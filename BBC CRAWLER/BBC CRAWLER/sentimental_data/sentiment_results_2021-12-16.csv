"Tania Mendoza was shot dead outside a sporting complex while waiting for her 11-year-old son A Mexican actress and singer was shot dead while she waited to pick up her 11-year-old son from a football academy in the state of Morelos, reports say. Tania Mendoza was outside the sporting complex in the city of Cuernavaca with other parents when two armed men arrived on a motorbike on Tuesday. One of them shot her multiple times before escaping with his accomplice. At least 10 women were murdered in the country every day last year, according to official data. Human rights group Amnesty International said around a third of victims - 940 - were cases of femicide,external, or the intentional murder of women because of their gender, calling it a ""shocking epidemic"". Mendoza, who was 42, rose to fame in 2005 after a lead role in the film La Mera Reyna del Sur. She had also appeared in a number of soap operas but in recent years was dedicated to her career as a singer, and recorded five albums. In 2010, she was kidnapped with her husband and son, who was six months old, from the couple's car wash business. Since then, she had reported to the Morelos State Attorney General's Office several death threats. It is not yet clear who was behind Mendoza's murder, or any possible motive. After the shooting, police carried out an operation in search for the suspects, but no-one was arrested. The Attorney General's Office told Efe news agency the case would be investigated as femicide, although no details were given. CONTEXT:Hundreds join 'Day of Dead Women' march in Mexico EXPLAINER:How dangerous is Mexico? Mexico has long suffered with high levels of crime, with much of the violence linked to drug cartels. Femicide is increasingly a cause for concern but despite a growing movement to raise awareness of the issue, authorities have been unable to stop a rise in the killings. According to Amnesty, cases are rarely investigated, and most perpetrators remain unpunished.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been in California holding meetings Rishi Sunak is cutting short a US trip for talks with businesses concerned about the impact of the Omicron variant. Questions had been raised over the chancellor's absence, on government business, as rising Covid cases hit consumer confidence. Labour called on Mr Sunak - who has been in California - to ""leave Hollywood and come back to reality"". The BBC understands he is returning a day earlier than planned. A number of firms and business organisations - especially those linked with the hospitality sector - are calling for financial support from the government as new restrictions and warnings over gatherings leads to cancellations and a drop in customers. But the Treasury has so far declined their plea. We're not locking the country down, says Johnson Firms plead for help as customers cancel bookings Sack Tory MP who criticised Whitty - Labour The chancellor, who is due back in the UK overnight, acknowledged it was a ""difficult time"" for hospitality but said the situation was ""very different to what we've done and encountered before"". He added that the government was not telling people to cancel things or closing down businesses. The UK government and devolved administrations have not placed any additional restrictions on businesses, such as lockdowns or reduced group sizes for restaurants or bars. But warnings from England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty to prioritise social interactions and from ministers urging people to ""think carefully in our choices"" in the run-up to Christmas has led to a collapse in customer numbers. The hospitality industry estimates that December takings will be down by 40% - and the damage could be twice as much as that in London. UK Hospitality has asked for an extension of the discounted 12.5% VAT rate to stretch beyond its scheduled end in March 2022 to help their members, and for business rates due in the first quarter of next year to be deferred. And business group the CBI has called for an instruction from the government to tell councils to immediately release unused grants and rates relief to businesses in need. But the appeals have been made while the chancellor has been in California on government business. The BBC understands Mr Sunak travelled to San Francisco on Tuesday to hold meetings with industry leaders from the technology and investment sectors, and hosted a roundtable on Thursday morning. But the general secretary of the TUC, Frances O'Grady, accused him of being ""missing in action"". She told the Daily Mirror: ""The chancellor should be stood next to the PM, announcing help to pay wages, save jobs and stop businesses going to the wall."" Mr Sunak tweeted that he and his team had held meetings with the hospitality sector on Thursday, including UK Hospitality and the CBI. And a Treasury spokesman said he would return early from his trip to to resume discussions with business leaders on Friday. But Labour called for a plan of action by the end of the day to help struggling firms. Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said places like theatres and gig venues ""urgently need some leadership from government"", but were instead getting ""heads in the sand"". In a statement, Mr Sunak said: ""We understand that this is a concerning time for businesses. ""Myself and my wider team met with business representatives earlier [on Thursday], listened to their concerns and will continue to work with industry leaders over the coming days. ""To keep safeguarding our economic recovery and the lives and livelihoods of the British people our priority is now to make sure everyone has the opportunity to 'get boosted now'.""

"M&S claims its light-up bottle with edible gold flakes has been copied by Aldi Supermarkets Marks & Spencer and Aldi are locked in a legal spat for the second time this year - this time over bottles of gin that light up. M&S has gone to the High Court seeking an injunction against alleged infringement of its design. The retailer says Aldi's blackberry and clementine gin liqueur is ""strikingly similar"" to its own Light Up gin. It follows 'Caterpillargate' in April, when M&S alleged Aldi's Cuthbert cake copied its Colin the Caterpillar cake. Both retailers' gins come in a bell-shaped bottle with a light in the base, which illuminates edible gold flakes in the liquid. The Aldi gin is about Â£6 cheaper than the basic Â£20 M&S version. Legal filings by M&S at the High Court earlier this month claim Aldi's products ""constitute designs which do not produce on the informed user a different overall impression to the [M&S] designs"". M&S cites media reports comparing the products as evidence of similarity. In its legal action M&S claims Aldi has specifically copied this bottle that was on sale last year The action concerns alleged infringement of a specific registered M&S design that was on sale last year, not the similar globe bottles currently available. An M&S spokesperson said: ""M&S has a proud history as a leading British innovator and for over 136 years customers have turned to M&S for unique, original, quality products - conceived, created and developed by us working with our trusted suppliers and produced to the highest standards."" The firm cited several firsts, including the first chilled chicken kiev, the introduction of pre-packed sandwiches, and glitter gin globes. Legal action over Colin and Cuthbert is still ongoing at the High Court M&S said: ""So, like many other UK businesses, large and small, we know the true value and cost of innovation and the enormous time, passion, creativity, energy and attention to detail, that goes into designing, developing and bringing a product to market and building its brand over many years. ""We will always seek to protect our reputation for freshness, quality, innovation and value - and protect our customers from obvious copies."" In April, the hashtag Caterpillargate began trending on Twitter after M&S started High Court action - which is ongoing - over cake. Aldi teased M&S on social media with a 'freecuthbert' campaign and dubbed the 136-year-old M&S 'Marks & Snitches'. The BBC has asked Aldi for comment.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Omicron is spreading ""exceptionally fast"" in Scotland Further restrictions on ""high risk"" sectors may be unavoidable as Omicron surges across the country, Scotland's first minister has warned. In a letter to the prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon said urgent financial help was needed to protect businesses from the ""economic shock"". She said the huge number of people likely to be infected could overwhelm the NHS and other critical services. And she said more restrictions ""while undesirable, may now be unavoidable"". The Omicron variant is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus in Scotland by Friday. Some 45% of the 5,951 Covid cases reported across the country on Thursday were suspected to be the new variant. Hospitality 'takes Â£1bn hit' on Christmas parties Covid rules: What is advice and what is the law? Why doesn't Scotland have tougher Covid measures? Ms Sturgeon has urged people to reduce contact with other households ""as much as you possibly can"", with adviceto limit socialising to three householdsat a time in the run-up to Christmas amid fears of a ""tsunami"" of new infections. New regulations requiring shops and hospitality venues to reduce the spread of the virus will come into force on Friday, withguidance for businesses,externalpublished on Thursday afternoon. Firms will need to enforce physical distancing, cut down on crowding in shops and at bars, and enable staff to work from home wherever possible. In her letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ms Sturgeon said that failing to put financial support in place for businesses meant that the UK's economic recovery was being put at risk. She urged him to either re-establish the furlough scheme or give the devolved administrations the means to set up similar initiatives of their own. Ms Sturgeon added: ""The sheer number of people likely to be infected in the period ahead risks overwhelming the NHS and disabling the economy and other critical services. ""If left unchecked, Omicron will deliver a significant economic shock that will see lack of staff and pressure on already stressed supply chains lead directly to business failure."" She added: ""Frankly, if we do not get Omicron under control we are sacrificing the economic recovery we all want to see. ""If the Treasury does not provide financial compensation and protection, this result becomes all but inevitable."" Confirmed Omicron cases have increased dramatically in recent days The Scottish government announced Â£100m of its own funding for struggling businesses on Tuesday, but opposition parties said there was no timeline for then the money would be distributed. And they have accused the government of causing confusion over when guidance on the new rules for business would be issued - and when the rules will come into force. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This guidance has now, finally, been published. But there's still no word on when struggling small businesses will get the funding they desperately need to survive this difficult period. ""This is about people's jobs and their livelihoods. Nicola Sturgeon must commit to getting this vital cash to businesses before Christmas. ""Nicola Sturgeon is calling for more support from the UK government before she's even able to tell Scottish businesses when they'll get funding from her government."" Nicola Sturgeon has written to the UK government calling for ""urgent"" funding to support businesses The advice on limiting social gatherings is not enforceable in law, but Ms Sturgeon has said people should ""not think of it as optional"". However, there will be new legal requirements for businesses from Friday - a day sooner than the government had initially indicated. Guidance published on Thursday said firms should look at installing barriers or screens to ensure physical distancing and avoid bottlenecks at entrances and in corridors. It said the government would ""strongly encourage the use of table service where possible"", and that retail settings should use ""signs, floor markings and queue management systems to help people keep a safe distance from others"". New government guidance says shops should use ""queue management systems"" where possible Hospitality firms in Scotland say they have alreadytaken a Â£1bn hit because of advice to cancel work Christmas parties,and bars and restaurants say the effect of guidance to limit social interactions could be ""devastating"". Ms Sturgeon said she was ""acutely aware of and deeply concerned"" about the impact of advice on businesses. Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has urged the UK government to provide around Â£500m immediately to help ""make a dent"" in grant support for Scottish businesses. She toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme: ""The greatest risk right now is that we wait too long, England goes into lockdown, something like furlough is reintroduced and suddenly it is available to Scottish businesses - but three or four weeks too late."" The UK government has made some funds available to the devolved administrations, although Scottish ministers say this has been brought forward from next year and had already been allocated within budgets. A UK government spokeswoman said the Treasury had ""given the devolved administrations the certainty they need to spend more money in the coming weeks"", and would continue to engage with them. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also said business owners were ""anxious"" about the future of their firms and workers. He said: ""What they will not appreciate is politics or bickering. What they will expect is for the Scottish and UK governments to work together in the national interest to protect people's lives and livelihoods."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Social distancing will be a requirement again in response to Omicron Wales must brace itself for the ""storm of Omicron"", the first minister has warned. Nightclubs will close in Wales after 26 December in response to the rising number of cases of the variant. Social distancing will also be reintroduced in shops and workplaces. Mark Drakeford also said more decisions on Covid restrictions would be made on Monday - in particularwith regard to sports events. A return to other restrictions - like extended household bubbles and the rule of six in pubs - is not being ruled out after Christmas. As it happened: Friday's press conference Welsh festive sport verdict on Monday First estimate of booster jab impact on Omicron The first minister told BBC's Today programme: ""Wales is in the calm before the storm. We see the storm of Omicron coming our way and we need to prepare for it now."" He pleaded with people to have a smaller Christmas and issued guidance to people avoid meeting ""wider circles of friends"". The number of Omicron cases detected in Wales rose by 64 to 159 cases on Friday. It comes as the UK sawa record number of Covid casesfor a third day, exceeding 90,000. Mr Drakeford warned that London was already seeing an increase in people going to hospital with Covid. ""We have to be prepared for the same to happen here,"" he told a press conference. And he warned it was ""inescapable"" that a sharp increase in cases will impact the delivery of public services. Updated guidance will be issued for care home visits, and people on the shielding list will be written to with new advice on how to protect themselves. But it is not expected they will be asked to shield like at the start of the pandemic. The first minister said he had not introduced stricter measures immediately because the government's actions had to be ""proportionate and fair"" to everyone as Christmas was a ""special"" time of year. ""Our Omicron numbers are the lowest anywhere else in the UK,"" he said, adding providing people adhered to the latest advice given, a pathway had been created into Christmas. Business lobby group the CBI said the fresh restrictions on companies were a ""big setback"". Announcing a two-phased plan, the Welsh government said it was giving ""strong guidance"" for people to leave a day between social events and to meet outdoors over Christmas. But from 27 December new legal restrictions will come into force. What are the new Covid rules for Wales? How do I get a booster in Wales? Omicron: Is it milder despite dodging immunity? How can I tell I have Omicron? They include the two-metre rule in workplaces, and extra rules for businesses and services to protect customers and staff, such as limiting numbers in supermarkets, one-way systems and tighter controls at check-outs. Businesses will also be required to allow people to work from home wherever possible. Welsh ministers say they will make Â£60m available for firms impacted by the new restrictions. The cash is earmarked for January but is not designed to cover wages, as the furlough scheme did earlier in the pandemic. The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed the cash but demanded ""urgent clarity"" on whether it would be available to firms that have seen a loss of bookings ""at an alarming rate"". This video can not be played Covid help should not just be for England, says Mark Drakeford But Mr Drakeford said the ability to provide and sustain and longer-term support to businesses is ""severely constrained by the current position of the UK Treasury and its refusal to open vital support schemes, such as furlough"". Such schemes should be available for all UK nations when needed ""and not just at the point at when restrictions are introduced in England"", he added. Mr Drakeford said Omicron was the most serious development in the pandemic so far. ""People should think very carefully about who they are meeting and how they are meeting to keep themselves and others safe before Christmas,"" he added. In the run-up to Christmas, the Welsh government urged people to: Take a lateral flow test before going out, going Christmas shopping or visiting people Meet outdoors, or if meeting indoors ensure it is well ventilated Leave a day between social events Socially distance, wear a face covering and wash your hands Get vaccinated, and make getting a booster a priority if you have had an appointment The guidance does not go as far as Scotland where indoor social mixing is limited tothree households. The Welsh government appears to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it come to the imposition of additional Covid restrictions that they believe could be necessary to meet the threat the Omicron variant poses to the Welsh NHS. It seems clear that ministers believe that strict new restrictions should be introduced but, without UK treasury support for affected businesses, are wary of introducing measures that could hurt the already battered hospitality and retail sectors of the economy. All eyes will be on the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to see what help might be on offer but with the UK government already nursing a hangover after a backbench Commons rebellion on Covid passes, it seems unlikely that Downing Street will move as quickly and firmly as the Welsh government would like. While Welsh ministers probably do have the resources to offer some additional support for businesses, a new Covid wave could lead to increased financial pressure on the health and other public services as they seek to cover for staff absences and increased public demand. With ministerial meetings being held on an almost daily basis it seems unlikely that today's announcements are the last word on Christmas and new year restrictions - and more measures may well be announced in coming days. Nightclubs were reopened last summer Wales is the first UK nation to close a business sector in response to the Omicron wave. The decision to shut nightclubs means they will be closed for New Year's Eve. The Night Time Industries Association said it was ""angry and frustrated"" they had been singled out for closure and claimed there was a lack of evidence to show transmission of the virus was higher in nightspots. Chief executive Mike Kill said: ""We've implemented Covid passports and lateral flow tests even though it has cost us some trade so why are we being singled out and targeted? These further restrictions are a step too far. ""Isn't there a greater concern that people who would normally socialise on New Year's Eve will now displace to other unregulated settings without those controls?"" But the first minister said the decision ""is about protecting the health of people who otherwise would be putting themselves in harm's way"". Asked if the move punishes younger people, Mark Drakeford said: ""If you look at London and you look to see where the most rapid growth has been in the Omicron variant, it has been people in their twenties and thirties."" The announcement also sparked concern from Prof Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University. ""I don't want to sound like the Grinch but this is not going to stem the tide of Omicron cases in Wales - hospitalisations and hospital pressure will follow in weeks,"" he said. He argued that the minimum needed was what the Welsh government called""alert level one"",external- which would have seen a return to the rule of six indoors - with a brief break at Christmas. Sara Jones, Head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, urged customers to show ""consideration and patience"" as shops reintroduce measures, which are likely to reduce capacity. But Ian Price, CBI Wales director, said: ""As Omicron cases continue to rise it's only right the government prioritises public health, but fresh restrictions are a big setback for businesses, particularly in hospitality."" This video can not be played Care home staff say they are ""reliving"" first lockdown feelings Care homes in Wales said they are relieved visits are still allowed but feared another rise in cases would put extra strain on already ""tired"" staff. ""It's a balance to keep people safe but not take away that contact of visits,"" said Care Homes Wales chief executive Mary Wimbury. ""However some care homes are not just asking whether they have enough staff to manage visits, but are there enough staff to the care home running safely? ""Staff live in their local community and it's almost impossible to stop them catching the virus somehow. The worry is for their health but also the pressure it puts on the staff who are there and are very tired. ""Everyone is worried at how things will pan out."" Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh government needed to provide ""clarity"" on the money being offered to support businesses. He said the Welsh government had a lot more money available to help firms: ""There's Â£600m sitting in the Welsh government budget which is available to them to spend on COVID measures"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said all governments face a ""difficult balancing act"" in taking these decisions. ""We're in the position in Wales, fortunately at the moment, I think we have about 5% of the population and less than 1% of the confirmed Omicron cases. And that allows that breathing space in the run-up to Christmas, but obviously we are facing a very, very difficult situation thereafter."" The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said support for health services is also needed. ""The Liberal Democrats have called for a 6% rise in our wages to both health and care workers,"" she said.

"The deal will reduce extra costs and taxes on exports and imports between the two countries The UK has signed a free trade deal with Australia which it says will benefit consumers and businesses. It is described as the first post-Brexit deal negotiated from scratch and not ""rolled over"" from trade terms that the UK enjoyed while in the EU. The government estimated it would unlock Â£10.4bn of additional trade while ending tariffs on all UK exports. However, some UK farmers have expressed concern that they could be undercut by cheap imports. The government said the deal was also a gateway into the fast-growing Indo-Pacific region and would boost the UK's bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the largest free trade areas in the world. Australia has also praised the deal, its second-largest trade contract with another country. ""It's a truly historic agreement - it's a true free-trade agreement. Everyone wins,"" said Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan. The agreement, which was signed in a virtual ceremony by International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, is due to come into force next year. Farmers' opposition to UK-Australia trade deal grows How will the UK-Australia trade deal work? How many trade deals has the UK done? UK wants to join the club - but what is the CPTPP? Ms Trevelyan described it as ""a landmark moment in the historic and vital relationship between our two Commonwealth nations"". It demonstrated what the UK could achieve as ""an agile, independent sovereign trading nation"", she added. In a BBC interview, she rejected suggestions the deal would harm UK farmers. She said the deal had ""very clear safeguards"" and ""clear tariff quotas in the first 10 years"", as well as ""an overarching safeguard mechanism"". ""The reality is that Australia sends about 70% of its beef and sheep meat to the Asia-Pacific markets,"" she said. ""They're closer for them and they get great prices. So I'm not expecting there to be any dramatic surge into UK markets and I know that our citizens will continue to buy what they want, but I'm very pleased to do things that will open up consumer choice."" For Australia, the deal eliminates tariffs from 99% of its exports and makes it easier for Australians to live and work in the UK. It will also help boost sales of Australia's wine, beef and sugar. These goods have been boycotted by China - Australia's main export market - due to recent political tensions. A free trade deal aims to encourage trade - usually in goods but occasionally in services - by making it cheaper. This is often achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs - taxes or charges by governments for trading goods across borders. Trade agreements also aim to remove quotas - which are limits on the amount of goods which can be traded. Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked. Ms Trevelyan says this agreement is a blueprint for all the other countries that want to do trade deals with the UK, so they can - in her words - ""see just how expansive we want to be"". It has been welcomed by British companies that want to do more business in Australia, especially in services. Trade between the two countries will increase. But trade deals always work both ways. The UK has given Australia pretty much everything it wanted in terms of access to the UK agricultural market. Other larger economies will take note of that and want similar access in the future. The government insists that the concerns of British farmers have been taken into account, with transitional arrangements lasting for up to 15 years. The government also points to a series of environmental provisions in the deal, which makes reference to the Paris agreement on climate change. An explicit reference to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C, though, has been dropped. Climate NGOs will not be impressed by that. It highlights the fact that trade deals involve compromise, but this agreement also needs to be seen in the perspective of the wider trade challenges the UK faces. The Department for International Trade's internal assessment is that the deal with Australia could increase the size of the UK economy by Â£2.3bn a year from 2035. But that's only 0.08% of GDP. In comparison, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that the long term loss from leaving the European Union could be about 4% of GDP. Shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour supported such a deal, but would scrutinise it very carefully to make sure it delivered the promised benefits. He added that the opposition would ""hold the government to promises made to farming communities, its pledges on environmental protections and on food and drink standards"". Among the main points of the deal listed by the UK government are: It gives UK firms guaranteed access to bid for an additional Â£10bn worth of Australian public sector contracts per year It allows young people to work and travel in Australia for up to three years at a time, removing previous visa rules It gives UK professionals including architects, scientists, researchers, lawyers and accountants access to Australian work visas without being subject to Australia's skilled occupation list. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK was valued at Â£20.1bn, and both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably.

"Pupils in some schools will return to class later than planned Schools will have two days at the start of the new term in January to plan for pupils' return and the possibility of moving to remote learning. It means pupils in some schools will return to class later than planned after the Christmas break. A letter from Education Minister Jeremy Miles calls on head teachers to plan for some classes, year groups or the whole school to move online. A head teachers' union has welcomed the announcement. But another said it was disappointed, claiming the letter would cause confusion and put the onus on head teachers. The letter states schools should plan for a ""very high risk"" scenario, and advises allowing for the return of staggered starts and more testing. What does Omicron mean for Christmas in Wales? Teachers lonely amid end-of-term Omicron concern Teen who had Covid urges youngsters to get jabbed It comes as the UK seesrecord high daily Covid casesas the Omicron variant of coronavirus spreads rapidly. Welsh government ministers are due to set out the results of their latest review of Covid restrictions on Friday. The education minister calls on schools to plan for some classes to move online in January Mr Miles said the priority ""continues to be to minimise the disruption to education, and ensure where possible learners continue to receive in person learning, as well as protecting school staff and learners"". ""I am providing all schools with two planning days at the start of the new spring term, this will allow you time to assess staffing capacity and put the necessary measures in place to support the return of learners,"" he added. Pupils and staff have been advised to take three lateral flow tests in the week before going back to school and weekly after that. On Thursday evening Conwy council became the sixth in Wales, alongside Wrexham, Anglesey, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Ceredigion, to announcein-person teaching would end for the year on Friday. Ceri said ""children cannot not attend school"" Ceri Reed is a parent from Cardiff and also director of Parents Voice in Wales CIC, a social enterprise supporting parents. She said the Welsh government's announcement meant there was an anxiety that schools may close again. ""Parents are willing to accept the rationale for the planning days to allow schools to put in measures to stay open,"" she said. ""What's important to us is that teachers remain safe, as if there is reduced staff schools are likely to close and we just want schools to be kept open."" Ms Reed said she would like to see an announcement as soon as possible if schools are to close. ""The decision needs to be made on the worst-case scenario so it doesn't compromise anyone's position,"" she explained. ""We need to avoid online learning if we can, and we need to clamp down on other aspects - I would much rather see pubs, shops and restaurants close than schools. We cannot compromise future generations and preserve the economy."" School attendance in Wales has not been above 90% since the first week of term in September The latest Welsh government figures show 86% of pupils were present last week - attendance has not been above 90% since the first week of term in September. The NASUWT teaching union has urged the Welsh government to stagger the return of pupils to schools and colleges after Christmas. Across the UK, more than 30 local authorities have told the BBCsome classes had moved online. In England,Âthe latest data showsÂ 236,000 pupils were out of school for Covid-related reasons on Thursday 9 December - a 13% increase within two weeks. Laura Doel, of head teachers' union NAHT Cymru, said: ""We welcome the changes announced today on planning days and the relaxation of sessions times. ""Schools have suffered significantly from staff absence since September and, given that the new variant is even more transmissible, we can be certain that Covid will continue to impact on staffing levels. ""School settings cannot stay open and remote learning cannot be supported if the workforce is unavailable, that is why we urge the Welsh government to introduce additional mitigation measures, like staggering session times to control the flow of learners and parents coming in and out of school, at the start of next term."" The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru expressed its disappointment. ""We are disappointed that the Welsh government feels it is still appropriate to rely on the same flimsy framework of Covid protection measures that have proved to be wholly inadequate throughout the autumn term,"" said director Eithne Hughes. ""The education minister's letter to schools has thrown leaders across Wales into confusion and effectively handed them the responsibility for deciding what they should do to keep their learners and staff safe.""

"The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years, in response to calls to tackle surging price rises. The increase to 0.25% from 0.1% followed data this week that showed prices climbing at the fastest pace for 10 years. It came despite fears the Omicron variant could slow the economy by causing people to spend less. The Bank's action is set to increase the mortgage costs of some homeowners. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it needed to tackle strong inflationary pressures building up in the economy. Inflation is now running at 5.1%, the highest in a decade, and he expects it to rise further early next year. ""In the short term - that is, in the next two or three months - we think it can get to around 6%,"" he told the BBC. A rise in wholesale gas prices is still a big factor driving inflation, and that is continuing to push up domestic energy bills. But one business group said the interest rate rise would do little to stop prices going up, since costs were being pushed higher by global factors largely outside the Bank's control. The decision by the Bank of England will add just over Â£15 to the typical monthly repayment for a tracker mortgage customer. A standard variable rate mortgage-holder is likely to pay nearly Â£10 extra a month. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers may welcome news of higher rates, analysts warn there is no guarantee the higher Bank rate will lead to better returns on savings. Even if savings rates increase slightly, returns are still well below the rate of inflation. How will the interest rate rise affect you? How do interest rates affect your money? Why is the cost of living going up? The Bank says inflation could hit 6% next year The Bank can raise interest rates to help control price rises - but many experts had expected it to hold off because of uncertainty about Omicron. Yet on Thursday, it said the prices of global assets, such as stocks and bonds, had largely recovered after an initial fall triggered by news of the new variant. Successive waves of Covid also appeared to have had less impact on economic growth, the Bank added, although there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case this time. ""Consumer price inflation in advanced economies has risen by more than expected,"" the Bank said. The Omicron variant could reduce economic activity early next year, said the Bank, although it was unclear how much of an effect it would have on inflation worldwide. Mr Bailey told the BBC the Bank's rate-setters had thought ""long and hard"" about the impact of Omicron on economic activity before making their decision. ""But it is not at all clear if the impact [on the economy] could cause inflation to come down, or even go up,"" he said. The Bank of England seems to like a surprise. Last month, acknowledging the expectation of an interest rate rise happening, it held off. This month, with the main development being the spread of Omicron, it has raised at a time when most expected it to hold. It goes to show that the arguments have been finely balanced. The other development has been that inflation has hit even harder and even faster than expected. Six per cent is now the expected peak in the spring, which will represent the highest rate of inflation on the targeted CPI measure for 30 years. It is treble the Bank of England's target. While it is important to note that a 0.15% rise is modest and still leaves base rates very close to historic lows, it is not ideal that this comes at the precise moment where some forms of consumer confidence, especially in terms of going out, appear to be slumping. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was briefed by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and intriguingly chose to mention the possibility that Omicron could raise inflationary pressure by further hobbling supply chains for goods, and the supply of workers. The argument will be that it is better to nip expectations of inflation in the bud, than try to contain them once they get going. A rise now is preferable, in the eyes of the MPC, to having to rise by even more over the next year or two. The Bank is choosing to act on what it knows about inflation, rather than hold back on what it doesn't know about Omicron. Not at all. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 8-1 in favour of the increase. The dissenting MPC member, Silvana Tenreyro, voted to keep rates as they were. Rates had been at 0.1%, a record low, since March last year, when they were cut in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. It was the second month in a row that Bank policymakers had surprised the markets. Economists had expected a rate rise at the MPC's last meeting in November, but policymakers voted to hold fire. This time, analysts expected a further delay because of Omicron, but the committee thought differently. ""The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates was surprising, given mounting uncertainty over the economic impact of the Omicron variant,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. ""While today's rate increase may have little effect on most firms, many will view this as the first step in a longer policy movement - not as a partial reversal of last year's cut."" He added that the current inflationary spike was mostly driven by global factors, so higher interest rates would do little to curb further increases in inflation. Instead, the government needed to find practical solutions to the UK's supply chain problems and labour shortages, he said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the move suggested that the Bank had become ""a bit more hawkish"" and might now think rates need to rise further than before. ""The MPC once again said that a 'modest tightening' of monetary policy is likely to be necessary, so this is not looking like a case of one and done,"" he added. ""We still think that weaker economic growth and a faster fall in inflation will mean that interest rates won't rise to 1% by the end of next year, but it's just become more likely that they rise above our 0.5% forecast."" The MPC also voted unanimously to maintain the Bank's asset purchase scheme at Â£875bn. The last time the Bank raised interest rates was in August 2018, when they reached 0.75%. They were then cut twice in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Do you have a tracker mortgage and will now see your repayments rise?

"Ministers are reviewing Covid measures weekly in the run-up to Christmas Wales is waiting to find out if ministers in Cardiff will reimpose tougher restrictions on businesses and social contact. The Welsh government cabinet met twice on Thursday to decide how to tackle the new Omicron variant, amid alarm at its growing spread in the UK. It is not clear whether they will issue advice, impose new legal restrictions, or do both. The number of Omicron cases in Wales rose by 33 to 95 on Friday. But a ""rapid increase over the coming days and weeks is expected"", according to Dr Meng Khaw, national director for health protection and screening services for Public Health Wales. There will be a press conference, led by Mark Drakeford, on Friday, but more details may be released on Thursday night. This video can not be played There are mixed reactions to the prospect of changes to Covid restrictions Wales' most senior doctor, chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton, advised the public to ""prioritise"" who they see at Christmas. He said the Welsh NHS has been asked to consider cancelling some types of care, which could include planned surgery. It comes as overall UK cases have hit arecordfor the second day running. First Minister Mark Drakeford predicted Omicron will hit Wales ""very quickly and very steeply"" in January. He said a number of services - from the NHS to bin collections - could be affected if lots of workers are off sick. Highest daily Covid cases - what does it tell us? 'Significant confusion' over booster walk-ins Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales At a Welsh Parliament committee meeting he warned of estimates indicating the coming wave could see ""half of the population of the United Kingdom will fall ill with coronavirus"". ""That is the most enormous number and it will be compressed in to a much shorter number of weeks than was the case with either Alpha or Delta,"" he said. He said ""fresh assistance"" for parts of the economy most affected by Coronavirus are among the things being considered by the Welsh government. Dr Frank Atherton estimated Wales's Omicron rate was just a ""few days"" behind other parts of the UK. He told BBC Wales the country's health boards had been given ""advice and instructions"" on ways to freeing up capacity in the NHS. ""You can work very closely with social care to make sure that patients who are ready and fit for discharge can get back to where they should be, which is in the community, and you can look to how you can relieve pressure on emergency care by using other ways of providing frontline care to patients."" He advised people to reduce their social contacts. ""We absolutely need to prioritize what we want to do at Christmas, for me it's about seeing family. It's not about going to the pub, it's not about going to a nightclub, it's not about going anywhere that's crowded or indoors."" This video can not be played Covid: Half the UK could be infected in fourth wave, warns Mark Drakeford Could Wales become the first UK nation to reimpose coronavirus restrictions on social contact since they were scrapped in the summer? The mood music from the first minister on Thursday was gloomy, with worries stretching not just from the impact on the Welsh NHS, but to the provision of services themselves given high levels of sickness absence expected. There is no Treasury support in the form of furlough, restricting the support for businesses available if the Welsh government decides some may need to be closed, or restricted. The question is - do ministers feel the situation is so bad they feel they have to act? Soldiers had already helped with the vaccine rollout over the last year Plans for possible remote learning in schoolshave also been announced. A letter from Education Minister Jeremy Miles calls on headteachers to plan for some classes, year groups or the whole school to move online. Schools will have two days at the start of term to plan for pupils' return, meaning some schools will return to class later than planned after the Christmas break. On Thursday the Ministry of Defence announced 98 armed forces personnel have been made available to support the booster programme, working in 14 teams of vaccinators. The UK has beenexperiencing record high daily Covid casesas the Omicron variant of coronavirus spreads rapidly, with Wales expected to deal with huge numbers of infections in the coming days and weeks. People in Scotland have been asked tolimit socialising to three households at a timein the run-up to Christmas, with shops and hospitality venues being told to bring back physical distancing and screens. Welsh ministers will be hoping their plans will be sufficient to cover the festive season and into the New Year, but will keep the option of making further changes during that period should they feel they are needed. Most of Wales' Covid rules were dropped last summer Wales' overall Covid rates have fluctuated slightly since November. The latest seven-day rate stands at 500.7 per 100,000 people. Public Health Wales (PHW) reported 2,889 cases on Thursday, and no deaths. The total number of deaths it has reported stands at 6,501. There were warnings that some Welsh firms are already seeing a significant impact on trade. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Labour ministers ""must use the Â£500m of unallocated Covid support sitting in government coffers to help firms and protect jobs. ""It's clear ministers of all colours across the UK are facing a challenging public health picture in an uncertain period. ""However, any consideration and implementation of restrictions must be evidence-based and have an impact on tackling the virus, unlike vaccine passports."" Dr Roland Salmon, a former PHW director, said there was not much evidence that restrictions work. ""Will they do any more than bring a lot of economic harm and long-term health harm to the people who are on the receiving end of those measures?"" he said. ""I'm afraid our best defence is immunisation,"" Dr Salmontold BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Welsh ministers are ramping up Wales' Covid booster campaign, aiming to offer all adults a third jab by the end of this month. But an assistant director at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board warned emergency services may ""possibly not be able to cope"" if Covid cases surge. Wyn Thomas, assistant area director for primary care at the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, was asked by BBC Wales how much leeway there was in capacity, if predictions of a ""tidal wave"" of omicron hospitalisations proved true. He said: ""I don't think there's a lot of leeway.Â ""It's not just the hospitals, primary care is very busy, social care is very busy, so I think actually the more people protect themselves and avoid the need to go to A&E or to be admitted to hospital, is going to take pressure off the system, because as we're seeing, this rapid increase means that some people [will] undoubtedly be hospitalised and I think the system is very full at present."" The health board is concentrating its booster jab efforts online and a booking website went live for the first time on Wednesday afternoon attracted 225,000 hits in the first 24 hours.

"This video can not be played The protection given by Covid vaccines and testing means Christmas will be ""very different"" this year, says the prime minister. Boris Johnson has insisted England is not being put into lockdown by stealth, despite accusations from some of his own MPs. The prime minister said he was not telling the public to cancel events, but urging them to exercise ""caution"". It comes as chief medical officer Chris Whitty suggested people ""prioritise"" activities in the run-up to Christmas. Conservative MP Steve Brine accused the government of ""putting hospitality into effective lockdown"". Mr Brine said Prof Whitty's comments meant businesses were facing ""complete ruin"" and more government support was needed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hold discussions with business leaders on Friday, after deciding to cut short an official trip to the US to return to the UK. He is facing demands for increased financial support to help affected sectors cope with booking cancellations, amid the spread of the Omicron variant. What are the Christmas rules this year? Downing Street denies Johnson lockdown party claim Chancellor cuts short US trip over Covid concerns The PM's spokesman denied Number 10 was sending out mixed messages about socialising over Christmas, adding that both the prime minister and the chief medical officer ""were making the point that given the current infection rate people should be cautious and think carefully before mixing with others"". However, Labour has urged ministers to be more specific about how they want people to behave in the coming weeks. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has called for ""clarity from the government"" on whether football fans should still go to matches - with thousands due to attend fixtures in the coming days, despitesome being postponeddue to players isolating. The party is also demanding Mr Sunak produces a plan to help sectors affected by cancelled bookings and staff shortages, in the wake of the advice to scale back socialising. It is calling on ministers to offer firms more flexibility on paying back government loans, cuts to business rates, and an improved insurance scheme for theatresforced to cancel shows due to performer absences. The pub industry is also calling for more support, with the British Beer & Pub Association estimating the sector is set to lose Â£297m in trade over the traditionally busy Christmas period. Look one way and there are plenty of the expert advisers. Look the other way, and there are plenty of Conservative backbenchers. There are plenty of businesses saying there is a lockdown by stealth: that grim warnings are spooking people, but because very little is actually banned, they're not getting the support they got when they were compelled to close. As if to illustrate the bind the government finds itself in, No 10 has now had to publicly defend Chris Whitty after one Tory backbencher claimed his remarks yesterday amounted to a ""public health socialist state"" in action. As the Omicron variant accelerates, the politics of the second Christmas of the pandemic is irritable and uncertain. Asked if the government was imposing a lockdown by stealth, Mr Johnson said the situation was ""very different"" from last year due to the existence of vaccines and testing. ""If you want to go to an event or a party... the sensible thing to do is to get a test and to make sure that you're being cautious. ""But we're not saying that we want to cancel stuff, we're not locking stuff down, and the fastest route back to normality is to get boosted."" Meanwhile, a number of Conservative MPs have questioned Prof Whitty's role in offering advice to the public. In a tweet she later deleted, Conservative MP for Beaconsfield Joy Morrissey said: ""Perhaps the unelected Covid public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of Parliament and the prime minister have decided. ""I know it's difficult to remember but that's how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state."" Labour has called the comments ""unacceptable and dangerous"" and urged Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to remove her from her role as his parliamentary aide unless she apologises. Meanwhile, Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that restrictions on ""higher risk settings"" may be ""unavoidable"" amid rising Omicron cases. Writing to Mr Johnson on Thursday, she said urgent financial help was needed to protect businesses from the ""economic shock"" of a surge in infections. Ms Sturgeon has already advised people in Scotland tolimit socialising to three households at a timeover the festive period, but in her letter said there may be a need to ""strengthen"" guidance further.

"Schools across the UK are being advised to reopen next term. Schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some children are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC that some classes had moved online at schools. The government says it is committed to ensuring that schools in England stay open in January. UK schools have been advised to reopen next term under current guidance - although in Wales, staff will have two days at the start of term to plan any additional measures needed for pupils' return. Schools have been planning for a number of scenarios - including remote learning and teaching in ""bubbles"" with staggered start and finish times. Retired teachers in England will be brought in to assist schools that are struggling with Covid-related staffing problems. Are you a retired teacher returning? Share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external In England,the latest data shows236,000 pupils were out of school for Covid-related reasons on Thursday 9 December. This is an increase of 13% on the last time the snapshot survey of school attendance was taken, two weeks earlier. Jo Franklin says teachers are worried about the impact of Omicron on children's learning In east London, children at two primary schools managed by the Letta Trust will be sent home with their laptops when they break up for Christmas, in case they cannot come back for the start of next term. Jo Franklin, head of the trust, said all classes had managed to stay open, but added: ""This picture is changing on a daily basis. We've had seven new staff cases so far this week. ""Teachers are making sure that everything they plan to teach in the first week of the new term can be taught remotely if it needs to be,"" she said. Among other contingency plans are timetables specially created in case classes need to be taught in ""bubbles"" next term. Ms Franklin said she was concerned about staff being off sick in the new year. ""Some people are telling us that they are having problems booking a booster, with no appointments available until mid-January,"" she said. ""There will come a point when we cannot safely keep classes open."" Vulnerable children are also being provided with laptops before Christmas in Kingston upon Thames. Not many schools have had to close early before Christmas because of Covid. Those that have include one in York, one in Hillingdon and two in Leicestershire, whilesome in five parts of Waleshave opted to move to online learning. However, a larger number of schools have had to move individual classes online. Of 75 local education authorities that responded to questions from the BBC on Wednesday, 35 said some classes had been forced to close. Many cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to get supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. On Thursday, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawisaid the government would help,externalretired teachers in England register with supply agencies. He called it ""the best way to boost the temporary workforce available to the sector"". Will schools have to close again? Some schools battling to stay open as cases rise Many local authorities told the BBC that schools already had contingency plans in place for January, and had become well prepared to switch to remote learning after the past two years. In some areas, councils are meeting with head teachers before the start of term in January to assess which measures are needed. A spokeswoman for Southampton City Council said some schools were ""postponing their return date by one to two days to ensure a thorough testing programme is in place to enable them to welcome students back safely"". ""The situation is under constant review, and we are on stand-by to support schools in implementing any new guidance,"" she added. In Wales, Powys County Council said staggered start and finish times for class ""bubbles"" was among the plans that could be implemented if necessary - with ""blended learning"" as a last resort. In Scotland, North Lanarkshire Council said contingency plans were already in place, and a programme of planned online learning could be used where necessary. Parents may be getting flashbacks as ministers insist all schools in England will open in January, while other politicians warn they may not. The booster campaign is in full swing giving more protection to adults. Yet barely half of teenagers have received one jab. But bubbles of whole year groups have gone, so only close contacts identified by NHS Test and Trace will be asked to do lateral flow tests for seven days. In the meantime they can attend school after a negative test. By far the biggest challenge is staff. Whatever ministers say, if a school doesn't have enough teachers, and can't get supply teachers, they may have to send pupils home to learn remotely. The Department for Education has said it is committed to keeping schools and colleges open because ""the classroom is the very best place for children and young people's development"". Education minister Alex Burghart told MPs on Wednesday that the government was putting measures in place to ""make sure that we have the best chance for the start of a normal school term"" in England. He said testing on return to school, vaccination uptake, ventilation in classrooms and hygiene measures would ensure in-person teaching could continue - and that the booster vaccination programme would be ""key"". Older pupils and staff are alsobeing asked to wear face coveringsin communal settings. However, Robert Halfon, Conservative chairman of the Education Select Committee, said it looked as though England was ""moving, sadly, towards de facto school closures"". Labour's shadow schools minister Stephen Morgan said there was ""a race against time to protect children's health and education"". He also called on the government to guarantee that all 12 to 15-year-olds can get vaccinated over the holidays. In Wales, education minister Jeremy Miles said schools and colleges would be able to take two ""planning days"" at the start of the spring term. ""This will allow time for schools to assess staffing capacity and put the necessary measures in place to support the return of all learners,"" he said. He added that schools would be able ""to operate staggered start and finish times from the start of the new term"" if they decided that was appropriate. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants schools to remain open ""if at all possible"" to limit any further disruption. In Northern Ireland, a teaching union has called for a ""staggered"" return of pupils to school. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said schools making contingency plans was the ""sensible and responsible thing to do"". ""The government needs to think very carefully about the mitigations it needs to take to keep schools open next term,"" he added - citing ventilation in classrooms as ""crucial"".

"This afternoon's No 10 press conference was a gloomy affair. The increase in the Omicron variant that we'd barely heard of a fortnight ago is so steep it was almost a straight line on one of Prof Chris Whitty's famous graphs. The number of Covid cases reported on Wednesday was the highest yet during the pandemic. You read that right: the highest ever during these tough two years. While there is so much we don't yet know about the severity of the Omicron variant itself, and it's impossible to be clear about its precise effect, the sheer number of cases is mind-boggling to contemplate. New UK cases record as Whitty warns 'more to come' Will tougher measures stop the spread of Omicron? Even if, crossing every finger, the number of deaths remains low because of vaccinations, we are looking at a likely period of serious disruption to much of our lives. And the message from England's top doctor was clear. He was at pains to repeat it several times: in the run-up to Christmas, stay at home unless it really matters. His language about ""prioritising"" or ""de-prioritising"" events might have been less blunt. But under repeated questioning that was the clear implication. That's not, though, a message the prime minister was willing, or perhaps able, to repeat. The political pressure on him not to introduce more restrictions is intense after 100 of his backbenchers stuck two fingers up at him on Tuesday night byvoting against part of his pandemic plan. But Prof Whitty's message will likely be heard loud and clear: what we all do in the next few days and weeks will make a difference to how fast the pandemic spreads. His call is already alarming the hospitality industry. Without official closures or limits there won't be extra financial help, at least not at this stage. But the message from the press conference is bound to lead to empty tables, and less custom. MPs will inevitably start to question the fairness of that. Once again, Number 10 is in the grip of a fast-moving crisis with consequences not just for the country's health but for the economy, and the nation's wealth too.

Join us again tomorrow - we'll have all the important updates on the Omicron variant and the wider pandemic throughout the day. Today's live page was written by Emma Harrison, Lauren Turner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Dulcie Lee and Adam Durbin. It was edited by Claire Heald, Alex Kleiderman and Kevin Ponniah. UK case numbers continued to climb rapidly today, with another 88,376 infections reported on Thursday - a record high for a second consecutive day The booster rollout is ramping up at pace - with a record 745,183 booster and third doses given out in the latest period Some 89% of people have had their first jab, 82% have had their second and 44% have now had their booster Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering that this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet Look up how many cases there are in your areahere. We'll be bringing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a close shortly. Here is a reminder of Thursday's main headlines:  US pharmaceutical firm Regeneron says its Covid-10 antibody
therapy is less potent against
the Omicron variant. In the US, the treatment â REGEN-COV â is used to treat Covid-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Ina statement,externalon Thursday, the company said its antibodies remain active against the Delta variant - currently the most
prevalent in the US. Regeneron added that it has confirmed that multiple ânext
generationâ antibodies it has identified, however, are active against Omicron,
Delta and âother variants of concernâ. âPending regulatory discussions, we anticipate entering the
clinic in the first quarter of 2022,â the statement said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although China was the first country to record cases of Covid-19 two years ago, it has only just today reach the milestone of 100,000 total cases. According to today's official statistics, there have now been exactly 100,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the country. China has a population of 1.4bn. This is pretty extraordinary when we factor in that these cases span two years, and the current rate of transmission in the UK means that this number of cases are being recorded within just two days (or less). The majority of these cases in China were recorded during the early stages of the pandemic. More than 50,000 Chinese cases were recorded in early 2020 in the central city of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified. Residents spent over two months confined to their homes so that transmission could be suppressed. China has managed to avoid subsequent large-scale outbreaks by introducing swift, sharp lockdowns. Chinaâs top medical specialists have projected that Chinaâs zero-Covid strategy may last until the end of spring 2022. The Queen usually attends church on Christmas Day - this year will be the first since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years More news now on the Queen, whoearlier cancelled her traditional pre-Christmas lunchfor extended family as a precautionary measure over soaring Omicron cases.

Maisy Evans says she doesn't know if she will ever fully recover - as some days she feels pain and tiredness, but other days she is well. She says it was ""really scary"" but that no one knows why she was affected so badly. As cases rise sharply in the UK,France is shutting its border to British tourists, tightening the reasons for people to travel between the two states. Eurostar has criticised this ""sudden switching on and off of travel"". The train company says the rule change - which comes into force on Saturday evening - is at ""significant cost to people, businesses and the economy"". Eurostar told the BBC it's difficult to see the purpose of travel restrictions when a variant is already established. For those who need to change their plans, Eurostar is offering a free exchange system or e-voucher. Read our full story on the changeshere. Ian says it's going to be a tough Christmas We've been hearing about the problems being faced by businesses as Omicron cases rise in the UK. And some of you have been getting in touch telling us about your worries. Ian McGregor, runs Thai restaurant Star of Siam in Keswick, Cumbria, and has had many cancellations in the last 10 days. ""Some of the cancelled bookings have been big and the footfall in the town has not brought enough passing trade to cover the cancellations,"" he said. ""In the last week we have seen a sharp fall in our revenue and it looks as though we are heading for a tough Christmas trading period."" He says they're going to try to stay open as long as they can. Travel agent Wendy Haines, from Staffordshire, says she's seeing bookings cancelled. And while the hospitality industry has had support over the last two years, she thinks her industry is ""the most affected"" but ""the least supported"". ""I was on the phone to a client earlier who has no choice but to cancel her familyâs trip to Disneyland Paris, as France is effectively closing its borders,"" she said. ""The whole point in people going to France is to see the Christmas festivities â postponing to March for instance would not be the same. Unless customers travel, we donât get paid."" She's worried about what the next few months will bring. As businesses in the hospitality sector field phone calls - primarily to cancel bookings due to rising cases - theChancellor will return from a business trip in the US earlierthan planned. Opposition Labour MPs have been critical as he's been away in the US for work whilebusinesses struggle. Sunak said he understood it was a ""concerning time for businesses"" and the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to support lives and livelihoods. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics First the good: the booster campaign is
ramping up rapidly. Nearly 750,000 boosters were given yesterday, new figures confirm. But the race against the virus is on. The bad news is cases are continuing to rise rapidly: nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in a single day, up from close to 80,000 yesterday. Most of this is being driven
by London, where Omicron is furthest advanced, case rates are highest and
rising fastest. Hospital admissions are rising in the capital too. But, with cases of Omicron being detected across the UK, other parts of the country are likely to be facing the
same challenges in the near future. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has increased by 105,595 or 31.4% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased by 6% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were identified in the UK. A further 88,376 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There have also been another 146 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK reported 78,610 cases yesterday. Another 1,691 Omicron cases in
the UK have been identified, the UK Health and Security Agency says. This brings the total number of identified
Omicron cases to 11,708 â though experts warn the number is likely to be much
higher as the variant spreads rapidly. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We are waiting on the latest UK figures, but as Omicron coronavirus cases surge in the UK, more and more people are pondering their symptoms. If you have a runny nose or a headache it is possible that you have Covid, say researchers. The Zoe Covid study app,externalasks hundreds of thousands of people to log their symptoms. Investigators have been looking at ones linked to Delta and more recently Omicron and say the top five symptoms are: So how likely is it to be aCovid rather than a cold? Lead scientist Professor Tim Spector says: ""In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it's far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold. ""If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we've seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant variant already."" If you think you may have Covid, it is important to get tested. Even people who don't feel very ill can put others at risk. The NHS says people should still look out for classic Covid symptoms:  Israel has also been busy on the vaccine front. It's going to donate one million coronavirus vaccines to African countries, its foreign minister has said. Yair Lapid said the AstraZeneca doses would be distributed in the coming weeks under the international Covax scheme, designed to boost vaccine supplies to poorer nations around the world. ""I'm happy that Israel can contribute and be a partner in eradicating this pandemic from the world,""Lapid tweeted,external. The foreign ministry said the vaccines would go to nearly a quarter of African countries, though it did not specify which. Only about 7% of people in Africa have been vaccinated,the World Health Organization said last month,external- the
lowest rate of any continent. Gidi KleimanBBC News, Jerusalem We've head a lot from France today about new restrictions on UK travellers, but the country is not alone in taking action. Israel will designate the UK and Denmark as countries on
its Covid-19 âred listâ at midnight due to concern over the spread of the
Omicron variant. Israeli citizens and permanent residents are forbidden
from travelling to âredâ countries from Israel, unless they get permission from
the government. Travellers returning from a âredâ country are be taken to a
publicly-funded quarantine facility on arrival and must stay there until they
receive a negative PCR test result. They may then complete their seven days of isolation
at home. France, Spain, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and the United Arab
Emirates are expected to be added to the red list on Sunday. Most African nations are already on it. Israel closed its borders to almost all foreign nationals last month
in response to Omicron, just
weeks after they were reopened to vaccinated
travellers. Earlier this week, Health Minister Nitzan
Horowitz told reporters that Israel could not be âhermetically sealedâ, but
that it was possible to delay the spread of Omicron in the country. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent There's also news today that retired teachers in England will be brought in to assist schools struggling withCovid-related staffing problems, the education secretary says. Ina letter to schools,external, Nadhim Zahawi says he knows the availability of supply teachers is a ""particular issue"" - and he wants to make sure ""as many supply staff as possible are available"". Many schools in England have had to move individual classes and year groups online because of staffing issues. Of 75 local education authorities that responded to questions from the BBC, 35 said some classes had been forced to close. Lots cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to find supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. Zahawi's announcement comes after the government was quizzed in the Commons on Wednesday about why retired teaching staff were not being brought back to help schools, asretired medical professionals were last year. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Its a level of preparedness to chill any working parent, and downbeat news for pupils, but schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC some classes had moved online at local schools. The government says it is committed to ensuring that schools in England stay open in January. UK schools have been advised to reopen next term under current guidance. They have been planning for a number of scenarios - including remote learning and teaching in ""bubbles"" with staggered start and finish times. Read more We heard from Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, earlier - who told MPs how dangerous it can be for pregnant women to get coronavirus. Now, the government's advisory group on vaccines, the JCVI, is putting mums-to-be on the priority list for vaccines. It means they're given the same priority as those with certain health conditions. Research shows higher rates of premature birth linked to infection and some pregnant women with Covid have died. Vaccines are safe to have when pregnant and cut the risk of severe illness. Read more.

"Unresolved fire safety defects mean that James' property is now ""unsellable"" People worst affected by the post-Grenfell fire safety crisis may be able to sell their flats to the Welsh government. Housing Minister Julie James has announced a ""buy-out"" scheme, which will be launched next year. It will be aimed at a ""small number"" of people in ""significant financial hardship"". It would be the first scheme of its kind in the UK, but the criteria and budget are not yet known. Campaigners welcomed the idea but said there had been a ""lack of urgency"" from the Welsh government, while opposition parties have called for more details. Homeowner's tears as cladding costs spiral Legal action threat over cladding support delay Combustible cladding ban in force from January Fire safety defects in many high-rise apartment blocks were exposed in the wake of the Grenfell disaster in west London in 2017, when 72 people died. Many leaseholders have found it impossible to sell, as lenders will not provide buyers with mortgages on the properties. They are also facing significantly increased costs to cover insurance premiums and interim fire safety measures as well as ongoing worry about who will pay for long-term repairs. Climate Change Minister Julie James says the Welsh government is prepared to look at a ""number of areas of hardship"" Announcing the plan in the Senedd on Tuesday, Ms James suggested the scheme could include people who have failed to sell their house on the open market because the sale would put them into negative equity, people in mortgage arrears and those whose flats have become overcrowded because they now have a larger family. ""There are a number of areas of hardship that we're prepared to look at,"" she said. People would either be able to sell the house to the government and stay in it as a tenant, or ""take the money and start again somewhere else"". ""I know from speaking to large numbers of residents that there are a lot of people who will be very interested in a scheme of that sort,"" Ms James said. She explained valuations would be done by the valuation office, in the same way as compulsory purchase valuations. James feels the government buy-out scheme is an attractive proposition James, 30, was a first-time buyer who had ""saved up a lot of money"" to buy his Cardiff Bay flat in 2016. Unresolved fire safety defects mean it is now ""unsellable"" and he is paying thousands of pounds in extra service charges to cover surveys, insurance and a night-time patrol. He said he was worried about being made bankrupt and ""never anticipated things would get this bad"", and would be interested in a government buy-out scheme. ""It's an attractive proposition, just to be out of here and not have to deal with the stress and the anxiety and the financial hit, and even years down the line when the fire defects are resolved, are people actually going to want to buy a property here? ""The reputational damage that's been done is going to be very off-putting for potential buyers I think."" Many leaseholders have found it impossible to sell due to exposed fire safety defects The Welsh Conservatives' housing spokeswoman, Janet Finch-Saunders, said it was ""vital"" there was clarity on how long the Welsh Government would own the flats and ""how exactly they would be managed"". Plaid Cymru's Mabon ap Gwynfor called on the minister to say how many people will be eligible for the scheme, and how the government will define ""significant financial hardship"". Ms James said the scheme would be ""up and running"" for the new financial year and in the meantime the government would ""start to process"" people who want to be part of it. Mark Habberfield, from the Welsh Cladiators campaign group, said he was glad people who could go bankrupt or are experiencing ""mental anguish"" are able to seek support. ""However, we are concerned about the apparent lack of urgency or commitment to time frames and feel this scandal is taking too long to resolve,"" he added. The government's broader scheme - to fund surveys on affected buildings, previously described as ""too little too late"" by campaigners - has received more than 100 applications and Ms James said work would begin in the new year. Ms James also renewed her call for ""developers and those responsible for these building defects"" to ""step up and do more to resolve the crisis"".

"Global uncertainty is having a direct effect on our finances in the UK, with prices rising and businesses juggling pressure from various issues. The impact of the war in Ukraine has an impact on petrol prices and the cost of everyday items. The economic uncertainty it creates is also making the Bank of England's decisions on rates trickier. The idea of raising interest rates is to keep those current and predicted price rises, measured by the rate of inflation, under control. In the face of global upheaval, this may be a relatively blunt tool. All eyes will be on the Bank's long-term strategy. For now, policymakers have increased interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5%, the third rate rise in four months. How high could UK interest rates go? Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. For households, that could mean higher mortgage costs, although - for the vast majority of homeowners - the impact is not immediate, and some will escape it entirely. An improvement on savings rates is likely to be far outweighed by the falling value of money put away. Recent years have seen an extraordinary period of cheap mortgages but, even before the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee began increasing interest rates in December, there were signs that the era of ultra-low mortgage rates was at an end. Some lenders have raised rates for those applying for a new home loan. However, brokers have predicted any rises in mortgage rates to be""slow and measured"", which would mean mortgages would stay cheap by historical standards for some time. It is a little-discussed fact that only about a third of adults have a mortgage. About a third rent their home, another third have either never had a mortgage or have paid it off. Those figures come from the English Housing Survey, which is geographically limited, but one of the most comprehensive guides available. Some 74% of mortgage borrowers in the UK are on fixed-rate deals, so would only see a change in their repayments when their current term ends, according to banking trade body UK Finance. About 1.5 million fixed-rate deals will expire this year, and another 1.5 million will do so in 2023. Of the remainder, 850,000 homeowners are on tracker deals, and the other 1.1 million are on standard variable rates (SVRs). They are the people likely to feel an immediate impact now the Bank rate has risen. The increase in the Bank rate to 0.75% means a typical tracker mortgage customer's monthly repayment will go up by Â£25.76. The typical SVR customer is likely to pay Â£15.96 more a month, UK Finance figures show. This is on top of similar rises in previous months. What are interest rates and why do they matter? UK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years That means a further squeeze on household budgets at a time of rising bills and when people have been used to years of cheap borrowing and relatively slow-rising prices. Every mortgage applicant since 2014 would have needed to prove in a stress test that they can pay at a rate of about 6% or 7% - the idea being that a small rate rise may be uncomfortable, but not unmanageable, for homeowners. However, the Bank of England is planning to drop this requirement, with a consultation on the proposal closing in May. Any improvement in savings rates will have a very limited impact on the value of money tucked away, given that the spending power of these funds is being eaten away by inflation. Analysts warn that there is no guarantee of the higher Bank rate being reflected in better returns on savings. Savers are often borrowers too, but the money in the bank has effectively been falling in value for some time. Anna Bowes, of website Savings Champion, says it is ""really disappointing"" how slow a lot of providers have been to react to the Bank of England's base rate rises. People are receiving pennies in interest for every Â£100 they keep in savings for a year. A Bank rate rise will do little to change that scenario. The average interest rate for an easy-access account you can open today is 0.2%, up from 0.17% in December. For easy-access accounts closed to new customers, it is 0.26%, up from 0.22%. The highest paying easy-access account has an interest rate of 0.84%, up from 0.71% in December. In the past five years, the best easy access savings rate on the market was in September 2019, which paid 1.6%. Interest rates rise again to counter higher prices Slow rise from ultra-low mortgage rates predicted When will interest rates fall?

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The first drop in rates for more than four years came in August, followed by another in November. Some analysts predict another cut in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,rose by 2.6% in the 12 months to November 2024which was up from 2.3% in October. That means inflation is back above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The government's plans to borrow and spend billions which were set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgethave changed expectations. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskafter the Budget announcement thatthey will have to pay more National Insurance for their staff, which could also affect the economy. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. How the Budget will affect you and your money Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change would have an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.46%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.23%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row. Its key lending rate is now ina target range of 4.25% to 4.5%,but the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace next year.

Join us again tomorrow - we'll have all the important updates on the Omicron variant and the wider pandemic throughout the day. Today's live page was written by Emma Harrison, Lauren Turner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Dulcie Lee and Adam Durbin. It was edited by Claire Heald, Alex Kleiderman and Kevin Ponniah. UK case numbers continued to climb rapidly today, with another 88,376 infections reported on Thursday - a record high for a second consecutive day The booster rollout is ramping up at pace - with a record 745,183 booster and third doses given out in the latest period Some 89% of people have had their first jab, 82% have had their second and 44% have now had their booster Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering that this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet Look up how many cases there are in your areahere. We'll be bringing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a close shortly. Here is a reminder of Thursday's main headlines:  US pharmaceutical firm Regeneron says its Covid-10 antibody
therapy is less potent against
the Omicron variant. In the US, the treatment â REGEN-COV â is used to treat Covid-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Ina statement,externalon Thursday, the company said its antibodies remain active against the Delta variant - currently the most
prevalent in the US. Regeneron added that it has confirmed that multiple ânext
generationâ antibodies it has identified, however, are active against Omicron,
Delta and âother variants of concernâ. âPending regulatory discussions, we anticipate entering the
clinic in the first quarter of 2022,â the statement said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although China was the first country to record cases of Covid-19 two years ago, it has only just today reach the milestone of 100,000 total cases. According to today's official statistics, there have now been exactly 100,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the country. China has a population of 1.4bn. This is pretty extraordinary when we factor in that these cases span two years, and the current rate of transmission in the UK means that this number of cases are being recorded within just two days (or less). The majority of these cases in China were recorded during the early stages of the pandemic. More than 50,000 Chinese cases were recorded in early 2020 in the central city of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified. Residents spent over two months confined to their homes so that transmission could be suppressed. China has managed to avoid subsequent large-scale outbreaks by introducing swift, sharp lockdowns. Chinaâs top medical specialists have projected that Chinaâs zero-Covid strategy may last until the end of spring 2022. The Queen usually attends church on Christmas Day - this year will be the first since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years More news now on the Queen, whoearlier cancelled her traditional pre-Christmas lunchfor extended family as a precautionary measure over soaring Omicron cases.

All plans are said to be under review, and the palace will announce a decision when there is one. Read morehere.

Maisy Evans says she doesn't know if she will ever fully recover - as some days she feels pain and tiredness, but other days she is well. She says it was ""really scary"" but that no one knows why she was affected so badly. As cases rise sharply in the UK,France is shutting its border to British tourists, tightening the reasons for people to travel between the two states. Eurostar has criticised this ""sudden switching on and off of travel"". The train company says the rule change - which comes into force on Saturday evening - is at ""significant cost to people, businesses and the economy"". Eurostar told the BBC it's difficult to see the purpose of travel restrictions when a variant is already established. For those who need to change their plans, Eurostar is offering a free exchange system or e-voucher. Read our full story on the changeshere. Ian says it's going to be a tough Christmas We've been hearing about the problems being faced by businesses as Omicron cases rise in the UK. And some of you have been getting in touch telling us about your worries. Ian McGregor, runs Thai restaurant Star of Siam in Keswick, Cumbria, and has had many cancellations in the last 10 days. ""Some of the cancelled bookings have been big and the footfall in the town has not brought enough passing trade to cover the cancellations,"" he said. ""In the last week we have seen a sharp fall in our revenue and it looks as though we are heading for a tough Christmas trading period."" He says they're going to try to stay open as long as they can. Travel agent Wendy Haines, from Staffordshire, says she's seeing bookings cancelled. And while the hospitality industry has had support over the last two years, she thinks her industry is ""the most affected"" but ""the least supported"". ""I was on the phone to a client earlier who has no choice but to cancel her familyâs trip to Disneyland Paris, as France is effectively closing its borders,"" she said. ""The whole point in people going to France is to see the Christmas festivities â postponing to March for instance would not be the same. Unless customers travel, we donât get paid."" She's worried about what the next few months will bring. As businesses in the hospitality sector field phone calls - primarily to cancel bookings due to rising cases - theChancellor will return from a business trip in the US earlierthan planned. Opposition Labour MPs have been critical as he's been away in the US for work whilebusinesses struggle. Sunak said he understood it was a ""concerning time for businesses"" and the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to support lives and livelihoods. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics First the good: the booster campaign is
ramping up rapidly. Nearly 750,000 boosters were given yesterday, new figures confirm. But the race against the virus is on. The bad news is cases are continuing to rise rapidly: nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in a single day, up from close to 80,000 yesterday. Most of this is being driven
by London, where Omicron is furthest advanced, case rates are highest and
rising fastest. Hospital admissions are rising in the capital too. But, with cases of Omicron being detected across the UK, other parts of the country are likely to be facing the
same challenges in the near future. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has increased by 105,595 or 31.4% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased by 6% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were identified in the UK. A further 88,376 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There have also been another 146 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK reported 78,610 cases yesterday. Another 1,691 Omicron cases in
the UK have been identified, the UK Health and Security Agency says. This brings the total number of identified
Omicron cases to 11,708 â though experts warn the number is likely to be much
higher as the variant spreads rapidly. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We are waiting on the latest UK figures, but as Omicron coronavirus cases surge in the UK, more and more people are pondering their symptoms. If you have a runny nose or a headache it is possible that you have Covid, say researchers. The Zoe Covid study app,externalasks hundreds of thousands of people to log their symptoms. Investigators have been looking at ones linked to Delta and more recently Omicron and say the top five symptoms are: So how likely is it to be aCovid rather than a cold? Lead scientist Professor Tim Spector says: ""In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it's far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold. ""If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we've seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant variant already."" If you think you may have Covid, it is important to get tested. Even people who don't feel very ill can put others at risk. The NHS says people should still look out for classic Covid symptoms:  Israel has also been busy on the vaccine front. It's going to donate one million coronavirus vaccines to African countries, its foreign minister has said. Yair Lapid said the AstraZeneca doses would be distributed in the coming weeks under the international Covax scheme, designed to boost vaccine supplies to poorer nations around the world. ""I'm happy that Israel can contribute and be a partner in eradicating this pandemic from the world,""Lapid tweeted,external. The foreign ministry said the vaccines would go to nearly a quarter of African countries, though it did not specify which. Only about 7% of people in Africa have been vaccinated,the World Health Organization said last month,external- the
lowest rate of any continent. Gidi KleimanBBC News, Jerusalem We've head a lot from France today about new restrictions on UK travellers, but the country is not alone in taking action. Israel will designate the UK and Denmark as countries on
its Covid-19 âred listâ at midnight due to concern over the spread of the
Omicron variant. Israeli citizens and permanent residents are forbidden
from travelling to âredâ countries from Israel, unless they get permission from
the government. Travellers returning from a âredâ country are be taken to a
publicly-funded quarantine facility on arrival and must stay there until they
receive a negative PCR test result. They may then complete their seven days of isolation
at home. France, Spain, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and the United Arab
Emirates are expected to be added to the red list on Sunday. Most African nations are already on it. Israel closed its borders to almost all foreign nationals last month
in response to Omicron, just
weeks after they were reopened to vaccinated
travellers. Earlier this week, Health Minister Nitzan
Horowitz told reporters that Israel could not be âhermetically sealedâ, but
that it was possible to delay the spread of Omicron in the country. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent There's also news today that retired teachers in England will be brought in to assist schools struggling withCovid-related staffing problems, the education secretary says. Ina letter to schools,external, Nadhim Zahawi says he knows the availability of supply teachers is a ""particular issue"" - and he wants to make sure ""as many supply staff as possible are available"". Many schools in England have had to move individual classes and year groups online because of staffing issues. Of 75 local education authorities that responded to questions from the BBC, 35 said some classes had been forced to close. Lots cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to find supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. Zahawi's announcement comes after the government was quizzed in the Commons on Wednesday about why retired teaching staff were not being brought back to help schools, asretired medical professionals were last year. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Its a level of preparedness to chill any working parent, and downbeat news for pupils, but schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC some classes had moved online at local schools. The government says it is committed to ensuring that schools in England stay open in January. UK schools have been advised to reopen next term under current guidance. They have been planning for a number of scenarios - including remote learning and teaching in ""bubbles"" with staggered start and finish times.

Now, the government's advisory group on vaccines, the JCVI, is putting mums-to-be on the priority list for vaccines. It means they're given the same priority as those with certain health conditions. Research shows higher rates of premature birth linked to infection and some pregnant women with Covid have died. Vaccines are safe to have when pregnant and cut the risk of severe illness. Read more.

"This video can not be played The protection given by Covid vaccines and testing means Christmas will be ""very different"" this year, says the prime minister. Boris Johnson has insisted England is not being put into lockdown by stealth, despite accusations from some of his own MPs. The prime minister said he was not telling the public to cancel events, but urging them to exercise ""caution"". It comes as chief medical officer Chris Whitty suggested people ""prioritise"" activities in the run-up to Christmas. Conservative MP Steve Brine accused the government of ""putting hospitality into effective lockdown"". Mr Brine said Prof Whitty's comments meant businesses were facing ""complete ruin"" and more government support was needed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hold discussions with business leaders on Friday, after deciding to cut short an official trip to the US to return to the UK. He is facing demands for increased financial support to help affected sectors cope with booking cancellations, amid the spread of the Omicron variant. What are the Christmas rules this year? Downing Street denies Johnson lockdown party claim Chancellor cuts short US trip over Covid concerns The PM's spokesman denied Number 10 was sending out mixed messages about socialising over Christmas, adding that both the prime minister and the chief medical officer ""were making the point that given the current infection rate people should be cautious and think carefully before mixing with others"". However, Labour has urged ministers to be more specific about how they want people to behave in the coming weeks. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has called for ""clarity from the government"" on whether football fans should still go to matches - with thousands due to attend fixtures in the coming days, despitesome being postponeddue to players isolating. The party is also demanding Mr Sunak produces a plan to help sectors affected by cancelled bookings and staff shortages, in the wake of the advice to scale back socialising. It is calling on ministers to offer firms more flexibility on paying back government loans, cuts to business rates, and an improved insurance scheme for theatresforced to cancel shows due to performer absences. The pub industry is also calling for more support, with the British Beer & Pub Association estimating the sector is set to lose Â£297m in trade over the traditionally busy Christmas period. Look one way and there are plenty of the expert advisers. Look the other way, and there are plenty of Conservative backbenchers. There are plenty of businesses saying there is a lockdown by stealth: that grim warnings are spooking people, but because very little is actually banned, they're not getting the support they got when they were compelled to close. As if to illustrate the bind the government finds itself in, No 10 has now had to publicly defend Chris Whitty after one Tory backbencher claimed his remarks yesterday amounted to a ""public health socialist state"" in action. As the Omicron variant accelerates, the politics of the second Christmas of the pandemic is irritable and uncertain. Asked if the government was imposing a lockdown by stealth, Mr Johnson said the situation was ""very different"" from last year due to the existence of vaccines and testing. ""If you want to go to an event or a party... the sensible thing to do is to get a test and to make sure that you're being cautious. ""But we're not saying that we want to cancel stuff, we're not locking stuff down, and the fastest route back to normality is to get boosted."" Meanwhile, a number of Conservative MPs have questioned Prof Whitty's role in offering advice to the public. In a tweet she later deleted, Conservative MP for Beaconsfield Joy Morrissey said: ""Perhaps the unelected Covid public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of Parliament and the prime minister have decided. ""I know it's difficult to remember but that's how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state."" Labour has called the comments ""unacceptable and dangerous"" and urged Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to remove her from her role as his parliamentary aide unless she apologises. Meanwhile, Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that restrictions on ""higher risk settings"" may be ""unavoidable"" amid rising Omicron cases. Writing to Mr Johnson on Thursday, she said urgent financial help was needed to protect businesses from the ""economic shock"" of a surge in infections. Ms Sturgeon has already advised people in Scotland tolimit socialising to three households at a timeover the festive period, but in her letter said there may be a need to ""strengthen"" guidance further.

"The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years, in response to calls to tackle surging price rises. The increase to 0.25% from 0.1% followed data this week that showed prices climbing at the fastest pace for 10 years. It came despite fears the Omicron variant could slow the economy by causing people to spend less. The Bank's action is set to increase the mortgage costs of some homeowners. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it needed to tackle strong inflationary pressures building up in the economy. Inflation is now running at 5.1%, the highest in a decade, and he expects it to rise further early next year. ""In the short term - that is, in the next two or three months - we think it can get to around 6%,"" he told the BBC. A rise in wholesale gas prices is still a big factor driving inflation, and that is continuing to push up domestic energy bills. But one business group said the interest rate rise would do little to stop prices going up, since costs were being pushed higher by global factors largely outside the Bank's control. The decision by the Bank of England will add just over Â£15 to the typical monthly repayment for a tracker mortgage customer. A standard variable rate mortgage-holder is likely to pay nearly Â£10 extra a month. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers may welcome news of higher rates, analysts warn there is no guarantee the higher Bank rate will lead to better returns on savings. Even if savings rates increase slightly, returns are still well below the rate of inflation. How will the interest rate rise affect you? How do interest rates affect your money? Why is the cost of living going up? The Bank says inflation could hit 6% next year The Bank can raise interest rates to help control price rises - but many experts had expected it to hold off because of uncertainty about Omicron. Yet on Thursday, it said the prices of global assets, such as stocks and bonds, had largely recovered after an initial fall triggered by news of the new variant. Successive waves of Covid also appeared to have had less impact on economic growth, the Bank added, although there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case this time. ""Consumer price inflation in advanced economies has risen by more than expected,"" the Bank said. The Omicron variant could reduce economic activity early next year, said the Bank, although it was unclear how much of an effect it would have on inflation worldwide. Mr Bailey told the BBC the Bank's rate-setters had thought ""long and hard"" about the impact of Omicron on economic activity before making their decision. ""But it is not at all clear if the impact [on the economy] could cause inflation to come down, or even go up,"" he said. The Bank of England seems to like a surprise. Last month, acknowledging the expectation of an interest rate rise happening, it held off. This month, with the main development being the spread of Omicron, it has raised at a time when most expected it to hold. It goes to show that the arguments have been finely balanced. The other development has been that inflation has hit even harder and even faster than expected. Six per cent is now the expected peak in the spring, which will represent the highest rate of inflation on the targeted CPI measure for 30 years. It is treble the Bank of England's target. While it is important to note that a 0.15% rise is modest and still leaves base rates very close to historic lows, it is not ideal that this comes at the precise moment where some forms of consumer confidence, especially in terms of going out, appear to be slumping. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was briefed by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and intriguingly chose to mention the possibility that Omicron could raise inflationary pressure by further hobbling supply chains for goods, and the supply of workers. The argument will be that it is better to nip expectations of inflation in the bud, than try to contain them once they get going. A rise now is preferable, in the eyes of the MPC, to having to rise by even more over the next year or two. The Bank is choosing to act on what it knows about inflation, rather than hold back on what it doesn't know about Omicron. Not at all. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 8-1 in favour of the increase. The dissenting MPC member, Silvana Tenreyro, voted to keep rates as they were. Rates had been at 0.1%, a record low, since March last year, when they were cut in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. It was the second month in a row that Bank policymakers had surprised the markets. Economists had expected a rate rise at the MPC's last meeting in November, but policymakers voted to hold fire. This time, analysts expected a further delay because of Omicron, but the committee thought differently. ""The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates was surprising, given mounting uncertainty over the economic impact of the Omicron variant,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. ""While today's rate increase may have little effect on most firms, many will view this as the first step in a longer policy movement - not as a partial reversal of last year's cut."" He added that the current inflationary spike was mostly driven by global factors, so higher interest rates would do little to curb further increases in inflation. Instead, the government needed to find practical solutions to the UK's supply chain problems and labour shortages, he said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the move suggested that the Bank had become ""a bit more hawkish"" and might now think rates need to rise further than before. ""The MPC once again said that a 'modest tightening' of monetary policy is likely to be necessary, so this is not looking like a case of one and done,"" he added. ""We still think that weaker economic growth and a faster fall in inflation will mean that interest rates won't rise to 1% by the end of next year, but it's just become more likely that they rise above our 0.5% forecast."" The MPC also voted unanimously to maintain the Bank's asset purchase scheme at Â£875bn. The last time the Bank raised interest rates was in August 2018, when they reached 0.75%. They were then cut twice in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Do you have a tracker mortgage and will now see your repayments rise?

"Unresolved fire safety defects mean that James' property is now ""unsellable"" People worst affected by the post-Grenfell fire safety crisis may be able to sell their flats to the Welsh government. Housing Minister Julie James has announced a ""buy-out"" scheme, which will be launched next year. It will be aimed at a ""small number"" of people in ""significant financial hardship"". It would be the first scheme of its kind in the UK, but the criteria and budget are not yet known. Campaigners welcomed the idea but said there had been a ""lack of urgency"" from the Welsh government, while opposition parties have called for more details. Homeowner's tears as cladding costs spiral Legal action threat over cladding support delay Combustible cladding ban in force from January Fire safety defects in many high-rise apartment blocks were exposed in the wake of the Grenfell disaster in west London in 2017, when 72 people died. Many leaseholders have found it impossible to sell, as lenders will not provide buyers with mortgages on the properties. They are also facing significantly increased costs to cover insurance premiums and interim fire safety measures as well as ongoing worry about who will pay for long-term repairs. Climate Change Minister Julie James says the Welsh government is prepared to look at a ""number of areas of hardship"" Announcing the plan in the Senedd on Tuesday, Ms James suggested the scheme could include people who have failed to sell their house on the open market because the sale would put them into negative equity, people in mortgage arrears and those whose flats have become overcrowded because they now have a larger family. ""There are a number of areas of hardship that we're prepared to look at,"" she said. People would either be able to sell the house to the government and stay in it as a tenant, or ""take the money and start again somewhere else"". ""I know from speaking to large numbers of residents that there are a lot of people who will be very interested in a scheme of that sort,"" Ms James said. She explained valuations would be done by the valuation office, in the same way as compulsory purchase valuations. James feels the government buy-out scheme is an attractive proposition James, 30, was a first-time buyer who had ""saved up a lot of money"" to buy his Cardiff Bay flat in 2016. Unresolved fire safety defects mean it is now ""unsellable"" and he is paying thousands of pounds in extra service charges to cover surveys, insurance and a night-time patrol. He said he was worried about being made bankrupt and ""never anticipated things would get this bad"", and would be interested in a government buy-out scheme. ""It's an attractive proposition, just to be out of here and not have to deal with the stress and the anxiety and the financial hit, and even years down the line when the fire defects are resolved, are people actually going to want to buy a property here? ""The reputational damage that's been done is going to be very off-putting for potential buyers I think."" Many leaseholders have found it impossible to sell due to exposed fire safety defects The Welsh Conservatives' housing spokeswoman, Janet Finch-Saunders, said it was ""vital"" there was clarity on how long the Welsh Government would own the flats and ""how exactly they would be managed"". Plaid Cymru's Mabon ap Gwynfor called on the minister to say how many people will be eligible for the scheme, and how the government will define ""significant financial hardship"". Ms James said the scheme would be ""up and running"" for the new financial year and in the meantime the government would ""start to process"" people who want to be part of it. Mark Habberfield, from the Welsh Cladiators campaign group, said he was glad people who could go bankrupt or are experiencing ""mental anguish"" are able to seek support. ""However, we are concerned about the apparent lack of urgency or commitment to time frames and feel this scandal is taking too long to resolve,"" he added. The government's broader scheme - to fund surveys on affected buildings, previously described as ""too little too late"" by campaigners - has received more than 100 applications and Ms James said work would begin in the new year. Ms James also renewed her call for ""developers and those responsible for these building defects"" to ""step up and do more to resolve the crisis"".

"This video can not be played The protection given by Covid vaccines and testing means Christmas will be ""very different"" this year, says the prime minister. Boris Johnson has insisted England is not being put into lockdown by stealth, despite accusations from some of his own MPs. The prime minister said he was not telling the public to cancel events, but urging them to exercise ""caution"". It comes as chief medical officer Chris Whitty suggested people ""prioritise"" activities in the run-up to Christmas. Conservative MP Steve Brine accused the government of ""putting hospitality into effective lockdown"". Mr Brine said Prof Whitty's comments meant businesses were facing ""complete ruin"" and more government support was needed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hold discussions with business leaders on Friday, after deciding to cut short an official trip to the US to return to the UK. He is facing demands for increased financial support to help affected sectors cope with booking cancellations, amid the spread of the Omicron variant. What are the Christmas rules this year? Downing Street denies Johnson lockdown party claim Chancellor cuts short US trip over Covid concerns The PM's spokesman denied Number 10 was sending out mixed messages about socialising over Christmas, adding that both the prime minister and the chief medical officer ""were making the point that given the current infection rate people should be cautious and think carefully before mixing with others"". However, Labour has urged ministers to be more specific about how they want people to behave in the coming weeks. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has called for ""clarity from the government"" on whether football fans should still go to matches - with thousands due to attend fixtures in the coming days, despitesome being postponeddue to players isolating. The party is also demanding Mr Sunak produces a plan to help sectors affected by cancelled bookings and staff shortages, in the wake of the advice to scale back socialising. It is calling on ministers to offer firms more flexibility on paying back government loans, cuts to business rates, and an improved insurance scheme for theatresforced to cancel shows due to performer absences. The pub industry is also calling for more support, with the British Beer & Pub Association estimating the sector is set to lose Â£297m in trade over the traditionally busy Christmas period. Look one way and there are plenty of the expert advisers. Look the other way, and there are plenty of Conservative backbenchers. There are plenty of businesses saying there is a lockdown by stealth: that grim warnings are spooking people, but because very little is actually banned, they're not getting the support they got when they were compelled to close. As if to illustrate the bind the government finds itself in, No 10 has now had to publicly defend Chris Whitty after one Tory backbencher claimed his remarks yesterday amounted to a ""public health socialist state"" in action. As the Omicron variant accelerates, the politics of the second Christmas of the pandemic is irritable and uncertain. Asked if the government was imposing a lockdown by stealth, Mr Johnson said the situation was ""very different"" from last year due to the existence of vaccines and testing. ""If you want to go to an event or a party... the sensible thing to do is to get a test and to make sure that you're being cautious. ""But we're not saying that we want to cancel stuff, we're not locking stuff down, and the fastest route back to normality is to get boosted."" Meanwhile, a number of Conservative MPs have questioned Prof Whitty's role in offering advice to the public. In a tweet she later deleted, Conservative MP for Beaconsfield Joy Morrissey said: ""Perhaps the unelected Covid public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of Parliament and the prime minister have decided. ""I know it's difficult to remember but that's how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state."" Labour has called the comments ""unacceptable and dangerous"" and urged Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to remove her from her role as his parliamentary aide unless she apologises. Meanwhile, Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that restrictions on ""higher risk settings"" may be ""unavoidable"" amid rising Omicron cases. Writing to Mr Johnson on Thursday, she said urgent financial help was needed to protect businesses from the ""economic shock"" of a surge in infections. Ms Sturgeon has already advised people in Scotland tolimit socialising to three households at a timeover the festive period, but in her letter said there may be a need to ""strengthen"" guidance further.

"The musician is one of the most-successful rock stars of the last 50 years Bruce Springsteen has sold the master recordings and publishing rights for his life's work to Sony for a reported $500m (Â£376m). The deal gives Sony ownership of his 20 studio albums, including classics like Born To Run, The River and Born In The USA, according tomultiple,externalUSreports,external. A 20-time Grammy winner, Springsteen's music generated about $15m in revenue last year. His deal follows similar sales byBob Dylan,Blondieand David Bowie. Warner Music bought the worldwide rights to Bowie's music in September, and Dylan sold his catalogue of more than 600 songs in December last year to Universal Music Group at a purchase price widely reported as $300m. The deals provide immediate financial security to the artists and their estates, while the rights-holders hope to profit by building new revenue streams for the music via film and TV licensing, merchandise, cover versions and performance royalties. Bruce Springsteen's Desert Island Discs Why the Church of England co-owns a BeyoncÃ© hit Bob Dylan sells song rights to UMG At an investor relations meeting in May, Sony Music's chief executive, Rob Stringer, said the company had spent $1.4bn in acquisitions over the previous six months. That included a multi-million dollar deal to obtain the rights to Paul Simon's back catalogue. Springsteen's deal would be the most expensive so far, if the numbers reported by music industry bible Billboard are correct. No public announcement has been made about the sale, and representatives for Sony and Springsteen did not immediately respond to queries from the BBC. Springsteen is one of the most successful rock musicians of all time, and has recorded for Sony's Columbia Records imprint for the duration of his career. Born and raised in New Jersey, he once said he intended to make an album with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector where he sang like Roy Orbison. It remains a neat encapsulation of his style, and a key to understanding his broad appeal - although he's frequently, and successfully, experimented outside those constraints. His reputation was cemented in 1974, when music critic Jon Landau reviewed one of his shows with The E Street Band in Boston. ""Last Thursday, at the Harvard Square theatre, I saw rock'n'roll past flash before my eyes,"" Landau wrote. ""And I saw something else: I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Springsteen's commercial breakthrough came the following year, with the hit album Born To Run, trailed by its ambitious, wall-of-sound title track. Greeted by rapturous reviews, it sold nine million copies and saw Springsteen achieve the rare feat of appearing on the covers of Time and Newsweek magazine in the same week. One of the hardest-working entertainers in showbusiness, he built up a fearsome reputation for his sweat-drenched, hours-long concerts - and, somewhat unexpectedly, became one of the breakout stars of the MTV generation, with videos for songs like Hungry Heart and Dancing In The Dark on heavy rotation alongside hits by Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince. His biggest hit was 1985's Born In The USA, which sold 15 million copies in the US and 30 million worldwide. After such huge success, he stepped away from his longtime companions, The E Street Band and subsequent albums varied in quality, while his marriage to actress Julianne Phillips ended in divorce after the star fell for his backing singer (and current wife) Patti Scialfa. In the 1990s, he earned an Oscar for the theme song to the Tom Hanks' Aids drama, Philadelphia; and a 1995 greatest hits album topped the charts, selling four million copies. The star's concerts often stretch to the three and four-hour mark After reconvening the E Street Band at the turn of the millennium, Springsteen entered a creative hot-streak that has yet to fade - with highlights including 2002's The Rising, a response to the terror attacks of 9/11, 2012's politically-charged Wrecking Ball and 2019's Western Stars, an homage to the 1970s-era golden age of the Laurel Canyon pop. He was inducted to the Rock Hall of Fame in 1999, and played the Super Bowl Half-Time show 10 years later. More recently, the 72-year-old has released his autobiography, also titled Born To Run, and staged a series of intimate, one-man Broadway shows looking back at his life and career. His last album, Letter To You, was released in 2020; and this year, he made rare guest appearances on songs by The Killers and Bleachers.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon took questions from opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament. Ms Sturgeon says ahead of the session that Omicron will become the dominant variant of the virus in Scotland from Friday. 5,951 Covid cases were reported yesterday - with 45% of cases now showing the S-gene drop out that is indicative of Omicron. More than half of the adult population in Scotland has now had a booster jab. Guidance ahead of new regulations aimed at limiting the spread of the new variant has now been published. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross questioned why businesses were still waiting for the guidance this morning. BBC Scotland News Finally, the SNP's Jim Fairlie asks Ms Sturgeon to update parliament on the most recent Cobra meeting with the UK government. The first minister says that meeting was on Wednesday afternoon and was the second in a week. She says it is important that they happen and that yesterday's session was chaired by Michael Gove. She says that she, and the first ministers of Wales and Northern Ireland raised the point about the need for funding support. She hopes the PM and chancellor both engage directly in the meetings from now on as it is a ""serious"" situation we are facing.  Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane notes that in addition to the classic Covid symptoms of a cough, fever and loss or change in sense of taste and smell, more symptoms are being associated with the Omicron variant. He says this includes headaches, night sweats, muscle aches, extreme tiredness, a runny nose and scratchy throats. Dr Gulhane asks the first minister if she will consider asking the UK's chief medical officers to add these other symptoms to the criteria for a PCR test. Ms Sturgeon replies that this is a very good point. She says symptoms of Covid are constantly under review by experts. She adds that anyone who is concerned they might have Covid should go for a PCR test. SNP MSP Emma Harper asks the FM to join her in thanking all staff and volunteers for their ""stunning and braw"" efforts in making Scotland the first nation to give a booster to more than half of the adult population. Ms Sturgeon says all staff are doing ""heroic work"" and she ""cannot find the words"" to properly convey the depth of her appreciation and gratitude. She adds that as they build capacity, they need people to come forward, book their appointments and get us out of the other end of the challenge with Omicron. SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson says NHS Ayrshire and Arran has suspended all visiting despite the FM's statement on Tuesday that it was important for patients not to be isolated. Mr Gibson asks the first minister if she can take steps to ensure patients in Ayrshire can receive visitors this Christmas. Ms Sturgeon says that discussions have taken place with the health board and says she has been assured that this decision will be revised. She says that no one should be isolated in hospital over Christmas and reminds anyone seeing a loved one in hospital to take a lateral flow test ahead of any visits. Scottish pop band Deacon Blue have postponed the last two shows of their tour over concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid. Lead singer Ricky Ross tweeted that he was ""disappointed"" the authorities had not made any decision about live gigs. ""However it's clear to us Deacon Blue should not be playing and people shouldn't be asked to attend gigs just now,"" he said. Scottish Trad Music band Skerryvore also postponed their last five shows. Read the full story here One-way systems will be reintroduced While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has published its latest guidance for businesses and work spaces to deal with the pandemic. The details set outextra restrictions,externalin law and advice which come into force from one minute past midnight on Friday. They include the reintroduction of greater physical distancing in shops and supermarkets such as the installation of plastic screens and one-way systems where feasible at entry points and exits. In pubs, the guidance stops short of mandating table service for customers but does say it is ""strongly encouraged"". However what it calls ""major life events"" such as weddings and funerals are allowed to carry on without additional restrictions. On Tuesday, the first minister's set out a range of measures the Scottish government wanted to take to slow down the transmission of the Omicron variant. In some cases, she said changes would be made to the law to make these things enforceable. In other cases, she offered guidance. Find out what is guidance and what is law. Scotland has the toughest Covid rules and guidance in the UK at the moment. But Nicola Sturgeon announced said the Scottish government would have liked to go further. Read why Scotland doesn't have tougher Covid measures. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says businesses are anxious about the impact of Omicron and do not appreciate ""politics or bickering"". He urges the Scottish and UK governments to work together. Mr Sarwar then goes on to ask about cancer treatment, highlighting fears over cancer patients waiting for diagnosis and treatment. He asks the FM what she's doing to prevent a ""cancer catastrophe"". Ms Sturgeon says her government is working through investments into early diagnosis to make sure people get ""speedy"" treatment for cancer. However, she acknowledges that there is ""continued and increasing"" pressure on health services as a result of the pandemic. Cancer services will continue to be prioritised, she adds, but  acknowledges that they have been impacted. Mr Ross says businesses were still waiting this morning for guidance in order to comply with the First Minister's statement on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon says more detailed guidance will be online shortly, and that we are facing a variant of the virus spreading faster than anything we have seen so far, with an R number possibly above 4. She says ""we do not have time to waste"" on vaccination or in putting in place protective measures to slow this variant down.  Lives are at risk, livelihoods are at risk and the NHS is at risk. The UK government has to step up and provide the financial support that businesses need. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish government has revised its booster target down from 70,000 to 61,000 a day between now and the end of the year. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it would be enough to reach 80% of those eligible for the jab before January. Scotlandbroke its booster record on Wednesdaywith 54,104 jabs given. A speedy booster programme is considered vital in tackling the threat of the Omicron variant, which is much more infectious than other strains. A Public Health Scotland report has warned that the ""predicted exponential increases"" in Omicron cases could put ""significant pressure"" on hospitals in coming weeks. Read more Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross starts the questions. He says the vaccination scheme has delivered a booster to half of all 18-year-olds and thanks health staff, forces  and volunteers. He brings up the issue of mass vaccination centres as he has in previous weeks. He asks how many mass centres will reopen and start vaccinating people. Ms Sturgeon makes the point that someone vaccinated today will not have immune protection for several days. She says that no matter how fast the vaccines go, the variant runs faster. She says that while we speed up the vaccination programme, we must also act now to slow the virus. She runs through extra vaccination facilities including Hampden Park, Ingliston, Ravenscraig and EICC. She says more are under preparation. She hopes to get to the 70,000 a day she wants to get to, albeit by de-prioritising the flu vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon says she is concerned about the impact Omicron will have on businesses. She says there are ""simply no mechanisms available to the devolved administrations"" to offer the scale of financial support required. She calls for urgent action from the UK government. ""We must not sleepwalk into an emergency that for health and business will be much greater as a result of inaction than if we act firmly and strongly now,"" she says. Ms Sturgeon adds that she has asked to speak to the prime minister later today about financial support for businesses. The first minister outlines the consequences of not bringing infections under control, which she says will be significant. She stresses that - so far - there is no evidence that Omicron symptoms are milder. Many will still become severely unwell and die, and the sheer number of peole infected will still present a massive challenge, Ms Sturgeon says. ""If we don't act now, what we have feared all along but so far avoided  - the NHS being overwhelmed - could happen,"" she warns. She adds that it is a ""really serious"" situation. ""Please stay at home much more than you normally would and as much as is feasible,"" she implores the public. The FM says that Omicron is running faster than even the fastest rollout of vaccines  and says we must also act to slow the virus down. She says that hospital admissions are rising in London which is heavily affected by the variant. Ms Sturgeon says a surge in infections is impacting the NHS and is already causing staff absences which will affect essential services. She reiterated the current guidance - to limit contact with other people as much as possible. She also says that by acting to reduce community transmission we will help to keep schools open and protect education. Omicron will be the dominant Covid strain in Scotland by tomorrow, the first minister says. She is ""profoundly concerned"" by the challenge Omicron poses. 5,951 Covid cases were reported yesterday, the FM says. 45.4% of cases now show the S-gene drop out indicative of Omicron, she adds. ""It, therefore, seems likely that by tomorrow Omicron will be the dominant strain circulating in Scotland."" Theescalation of the Omicron variantis likely to dominate the opposition's questions today. Full updated guidance is due from the Scottish government as the vaccination booster programme is ramped up. Calls for help from the hospitality sectormay also merit discussion and the prospect of further restrictions around the festive period may also be mentioned. Labour's Anas Sarwarhas been championing the infection crisis at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital at FMQsof late, so that may also come up. Good afternoon and welcome to our live coverage of first minister's questions. Nicola Sturgeon is due on her feet at noon.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Omicron is spreading ""exceptionally fast"" in Scotland Further restrictions on ""high risk"" sectors may be unavoidable as Omicron surges across the country, Scotland's first minister has warned. In a letter to the prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon said urgent financial help was needed to protect businesses from the ""economic shock"". She said the huge number of people likely to be infected could overwhelm the NHS and other critical services. And she said more restrictions ""while undesirable, may now be unavoidable"". The Omicron variant is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus in Scotland by Friday. Some 45% of the 5,951 Covid cases reported across the country on Thursday were suspected to be the new variant. Hospitality 'takes Â£1bn hit' on Christmas parties Covid rules: What is advice and what is the law? Why doesn't Scotland have tougher Covid measures? Ms Sturgeon has urged people to reduce contact with other households ""as much as you possibly can"", with adviceto limit socialising to three householdsat a time in the run-up to Christmas amid fears of a ""tsunami"" of new infections. New regulations requiring shops and hospitality venues to reduce the spread of the virus will come into force on Friday, withguidance for businesses,externalpublished on Thursday afternoon. Firms will need to enforce physical distancing, cut down on crowding in shops and at bars, and enable staff to work from home wherever possible. In her letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ms Sturgeon said that failing to put financial support in place for businesses meant that the UK's economic recovery was being put at risk. She urged him to either re-establish the furlough scheme or give the devolved administrations the means to set up similar initiatives of their own. Ms Sturgeon added: ""The sheer number of people likely to be infected in the period ahead risks overwhelming the NHS and disabling the economy and other critical services. ""If left unchecked, Omicron will deliver a significant economic shock that will see lack of staff and pressure on already stressed supply chains lead directly to business failure."" She added: ""Frankly, if we do not get Omicron under control we are sacrificing the economic recovery we all want to see. ""If the Treasury does not provide financial compensation and protection, this result becomes all but inevitable."" Confirmed Omicron cases have increased dramatically in recent days The Scottish government announced Â£100m of its own funding for struggling businesses on Tuesday, but opposition parties said there was no timeline for then the money would be distributed. And they have accused the government of causing confusion over when guidance on the new rules for business would be issued - and when the rules will come into force. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This guidance has now, finally, been published. But there's still no word on when struggling small businesses will get the funding they desperately need to survive this difficult period. ""This is about people's jobs and their livelihoods. Nicola Sturgeon must commit to getting this vital cash to businesses before Christmas. ""Nicola Sturgeon is calling for more support from the UK government before she's even able to tell Scottish businesses when they'll get funding from her government."" Nicola Sturgeon has written to the UK government calling for ""urgent"" funding to support businesses The advice on limiting social gatherings is not enforceable in law, but Ms Sturgeon has said people should ""not think of it as optional"". However, there will be new legal requirements for businesses from Friday - a day sooner than the government had initially indicated. Guidance published on Thursday said firms should look at installing barriers or screens to ensure physical distancing and avoid bottlenecks at entrances and in corridors. It said the government would ""strongly encourage the use of table service where possible"", and that retail settings should use ""signs, floor markings and queue management systems to help people keep a safe distance from others"". New government guidance says shops should use ""queue management systems"" where possible Hospitality firms in Scotland say they have alreadytaken a Â£1bn hit because of advice to cancel work Christmas parties,and bars and restaurants say the effect of guidance to limit social interactions could be ""devastating"". Ms Sturgeon said she was ""acutely aware of and deeply concerned"" about the impact of advice on businesses. Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has urged the UK government to provide around Â£500m immediately to help ""make a dent"" in grant support for Scottish businesses. She toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme: ""The greatest risk right now is that we wait too long, England goes into lockdown, something like furlough is reintroduced and suddenly it is available to Scottish businesses - but three or four weeks too late."" The UK government has made some funds available to the devolved administrations, although Scottish ministers say this has been brought forward from next year and had already been allocated within budgets. A UK government spokeswoman said the Treasury had ""given the devolved administrations the certainty they need to spend more money in the coming weeks"", and would continue to engage with them. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also said business owners were ""anxious"" about the future of their firms and workers. He said: ""What they will not appreciate is politics or bickering. What they will expect is for the Scottish and UK governments to work together in the national interest to protect people's lives and livelihoods."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"This video can not be played The protection given by Covid vaccines and testing means Christmas will be ""very different"" this year, says the prime minister. Boris Johnson has insisted England is not being put into lockdown by stealth, despite accusations from some of his own MPs. The prime minister said he was not telling the public to cancel events, but urging them to exercise ""caution"". It comes as chief medical officer Chris Whitty suggested people ""prioritise"" activities in the run-up to Christmas. Conservative MP Steve Brine accused the government of ""putting hospitality into effective lockdown"". Mr Brine said Prof Whitty's comments meant businesses were facing ""complete ruin"" and more government support was needed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will hold discussions with business leaders on Friday, after deciding to cut short an official trip to the US to return to the UK. He is facing demands for increased financial support to help affected sectors cope with booking cancellations, amid the spread of the Omicron variant. What are the Christmas rules this year? Downing Street denies Johnson lockdown party claim Chancellor cuts short US trip over Covid concerns The PM's spokesman denied Number 10 was sending out mixed messages about socialising over Christmas, adding that both the prime minister and the chief medical officer ""were making the point that given the current infection rate people should be cautious and think carefully before mixing with others"". However, Labour has urged ministers to be more specific about how they want people to behave in the coming weeks. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has called for ""clarity from the government"" on whether football fans should still go to matches - with thousands due to attend fixtures in the coming days, despitesome being postponeddue to players isolating. The party is also demanding Mr Sunak produces a plan to help sectors affected by cancelled bookings and staff shortages, in the wake of the advice to scale back socialising. It is calling on ministers to offer firms more flexibility on paying back government loans, cuts to business rates, and an improved insurance scheme for theatresforced to cancel shows due to performer absences. The pub industry is also calling for more support, with the British Beer & Pub Association estimating the sector is set to lose Â£297m in trade over the traditionally busy Christmas period. Look one way and there are plenty of the expert advisers. Look the other way, and there are plenty of Conservative backbenchers. There are plenty of businesses saying there is a lockdown by stealth: that grim warnings are spooking people, but because very little is actually banned, they're not getting the support they got when they were compelled to close. As if to illustrate the bind the government finds itself in, No 10 has now had to publicly defend Chris Whitty after one Tory backbencher claimed his remarks yesterday amounted to a ""public health socialist state"" in action. As the Omicron variant accelerates, the politics of the second Christmas of the pandemic is irritable and uncertain. Asked if the government was imposing a lockdown by stealth, Mr Johnson said the situation was ""very different"" from last year due to the existence of vaccines and testing. ""If you want to go to an event or a party... the sensible thing to do is to get a test and to make sure that you're being cautious. ""But we're not saying that we want to cancel stuff, we're not locking stuff down, and the fastest route back to normality is to get boosted."" Meanwhile, a number of Conservative MPs have questioned Prof Whitty's role in offering advice to the public. In a tweet she later deleted, Conservative MP for Beaconsfield Joy Morrissey said: ""Perhaps the unelected Covid public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of Parliament and the prime minister have decided. ""I know it's difficult to remember but that's how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state."" Labour has called the comments ""unacceptable and dangerous"" and urged Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to remove her from her role as his parliamentary aide unless she apologises. Meanwhile, Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that restrictions on ""higher risk settings"" may be ""unavoidable"" amid rising Omicron cases. Writing to Mr Johnson on Thursday, she said urgent financial help was needed to protect businesses from the ""economic shock"" of a surge in infections. Ms Sturgeon has already advised people in Scotland tolimit socialising to three households at a timeover the festive period, but in her letter said there may be a need to ""strengthen"" guidance further.

"Health Minister Robin Swann and Patricia Donnelly, head of NI's vaccine programme, outside the TEC A mass vaccination centre is being opened at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast next week as the rollout of Covid-19 boosters accelerates. The large-scale facility will offer walk-in slots and pre-booked appointments for booster jabs. First and second doses will also be offered. The Department of Health said it was being opened to deal with the ""expected surge"" from the Omicron variant. The Titanic Exhibition Centre is normally used to host large-scale trade shows. The South Eastern Health Trust, which will run the centre, is hoping to vaccinate 4,000 people each day. Tanya Daly, the clinical lead for the vaccine programme at the South Eastern Trust, said it was a ""mammoth task"". ""We can get a larger number of people through this building than we can on a hospital site,"" she said. ""We also have excellent car parking here we have good public transport links, so that's the benefit of being on a larger site, more people in a better location."" It has also been confirmed that people aged from 18 to 29 will be able to receive their booster from Monday as long as it has been at least three months since they received their second dose. Appointment bookings for that age group will be available from next Wednesday, 22 December, BBC News NI understands. On Wednesday it emerged that there were151 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in Northern Ireland. The Public Health Agency (PHA) described the figure as a ""significant increase"" and attributed it to ""rising community spread"" and a change in how cases were classified. A new definition came into effect across the UK on Wednesday, which meant cases that were previously recorded as ""highly probable"" Omicron cases were now automatically recorded as confirmed cases. The definition has been applied retrospectively to 1 December. Dr Brid Farrell, the PHA's deputy director of public health, said the identification of more Omicron cases was not unexpected. ""But it does act as a timely reminder that each of us needs to do what we can to slow its further spread and help protect ourselves and those around us,"" she said. Sir Michael McBride says ""significant measures might be required"" to curb the coronavirus infection rate Six more coronavirus-related deaths and another 2,237 casesof the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland on Thursday. A further 88,376 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures, up from Wednesday's record of 78,610. Stormont ministers have been told by health officials that if the Omicron variant is as severe as the Delta,""significant intervention"" would be needed after Christmasto ease pressure on the health service. A document provided by officials states states that it is likely that a peak in coronavirus case numbers will occur in the third week of January, with hospital admissions peaking in late January or February. Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? NI Covid booster uptake rises but infection rate high Will tougher measures stop the spread of Omicron? Speaking on Wednesday, chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said he was ""more concerned"" now than he had been at any other stage of the pandemic. He asked the public to get vaccinated and to get their booster if they were eligible for it. There was also a warning that reintroducing restrictions might be necessary to cope with rising figures. Sir Michael said that it was ""reasonable given the current growth that significant measures might be required"".

"Hospitals in Northern Ireland could be under even more pressure in January, say health officials Ministers have been warned there could be 11,000 Omicron variant cases each day in Northern Ireland in a worst-case scenario by the end of December. There are now 210 confirmed cases, but sources advise that the real number could be up to 10 times those detected. Health officials said a ""significant intervention"" could be needed after Christmas. Projections about Covid patient numbers were shown to ministers on Thursday but no further restrictions were announced. Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan said ""more clarity"" was needed on the link between the variant and hospitalisations. The executive is next expected to meet on Wednesday. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there could be a ""clearer picture"" then about the variant and any action that may be required. Allow Twitter content?

A document given to ministers on Thursday stated that action may be needed for a ""reasonable chance"" of keeping hospital inpatient numbers below 1,000. It outlined that a ""significant intervention"" would be needed ""immediately after Christmas"" to help the health service. The document also explained that it was likely that a peak in coronavirus case numbers would occur in the third week of January, with hospital admissions peaking in late January or February. The paper added: ""The extent of the hospital peak will depend on the severity of Omicron illness but without further measures is likely to exceed numbers observed earlier in the epidemic, potentially by several fold."" The 11,000 cases a day figure, which was described as a modelling projection and ""not a prediction"", was included in a series of graphs presented by Stormont's chief medical officer. It was described as the worst case scenario if no further restrictions are imposed, and the vaccine booster rate remains at current levels. Ministers were also told that hospitalisation figures could reach 4,000 by January on the current trajectory. But they were warned the figures were based on the current available data, and much more information will become available over the weekend. Speaking after the executive meeting, Mr Givan said Northern Ireland was behind the curve of Omicron cases being experienced elsewhere in the UK. He also said he had been ""encouraged"" by the level of uptake of the Covid-19 booster jabs. ""We don't panic, we continue to put into practice our public health, we be careful over the Christmas period and we get as much information as we can which will help inform the executive at our next meeting next week,"" he said. Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was not in the same position as last Christmas due to the vaccine programme Mr Givan said he wanted flexibility from the UK Treasury for the devolved regions to access coronavirus funding depending on their individual circumstances. He said: ""If we're not getting any more funding then we have to look at our existing resources,"" he said. Covid-19 vaccine certificates have been introduced for entry to some venues Further data will emerge from experience in England and Scotland in the next fortnight, where community transmission of the variant is more advanced. The paper received by ministers also said hospital admissions in Northern Ireland declined modestly in the past week but hospital occupancy remained at a ""relatively high"" level. Intensive care units occupancy and deaths declined modestly in the past week, it added. It warned that Omicron will become dominant around the final week of December, potentially with ""very large numbers of cases"". The chief medical officer has said he is more concerned than at any other time in the pandemic. Six more coronavirus-related deaths and another 2,237 casesof the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland on Thursday. The situation has been exacerbated by a shortage of nursing staff, withthe Belfast Telegraph reporting that 575 nurses left the health service,externalin Northern Ireland between June and October. The potential for a surge in Omicron cases has led the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) to warn that a crisis could be looming. ""What we're seeing are the outworkings of an exhausted and burnt-out group of people who have been trying to hold the service together for a long time,"" said Rita Devlin of the RCN. Booster jabs on offer to over 18s in NI from Monday What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""People have just reached the end of their tether,"" she continued. ""In a crisis situation you can keep going with no breaks and working overtime but only for a short time. ""Our nurses are saying... [there] just seems to be no end to it."" The Covid-19 booster jab programme in Northern Ireland will open to all age groups from Monday Earlier on Thursday an organisation representing the bar and restaurant sector saidthe industry was ""in freefall"" as a result of new Covid rules. Colin Neill, of Hospitality Ulster, said factors including the spread of the Omicron variant and speculation about new restrictions had led to many people cancelling Christmas bookings. He said the situation was ""unsustainable"" and he called for the Stormont executive to offer financial support. At Thursday's meeting of the executive, ministers were briefed on the spread of the Omicron variant in Northern Ireland. They also heard details of the plan for a rapid roll-out of Covid-19 booster vaccinations. BBC News NI understands that from Monday all adults in Northern Ireland will be able to get a booster vaccination as long as their last dose was administered at least three months ago. Staffing cover for schools, which have been affected by a rise in coronavirus cases, was also expected to be discussed.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon took questions from opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament. Ms Sturgeon says ahead of the session that Omicron will become the dominant variant of the virus in Scotland from Friday. 5,951 Covid cases were reported yesterday - with 45% of cases now showing the S-gene drop out that is indicative of Omicron. More than half of the adult population in Scotland has now had a booster jab. Guidance ahead of new regulations aimed at limiting the spread of the new variant has now been published. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross questioned why businesses were still waiting for the guidance this morning. BBC Scotland News Finally, the SNP's Jim Fairlie asks Ms Sturgeon to update parliament on the most recent Cobra meeting with the UK government. The first minister says that meeting was on Wednesday afternoon and was the second in a week. She says it is important that they happen and that yesterday's session was chaired by Michael Gove. She says that she, and the first ministers of Wales and Northern Ireland raised the point about the need for funding support. She hopes the PM and chancellor both engage directly in the meetings from now on as it is a ""serious"" situation we are facing.  Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane notes that in addition to the classic Covid symptoms of a cough, fever and loss or change in sense of taste and smell, more symptoms are being associated with the Omicron variant. He says this includes headaches, night sweats, muscle aches, extreme tiredness, a runny nose and scratchy throats. Dr Gulhane asks the first minister if she will consider asking the UK's chief medical officers to add these other symptoms to the criteria for a PCR test. Ms Sturgeon replies that this is a very good point. She says symptoms of Covid are constantly under review by experts. She adds that anyone who is concerned they might have Covid should go for a PCR test. SNP MSP Emma Harper asks the FM to join her in thanking all staff and volunteers for their ""stunning and braw"" efforts in making Scotland the first nation to give a booster to more than half of the adult population. Ms Sturgeon says all staff are doing ""heroic work"" and she ""cannot find the words"" to properly convey the depth of her appreciation and gratitude. She adds that as they build capacity, they need people to come forward, book their appointments and get us out of the other end of the challenge with Omicron. SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson says NHS Ayrshire and Arran has suspended all visiting despite the FM's statement on Tuesday that it was important for patients not to be isolated. Mr Gibson asks the first minister if she can take steps to ensure patients in Ayrshire can receive visitors this Christmas. Ms Sturgeon says that discussions have taken place with the health board and says she has been assured that this decision will be revised. She says that no one should be isolated in hospital over Christmas and reminds anyone seeing a loved one in hospital to take a lateral flow test ahead of any visits. Scottish pop band Deacon Blue have postponed the last two shows of their tour over concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid. Lead singer Ricky Ross tweeted that he was ""disappointed"" the authorities had not made any decision about live gigs. ""However it's clear to us Deacon Blue should not be playing and people shouldn't be asked to attend gigs just now,"" he said. Scottish Trad Music band Skerryvore also postponed their last five shows. Read the full story here One-way systems will be reintroduced While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has published its latest guidance for businesses and work spaces to deal with the pandemic. The details set outextra restrictions,externalin law and advice which come into force from one minute past midnight on Friday. They include the reintroduction of greater physical distancing in shops and supermarkets such as the installation of plastic screens and one-way systems where feasible at entry points and exits. In pubs, the guidance stops short of mandating table service for customers but does say it is ""strongly encouraged"". However what it calls ""major life events"" such as weddings and funerals are allowed to carry on without additional restrictions. On Tuesday, the first minister's set out a range of measures the Scottish government wanted to take to slow down the transmission of the Omicron variant. In some cases, she said changes would be made to the law to make these things enforceable. In other cases, she offered guidance. Find out what is guidance and what is law. Scotland has the toughest Covid rules and guidance in the UK at the moment. But Nicola Sturgeon announced said the Scottish government would have liked to go further. Read why Scotland doesn't have tougher Covid measures. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says businesses are anxious about the impact of Omicron and do not appreciate ""politics or bickering"". He urges the Scottish and UK governments to work together. Mr Sarwar then goes on to ask about cancer treatment, highlighting fears over cancer patients waiting for diagnosis and treatment. He asks the FM what she's doing to prevent a ""cancer catastrophe"". Ms Sturgeon says her government is working through investments into early diagnosis to make sure people get ""speedy"" treatment for cancer. However, she acknowledges that there is ""continued and increasing"" pressure on health services as a result of the pandemic. Cancer services will continue to be prioritised, she adds, but  acknowledges that they have been impacted. Mr Ross says businesses were still waiting this morning for guidance in order to comply with the First Minister's statement on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon says more detailed guidance will be online shortly, and that we are facing a variant of the virus spreading faster than anything we have seen so far, with an R number possibly above 4. She says ""we do not have time to waste"" on vaccination or in putting in place protective measures to slow this variant down.  Lives are at risk, livelihoods are at risk and the NHS is at risk. The UK government has to step up and provide the financial support that businesses need. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish government has revised its booster target down from 70,000 to 61,000 a day between now and the end of the year. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it would be enough to reach 80% of those eligible for the jab before January. Scotlandbroke its booster record on Wednesdaywith 54,104 jabs given. A speedy booster programme is considered vital in tackling the threat of the Omicron variant, which is much more infectious than other strains. A Public Health Scotland report has warned that the ""predicted exponential increases"" in Omicron cases could put ""significant pressure"" on hospitals in coming weeks. Read more Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross starts the questions. He says the vaccination scheme has delivered a booster to half of all 18-year-olds and thanks health staff, forces  and volunteers. He brings up the issue of mass vaccination centres as he has in previous weeks. He asks how many mass centres will reopen and start vaccinating people. Ms Sturgeon makes the point that someone vaccinated today will not have immune protection for several days. She says that no matter how fast the vaccines go, the variant runs faster. She says that while we speed up the vaccination programme, we must also act now to slow the virus. She runs through extra vaccination facilities including Hampden Park, Ingliston, Ravenscraig and EICC. She says more are under preparation. She hopes to get to the 70,000 a day she wants to get to, albeit by de-prioritising the flu vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon says she is concerned about the impact Omicron will have on businesses. She says there are ""simply no mechanisms available to the devolved administrations"" to offer the scale of financial support required. She calls for urgent action from the UK government. ""We must not sleepwalk into an emergency that for health and business will be much greater as a result of inaction than if we act firmly and strongly now,"" she says. Ms Sturgeon adds that she has asked to speak to the prime minister later today about financial support for businesses. The first minister outlines the consequences of not bringing infections under control, which she says will be significant. She stresses that - so far - there is no evidence that Omicron symptoms are milder. Many will still become severely unwell and die, and the sheer number of peole infected will still present a massive challenge, Ms Sturgeon says. ""If we don't act now, what we have feared all along but so far avoided  - the NHS being overwhelmed - could happen,"" she warns. She adds that it is a ""really serious"" situation. ""Please stay at home much more than you normally would and as much as is feasible,"" she implores the public. The FM says that Omicron is running faster than even the fastest rollout of vaccines  and says we must also act to slow the virus down. She says that hospital admissions are rising in London which is heavily affected by the variant. Ms Sturgeon says a surge in infections is impacting the NHS and is already causing staff absences which will affect essential services. She reiterated the current guidance - to limit contact with other people as much as possible. She also says that by acting to reduce community transmission we will help to keep schools open and protect education. Omicron will be the dominant Covid strain in Scotland by tomorrow, the first minister says. She is ""profoundly concerned"" by the challenge Omicron poses. 5,951 Covid cases were reported yesterday, the FM says. 45.4% of cases now show the S-gene drop out indicative of Omicron, she adds. ""It, therefore, seems likely that by tomorrow Omicron will be the dominant strain circulating in Scotland."" Theescalation of the Omicron variantis likely to dominate the opposition's questions today. Full updated guidance is due from the Scottish government as the vaccination booster programme is ramped up. Calls for help from the hospitality sectormay also merit discussion and the prospect of further restrictions around the festive period may also be mentioned. Labour's Anas Sarwarhas been championing the infection crisis at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital at FMQsof late, so that may also come up.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Omicron is spreading ""exceptionally fast"" in Scotland Further restrictions on ""high risk"" sectors may be unavoidable as Omicron surges across the country, Scotland's first minister has warned. In a letter to the prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon said urgent financial help was needed to protect businesses from the ""economic shock"". She said the huge number of people likely to be infected could overwhelm the NHS and other critical services. And she said more restrictions ""while undesirable, may now be unavoidable"". The Omicron variant is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus in Scotland by Friday. Some 45% of the 5,951 Covid cases reported across the country on Thursday were suspected to be the new variant. Hospitality 'takes Â£1bn hit' on Christmas parties Covid rules: What is advice and what is the law? Why doesn't Scotland have tougher Covid measures? Ms Sturgeon has urged people to reduce contact with other households ""as much as you possibly can"", with adviceto limit socialising to three householdsat a time in the run-up to Christmas amid fears of a ""tsunami"" of new infections. New regulations requiring shops and hospitality venues to reduce the spread of the virus will come into force on Friday, withguidance for businesses,externalpublished on Thursday afternoon. Firms will need to enforce physical distancing, cut down on crowding in shops and at bars, and enable staff to work from home wherever possible. In her letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ms Sturgeon said that failing to put financial support in place for businesses meant that the UK's economic recovery was being put at risk. She urged him to either re-establish the furlough scheme or give the devolved administrations the means to set up similar initiatives of their own. Ms Sturgeon added: ""The sheer number of people likely to be infected in the period ahead risks overwhelming the NHS and disabling the economy and other critical services. ""If left unchecked, Omicron will deliver a significant economic shock that will see lack of staff and pressure on already stressed supply chains lead directly to business failure."" She added: ""Frankly, if we do not get Omicron under control we are sacrificing the economic recovery we all want to see. ""If the Treasury does not provide financial compensation and protection, this result becomes all but inevitable."" Confirmed Omicron cases have increased dramatically in recent days The Scottish government announced Â£100m of its own funding for struggling businesses on Tuesday, but opposition parties said there was no timeline for then the money would be distributed. And they have accused the government of causing confusion over when guidance on the new rules for business would be issued - and when the rules will come into force. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This guidance has now, finally, been published. But there's still no word on when struggling small businesses will get the funding they desperately need to survive this difficult period. ""This is about people's jobs and their livelihoods. Nicola Sturgeon must commit to getting this vital cash to businesses before Christmas. ""Nicola Sturgeon is calling for more support from the UK government before she's even able to tell Scottish businesses when they'll get funding from her government."" Nicola Sturgeon has written to the UK government calling for ""urgent"" funding to support businesses The advice on limiting social gatherings is not enforceable in law, but Ms Sturgeon has said people should ""not think of it as optional"". However, there will be new legal requirements for businesses from Friday - a day sooner than the government had initially indicated. Guidance published on Thursday said firms should look at installing barriers or screens to ensure physical distancing and avoid bottlenecks at entrances and in corridors. It said the government would ""strongly encourage the use of table service where possible"", and that retail settings should use ""signs, floor markings and queue management systems to help people keep a safe distance from others"". New government guidance says shops should use ""queue management systems"" where possible Hospitality firms in Scotland say they have alreadytaken a Â£1bn hit because of advice to cancel work Christmas parties,and bars and restaurants say the effect of guidance to limit social interactions could be ""devastating"". Ms Sturgeon said she was ""acutely aware of and deeply concerned"" about the impact of advice on businesses. Scotland's Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has urged the UK government to provide around Â£500m immediately to help ""make a dent"" in grant support for Scottish businesses. She toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme: ""The greatest risk right now is that we wait too long, England goes into lockdown, something like furlough is reintroduced and suddenly it is available to Scottish businesses - but three or four weeks too late."" The UK government has made some funds available to the devolved administrations, although Scottish ministers say this has been brought forward from next year and had already been allocated within budgets. A UK government spokeswoman said the Treasury had ""given the devolved administrations the certainty they need to spend more money in the coming weeks"", and would continue to engage with them. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also said business owners were ""anxious"" about the future of their firms and workers. He said: ""What they will not appreciate is politics or bickering. What they will expect is for the Scottish and UK governments to work together in the national interest to protect people's lives and livelihoods."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Global uncertainty is having a direct effect on our finances in the UK, with prices rising and businesses juggling pressure from various issues. The impact of the war in Ukraine has an impact on petrol prices and the cost of everyday items. The economic uncertainty it creates is also making the Bank of England's decisions on rates trickier. The idea of raising interest rates is to keep those current and predicted price rises, measured by the rate of inflation, under control. In the face of global upheaval, this may be a relatively blunt tool. All eyes will be on the Bank's long-term strategy. For now, policymakers have increased interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5%, the third rate rise in four months. How high could UK interest rates go? Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. For households, that could mean higher mortgage costs, although - for the vast majority of homeowners - the impact is not immediate, and some will escape it entirely. An improvement on savings rates is likely to be far outweighed by the falling value of money put away. Recent years have seen an extraordinary period of cheap mortgages but, even before the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee began increasing interest rates in December, there were signs that the era of ultra-low mortgage rates was at an end. Some lenders have raised rates for those applying for a new home loan. However, brokers have predicted any rises in mortgage rates to be""slow and measured"", which would mean mortgages would stay cheap by historical standards for some time. It is a little-discussed fact that only about a third of adults have a mortgage. About a third rent their home, another third have either never had a mortgage or have paid it off. Those figures come from the English Housing Survey, which is geographically limited, but one of the most comprehensive guides available. Some 74% of mortgage borrowers in the UK are on fixed-rate deals, so would only see a change in their repayments when their current term ends, according to banking trade body UK Finance. About 1.5 million fixed-rate deals will expire this year, and another 1.5 million will do so in 2023. Of the remainder, 850,000 homeowners are on tracker deals, and the other 1.1 million are on standard variable rates (SVRs). They are the people likely to feel an immediate impact now the Bank rate has risen. The increase in the Bank rate to 0.75% means a typical tracker mortgage customer's monthly repayment will go up by Â£25.76. The typical SVR customer is likely to pay Â£15.96 more a month, UK Finance figures show. This is on top of similar rises in previous months. What are interest rates and why do they matter? UK prices rise at fastest rate in 10 years That means a further squeeze on household budgets at a time of rising bills and when people have been used to years of cheap borrowing and relatively slow-rising prices. Every mortgage applicant since 2014 would have needed to prove in a stress test that they can pay at a rate of about 6% or 7% - the idea being that a small rate rise may be uncomfortable, but not unmanageable, for homeowners. However, the Bank of England is planning to drop this requirement, with a consultation on the proposal closing in May. Any improvement in savings rates will have a very limited impact on the value of money tucked away, given that the spending power of these funds is being eaten away by inflation. Analysts warn that there is no guarantee of the higher Bank rate being reflected in better returns on savings. Savers are often borrowers too, but the money in the bank has effectively been falling in value for some time. Anna Bowes, of website Savings Champion, says it is ""really disappointing"" how slow a lot of providers have been to react to the Bank of England's base rate rises. People are receiving pennies in interest for every Â£100 they keep in savings for a year. A Bank rate rise will do little to change that scenario. The average interest rate for an easy-access account you can open today is 0.2%, up from 0.17% in December. For easy-access accounts closed to new customers, it is 0.26%, up from 0.22%. The highest paying easy-access account has an interest rate of 0.84%, up from 0.71% in December. In the past five years, the best easy access savings rate on the market was in September 2019, which paid 1.6%. Interest rates rise again to counter higher prices Slow rise from ultra-low mortgage rates predicted When will interest rates fall?

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The first drop in rates for more than four years came in August, followed by another in November. Some analysts predict another cut in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,rose by 2.6% in the 12 months to November 2024which was up from 2.3% in October. That means inflation is back above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The government's plans to borrow and spend billions which were set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgethave changed expectations. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskafter the Budget announcement thatthey will have to pay more National Insurance for their staff, which could also affect the economy. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. How the Budget will affect you and your money Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change would have an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.46%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.23%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row. Its key lending rate is now ina target range of 4.25% to 4.5%,but the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace next year.

Ms Sturgeon says ahead of the session that Omicron will become the dominant variant of the virus in Scotland from Friday. 5,951 Covid cases were reported yesterday - with 45% of cases now showing the S-gene drop out that is indicative of Omicron. More than half of the adult population in Scotland has now had a booster jab. Guidance ahead of new regulations aimed at limiting the spread of the new variant has now been published. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross questioned why businesses were still waiting for the guidance this morning. BBC Scotland News Finally, the SNP's Jim Fairlie asks Ms Sturgeon to update parliament on the most recent Cobra meeting with the UK government. The first minister says that meeting was on Wednesday afternoon and was the second in a week. She says it is important that they happen and that yesterday's session was chaired by Michael Gove. She says that she, and the first ministers of Wales and Northern Ireland raised the point about the need for funding support. She hopes the PM and chancellor both engage directly in the meetings from now on as it is a ""serious"" situation we are facing.  Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane notes that in addition to the classic Covid symptoms of a cough, fever and loss or change in sense of taste and smell, more symptoms are being associated with the Omicron variant. He says this includes headaches, night sweats, muscle aches, extreme tiredness, a runny nose and scratchy throats. Dr Gulhane asks the first minister if she will consider asking the UK's chief medical officers to add these other symptoms to the criteria for a PCR test. Ms Sturgeon replies that this is a very good point. She says symptoms of Covid are constantly under review by experts. She adds that anyone who is concerned they might have Covid should go for a PCR test. SNP MSP Emma Harper asks the FM to join her in thanking all staff and volunteers for their ""stunning and braw"" efforts in making Scotland the first nation to give a booster to more than half of the adult population. Ms Sturgeon says all staff are doing ""heroic work"" and she ""cannot find the words"" to properly convey the depth of her appreciation and gratitude. She adds that as they build capacity, they need people to come forward, book their appointments and get us out of the other end of the challenge with Omicron. SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson says NHS Ayrshire and Arran has suspended all visiting despite the FM's statement on Tuesday that it was important for patients not to be isolated. Mr Gibson asks the first minister if she can take steps to ensure patients in Ayrshire can receive visitors this Christmas. Ms Sturgeon says that discussions have taken place with the health board and says she has been assured that this decision will be revised. She says that no one should be isolated in hospital over Christmas and reminds anyone seeing a loved one in hospital to take a lateral flow test ahead of any visits. Scottish pop band Deacon Blue have postponed the last two shows of their tour over concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid. Lead singer Ricky Ross tweeted that he was ""disappointed"" the authorities had not made any decision about live gigs. ""However it's clear to us Deacon Blue should not be playing and people shouldn't be asked to attend gigs just now,"" he said. Scottish Trad Music band Skerryvore also postponed their last five shows. Read the full story here One-way systems will be reintroduced While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has published its latest guidance for businesses and work spaces to deal with the pandemic. The details set outextra restrictions,externalin law and advice which come into force from one minute past midnight on Friday. They include the reintroduction of greater physical distancing in shops and supermarkets such as the installation of plastic screens and one-way systems where feasible at entry points and exits. In pubs, the guidance stops short of mandating table service for customers but does say it is ""strongly encouraged"". However what it calls ""major life events"" such as weddings and funerals are allowed to carry on without additional restrictions. On Tuesday, the first minister's set out a range of measures the Scottish government wanted to take to slow down the transmission of the Omicron variant. In some cases, she said changes would be made to the law to make these things enforceable. In other cases, she offered guidance. Find out what is guidance and what is law. Scotland has the toughest Covid rules and guidance in the UK at the moment. But Nicola Sturgeon announced said the Scottish government would have liked to go further. Read why Scotland doesn't have tougher Covid measures. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says businesses are anxious about the impact of Omicron and do not appreciate ""politics or bickering"". He urges the Scottish and UK governments to work together. Mr Sarwar then goes on to ask about cancer treatment, highlighting fears over cancer patients waiting for diagnosis and treatment. He asks the FM what she's doing to prevent a ""cancer catastrophe"". Ms Sturgeon says her government is working through investments into early diagnosis to make sure people get ""speedy"" treatment for cancer. However, she acknowledges that there is ""continued and increasing"" pressure on health services as a result of the pandemic. Cancer services will continue to be prioritised, she adds, but  acknowledges that they have been impacted. Mr Ross says businesses were still waiting this morning for guidance in order to comply with the First Minister's statement on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon says more detailed guidance will be online shortly, and that we are facing a variant of the virus spreading faster than anything we have seen so far, with an R number possibly above 4. She says ""we do not have time to waste"" on vaccination or in putting in place protective measures to slow this variant down.  Lives are at risk, livelihoods are at risk and the NHS is at risk. The UK government has to step up and provide the financial support that businesses need. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish government has revised its booster target down from 70,000 to 61,000 a day between now and the end of the year. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it would be enough to reach 80% of those eligible for the jab before January. Scotlandbroke its booster record on Wednesdaywith 54,104 jabs given. A speedy booster programme is considered vital in tackling the threat of the Omicron variant, which is much more infectious than other strains. A Public Health Scotland report has warned that the ""predicted exponential increases"" in Omicron cases could put ""significant pressure"" on hospitals in coming weeks. Read more Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross starts the questions. He says the vaccination scheme has delivered a booster to half of all 18-year-olds and thanks health staff, forces  and volunteers. He brings up the issue of mass vaccination centres as he has in previous weeks. He asks how many mass centres will reopen and start vaccinating people. Ms Sturgeon makes the point that someone vaccinated today will not have immune protection for several days. She says that no matter how fast the vaccines go, the variant runs faster. She says that while we speed up the vaccination programme, we must also act now to slow the virus. She runs through extra vaccination facilities including Hampden Park, Ingliston, Ravenscraig and EICC. She says more are under preparation. She hopes to get to the 70,000 a day she wants to get to, albeit by de-prioritising the flu vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon says she is concerned about the impact Omicron will have on businesses. She says there are ""simply no mechanisms available to the devolved administrations"" to offer the scale of financial support required. She calls for urgent action from the UK government. ""We must not sleepwalk into an emergency that for health and business will be much greater as a result of inaction than if we act firmly and strongly now,"" she says. Ms Sturgeon adds that she has asked to speak to the prime minister later today about financial support for businesses. The first minister outlines the consequences of not bringing infections under control, which she says will be significant. She stresses that - so far - there is no evidence that Omicron symptoms are milder. Many will still become severely unwell and die, and the sheer number of peole infected will still present a massive challenge, Ms Sturgeon says. ""If we don't act now, what we have feared all along but so far avoided  - the NHS being overwhelmed - could happen,"" she warns. She adds that it is a ""really serious"" situation. ""Please stay at home much more than you normally would and as much as is feasible,"" she implores the public. The FM says that Omicron is running faster than even the fastest rollout of vaccines  and says we must also act to slow the virus down. She says that hospital admissions are rising in London which is heavily affected by the variant. Ms Sturgeon says a surge in infections is impacting the NHS and is already causing staff absences which will affect essential services. She reiterated the current guidance - to limit contact with other people as much as possible. She also says that by acting to reduce community transmission we will help to keep schools open and protect education. Omicron will be the dominant Covid strain in Scotland by tomorrow, the first minister says. She is ""profoundly concerned"" by the challenge Omicron poses. 5,951 Covid cases were reported yesterday, the FM says. 45.4% of cases now show the S-gene drop out indicative of Omicron, she adds. ""It, therefore, seems likely that by tomorrow Omicron will be the dominant strain circulating in Scotland."" Theescalation of the Omicron variantis likely to dominate the opposition's questions today. Full updated guidance is due from the Scottish government as the vaccination booster programme is ramped up. Calls for help from the hospitality sectormay also merit discussion and the prospect of further restrictions around the festive period may also be mentioned.

Join us again tomorrow - we'll have all the important updates on the Omicron variant and the wider pandemic throughout the day. Today's live page was written by Emma Harrison, Lauren Turner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Dulcie Lee and Adam Durbin. It was edited by Claire Heald, Alex Kleiderman and Kevin Ponniah. UK case numbers continued to climb rapidly today, with another 88,376 infections reported on Thursday - a record high for a second consecutive day The booster rollout is ramping up at pace - with a record 745,183 booster and third doses given out in the latest period Some 89% of people have had their first jab, 82% have had their second and 44% have now had their booster Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering that this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet Look up how many cases there are in your areahere. We'll be bringing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a close shortly. Here is a reminder of Thursday's main headlines:  US pharmaceutical firm Regeneron says its Covid-10 antibody
therapy is less potent against
the Omicron variant. In the US, the treatment â REGEN-COV â is used to treat Covid-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Ina statement,externalon Thursday, the company said its antibodies remain active against the Delta variant - currently the most
prevalent in the US. Regeneron added that it has confirmed that multiple ânext
generationâ antibodies it has identified, however, are active against Omicron,
Delta and âother variants of concernâ. âPending regulatory discussions, we anticipate entering the
clinic in the first quarter of 2022,â the statement said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although China was the first country to record cases of Covid-19 two years ago, it has only just today reach the milestone of 100,000 total cases. According to today's official statistics, there have now been exactly 100,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the country. China has a population of 1.4bn. This is pretty extraordinary when we factor in that these cases span two years, and the current rate of transmission in the UK means that this number of cases are being recorded within just two days (or less). The majority of these cases in China were recorded during the early stages of the pandemic. More than 50,000 Chinese cases were recorded in early 2020 in the central city of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified. Residents spent over two months confined to their homes so that transmission could be suppressed. China has managed to avoid subsequent large-scale outbreaks by introducing swift, sharp lockdowns. Chinaâs top medical specialists have projected that Chinaâs zero-Covid strategy may last until the end of spring 2022. The Queen usually attends church on Christmas Day - this year will be the first since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years More news now on the Queen, whoearlier cancelled her traditional pre-Christmas lunchfor extended family as a precautionary measure over soaring Omicron cases. Like many of us, her Christmas plans are up in the air, with her annual trip to Sandringham for Christmas also as yet undecided. All plans are said to be under review, and the palace will announce a decision when there is one. Read morehere. This video can not be played Teen urges young to get jab after fight for life A teenager has urged other young people to get the Covid vaccine after spending a week in hospital fighting for her life. Maisy Evans says she doesn't know if she will ever fully recover - as some days she feels pain and tiredness, but other days she is well. She says it was ""really scary"" but that no one knows why she was affected so badly. As cases rise sharply in the UK,France is shutting its border to British tourists, tightening the reasons for people to travel between the two states. Eurostar has criticised this ""sudden switching on and off of travel"". The train company says the rule change - which comes into force on Saturday evening - is at ""significant cost to people, businesses and the economy"". Eurostar told the BBC it's difficult to see the purpose of travel restrictions when a variant is already established. For those who need to change their plans, Eurostar is offering a free exchange system or e-voucher. Read our full story on the changeshere. Ian says it's going to be a tough Christmas We've been hearing about the problems being faced by businesses as Omicron cases rise in the UK. And some of you have been getting in touch telling us about your worries. Ian McGregor, runs Thai restaurant Star of Siam in Keswick, Cumbria, and has had many cancellations in the last 10 days. ""Some of the cancelled bookings have been big and the footfall in the town has not brought enough passing trade to cover the cancellations,"" he said. ""In the last week we have seen a sharp fall in our revenue and it looks as though we are heading for a tough Christmas trading period."" He says they're going to try to stay open as long as they can. Travel agent Wendy Haines, from Staffordshire, says she's seeing bookings cancelled. And while the hospitality industry has had support over the last two years, she thinks her industry is ""the most affected"" but ""the least supported"". ""I was on the phone to a client earlier who has no choice but to cancel her familyâs trip to Disneyland Paris, as France is effectively closing its borders,"" she said. ""The whole point in people going to France is to see the Christmas festivities â postponing to March for instance would not be the same. Unless customers travel, we donât get paid."" She's worried about what the next few months will bring. As businesses in the hospitality sector field phone calls - primarily to cancel bookings due to rising cases - theChancellor will return from a business trip in the US earlierthan planned. Opposition Labour MPs have been critical as he's been away in the US for work whilebusinesses struggle. Sunak said he understood it was a ""concerning time for businesses"" and the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to support lives and livelihoods. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics First the good: the booster campaign is
ramping up rapidly. Nearly 750,000 boosters were given yesterday, new figures confirm. But the race against the virus is on. The bad news is cases are continuing to rise rapidly: nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in a single day, up from close to 80,000 yesterday. Most of this is being driven
by London, where Omicron is furthest advanced, case rates are highest and
rising fastest. Hospital admissions are rising in the capital too. But, with cases of Omicron being detected across the UK, other parts of the country are likely to be facing the
same challenges in the near future. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has increased by 105,595 or 31.4% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased by 6% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were identified in the UK. A further 88,376 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There have also been another 146 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK reported 78,610 cases yesterday. Another 1,691 Omicron cases in
the UK have been identified, the UK Health and Security Agency says. This brings the total number of identified
Omicron cases to 11,708 â though experts warn the number is likely to be much
higher as the variant spreads rapidly. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We are waiting on the latest UK figures, but as Omicron coronavirus cases surge in the UK, more and more people are pondering their symptoms. If you have a runny nose or a headache it is possible that you have Covid, say researchers. The Zoe Covid study app,externalasks hundreds of thousands of people to log their symptoms. Investigators have been looking at ones linked to Delta and more recently Omicron and say the top five symptoms are: So how likely is it to be aCovid rather than a cold? Lead scientist Professor Tim Spector says: ""In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it's far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold. ""If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we've seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant variant already."" If you think you may have Covid, it is important to get tested. Even people who don't feel very ill can put others at risk. The NHS says people should still look out for classic Covid symptoms:  Israel has also been busy on the vaccine front. It's going to donate one million coronavirus vaccines to African countries, its foreign minister has said. Yair Lapid said the AstraZeneca doses would be distributed in the coming weeks under the international Covax scheme, designed to boost vaccine supplies to poorer nations around the world. ""I'm happy that Israel can contribute and be a partner in eradicating this pandemic from the world,""Lapid tweeted,external. The foreign ministry said the vaccines would go to nearly a quarter of African countries, though it did not specify which. Only about 7% of people in Africa have been vaccinated,the World Health Organization said last month,external- the
lowest rate of any continent. Gidi KleimanBBC News, Jerusalem We've head a lot from France today about new restrictions on UK travellers, but the country is not alone in taking action. Israel will designate the UK and Denmark as countries on
its Covid-19 âred listâ at midnight due to concern over the spread of the
Omicron variant. Israeli citizens and permanent residents are forbidden
from travelling to âredâ countries from Israel, unless they get permission from
the government. Travellers returning from a âredâ country are be taken to a
publicly-funded quarantine facility on arrival and must stay there until they
receive a negative PCR test result. They may then complete their seven days of isolation
at home. France, Spain, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and the United Arab
Emirates are expected to be added to the red list on Sunday. Most African nations are already on it. Israel closed its borders to almost all foreign nationals last month
in response to Omicron, just
weeks after they were reopened to vaccinated
travellers. Earlier this week, Health Minister Nitzan
Horowitz told reporters that Israel could not be âhermetically sealedâ, but
that it was possible to delay the spread of Omicron in the country. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent There's also news today that retired teachers in England will be brought in to assist schools struggling withCovid-related staffing problems, the education secretary says. Ina letter to schools,external, Nadhim Zahawi says he knows the availability of supply teachers is a ""particular issue"" - and he wants to make sure ""as many supply staff as possible are available"". Many schools in England have had to move individual classes and year groups online because of staffing issues. Of 75 local education authorities that responded to questions from the BBC, 35 said some classes had been forced to close. Lots cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to find supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. Zahawi's announcement comes after the government was quizzed in the Commons on Wednesday about why retired teaching staff were not being brought back to help schools, asretired medical professionals were last year. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Its a level of preparedness to chill any working parent, and downbeat news for pupils, but schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC some classes had moved online at local schools. The government says it is committed to ensuring that schools in England stay open in January. UK schools have been advised to reopen next term under current guidance. They have been planning for a number of scenarios - including remote learning and teaching in ""bubbles"" with staggered start and finish times.

Now, the government's advisory group on vaccines, the JCVI, is putting mums-to-be on the priority list for vaccines. It means they're given the same priority as those with certain health conditions. Research shows higher rates of premature birth linked to infection and some pregnant women with Covid have died. Vaccines are safe to have when pregnant and cut the risk of severe illness. Read more.

Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane notes that in addition to the classic Covid symptoms of a cough, fever and loss or change in sense of taste and smell, more symptoms are being associated with the Omicron variant. He says this includes headaches, night sweats, muscle aches, extreme tiredness, a runny nose and scratchy throats. Dr Gulhane asks the first minister if she will consider asking the UK's chief medical officers to add these other symptoms to the criteria for a PCR test. Ms Sturgeon replies that this is a very good point. She says symptoms of Covid are constantly under review by experts. She adds that anyone who is concerned they might have Covid should go for a PCR test. SNP MSP Emma Harper asks the FM to join her in thanking all staff and volunteers for their ""stunning and braw"" efforts in making Scotland the first nation to give a booster to more than half of the adult population. Ms Sturgeon says all staff are doing ""heroic work"" and she ""cannot find the words"" to properly convey the depth of her appreciation and gratitude. She adds that as they build capacity, they need people to come forward, book their appointments and get us out of the other end of the challenge with Omicron. SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson says NHS Ayrshire and Arran has suspended all visiting despite the FM's statement on Tuesday that it was important for patients not to be isolated. Mr Gibson asks the first minister if she can take steps to ensure patients in Ayrshire can receive visitors this Christmas. Ms Sturgeon says that discussions have taken place with the health board and says she has been assured that this decision will be revised. She says that no one should be isolated in hospital over Christmas and reminds anyone seeing a loved one in hospital to take a lateral flow test ahead of any visits. Scottish pop band Deacon Blue have postponed the last two shows of their tour over concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid. Lead singer Ricky Ross tweeted that he was ""disappointed"" the authorities had not made any decision about live gigs. ""However it's clear to us Deacon Blue should not be playing and people shouldn't be asked to attend gigs just now,"" he said. Scottish Trad Music band Skerryvore also postponed their last five shows. Read the full story here One-way systems will be reintroduced While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has published its latest guidance for businesses and work spaces to deal with the pandemic. The details set outextra restrictions,externalin law and advice which come into force from one minute past midnight on Friday. They include the reintroduction of greater physical distancing in shops and supermarkets such as the installation of plastic screens and one-way systems where feasible at entry points and exits. In pubs, the guidance stops short of mandating table service for customers but does say it is ""strongly encouraged"". However what it calls ""major life events"" such as weddings and funerals are allowed to carry on without additional restrictions. On Tuesday, the first minister's set out a range of measures the Scottish government wanted to take to slow down the transmission of the Omicron variant. In some cases, she said changes would be made to the law to make these things enforceable. In other cases, she offered guidance. Find out what is guidance and what is law. Scotland has the toughest Covid rules and guidance in the UK at the moment. But Nicola Sturgeon announced said the Scottish government would have liked to go further. Read why Scotland doesn't have tougher Covid measures. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says businesses are anxious about the impact of Omicron and do not appreciate ""politics or bickering"". He urges the Scottish and UK governments to work together. Mr Sarwar then goes on to ask about cancer treatment, highlighting fears over cancer patients waiting for diagnosis and treatment. He asks the FM what she's doing to prevent a ""cancer catastrophe"". Ms Sturgeon says her government is working through investments into early diagnosis to make sure people get ""speedy"" treatment for cancer. However, she acknowledges that there is ""continued and increasing"" pressure on health services as a result of the pandemic. Cancer services will continue to be prioritised, she adds, but  acknowledges that they have been impacted. Mr Ross says businesses were still waiting this morning for guidance in order to comply with the First Minister's statement on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon says more detailed guidance will be online shortly, and that we are facing a variant of the virus spreading faster than anything we have seen so far, with an R number possibly above 4. She says ""we do not have time to waste"" on vaccination or in putting in place protective measures to slow this variant down.  Lives are at risk, livelihoods are at risk and the NHS is at risk. The UK government has to step up and provide the financial support that businesses need. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish government has revised its booster target down from 70,000 to 61,000 a day between now and the end of the year. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it would be enough to reach 80% of those eligible for the jab before January. Scotlandbroke its booster record on Wednesdaywith 54,104 jabs given. A speedy booster programme is considered vital in tackling the threat of the Omicron variant, which is much more infectious than other strains. A Public Health Scotland report has warned that the ""predicted exponential increases"" in Omicron cases could put ""significant pressure"" on hospitals in coming weeks. Read more Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross starts the questions. He says the vaccination scheme has delivered a booster to half of all 18-year-olds and thanks health staff, forces  and volunteers. He brings up the issue of mass vaccination centres as he has in previous weeks. He asks how many mass centres will reopen and start vaccinating people. Ms Sturgeon makes the point that someone vaccinated today will not have immune protection for several days. She says that no matter how fast the vaccines go, the variant runs faster. She says that while we speed up the vaccination programme, we must also act now to slow the virus. She runs through extra vaccination facilities including Hampden Park, Ingliston, Ravenscraig and EICC. She says more are under preparation. She hopes to get to the 70,000 a day she wants to get to, albeit by de-prioritising the flu vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon says she is concerned about the impact Omicron will have on businesses. She says there are ""simply no mechanisms available to the devolved administrations"" to offer the scale of financial support required. She calls for urgent action from the UK government. ""We must not sleepwalk into an emergency that for health and business will be much greater as a result of inaction than if we act firmly and strongly now,"" she says. Ms Sturgeon adds that she has asked to speak to the prime minister later today about financial support for businesses. The first minister outlines the consequences of not bringing infections under control, which she says will be significant. She stresses that - so far - there is no evidence that Omicron symptoms are milder. Many will still become severely unwell and die, and the sheer number of peole infected will still present a massive challenge, Ms Sturgeon says. ""If we don't act now, what we have feared all along but so far avoided  - the NHS being overwhelmed - could happen,"" she warns. She adds that it is a ""really serious"" situation. ""Please stay at home much more than you normally would and as much as is feasible,"" she implores the public. The FM says that Omicron is running faster than even the fastest rollout of vaccines  and says we must also act to slow the virus down. She says that hospital admissions are rising in London which is heavily affected by the variant. Ms Sturgeon says a surge in infections is impacting the NHS and is already causing staff absences which will affect essential services. She reiterated the current guidance - to limit contact with other people as much as possible. She also says that by acting to reduce community transmission we will help to keep schools open and protect education. Omicron will be the dominant Covid strain in Scotland by tomorrow, the first minister says. She is ""profoundly concerned"" by the challenge Omicron poses. 5,951 Covid cases were reported yesterday, the FM says. 45.4% of cases now show the S-gene drop out indicative of Omicron, she adds. ""It, therefore, seems likely that by tomorrow Omicron will be the dominant strain circulating in Scotland."" Theescalation of the Omicron variantis likely to dominate the opposition's questions today. Full updated guidance is due from the Scottish government as the vaccination booster programme is ramped up. Calls for help from the hospitality sectormay also merit discussion and the prospect of further restrictions around the festive period may also be mentioned. Labour's Anas Sarwarhas been championing the infection crisis at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital at FMQsof late, so that may also come up. Good afternoon and welcome to our live coverage of first minister's questions. Nicola Sturgeon is due on her feet at noon.

Join us again tomorrow - we'll have all the important updates on the Omicron variant and the wider pandemic throughout the day. Today's live page was written by Emma Harrison, Lauren Turner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Dulcie Lee and Adam Durbin. It was edited by Claire Heald, Alex Kleiderman and Kevin Ponniah. UK case numbers continued to climb rapidly today, with another 88,376 infections reported on Thursday - a record high for a second consecutive day The booster rollout is ramping up at pace - with a record 745,183 booster and third doses given out in the latest period Some 89% of people have had their first jab, 82% have had their second and 44% have now had their booster Deaths remain stable - but it's worth remembering that this current spike in Omicron cases won't be reflected in these figures yet Look up how many cases there are in your areahere. We'll be bringing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a close shortly. Here is a reminder of Thursday's main headlines:  US pharmaceutical firm Regeneron says its Covid-10 antibody
therapy is less potent against
the Omicron variant. In the US, the treatment â REGEN-COV â is used to treat Covid-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Ina statement,externalon Thursday, the company said its antibodies remain active against the Delta variant - currently the most
prevalent in the US. Regeneron added that it has confirmed that multiple ânext
generationâ antibodies it has identified, however, are active against Omicron,
Delta and âother variants of concernâ. âPending regulatory discussions, we anticipate entering the
clinic in the first quarter of 2022,â the statement said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although China was the first country to record cases of Covid-19 two years ago, it has only just today reach the milestone of 100,000 total cases. According to today's official statistics, there have now been exactly 100,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the country. China has a population of 1.4bn. This is pretty extraordinary when we factor in that these cases span two years, and the current rate of transmission in the UK means that this number of cases are being recorded within just two days (or less). The majority of these cases in China were recorded during the early stages of the pandemic. More than 50,000 Chinese cases were recorded in early 2020 in the central city of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified. Residents spent over two months confined to their homes so that transmission could be suppressed. China has managed to avoid subsequent large-scale outbreaks by introducing swift, sharp lockdowns. Chinaâs top medical specialists have projected that Chinaâs zero-Covid strategy may last until the end of spring 2022. The Queen usually attends church on Christmas Day - this year will be the first since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years More news now on the Queen, whoearlier cancelled her traditional pre-Christmas lunchfor extended family as a precautionary measure over soaring Omicron cases.

Maisy Evans says she doesn't know if she will ever fully recover - as some days she feels pain and tiredness, but other days she is well. She says it was ""really scary"" but that no one knows why she was affected so badly. As cases rise sharply in the UK,France is shutting its border to British tourists, tightening the reasons for people to travel between the two states. Eurostar has criticised this ""sudden switching on and off of travel"". The train company says the rule change - which comes into force on Saturday evening - is at ""significant cost to people, businesses and the economy"". Eurostar told the BBC it's difficult to see the purpose of travel restrictions when a variant is already established. For those who need to change their plans, Eurostar is offering a free exchange system or e-voucher. Read our full story on the changeshere. Ian says it's going to be a tough Christmas We've been hearing about the problems being faced by businesses as Omicron cases rise in the UK. And some of you have been getting in touch telling us about your worries. Ian McGregor, runs Thai restaurant Star of Siam in Keswick, Cumbria, and has had many cancellations in the last 10 days. ""Some of the cancelled bookings have been big and the footfall in the town has not brought enough passing trade to cover the cancellations,"" he said. ""In the last week we have seen a sharp fall in our revenue and it looks as though we are heading for a tough Christmas trading period."" He says they're going to try to stay open as long as they can. Travel agent Wendy Haines, from Staffordshire, says she's seeing bookings cancelled. And while the hospitality industry has had support over the last two years, she thinks her industry is ""the most affected"" but ""the least supported"". ""I was on the phone to a client earlier who has no choice but to cancel her familyâs trip to Disneyland Paris, as France is effectively closing its borders,"" she said. ""The whole point in people going to France is to see the Christmas festivities â postponing to March for instance would not be the same. Unless customers travel, we donât get paid."" She's worried about what the next few months will bring. As businesses in the hospitality sector field phone calls - primarily to cancel bookings due to rising cases - theChancellor will return from a business trip in the US earlierthan planned. Opposition Labour MPs have been critical as he's been away in the US for work whilebusinesses struggle. Sunak said he understood it was a ""concerning time for businesses"" and the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to support lives and livelihoods. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics First the good: the booster campaign is
ramping up rapidly. Nearly 750,000 boosters were given yesterday, new figures confirm. But the race against the virus is on. The bad news is cases are continuing to rise rapidly: nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in a single day, up from close to 80,000 yesterday. Most of this is being driven
by London, where Omicron is furthest advanced, case rates are highest and
rising fastest. Hospital admissions are rising in the capital too. But, with cases of Omicron being detected across the UK, other parts of the country are likely to be facing the
same challenges in the near future. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has increased by 105,595 or 31.4% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased by 6% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were identified in the UK. A further 88,376 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There have also been another 146 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK reported 78,610 cases yesterday. Another 1,691 Omicron cases in
the UK have been identified, the UK Health and Security Agency says. This brings the total number of identified
Omicron cases to 11,708 â though experts warn the number is likely to be much
higher as the variant spreads rapidly. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We are waiting on the latest UK figures, but as Omicron coronavirus cases surge in the UK, more and more people are pondering their symptoms. If you have a runny nose or a headache it is possible that you have Covid, say researchers. The Zoe Covid study app,externalasks hundreds of thousands of people to log their symptoms. Investigators have been looking at ones linked to Delta and more recently Omicron and say the top five symptoms are: So how likely is it to be aCovid rather than a cold? Lead scientist Professor Tim Spector says: ""In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it's far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold. ""If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we've seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant variant already."" If you think you may have Covid, it is important to get tested. Even people who don't feel very ill can put others at risk. The NHS says people should still look out for classic Covid symptoms:  Israel has also been busy on the vaccine front. It's going to donate one million coronavirus vaccines to African countries, its foreign minister has said. Yair Lapid said the AstraZeneca doses would be distributed in the coming weeks under the international Covax scheme, designed to boost vaccine supplies to poorer nations around the world. ""I'm happy that Israel can contribute and be a partner in eradicating this pandemic from the world,""Lapid tweeted,external. The foreign ministry said the vaccines would go to nearly a quarter of African countries, though it did not specify which. Only about 7% of people in Africa have been vaccinated,the World Health Organization said last month,external- the
lowest rate of any continent. Gidi KleimanBBC News, Jerusalem We've head a lot from France today about new restrictions on UK travellers, but the country is not alone in taking action. Israel will designate the UK and Denmark as countries on
its Covid-19 âred listâ at midnight due to concern over the spread of the
Omicron variant. Israeli citizens and permanent residents are forbidden
from travelling to âredâ countries from Israel, unless they get permission from
the government. Travellers returning from a âredâ country are be taken to a
publicly-funded quarantine facility on arrival and must stay there until they
receive a negative PCR test result. They may then complete their seven days of isolation
at home. France, Spain, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and the United Arab
Emirates are expected to be added to the red list on Sunday. Most African nations are already on it. Israel closed its borders to almost all foreign nationals last month
in response to Omicron, just
weeks after they were reopened to vaccinated
travellers. Earlier this week, Health Minister Nitzan
Horowitz told reporters that Israel could not be âhermetically sealedâ, but
that it was possible to delay the spread of Omicron in the country. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent There's also news today that retired teachers in England will be brought in to assist schools struggling withCovid-related staffing problems, the education secretary says. Ina letter to schools,external, Nadhim Zahawi says he knows the availability of supply teachers is a ""particular issue"" - and he wants to make sure ""as many supply staff as possible are available"". Many schools in England have had to move individual classes and year groups online because of staffing issues. Of 75 local education authorities that responded to questions from the BBC, 35 said some classes had been forced to close. Lots cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to find supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. Zahawi's announcement comes after the government was quizzed in the Commons on Wednesday about why retired teaching staff were not being brought back to help schools, asretired medical professionals were last year. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Its a level of preparedness to chill any working parent, and downbeat news for pupils, but schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC some classes had moved online at local schools. The government says it is committed to ensuring that schools in England stay open in January. UK schools have been advised to reopen next term under current guidance. They have been planning for a number of scenarios - including remote learning and teaching in ""bubbles"" with staggered start and finish times.

Now, the government's advisory group on vaccines, the JCVI, is putting mums-to-be on the priority list for vaccines. It means they're given the same priority as those with certain health conditions. Research shows higher rates of premature birth linked to infection and some pregnant women with Covid have died. Vaccines are safe to have when pregnant and cut the risk of severe illness. Read more.

Lots cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to find supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. Zahawi's announcement comes after the government was quizzed in the Commons on Wednesday about why retired teaching staff were not being brought back to help schools, asretired medical professionals were last year. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Its a level of preparedness to chill any working parent, and downbeat news for pupils, but schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC some classes had moved online at local schools. The government says it is committed to ensuring that schools in England stay open in January. UK schools have been advised to reopen next term under current guidance. They have been planning for a number of scenarios - including remote learning and teaching in ""bubbles"" with staggered start and finish times.

"The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years, in response to calls to tackle surging price rises. The increase to 0.25% from 0.1% followed data this week that showed prices climbing at the fastest pace for 10 years. It came despite fears the Omicron variant could slow the economy by causing people to spend less. The Bank's action is set to increase the mortgage costs of some homeowners. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it needed to tackle strong inflationary pressures building up in the economy. Inflation is now running at 5.1%, the highest in a decade, and he expects it to rise further early next year. ""In the short term - that is, in the next two or three months - we think it can get to around 6%,"" he told the BBC. A rise in wholesale gas prices is still a big factor driving inflation, and that is continuing to push up domestic energy bills. But one business group said the interest rate rise would do little to stop prices going up, since costs were being pushed higher by global factors largely outside the Bank's control. The decision by the Bank of England will add just over Â£15 to the typical monthly repayment for a tracker mortgage customer. A standard variable rate mortgage-holder is likely to pay nearly Â£10 extra a month. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers may welcome news of higher rates, analysts warn there is no guarantee the higher Bank rate will lead to better returns on savings. Even if savings rates increase slightly, returns are still well below the rate of inflation. How will the interest rate rise affect you? How do interest rates affect your money? Why is the cost of living going up? The Bank says inflation could hit 6% next year The Bank can raise interest rates to help control price rises - but many experts had expected it to hold off because of uncertainty about Omicron. Yet on Thursday, it said the prices of global assets, such as stocks and bonds, had largely recovered after an initial fall triggered by news of the new variant. Successive waves of Covid also appeared to have had less impact on economic growth, the Bank added, although there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case this time. ""Consumer price inflation in advanced economies has risen by more than expected,"" the Bank said. The Omicron variant could reduce economic activity early next year, said the Bank, although it was unclear how much of an effect it would have on inflation worldwide. Mr Bailey told the BBC the Bank's rate-setters had thought ""long and hard"" about the impact of Omicron on economic activity before making their decision. ""But it is not at all clear if the impact [on the economy] could cause inflation to come down, or even go up,"" he said. The Bank of England seems to like a surprise. Last month, acknowledging the expectation of an interest rate rise happening, it held off. This month, with the main development being the spread of Omicron, it has raised at a time when most expected it to hold. It goes to show that the arguments have been finely balanced. The other development has been that inflation has hit even harder and even faster than expected. Six per cent is now the expected peak in the spring, which will represent the highest rate of inflation on the targeted CPI measure for 30 years. It is treble the Bank of England's target. While it is important to note that a 0.15% rise is modest and still leaves base rates very close to historic lows, it is not ideal that this comes at the precise moment where some forms of consumer confidence, especially in terms of going out, appear to be slumping. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was briefed by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and intriguingly chose to mention the possibility that Omicron could raise inflationary pressure by further hobbling supply chains for goods, and the supply of workers. The argument will be that it is better to nip expectations of inflation in the bud, than try to contain them once they get going. A rise now is preferable, in the eyes of the MPC, to having to rise by even more over the next year or two. The Bank is choosing to act on what it knows about inflation, rather than hold back on what it doesn't know about Omicron. Not at all. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 8-1 in favour of the increase. The dissenting MPC member, Silvana Tenreyro, voted to keep rates as they were. Rates had been at 0.1%, a record low, since March last year, when they were cut in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. It was the second month in a row that Bank policymakers had surprised the markets. Economists had expected a rate rise at the MPC's last meeting in November, but policymakers voted to hold fire. This time, analysts expected a further delay because of Omicron, but the committee thought differently. ""The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates was surprising, given mounting uncertainty over the economic impact of the Omicron variant,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. ""While today's rate increase may have little effect on most firms, many will view this as the first step in a longer policy movement - not as a partial reversal of last year's cut."" He added that the current inflationary spike was mostly driven by global factors, so higher interest rates would do little to curb further increases in inflation. Instead, the government needed to find practical solutions to the UK's supply chain problems and labour shortages, he said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the move suggested that the Bank had become ""a bit more hawkish"" and might now think rates need to rise further than before. ""The MPC once again said that a 'modest tightening' of monetary policy is likely to be necessary, so this is not looking like a case of one and done,"" he added. ""We still think that weaker economic growth and a faster fall in inflation will mean that interest rates won't rise to 1% by the end of next year, but it's just become more likely that they rise above our 0.5% forecast."" The MPC also voted unanimously to maintain the Bank's asset purchase scheme at Â£875bn. The last time the Bank raised interest rates was in August 2018, when they reached 0.75%. They were then cut twice in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Do you have a tracker mortgage and will now see your repayments rise?

Springsteen's commercial breakthrough came the following year, with the hit album Born To Run, trailed by its ambitious, wall-of-sound title track. Greeted by rapturous reviews, it sold nine million copies and saw Springsteen achieve the rare feat of appearing on the covers of Time and Newsweek magazine in the same week.

His biggest hit was 1985's Born In The USA, which sold 15 million copies in the US and 30 million worldwide. After such huge success, he stepped away from his longtime companions, The E Street Band and subsequent albums varied in quality, while his marriage to actress Julianne Phillips ended in divorce after the star fell for his backing singer (and current wife) Patti Scialfa.

"Boohoo bought the Karen Millen brand in 2019 Boohoo has said a surge in customers returning smarter clothes such as dresses is likely to hit its sales and profits this year. The online retailer said it had sold an ""exceptionally high"" proportion of dresses in the quarter to November. A Boohoo spokeswoman said people were more likely to return expensive clothing from its brands such as Karen Millen and Coast. It added overseas delivery delays and higher shipping costs will hit profits. As a result, Boohoo now expects earnings to grow by 6-7% in the year to February, compared to previous forecasts of a 9-9.5% increase, and has nearly halved its forecast for sales growth. The news sentshares in Boohoodown by about 15%. Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Boohoo's results this morning seem to back up UK Chief Medical Officer Christ Whitty's assumption that people are de-prioritising some social gatherings in light of the Omicron variant. ""The fast-fashion clothing retailer saw return rates spike in the UK, with an exceptionally high mix of dresses being sent back."" Boohoo said it had seen ""significantly higher returns rates impacting net sales growth and costs, with continued extended delivery times impacting international demand"". The firm saw UK sales rise over the three months to 30 November, but sales fell sharply in Europe, the US and the rest of the world. Boohoo said it expected freight costs to the UK to be about Â£20m higher this year, while consumer uncertainty and delivery delays were hampering European and overseas trade. It said it was having to deliver all international sales through its UK distribution network due to shipping and air freight disruption, which was leading to lengthy customer delivery delays. John Lyttle, group chief executive, said international sales had been hit by ""ongoing service disruption due to the pandemic"" which, added to higher consumer uncertainty due to the spread of the Omicron variant, had dragged on its performance. But he expected sales to get better as ""pandemic-related disruption begins to ease"". Ms Hoy at Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""Management believes the issues are transient and we're inclined to agree - but the question on everyone's mind these days is what exactly 'transient' means. ""The supply chain bottle necks and cost inflation aren't going to last forever, but another year coping with this kind of disruption would be disastrous for the retail sector, Boohoo included."" Boohoo has expanded significantly in recent years. It acquired Karen Millen and Coast in 2019, bought Warehouse the following year and more recently took over the brand and website of failed department store chain Debenhams.

"Valerie, who is seven months pregnant, was left despondent by a long wait for a booster Pregnant women say they are queuing for hours at busy vaccination centres for a booster jab, despite being at greater risk from Covid-19 if seriously ill. All adults in England, Scotland and Wales have been offered a booster by the end of 2021. Pregnant women have not been prioritised, but doctors say they should be first in line to protect them and their babies against Omicron. The NHS is urging people to book a jab appointment to avoid waiting in queues. And the UK's vaccine advisory committee, the JCVI, said women who were pregnant and already had two vaccine doses were included in the accelerated booster programme. However, the charity Pregnant Then Screwed said thousands of pregnant women had ""encountered unnecessary barriers"" which had ""left many without the protection they need"". Valerie van Mulukom, who lives in Oxford, and is 32 weeks pregnant, cycled 30 minutes to her nearest walk-in centre this week because she was worried boosters would run out. She was left ""absolutely despondent"" by having to queue outside for one-and-a-half hours, while suffering with pelvic pain and feeling increasingly thirsty and hungry. She was then allowed to wait in line indoors which made her tense because of the risk of infection. ""I've only eaten inside a restaurant twice in the past two years,"" she says. ""I'm so worried about my own health and the health of my baby. I feel like I constantly need to fight to be looked after. ""We are clinically vulnerable - why are we being ignored?"" Valerie asks. Mums who had Covid urge pregnant women to get jabs Covid vaccines safe in pregnancy, data shows Stillbirth risk may increase with Covid Jane (not her real name), who is 34 weeks pregnant with her first child, told the BBC she also waited for an hour-and-a-half in Belfast to get her booster. Despite being ""massive"" and stewards counting people waiting in line, she wasn't invited to move to the front. ""I would have appreciated it,"" she says. ""If I test positive I'll end up going into hospital by myself."" Most pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid in the UK are not vaccinated On social media, pregnant women have talked about waiting in the cold with young children, having no access to toilets and feeling faint after being on their feet for too long. Some vaccination centres are allowing pregnant women to jump the queue but because of high demand, official NHS advice is to book a booster to avoid disappointment. All adults in the UK aged over 18 are being offered a booster vaccine three months after their second dose, althoughbooking arrangements vary across the four nations. It's in response to fears over the heavily-mutated variant Omicron,which is spreading rapidly in the UKand could lead to a large wave of infections. Studies have found boosters are needed to give the best protection - up to 75% - against infection,but two vaccine doses are still thought to protect against serious illness from Covid. Dr Mary Ross-Davie, from the Royal College of Midwives, said: ""Because of the increased risk of Covid to women and their babies, it's vital that pregnant women are now prioritised and encouraged to take up their vaccine and booster dose."" She added: ""Setting up vaccination sites close to antenatal clinics is a great way to encourage uptake, but they must be staffed by vaccinators and not take midwives away from their core work, particularly in the light of workforce shortages in maternity services."" Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said they were ""disappointed"" that pregnant women have not been prioritised for the booster vaccine. He said more than half of pregnant women who catch Covid-19 do not develop symptoms. But pregnant women who do develop severe symptoms are more likely to have pregnancy complications, including having a stillbirth and giving birth prematurely - although the numbers are still very low. JCVI chairman Prof Wei Shen Lim said: ""A high proportion of women who are pregnant remain unvaccinated. These women are at higher risk from Covid-19 than those who are vaccinated. ""The latest data continue to show a good safety record from Covid-19 vaccine use in pregnant women. ""We strongly encourage pregnant women to come forward and get their first and second vaccine doses."" A recent survey of 4,000 pregnant women by Pregnant Then Screwed found nearly three-quarters had received two doses of a vaccine, but official data suggests the figure could be much lower. Many still appear to be confused on the advice around vaccines. In the survey, 42% said a health professional had made them question the safety of the vaccine, while one in five said they felt judged by a doctor, nurse or midwife for wanting to have a vaccine. A recent report shows that more than 98% of pregnant women who are admitted to hospital are unvaccinated. Mums who had Covid urge pregnant women to get jabs Covid vaccines safe in pregnancy, data shows Rise in unvaccinated pregnant women ill with Covid Covid unlocking risk for pregnant women, say doctors Stillbirth risk may increase with Covid Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and pregnancy RCM - A professional organisation and trade union dedicated to serving the whole midwifery team Pregnant Then Screwed - Pregnant Then Screwed Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"This afternoon's No 10 press conference was a gloomy affair. The increase in the Omicron variant that we'd barely heard of a fortnight ago is so steep it was almost a straight line on one of Prof Chris Whitty's famous graphs. The number of Covid cases reported on Wednesday was the highest yet during the pandemic. You read that right: the highest ever during these tough two years. While there is so much we don't yet know about the severity of the Omicron variant itself, and it's impossible to be clear about its precise effect, the sheer number of cases is mind-boggling to contemplate. New UK cases record as Whitty warns 'more to come' Will tougher measures stop the spread of Omicron? Even if, crossing every finger, the number of deaths remains low because of vaccinations, we are looking at a likely period of serious disruption to much of our lives. And the message from England's top doctor was clear. He was at pains to repeat it several times: in the run-up to Christmas, stay at home unless it really matters. His language about ""prioritising"" or ""de-prioritising"" events might have been less blunt. But under repeated questioning that was the clear implication. That's not, though, a message the prime minister was willing, or perhaps able, to repeat. The political pressure on him not to introduce more restrictions is intense after 100 of his backbenchers stuck two fingers up at him on Tuesday night byvoting against part of his pandemic plan. But Prof Whitty's message will likely be heard loud and clear: what we all do in the next few days and weeks will make a difference to how fast the pandemic spreads. His call is already alarming the hospitality industry. Without official closures or limits there won't be extra financial help, at least not at this stage. But the message from the press conference is bound to lead to empty tables, and less custom. MPs will inevitably start to question the fairness of that. Once again, Number 10 is in the grip of a fast-moving crisis with consequences not just for the country's health but for the economy, and the nation's wealth too.

"With Covid cases at record levels and rising, employers are bracing for large numbers of workers to call in sick. The Strats Homes lettings agency is being harder-hit than most.

And with the UK Health Security Agencyâs chief executive Jenny Harries warning of a âstaggeringâ number of cases in coming days, itâs likely that many other businesses will follow. Strats Homes in Hatfield would normally be busy at this time of year, letting properties for students at the University of Hertfordshire. âItâs really stressful because itâs Christmas next week and everyone is coming down with Covid,â says Ms Stratis. âFour maintenance people, five in the office, one by one they have all been testing positive. âThree of us are managing everything. We have had to lock our doors, and weâve switched to doing everything remotely."" The company has told tenants they canât fix anything because all maintenance staff are currently off work. Strats Homes main office At Copy Concept in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, it's a similar story. Director Richard Burmo has tested positive, but feels he had to keep working to keep the business going. Mr Burmo sells art supplies, stationery and gifts, and also offers printing and copying services. His symptoms havenât been too serious so he has kept working alone in his closed shop doing jobs for delivery and mail order customers. But any walk-in trade has been lost, and his two employees canât risk exposure by coming to work. âItâs not very helpful,â he says. Increased absences have forced bus and train companies to cut services, and the impact of Covid is only going to get worse, according to the RMT union. The union, which represents transport workers, is warning there will be a ""significant impact"" on services with infections predicted to grow further over Christmas and New Year. Last weekend, ScotRail cancelled a number of trains, mainly in the central belt of Scotland, after 113 staff tested positive, including 37 drivers. The company is considering operating a reduced timetable if it is hit by another significant rise in Covid cases. Meanwhile, Stagecoach has confirmed some of its bus services have been affected by workers being off sick. However, the firm said it was ""continuing to run the vast majority of services as planned"". According to the Rail Delivery Group, train operators across the UK currently have 7.5% of staff absent due to all causes including Covid. Gary Grant, chief executive of toy retailer The Entertainer, which sells one in 10 of the UK's toys, also said that more staff in the business were testing positive with Covid now than since the pandemic began. The toy chain had also experienced a 20% fall in footfall, according to Mr Grant, but those coming into shops were spending more money, in order to get presents in time for Christmas and avoid delivery delays. The government, he explained, had done ""amazing things"" with furlough support and business rates during the pandemic which he said he wants them to look into again. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the NHS Trusts he represents were âdefinitely beginning to see numbers of staff having to take time off and be absent from work because of Covid increase"". He told BBC Radio 4âs World at One that trusts were making plans for significant numbers of staff being off. Elsewhere, 3,000 pupils in England have been off because their schools were shut because of Covid, according to the Department for Education, but with the Christmas holidays a few days away, schools will soon get some respite. Ministers have said they will try toreopen schools as normal in January, but if that doesnât happen more workers may have to take time off to look after children, which might add to the absence problem. Meanwhile, Royal Mail has confirmed that absence is attwice pre-pandemic levels, though it insists deliveries are running as normal. The Lion King was one of the West End shows which had to cancel some performances due to Covid Football matches have been cancelled following arecord number of positive testsamong Premier League clubs, with Leicester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Watford all having to postpone games. A number ofWest End showsincluding the Lion King have also cancelled performances following positive tests among cast and crew. Representatives of industries which were hit hard in the summer, when many workers had to self-isolate during the so-called ""pingdemic"", such as meat processors and car makers, said their members had not been reporting problems so far. And after dealing with the pandemic for nearly two years, many business leaders feel they are as well placed as they can be to deal with whatever the new wave throws at them. Richard Norrington, chief executive of the Suffolk Building Society, said he is confident the business can keep going despite the new rise in cases. Most of his 100 head office staff are equipped with laptops to work from home, so he doesnât think itâs likely that a significant proportion would be off work at once. âI would expect a few branch closures, but they will be deep-cleaned and reopened, usually the next day,â he says. âAm I concerned? Yes. But I am also calm.â New UK cases record as Whitty warns worse to come Some schools battling to stay open as cases rise Top theatres cancel shows after Covid outbreaks Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although China was the first country to record cases of Covid-19 two years ago, it has only just today reach the milestone of 100,000 total cases. According to today's official statistics, there have now been exactly 100,000 confirmed cases of the virus in the country. China has a population of 1.4bn. This is pretty extraordinary when we factor in that these cases span two years, and the current rate of transmission in the UK means that this number of cases are being recorded within just two days (or less). The majority of these cases in China were recorded during the early stages of the pandemic. More than 50,000 Chinese cases were recorded in early 2020 in the central city of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified. Residents spent over two months confined to their homes so that transmission could be suppressed. China has managed to avoid subsequent large-scale outbreaks by introducing swift, sharp lockdowns. Chinaâs top medical specialists have projected that Chinaâs zero-Covid strategy may last until the end of spring 2022. The Queen usually attends church on Christmas Day - this year will be the first since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years More news now on the Queen, whoearlier cancelled her traditional pre-Christmas lunchfor extended family as a precautionary measure over soaring Omicron cases.

Ian says it's going to be a tough Christmas We've been hearing about the problems being faced by businesses as Omicron cases rise in the UK. And some of you have been getting in touch telling us about your worries. Ian McGregor, runs Thai restaurant Star of Siam in Keswick, Cumbria, and has had many cancellations in the last 10 days. ""Some of the cancelled bookings have been big and the footfall in the town has not brought enough passing trade to cover the cancellations,"" he said. ""In the last week we have seen a sharp fall in our revenue and it looks as though we are heading for a tough Christmas trading period."" He says they're going to try to stay open as long as they can. Travel agent Wendy Haines, from Staffordshire, says she's seeing bookings cancelled. And while the hospitality industry has had support over the last two years, she thinks her industry is ""the most affected"" but ""the least supported"". ""I was on the phone to a client earlier who has no choice but to cancel her familyâs trip to Disneyland Paris, as France is effectively closing its borders,"" she said. ""The whole point in people going to France is to see the Christmas festivities â postponing to March for instance would not be the same. Unless customers travel, we donât get paid."" She's worried about what the next few months will bring. As businesses in the hospitality sector field phone calls - primarily to cancel bookings due to rising cases - theChancellor will return from a business trip in the US earlierthan planned. Opposition Labour MPs have been critical as he's been away in the US for work whilebusinesses struggle. Sunak said he understood it was a ""concerning time for businesses"" and the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to support lives and livelihoods. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics First the good: the booster campaign is
ramping up rapidly. Nearly 750,000 boosters were given yesterday, new figures confirm. But the race against the virus is on. The bad news is cases are continuing to rise rapidly: nearly 90,000 cases have been reported in a single day, up from close to 80,000 yesterday. Most of this is being driven
by London, where Omicron is furthest advanced, case rates are highest and
rising fastest. Hospital admissions are rising in the capital too. But, with cases of Omicron being detected across the UK, other parts of the country are likely to be facing the
same challenges in the near future. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has increased by 105,595 or 31.4% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week, according to the government figures. The number of daily deaths reported has decreased by 6% in the last seven days, compared to the previous week. But it's worth remembering that it takes time for hospital admissions and deaths to show up in the figures after cases start to rise. And it's only been a few weeks since the first Omicron cases were identified in the UK. A further 88,376 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There have also been another 146 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The UK reported 78,610 cases yesterday. Another 1,691 Omicron cases in
the UK have been identified, the UK Health and Security Agency says. This brings the total number of identified
Omicron cases to 11,708 â though experts warn the number is likely to be much
higher as the variant spreads rapidly. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online We are waiting on the latest UK figures, but as Omicron coronavirus cases surge in the UK, more and more people are pondering their symptoms. If you have a runny nose or a headache it is possible that you have Covid, say researchers. The Zoe Covid study app,externalasks hundreds of thousands of people to log their symptoms. Investigators have been looking at ones linked to Delta and more recently Omicron and say the top five symptoms are: So how likely is it to be aCovid rather than a cold? Lead scientist Professor Tim Spector says: ""In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it's far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold. ""If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we've seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant variant already."" If you think you may have Covid, it is important to get tested. Even people who don't feel very ill can put others at risk. The NHS says people should still look out for classic Covid symptoms:  Israel has also been busy on the vaccine front. It's going to donate one million coronavirus vaccines to African countries, its foreign minister has said. Yair Lapid said the AstraZeneca doses would be distributed in the coming weeks under the international Covax scheme, designed to boost vaccine supplies to poorer nations around the world. ""I'm happy that Israel can contribute and be a partner in eradicating this pandemic from the world,""Lapid tweeted,external. The foreign ministry said the vaccines would go to nearly a quarter of African countries, though it did not specify which. Only about 7% of people in Africa have been vaccinated,the World Health Organization said last month,external- the
lowest rate of any continent. Gidi KleimanBBC News, Jerusalem We've head a lot from France today about new restrictions on UK travellers, but the country is not alone in taking action. Israel will designate the UK and Denmark as countries on
its Covid-19 âred listâ at midnight due to concern over the spread of the
Omicron variant. Israeli citizens and permanent residents are forbidden
from travelling to âredâ countries from Israel, unless they get permission from
the government. Travellers returning from a âredâ country are be taken to a
publicly-funded quarantine facility on arrival and must stay there until they
receive a negative PCR test result. They may then complete their seven days of isolation
at home. France, Spain, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and the United Arab
Emirates are expected to be added to the red list on Sunday. Most African nations are already on it. Israel closed its borders to almost all foreign nationals last month
in response to Omicron, just
weeks after they were reopened to vaccinated
travellers. Earlier this week, Health Minister Nitzan
Horowitz told reporters that Israel could not be âhermetically sealedâ, but
that it was possible to delay the spread of Omicron in the country. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent There's also news today that retired teachers in England will be brought in to assist schools struggling withCovid-related staffing problems, the education secretary says. Ina letter to schools,external, Nadhim Zahawi says he knows the availability of supply teachers is a ""particular issue"" - and he wants to make sure ""as many supply staff as possible are available"". Many schools in England have had to move individual classes and year groups online because of staffing issues. Of 75 local education authorities that responded to questions from the BBC, 35 said some classes had been forced to close. Lots cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to find supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. Zahawi's announcement comes after the government was quizzed in the Commons on Wednesday about why retired teaching staff were not being brought back to help schools, asretired medical professionals were last year. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent Its a level of preparedness to chill any working parent, and downbeat news for pupils, but schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC some classes had moved online at local schools.

"Schools across the UK are being advised to reopen next term. Schools across the UK say they are prepared to switch to online learning if they have to next term, as more children stay at home because of Covid. Some children are being asked to take laptops home with them before Christmas in preparation. More than 30 local authorities told the BBC that some classes had moved online at schools. The government says it is committed to ensuring that schools in England stay open in January. UK schools have been advised to reopen next term under current guidance - although in Wales, staff will have two days at the start of term to plan any additional measures needed for pupils' return. Schools have been planning for a number of scenarios - including remote learning and teaching in ""bubbles"" with staggered start and finish times. Retired teachers in England will be brought in to assist schools that are struggling with Covid-related staffing problems. Are you a retired teacher returning? Share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external In England,the latest data shows236,000 pupils were out of school for Covid-related reasons on Thursday 9 December. This is an increase of 13% on the last time the snapshot survey of school attendance was taken, two weeks earlier. Jo Franklin says teachers are worried about the impact of Omicron on children's learning In east London, children at two primary schools managed by the Letta Trust will be sent home with their laptops when they break up for Christmas, in case they cannot come back for the start of next term. Jo Franklin, head of the trust, said all classes had managed to stay open, but added: ""This picture is changing on a daily basis. We've had seven new staff cases so far this week. ""Teachers are making sure that everything they plan to teach in the first week of the new term can be taught remotely if it needs to be,"" she said. Among other contingency plans are timetables specially created in case classes need to be taught in ""bubbles"" next term. Ms Franklin said she was concerned about staff being off sick in the new year. ""Some people are telling us that they are having problems booking a booster, with no appointments available until mid-January,"" she said. ""There will come a point when we cannot safely keep classes open."" Vulnerable children are also being provided with laptops before Christmas in Kingston upon Thames. Not many schools have had to close early before Christmas because of Covid. Those that have include one in York, one in Hillingdon and two in Leicestershire, whilesome in five parts of Waleshave opted to move to online learning. However, a larger number of schools have had to move individual classes online. Of 75 local education authorities that responded to questions from the BBC on Wednesday, 35 said some classes had been forced to close. Many cited staff being off sick or isolating, and not being able to get supply teachers to replace them. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said this week he knew of schools which have had 25% of staff absent. On Thursday, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawisaid the government would help,externalretired teachers in England register with supply agencies. He called it ""the best way to boost the temporary workforce available to the sector"". Will schools have to close again? Some schools battling to stay open as cases rise Many local authorities told the BBC that schools already had contingency plans in place for January, and had become well prepared to switch to remote learning after the past two years. In some areas, councils are meeting with head teachers before the start of term in January to assess which measures are needed. A spokeswoman for Southampton City Council said some schools were ""postponing their return date by one to two days to ensure a thorough testing programme is in place to enable them to welcome students back safely"". ""The situation is under constant review, and we are on stand-by to support schools in implementing any new guidance,"" she added. In Wales, Powys County Council said staggered start and finish times for class ""bubbles"" was among the plans that could be implemented if necessary - with ""blended learning"" as a last resort. In Scotland, North Lanarkshire Council said contingency plans were already in place, and a programme of planned online learning could be used where necessary. Parents may be getting flashbacks as ministers insist all schools in England will open in January, while other politicians warn they may not. The booster campaign is in full swing giving more protection to adults. Yet barely half of teenagers have received one jab. But bubbles of whole year groups have gone, so only close contacts identified by NHS Test and Trace will be asked to do lateral flow tests for seven days. In the meantime they can attend school after a negative test. By far the biggest challenge is staff. Whatever ministers say, if a school doesn't have enough teachers, and can't get supply teachers, they may have to send pupils home to learn remotely. The Department for Education has said it is committed to keeping schools and colleges open because ""the classroom is the very best place for children and young people's development"". Education minister Alex Burghart told MPs on Wednesday that the government was putting measures in place to ""make sure that we have the best chance for the start of a normal school term"" in England. He said testing on return to school, vaccination uptake, ventilation in classrooms and hygiene measures would ensure in-person teaching could continue - and that the booster vaccination programme would be ""key"". Older pupils and staff are alsobeing asked to wear face coveringsin communal settings. However, Robert Halfon, Conservative chairman of the Education Select Committee, said it looked as though England was ""moving, sadly, towards de facto school closures"". Labour's shadow schools minister Stephen Morgan said there was ""a race against time to protect children's health and education"". He also called on the government to guarantee that all 12 to 15-year-olds can get vaccinated over the holidays. In Wales, education minister Jeremy Miles said schools and colleges would be able to take two ""planning days"" at the start of the spring term. ""This will allow time for schools to assess staffing capacity and put the necessary measures in place to support the return of all learners,"" he said. He added that schools would be able ""to operate staggered start and finish times from the start of the new term"" if they decided that was appropriate. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants schools to remain open ""if at all possible"" to limit any further disruption. In Northern Ireland, a teaching union has called for a ""staggered"" return of pupils to school. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said schools making contingency plans was the ""sensible and responsible thing to do"". ""The government needs to think very carefully about the mitigations it needs to take to keep schools open next term,"" he added - citing ventilation in classrooms as ""crucial"".

"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line EU leaders have warned Russia that action against Ukraine will result in ""massive consequences"" and a ""severe cost"" amid worries over the build-up of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border. The message, which came after the last European Council summit of the year in Brussels, also mentioned possible ""restrictive measures"" against Russia, but no detail has been released. However, the bloc also encouraged more diplomacy with Moscow. The Kremlin denies it plans to attack. Western intelligence services believe up to 100,000 Russian troops are massed near Ukraine's borders. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether President Vladimir Putin has made a decision. ""Any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe cost in response, including restrictive measures co-ordinated with partners,"" EU leaders said in a statement, referring to the US and UK. After the summit, Ursula von der Leyen, the chief of the European Commission, which is the EU executive, said the bloc was ready to impose additional sanctions on Russia. The EU's current restrictions were in response to Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. It is not yet clear what the threatened sanctions package may include. A possible target is Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany not yet in operation. Reports suggest Russia could also be disconnected from the Swift global financial payment system. The leaders also expressed their support for the return of a four-way dialogue between Paris, Berlin, Kyiv and Moscow, known as the Normandy format. CONTEXT:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ANALYSIS:What would be the fallout if Russia invaded Ukraine? The warning from the EU came as Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia was increasing, not reducing, its troops on the border. He said there were ""combat-ready troops, tanks, artillery, armoured units, drones [and] electronic warfare systems"". A Ukrainian serviceman keeps watch at a position on the frontline with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine Speaking on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would prefer sanctions to be imposed immediately, before Russia acts, adding that measures after an escalation of hostilities ""no longer interest anyone"". Ukraine, which is not a member of the EU or Nato, shares borders with both the EU and Russia, with which it has deep social and cultural ties. Russia wants legally binding guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to its border. Nato says its activities are defensive and that no country can veto Ukraine's hopes of joining the alliance. Russia has accused Ukraine of provocations and President Putin said this week that the treatment of Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels control territory, looked like genocide.

"Business groups are increasing pressure on the government to assist firms suffering from the rise in Covid cases. The CBI urged ministers to provide support ""in lockstep with future restrictions"", while UK Hospitality called for business rates to be deferred and VAT discounts extended. The spread of the Omicron variant has hit consumer confidence and seen hospitality bookings cancelled. Labour urged further support for firms, but the government has so far declined. But the chancellor will meet with representatives from the hospitality sector on Thursday to discuss their concerns. 'One by one they have all been testing positive' 'I've had 3,200 bookings cancelled at my pubs' What are the Christmas rules this year? The UK government and devolved administrations have not placed any additional restrictions on businesses, such as lockdowns or reduced group sizes for restaurants or bars, but many firms have seen a collapse in customers at a time when they hope to recoup lost earnings. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"". The hospitality industry has estimated December takings will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. This has prompted UK Hospitality to ask for an extension of the discounted 12.5% VAT rate to stretch beyond its scheduled end in March 2022, and for business rates due in the first quarter of next year to be deferred. Celebrity chef Tom Kerridge told the BBC one of his restaurants had 654 cancellations in the past six days, during a time of year for the industry which is trying to ""claw our way back to some sort of normality"". He said bar and restaurant owners ""wouldn't have a problem"" if they had to close from a ""government and scientific point of view"" because of Covid, as long as financial support was put in place. But, he added: ""It feels like there's a reactive approach to the situation rather than thinking of being proactive. ""If you're telling people to work from home, which I get and I understand, there's a knock-on effect on many businesses that are reliant on lunch trade... the coffee shop round the corner, the newsagent in the city, hairdressers and nail bars. ""There are so many different places that will be unable to cope. Getting shut down without financial support, a lot of places will close their doors and will not re-open in the new year."" Patrick Dardis, chief executive of pub chain Youngs, said that widespread cancellations and no extra government support would mean hospitality closures in January. ""I think people are terribly confused and it's certainly having a significant impact,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. These Christmas weeks were critical for businesses ""hanging on by their fingernails"", he added. Youngs, which has 80% of its pubs in London, was helped by the reduction in VAT last lockdown and Mr Dardis called on the government to hold VAT for the hospitality sector at the reduced rate of 12.5% and lower business rates. Sam Morgan has seen a drop in enquiries for his restaurants Sam Morgan, who owns restaurants Craft and 8, said his businesses had seen a ""rapid decline"" in bookings, with more than 600 cancellations. ""We've got a perfect storm,"" he said. ""Consumer confidence is low, meaning future bookings or bookings to replace current cancellations are low. ""Corporate customers are cancelling Christmas and New Year bookings due to nervousness around exposing customers to risk, and staff having members of their parties becoming ill, meaning they must isolate."" Mr Morgan said the situation was ""extremely worrying"", with revenue earned from the festive period used to cover less busy times in the first months of the year. The CBI has called for an instruction from the government to tell councils to immediately release unused grants and rates relief to businesses in need. Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris tweeted that if the government was ""effectively telling people not to visit hospitality venues this Christmas"",then financial support should be provided.,external Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses faced a ""two-punch combination of serious issues with staff absence and plummeting consumer confidence"". ""Not even a rationale has been provided for why it believes no new support is required. They deserve better. ""Many of these firms, who have survived nearly two years of challenging trading conditions, are now seeing their vital festive income melt away in front of their eyes."" Nick Farr (right) says pubs will go under without financial support Nick Farr, co-owner of Hertfordshire brewery Farr Brew, which owns six pubs, says it has been hit with around 450 cancellations in the past seven to 10 days and this has had a ""devastating"" impact. ""Yesterday one of our pubs - The Bull in Whitwell - we had a table of 15 booked, they were booked in for 12 o'clock, they literally cancelled at 9 o'clock. So that's a lot of turkey going to waste, a lot of prep done undertaken by the chefs the night before. All of that money goes to waste really."" He said if the government was asking people to limit socialising then they had to step in. ""Unless they are OK with literally dozens of thousands of pubs going under then they just simply have to put a very extensive package of financial aid back into place,"" he told the BBC. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said implementing Plan B measures was ""the right thing to do"", but added it had ""dented"" demand and consumer confidence and further support for struggling firms would be needed in future measures were brought in. ""The Omicron variant is unlikely to be the final challenge the coronavirus poses the economy or the country. So, the question is: how do we learn to live confidently not just with the virus, but with its variants?"" In parliament on Thursday, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, questioned why further government support measures had not been approved given the chief medical officer's advice to ""de-prioritise social contact"". He also criticised the chancellor for proceeding with a ministerial trip to California on Tuesday while the country faced a ""tidal wave"" of Omicron. The chancellor is due to speak to hospitality leaders by video link today, and again tomorrow upon his return to the UK. A Treasury spokesman said: ""As we have done throughout the pandemic, we are closely monitoring the impact of the virus on the economy - and particularly the hospitality sector which is why the Chancellor is meeting with representatives from the industry today. ""Our Â£400bn Covid support package will continue to help businesses well into spring next year and of course we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of theâ¯virus.""
