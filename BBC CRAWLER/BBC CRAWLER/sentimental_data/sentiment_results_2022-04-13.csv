"This video can not be played Watch: Prime Minister outlines Rwanda immigration plans in April Some asylum seekers who cross the Channel to the UK will be given a one-way ticket to Rwanda under new government plans. The pilot scheme will focus on single men arriving on boats or lorries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Â£120m scheme would ""save countless lives"" from human trafficking. Refugee organisations have criticised the plan as cruel. They questioned its cost and impact and raised concerns about Rwanda's human rights record. Mr Johnson said action was needed to stop ""vile people smugglers"" turning the ocean into a ""watery graveyard"", with the plan designed to break their business model. ""Our compassion may be infinite but our capacity to help people is not,"" he said. ""We can't ask the British taxpayer to write a blank cheque to cover the costs of anyone who might want to come and live here."" How many Channel crossings are there and what will change? Which countries send asylum seekers overseas? Former RAF station to become asylum centre Those who succeed in making it to the UK ""will be taken not to hotels at vast public expense"", the prime minister said, and instead would be housed in detention centres. Speaking in Kent, he said the new plan would ""over time prove a very considerable deterrent"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the scheme as ""unworkable"" and ""extortionate"", claiming it was an attempt to distract from Mr Johnson's ""partygate"" fine. Last year,28,526 people are known to have crossedin small boats, up from 8,404 in 2020. About 600 people made the crossing on Wednesday - the figure could reach 1,000 a day in coming weeks, Mr Johnson said. The number of people who can be relocated will be ""unlimited"", said Mr Johnson. Rwanda will have the ""capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead"", including those who have arrived ""illegally"" since the start of the year, he said. Migrants arriving in Dover after being rescued crossing the Channel ""We cannot sustain a parallel illegal system,"" said the prime minister. ""Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity to help people is not."" Home Secretary Priti Patel, who travelled to Rwandan capital Kigali to sign the deal, said it was a ""global first and it will change the way we collectively tackle illegal migration"". She said the ""vast majority"" of those arriving in the UK ""illegally"" would be considered for relocation to Rwanda. Why is the Nationality Bill causing protests? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? Refugees minister declines to comment on Rwanda plan Recent researchby Ipsos Mori,externalsuggested 60% of the public were dissatisfied with the government's migration policy - more than half of which cited Channel crossings. BBC home editor Mark Easton, reporting from Rwanda, said ministers would face legal hurdles and substantial costs to launch the scheme. Precise details of the plan are yet to be confirmed - but he said the trial would be restricted to mostly single men. Under the proposal, Rwanda would take responsibility for the people who made the more than 4,000-mile journey, put them through an asylum process, and at the end of that process, if they were successful, they would have long-term accommodation in Rwanda. The BBC has seen accommodation the asylum seekers would be housed in, thought to have enough space for about 100 people at a time and to process up to 500 a year. Journalists were given a tour of a typical government refugee facility in Rwanda The Rwandan government said migrants would be ""entitled to full protection under Rwandan law, equal access to employment, and enrolment in healthcare and social care services"". The UK Home Office believes existing asylum law will be enough to implement the plan, but questions remain about the legality of the scheme. Mr Johnson said the plan was ""fully compliant"" with international law, but acknowledged he expected it to be subject to challenge in the courts and from a ""formidable army of politically-motivated lawyers"". BBC Radio 5 Live listenersshared their views with Nicky Campbell: ""What's crueller - that or being drowned? If it saves one life, surely it's got to be better than what's happening with these migrants now""- Lorraine, Dartington ""How are we treating these humans? Are we suddenly saying those coming from Ukraine, their lives are better value than those coming from certain other countries? I think it's abhorrent""- Hamid, Bicester ""I feel it's a real shame. We seem to have eroded this idea of fairness in our nation. We seem to no longer want to be the nation that wants to help other people. It seems a shame we've lost those values in our country""- Chris, Devon ""Let's forget about the optics and actually look at the reality. People smugglers will keep trying to find different ways until we break it. That's the cruel part here... I applaud the government for having some backbone""- Martin, Bedford British Red Cross executive director Zoe Abrams said the humanitarian network was ""profoundly concerned"" about the scheme and that ""the financial and human cost will be considerable"". Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the charity was ""appalled by the government's cruel and nasty decision"", which it said would ""do little"" to deter people from coming to the UK. Miranda Butler, a barrister who specialises in immigration law, said there were ""serious questions"" about the risks faced by migrants under this ""expedited process"". The Lib Dems said the government was ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees, while the SNP's Ian Blackford described the plan as ""absolutely chilling"". Questions have been raised over the human rights record of the Rwandan government and its president, Paul Kagame. Last year, the UK governmentexpressed concern,externalat the United Nations over ""continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom"" in Rwanda. But Mr Johnson described Rwanda as being one of the safest countries in the world. Other countries - including Ascension Island and Gibraltar - had also been considered. The prime minister also announced: Asylum seekers who are resettled in the UK will be spread more evenly across local authorities Plans to hand operational control of the Channel to the Royal Navy Â£50m in funding for new equipment and specialist personnel for Channel operations A new government facility to house migrants, described as a reception centre, in Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire A maximum sentence of life imprisonment for people smugglers The government's Nationality and Borders Bill is making its way through Parliament, but time is running out to pass it into law after a series of defeats in the House of Lords. MPs are currently on a break, but when they return, they are due to review a series of amendments, including one about powers to offshore asylum claims.

"Sir David Amess was fatally stabbed during a constituency surgery in October IS fanatic Ali Harbi Ali has been given a whole-life sentence for murdering Sir David Amess MP. Ali stabbed the Conservative MP for Southend West more than 20 times after tricking his way into a constituency surgery in Essex last year. Sir David's family said it broke their hearts that he would have ""greeted the murderer with a smile of friendship"". At the Old Bailey, Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said: ""This was a murder that struck at the heart of our democracy."" Sir David, 69, was killed at the surgery he was holding at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea on 15 October. He was stabbed after 26-year-old Ali had gone into the meeting pretending to be an NHS employee moving to the area. This video can not be played Sir David Amess' murder by Ali Harbi Ali ""sent shockwaves"" through the community Ali, from Kentish Town in north London, told the court he had plans to target various MPs, including cabinet minister Michael Gove. He told his trial he was motivated by a desire to seek revenge against MPs who had voted for airstrikes on Syria. Members of Sir David's family wiped away tears during the 40-minute hearing. After sentencing, they said they felt ""no elation"" in a statement issued through the Metropolitan Police. They added: ""It breaks our heart to know that our husband and father would have greeted the murderer with a smile of friendship and would have been anxious to help. ""How sickening to think what happened next. It is beyond evil."" Two plain clothes officers were the first police to arrive at Belfairs Methodist Church where they detained the suspect Tracy Ayling QC, for Ali, told the court she had been instructed by her client not to say anything in mitigation. Ali pursed his lips briefly but otherwise showed little emotion as the judge handed down his sentence. ""The defendant has no remorse or shame for what he has done - quite the reverse,"" said the judge. He described Sir David's death as a loss ""of national significance"". He added: ""He had done nothing whatsoever to justify the attack upon him, let alone his murder. ""On the contrary, he had devoted 38 years of his life to the lawful service of the public, and was engaged in doing so when he was murdered."" This video can not be played Jurors were shown bodycam footage of plain-clothed police officers tackling Ali Harbi Ali to the ground MPs who had once been on Ali's list of potential targets provided victim impact statements in which they described the effect it had had on their lives. Mike Freer, Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said he and his staff would now wear stab vests and panic alarms for constituency surgeries. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said he had been at home in west London when Ali carried out armed reconnaissance outside in the months prior to attacking Sir David. ""Our security and that of our home was threatened and that has put a profound pressure on our lives,"" he said. MP's shock at being researched by killer Prince Charles presents city status to Southend Tories retain seat in by-election after MP's death The jury took just 18 minutes on Monday to convict Ali of murder and preparing acts of terrorism. During the trial, he said he had no regrets or shame, saying: ""If I thought I did anything wrong, I wouldn't have done it"". The court was told he had planned to die as a ""martyr"", assuming he would be shot by police. Julie Cushion, a long-standing aide and friend of Sir David who was at the church, shared her anguish about the killing and said she still felt guilt and anger. In an impact statement read by the prosecution, she said: ""I can still see and hear the sounds and images of the time, like the crashing of furniture. ""I remember the awful feeling of distress while we waited for help - feeling helpless and hopeless as there was nothing I could physically do to help."" She said the look on Ali's face - ""smug, so self-satisfied"" - had stayed with her. She said she was now working for the constituency's new MP and was haunted by the fear of a similar attack. Conservative Anna Firth, who won the by-election in February, welcomed Ali's whole-life sentence. She said Sir David's ""incredible work and legacy will live on through the many charities and good causes he championed"". The judge imposed a whole-life sentence, as opposed to a life sentence with a minimum term, which means Ali will not be considered for parole and will never be released from prison. Others serving whole-life sentences include sexual predator Wayne Couzens, whoraped and murdered Sarah Everard in London, far-right extremist Thomas Mair, whomurdered Labour MP Jo Cox, andIpswich serial killer Steve Wright.

"This video can not be played Businesses will still be required to make risk assessments under existing legislation A law requiring workplaces in Wales to take precautions for Covid will be axed from Monday. It is one of two remaining Covid measures the Welsh government has in place. Rules requiring facemasks in health and social care settings will remain in force for at least another three weeks. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the mask rule would help control the spread of Covid where ""some of the most vulnerable people"" are treated or live. The move to scrap restrictions on businesses came as the latest Office for National Statistics data indicated infections remain at record levels in Wales, with one in 13 people still estimated to have Covid in the latest week. Mr Drakeford said firms will still be required to make risk assessments under existing legislation. He told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""It certainly doesn't mean that businesses will be abandoning all the things that they put in place to keep their workers safe and to keep customers safe."" He said firms are telling ministers ""they're determined to go on doing all of those things because they know it makes good sense for their business"". The last Welsh government review of coronavirus rulessaw the end of the laws requiring people to wear face coverings in shops and on public transport, and to self-isolate if they catch coronavirus. Both measures were replaced with guidance. Under the law, companies and other organisations had been required to assess the risk coronavirus poses in their workplace. They were required to take precautions from a shopping list of suggestions, such as ensuring premises are well ventilated, using screens or barriers and limiting close physical interaction, and could have faced fines if they ignored the rules. The Welsh government said firms would ""continue to be encouraged to take steps to operate in a Covid-safe manner"". Workplaces will still be subject to other legal responsibilities, such as under the Health and Safety at Work Act. What are the UK's remaining Covid restrictions? Rules on masks and self-isolation end in Wales What are the latest rules for Wales? The Welsh Conservatives' Russell George said the changes were coming ""too late with the long bank holiday weekend already on us"". He called for Mr Drakeford to use the next review to ""finally announce an independent public inquiry into the Welsh government's handling of the pandemic that has seen Wales with the highest rate of deaths in the UK and record-breaking waiting lists"". Figures for deaths in Walesinvolving Covid, which do not adjust for age or population, across the whole of the pandemic period are higher in Wales than the other UK nations at 314.1 per 100,000 people. When standardised for age the figure is 142.7, slightly lower than England's 143.2, but higher than Scotland and Northern Ireland. Plaid Cymru's Peredur Owen Griffiths also called for a Welsh-only pandemic inquiry, adding: ""Key worker illness and sickness absence remains a real problem for many services. That's why it's more important than ever that the Labour government provides a meaningful plan for NHS recovery."" Business groups welcomed the move. CBI Wales' Leighton Jenkins said: ""These recent changes will be welcomed by businesses, which are under strain due to rising energy costs and inflation."" Ben Cottam, head of the Federation of Small Businesses Wales, added: ""Business will continue to do everything they can to ensure customers and staff are safe."" Shavanah Taj, general secretary of the Wales TUC group of trade unions, said employers ""still have a legal obligation to ensure the safety and security of their workers"". ""Employers must continue to assess the physical environment and working practices in order to safeguard against the spread of infection."" Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, also welcomed the decision and called for the fourth booster vaccine to be opened up to those under 75 who want it. Michael Kill says the industry does not take safety lightly Meanwhile, Night Time Industries Association's Michael Kill said a Welsh government Freedom of Information request showed there was no evidence to support the closure of nightclubs last year. Mr Kill toldRadio Wales Breakfastthe findings left many in the sector feeling ""frustrated and angry"". ""The response that we got... was it is not possible to establish exactly where someone caught Covid,"" he said. ""Therefore, it's not possible to provide the number of cases that were caught in specific venues. Welsh government does not hold that information."" he added. He said the sector was not surprised by the response, which showed evidence was ""anecdotal"", but said there had been a ""huge impact"" on businesses, with over a third of nightclubs now closed across the UK. In response, the Welsh government said its approach has been ""informed by the latest available scientific and medical advice"". It added that ""Increasing the number of people at a venue without increasing the size of the venue or otherwise mitigating appropriately will increase the risk of transmission. SAGE highlighted the highest risks of transmission are associated with poorly ventilated and crowded indoor settings."" Mr Drakeford said nightclubs were ""high-risk"" and have been associated with super-spreader events ""across the world"". ""The evidence from the Sage committee said the transmission of the virus was strongly associated with a proximity and duration of contacts in indoor environments,"" he added. Covid infections remain at record levels in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with one in 13 people still estimated to have Covid in the latest week. It is estimated 231,900 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 9 April. That equates to 7.63% of the population and is a slight increase on the previous week's estimate, which was that 230,800 people were infected and suggests they may be flattening. The estimate for Wales is a higher than those in the other UK nations, where infections were estimated to be decreasing. It was also higher than in all English regions except the north east. Infections are estimated to involve one in 14 people in England, one in 17 in Scotland and one in 19 in Northern Ireland. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales, later on Thursday, that Covid ""in general"" has been ""stabilising in Wales over the last three weeks, albeit at very high numbers"". He said there were ""just the beginnings of signs that maybe the BA.2 wave of Omicron is passing its peak and numbers are beginning to come down"". Meanwhile, the numbers of patients with Covid in hospital beds has averaged 836 over the last week - slightly up on the previous seven days. Numbers in critical care are averaging 19 a day, a small rise on a week ago but half the numbers at the peak we saw in January. However, more than 84% of patients with Covid in acute beds are being treated for other conditions, reflecting the high numbers of Covid infections in the community. Only 124 patients with Covid on Wednesday were  being primarily treated for the virus. But the chief medical officer for Wales warned that the health and care system continued to struggle with Covid demands and high levels of staff absence. Mark Drakeford has warned people that the pandemic is not over Earlier this week registered deaths involving Covid in Wales rose to their highest weekly total in two months, according to the ONS. In the most recent week, up to 1 April, 61 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid - and saw it included as a contributory factor on a death certificate. It was the highest weekly total since early February - there were 45 deaths registered in the previous week. The next three-weekly review of coronavirus regulations is expected around 5 May.

"Roman Abramovich has been forced to sell Chelsea FC and move his superyachts out of EU waters Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has had $7bn (Â£5.4bn) of assets linked to him frozen by a Jersey court. On Tuesday, Jersey Police searched premises suspected to be connected to Mr Abramovich's business activities on the island, Jersey Law Officers' Department said. The billionaire is on the UK sanctions list over Russia's war in Ukraine. Channel Island Jersey follows UK policy and imposes sanctions on the same people. ""The Royal Court also imposed a formal freezing order on 12 April, known as a saisie judiciaire, over assets understood to be valued in excess of US$7bn which are suspected to be connected to Mr Abramovich and which are either located in Jersey or owned by Jersey incorporated entities,"" the Jersey Law Officers' Department said. Mr Abramovich was among several wealthy Russians added last month to the UK and European Union sanctions lists over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and governments have since been taking action to seize yachts and other luxury assets from them. The billionaire tried to sell Chelsea Football Club in March, but that process was taken out of his hands by the government after he was sanctioned. Earlier this month, the Caribbean nation Antigua and Barbuda said it was willing to help the UK seize yachts owned by Abramovich. Superyachts linked to the businessman, together worth an estimated $1.2bn, have also been docked in southwest Turkey, outside the jurisdiction of the EU and the UK. Mystery surrounds Chelsea investment. The Jersey Royal Court has frozen a staggering $7bn of Roman Abramovich's assets in Jersey. And one company in particular will be of interest to football fans. Camberley International Investments, based in the Jersey capital St. Helier, has loaned Â£1.4bn to Fordstam Ltd, the company through which Roman Abramovich owns Chelsea FC, according to its latest accounts. That's money which has helped to fund Chelsea's triumphs on the pitch. Camberley International Investments is described in the accounts as a 'related party' - suggesting it  could also be  controlled by Mr Abramovich. We don't know for sure if it is among the assets frozen by the Jersey court. But if it is - what will that mean for the ongoing sale of the Chelsea? Mr Abramovich has previously said that he won't seek for the loan to be repaid. But if the company which made the loan were to be frozen, the decision may be out of his hands. The Jersey Law Officers' department gave no detail on what would happen to specific assets. It will come under a lot of pressure to fill in some of the blanks in coming days.

"Prime Minister Sanna Marin (R) met Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm to discuss Nato Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin says her country will decide whether to apply to join Nato ""within weeks"". She said she saw no reason to delay the decision, at a joint news conference alongside Sweden's prime minister. Her comments coincided with a report to the Finnish parliament that said membership of the bloc could result in ""increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia"". Moscow has warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato in recent weeks. Finland and Sweden are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support to become members of the Western defensive alliance. Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson told reporters that the same ""very serious analysis"" was taking place as in Finland and she saw no point in delaying it. Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported on Wednesday that Ms Andersson was aiming to apply for membership in time for a Nato summit in late June. Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) border with Russia, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if the Nato bid went ahead. ""I won't give any kind of timetable when we will make our decisions, but I think it will happen quite fast,"" said Ms Marin. She pointed out that Nato membership offered Finland the security guarantee of Article Five, whereby an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all. While the two leaders met in Stockholm, Finland's security review was being launched in Helsinki. Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Russia's war had changed the security environment in Europe and forced the review of Finnish defence policy. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is transforming European security. The Nato military alliance has been given new purpose and now - potentially - could get new members too. Voters in Finland and Sweden have long cherished their non-aligned status. But now the mood is changing. Sanna Marin's predecessor as prime minister, Alexander Stubb, says the decision is a ""foregone conclusion"". Sweden is also looking afresh at Nato - the country's ruling Social Democrat party is reviewing its historic opposition to joining the alliance. But Russian spokesmen have repeatedly said any expansion of Nato would be considered a ""provocation"" and warned there would be ""consequences"". The report warns that ""military force might be used solely against Finland,"",externaland that the security situation in Europe and Finland is more serious and more difficult to predict than at any time since the Cold War. It also noted that were Finland to join the bloc, it would be forced to spend up to 1.5% more of its budget on defence, but added that membership of the alliance would offer the country a greater capacity to defend itself. Finland has already announced a 40% increase in its defence budget by 2026. Any potential application would also welcome a bid by neighbouring Sweden to seek membership of the bloc, it added. Finnish forces have taken part in recent Nato military exercises as recently as last month The Finnish government emphasised that the report ""does not include any conclusions or present new security policy guidelines"" and said that no decisions would be made before parliament had debated its findings. Ms Marin told reporters that ""all the parliamentary groups, government and also the president will have the possibility to make the decisions within upcoming weeks"". Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said the military situation remained calm but cautioned that the army must be ready for possible changes. The prime minister warned earlier that Finland had to be prepared for a Russian attack during any potential Nato evaluation process. There have been reports that Moscow has started to move military equipment towards the Russian-Finnish border, although US officials said they had seen nothing to confirm that. Finland has maintained a policy of military neutrality designed to avoid confrontation with Russia since Nato was formed in 1949. In 1939, Finland fought off an invasion from the Soviet Union in what became known as the Winter War, but ended up ceding most of its eastern province of Karelia. Ms Marin's ruling Social Democratic party has traditionally supported the policy of non-alignment and she reiterated it as recently as March. But recent opinion polls show that public support for joining Nato has climbed from 28% in February to 62% last month. Finland retains a large standing military of around 21,500 troops and has the capacity to call up over 200,000 reservists in the event of war.

"Some believe killings in Bucha constitute genocide The United States has historically been reluctant to accuse states of genocide. The UN Genocide Convention, of which the US is a signatory, requires countries to intervene once genocide is formally identified. But amid mounting evidence of atrocities in Ukraine, President Joe Biden has now accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being guilty of what has been called the ""crime of all crimes"". He said President Putin was committing acts of genocide by trying to ""wipe out the idea"" of a Ukrainian identity. Not everyone is ready to go as far. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was reluctant to use the word, stating that he was ""not sure that an escalation of rhetoric serves that cause"". But what is genocide, and is there evidence that Russia is guilty of the crime in Ukraine? The BBC's George Wright took a look at the arguments for and againstaccusing President Putin of genocide. Russia is keeping up its assault on one of its key targets, the southern port city of Mariupol. If captured, it would be only the second major city after Kherson to fall since the war began, and pave the way for a broader Russian campaign in the east. The human cost has been immense: Mariupol's mayor says as many as 21,000 civilians have been killed in the southern city and 100,000 are still awaiting evacuation. Meanwhile, Ukraine has denied Russian reports of more than 1,000 marines surrendering in the city. One of them - a British man -told family there were no weapons left to fight. For a full picture of the fighting on the ground,our Visual Journalism team have been tracking the conflict in maps. When the Russians retreated from Bucha, one of several towns they occupied north of the capital Kyiv, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. One of the bodies belonged to Vitaliy, a former cook who moved to Bucha two years ago. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" his brother Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" At least 500 dead have been found since the Russians left. The BBC's Joel Gunter joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. Prime Minister Sanna Marin (R) met Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm to discuss Nato One of Russia's main concerns has been the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato, but a consequence of the conflict may be that the bloc gains two new members anyway. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin says her country will decide whether to apply to join Nato ""within weeks"". She was speaking at a news conference alongside her Swedish counterpart - Sweden too is considering membership. As our Diplomatic Correspondent James Landale notes,Russia's invasion of Ukraine is transforming European security. Viktor Medvedchuk is a wealthy businessman who is close to Russia's President Vladimir Putin. So close, in fact, that his daughter has President Putin as a godfather. For years Ukraine tolerated him as a useful channel to the Kremlin. But last year, he was charged with treason and soon after Russia's invasion he escaped house arrest. Ukraine has now recaptured him. On Wednesday security chief Ivan Bakanov gave more details of the operation. He said Ukrainian agents thwarted a plot by Russia's Federal Security Service to smuggle him across the border into Moldova, and then on to Moscow.

The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US military aid  'Crime scene' call  Mariupol latest  This is Nathan Williams and Gareth Evans in London handing over to our colleagues Jude Sheerin in Washington DC and Max Matza in Seattle. The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.047101136
"Police in Bucha examine a body unearthed in a field. At least 500 dead have been found since the Russians left. When the Russians retreated from Bucha, a massive operation began to find and document the dead. BBC News joined the local police officers and bereaved families as they carried out their grim task. Warning: This article contains graphic images. Police Chief Vitaliy Lobas was sitting at a child's desk in an abandoned school in Bucha, collecting the details of the bodies. Every few minutes, Chief Lobas, who has broad shoulders and short dark hair, and rarely uses an unnecessary word, received a call on his mobile phone, and the brief conversations went the same: a location, a few details, a phone number of a relative or friend. Before the Russians came, Lobas was an ordinary local police chief, the head of Buchanksy District 1, who spent his days dealing with ordinary local crime and the occasional murder. Since the liberation of Bucha, he has spent his days in this abandoned school classroom, where school posters still hang on the walls, coordinating the massive operation to find the dead. In front of Lobas on the school desk there was a map of Bucha, a once peaceful and little-known suburb of Kyiv that is now a sprawling crime scene. The area was occupied by Russian forces for a month as they attempted to assault Kyiv, and its liberation a little over a week ago has begun a slow and painful process of uncovering horrors. Each time the phone rang, Lobas consulted the map in front of him, and on a plain piece of paper he wrote down the necessary information in neat handwriting, one line per body. By mid-morning, he had filled one side of A4 and moved on to the reverse. The previous day there had been 64 bodies, he said. The day before, 37. He did not know how many there would be that day, but he was expecting the number to jump by around 40 because a mass grave was being dug up nearby. Lobas is only in charge of one part of this region, and many more bodies are being found outside his jurisdiction. Vitaliy Lobas, the head of Buchansky District 1 police department, takes a call in his command post in a school classroom. Lobas paused occasionally to go to the school playground for a cigarette, but even these moments were interrupted by calls about bodies or problems relating to the collection of bodies. It was raining in Bucha, and one of the vans that ferried corpses to the morgue had become stuck in the mud. A tractor needed to be found quickly, because there was a limited number of vans and a large number of bodies. Lobas generally delegates the field work to his deputies, but in cases of particularly grave crimes he goes himself. ""When people have been shot in the head with their hands tied behind their back, for example, I will go,"" he said. ""When the bodies have been burned I also go."" About mid-morning, a call came in from Dmytro Kushnir, a 24-year-old police deputy in one of Lobas's units, to log a body that had been reported behind an apartment building on the outskirts of Bucha. When Kushnir arrived at the building, which stood alone on an otherwise undeveloped green area on the edge of woodland, he found two men behind the building at the place where the property line met the woods. They were wearing blue surgical gloves and standing over the partially decomposed body of a man who appeared to have been shot in the back of the head. The body lay on a stained white duvet decorated with red flowers and was surrounded by empty bottles of beer and spirits. The blue surgical gloves initially gave the men the appearance of medical officials, but they introduced themselves as Volodymyr and Serhiy Brezhnev, the dead man's father and brother. Lying on the blanket was Vitaliy Brezhnev, a 30-year-old former cook who, until the Russians arrived, lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend on the sixth floor of the apartment building that now towered over his corpse. Serhiy Brezhnev stands over his brother's body. ""He was a kind-hearted man, he gave his all,"" Serhiy said. A passport picture of Vitaliy that Serhiy carried while he searched for his brother Volodymyr and Serhiy had lost contact with Vitaliy a month earlier, when the Russians seized control of Bucha and communications went down. It was impossible to enter the suburb to check his building, so they searched for him for a month online, scouring social media in vain for evidence that he was alive. When the Russians finally retreated, a little over a week ago, Serhiy got a call from Vitaliy's girlfriend and she told them the story. The Russians had assaulted the apartment building and blasted their way into every apartment with a shotgun, she said, demanding people handed over their SIM cards and keys. They interrogated her and Vitaliy in separate rooms, beat them, and shot their dog, she said. Then they took her down to the basement with a group of other residents and bolted the door, but took Vitaliy away separately and told her she wouldn't see him again, and she didn't. As soon as the Ukrainian army declared Bucha safe to re-enter, Volodymyr and Serhiy set out for the apartment building. Inside, they found blood smeared on the floor in the stairwells and personal photographs from people's apartments strewn around. On every door you could see the holes from the shotgun blasts - sometimes one, sometimes four or five. Doors with steel plates had been crowbarred. On one wooden door, where the lock hadn't given way to repeated shots, the Russian soldiers appeared to have become frustrated and blown a hole right through the middle of the door into the apartment. Behind another door, it was clear the homeowners had pushed a heavy table up against the frame in a failed attempt to keep the invaders out. Every door in Vitaliy Brezhnev's apartment building had been blown open with a shotgun. When Volodymyr and Serhiy reached the sixth floor they saw that the shotgun had been used on the door of Apartment 83. A rank odour came from inside. The Russians had trashed the apartment and pried open the air vents and even the bathroom drain, looking for money, Serhiy guessed. When he entered Vitaliy's bedroom he suffered the first of several blows to his hopes of finding his brother alive. On the pillow there was a deep blood stain and blood was sprayed up the walls behind the bed. Among the mess on the floor there were two 7.62mm bullet casings - the calibre used by the Russian army in their rifles. ""You could see that a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. ""But there was no body."" So Volodymyr and Serhiy began to search for Vitaliy, knowing that their search was now probably for a body and not a son and brother they could hold again in their arms. Serhiy was carrying a passport photograph of Vitaliy. ""We searched and searched,"" he said, ""and at first we were looking for his face."" Warning: Readers may find some of the following images distressing The scene inside Vitaliy's bedroom. ""You could see a man had been killed here,"" Serhiy said. Vitaliy Brezhnev's body was found behind his apartment, where the property line met the woods. Behind the building, next to the woods, they found what appeared to be a shallow grave, and they began to dig. It took time to exhume the remains there. First they saw a flower-patterned duvet they didn't recognise and their hearts found some hope. But when they brought the body up they saw that inside the duvet there was a curtain from Vitaliy's apartment. Then they saw the dead man's shoes and thought they recognised them. The light was fading by that point and they had to be home before curfew, so they covered the body with the sheet. Embers of hope remained. ""Today was the final touch,"" Serhiy said, the following day, looking down at the body. ""Today we took his shoes off and we saw his feet."" Because Vitaliy's feet had been inside socks and shoes they were better preserved than the rest of his body after a month in the earth. ""We saw the shape of his feet,"" Volodymyr said. ""Then we looked at the shape of the nose and the hands,"" Serhiy said. ""And we knew it was our bloodline."" Volodymyr replaces the thin sheet that covered the body where it lay Volodymyr and Serhiy waiting for the van that collects the bodies. Eventually they gave up. Volodymyr had purchased the small apartment in Bucha two years earlier - an investment in his son's future. Vitaliy had been a cook in a restaurant in Kyiv, until the pandemic hit and he was laid off. He did some work in construction and was looking for something more stable, but he had a girlfriend he loved and a dog, and now an apartment in a nice neighbourhood. He loved to fish and hunt, and forage for mushrooms in his spare time, and cook. ""He was living a peaceful life here,"" Serhiy said. ""He was a normal guy, that's all, a kind-hearted man. He gave his all."" ""He was a son and a brother,"" Volodymyr said, trying to hold back his tears. At the front of the apartment building, Officer Kushnir was filling out his police report. Volodymyr went to his car and took two small pieces of cardboard and wrote his name and phone number and Vitaliy's name and address on each. Then he asked some neighbours for clear tape to cover the ink, because the rain was beginning to fall harder on Bucha, and he went back to the body, without surgical gloves this time, to tie one piece of card to Vitaliy's ankle and one to his wrist. ""I do not want to lose my son,"" he said. Officer Kushnir finished his report and called it in. Chief Lobas would arrange for the van that collected the bodies to stop by. Volodymyr and Serhiy took shelter from the rain and waited for the van to arrive. Families in Bucha attached tags to their loved ones or put passports in their pockets, so as not to lose them again. As the day wore on, Chief Lobas's classroom command post got busier. Officers came and went, filing crime scene reports. The list on Lobas's desk got longer and his phone kept ringing. A dead woman had been found in a well next to a destroyed column of Russian tanks. There was a body on the ninth floor of an apartment building. A driver of one of the vans called to say he couldn't find the body he had been sent to collect. A woman came in to the classroom in person to report that her neighbour was dead. ""I understand everything,"" Lobas told her, keen to move on. ""We will try to collect him today."" Lobas's father called. ""Dad, I am too busy,"" he said. ""Everything is OK."" Two of Bucha district's police departments had been destroyed in the Russian assault and Lobas was struggling for resources. There were not enough body bags. His team had also been whittled down over the preceding days to those who had shown themselves capable of withstanding this new work. ""Those who were weak went at the very beginning,"" he said. There was little room for sentiment amid the scale of the task. Lobas received another call. ""Nine?"" he said. ""Where?"" The call was coming from a unit in a neighbouring police department. Nine bodies were buried in a field nearby. Lobas hung up and dialled one of his mobile units. ""The team there is exhausted and they have no body bags left,"" he said. ""They have been collecting bodies all day. Please go and help them now. Find body bags and help them to pack the bodies."" Nine graves, dug by neighbours behind apartment buildings in Bucha. The nine graves were laid out neatly in a row at the edge of the field, behind a corrugated fence at the end of a dirt track. The dead had been buried by their neighbours during the Russian occupation and now they were being exhumed by their neighbours, with the help of the police. ""Some of these people died because they could not get medicine and some were killed by Russians,"" said Gennadiy, a 45-year-old Ukrainian from one of the buildings by the field, who had helped to bury the the bodies and was doing the most work now to bring them up. ""These were our neighbours,"" Gennadiy said, a look of deep anger set in his face. ""Here is Uncle Tolya from the building next door and a neighbour of his. Here is another person I knew from the next building. This man has a bullet wound, we didn't know him but we found a passport on his body. This elderly woman had severe diabetes and we tried to take her out of Bucha but there was no green corridor, so she died. This man went for a walk with his dog and didn't come back. We are not pathologists but it looks like he was shot."" Gennadiy, a resident who buried his neighbours, helps to bring them up from their graves. The work to remove the bodies was hard. They had been buried well in deep graves, and the rain was soaking into the mud and making it slippery. Gennadiy, in a green plastic rain cape, climbed into each grave, one after the other, and shovelled the earth from around the bodies so that thick straps could be tied around them to hoist them up. Each body had been wrapped in whatever was at hand - curtains, blankets of different colours and patterns. They were examined by the police and any obvious wounds photographed with an iPhone. Enough body bags had been found, and after a while the van arrived. In the dirt on its back doors, someone had scrawled '200' - the military identifier for the transport of the dead. The bodies were loaded inside. The sky was grey and the rain kept falling. At Vitaliy's apartment building, Volodymyr and Serhiy had waited as long as they could for the van to arrive. It was getting dark and they needed to get home. Vitaliy's body would have to spend another night on the ground. They were too late now to make the 9pm curfew in Kyiv, but at the military checkpoints along the route they showed the death report and were waved through. At sunrise the next morning, the father and son got up and began the drive back to Bucha. They could not wait for the van any longer, and they loaded Vitaliy's body into the back of their car and set out for a morgue in the town of Boyarka, about an hour's drive south. Before the invasion, the staff at the Boyarka morgue were used to handling about three bodies a day, the vast majority of them deaths from natural causes. Since Bucha was liberated, they have been autopsying about 50 bodies a day, 80% of which were violent deaths, said Semen Petrovych, 39, who has been the forensic expert there for 16 years. The Boyarka morgue used to receive three bodies a day. Now it is autopsying about 50. The morgue, a small outbuilding at the back of a hospital on the edge of town, where Boyarka meets the forest, had just acquired two rented refrigerator trucks and both were full of bodies. Body bags lay on the floor by the trucks and against the fence nearby and either side of the entrance to the morgue. ""There are not enough staff and there is not enough room,"" said Petrovych, the forensic expert. ""Even if we had more people, where would we put the bodies?"" Normally he would do a careful autopsy on every body and print a death certificate. ""Now we just dissect them quickly and write something simple by hand,"" he said. Volodymyr and Serhiy were not alone in bringing a body themselves. Private cars pulled up to the morgue and bodies were brought out wrapped in blankets and rugs. Relatives and friends came searching. Tatiana Zhylenko was looking for the body of the father of a friend who was abroad. ""He had his passport on his chest,"" she told the staff. Oleksander Zakovorotnyi came for his father-in-law, who, when the Russians cut the gas supply in the depth of winter, rigged up a makeshift heater using a gas cylinder, but fell asleep and was poisoned when the flame went out. Serhiy Brezhnev helps carry Vitaliy's body bag out from the morgue, to await fingerprinting. Volodymyr and Serhiy waited outside until they were called in to identify Vitaliy. They stood inside the cramped, low-ceilinged morgue, where there were bodies on the floor and on every gurney and the smell was overpowering. They had to squeeze between two gurneys, beside an open corpse, to get close to Vitaliy's body, and they searched it for scars they could remember. They repeated to the pathologist that they thought they recognised his feet. Volodymyr looked away and looked back. He was wrestling with doubt and hope. Afterwards, he walked behind the refrigerator truck and stood alone sobbing, his chest heaving with his tears. Vitaliy was brought out, his body bag tagged number 552 - the 552nd body processed by this small morgue since the beginning of the year, nearly double the figure in a normal year, the extra hundreds all condensed into one week. The police took fingerprints and told Volodymyr and Serhiy that the formal identification would take around a month, because of the backlog, but otherwise they were free to take him to the cemetery to be buried. The line of body bags at the Bucha cemetery, waiting to be processed and buried. Because Vitaliy was already identified, he was placed by his family straight into a casket. Rather than wait for the body van, Volodymyr and Serhiy lifted Vitaliy carefully again into the back of their car and drove him the hour or so back to Bucha, past the rows of destroyed homes and places where bodies had laid in the streets for weeks. At the cemetery, which was already full, new graves were being dug outside the boundary fence on a thin strip of earth along the side of the road. A priest intoned the funeral rites over a coffin. The mother of the dead man wailed. In the near distance, past the line of the forest, enormous booms sounded as unexploded ordnance was detonated. Volodymyr and Serhiy drove into the cemetery and unloaded Vitaliy next to a long line of body bags arrayed on the ground. Because Vitaliy had already been identified and would be buried here in Bucha, he was placed into a simple wooden casket with maroon fabric and afforded the small dignity of resting inside a brick building on the cemetery grounds. He would be buried in two days' time. Volodymyr and Serhiy left the cemetery and Volodymyr decided that, even though it was far from their home in Kyiv, he would buy a plot there for his wife Lily, Vitaliy's mother, who was suffering from end-stage cancer, so that when the time came she would be near to her son. Two days later, on a bright, cold morning in Bucha, the family gathered at the cemetery. Once again, Volodymyr and Serhiy took the lead and went inside the brick building to prepare to carry the casket. Lily sat outside on a bench, smoking a cigarette, alone among the body bags. The casket was carried to a stone plinth and the family gathered around it while the priest read the funeral rites and two elderly women from the church held the incense burner and sang. Then Vitaliy was taken by the van marked 200 to one of the fresh graves along the roadside outside the cemetery and laid to rest. Volodymyr was still wrestling with doubt. ""I am still hoping that the fingerprints will show this was not my son,"" he said. The family gathers for a small funeral service for Vitaliy Vitaliy Brezhnev was buried on Monday 11 April, in a fresh grave by the road Later that day, back at the abandoned school in Bucha, Chief Lobas was sitting at his schooldesk, listening carefully to a man who had come in person to ask for help finding a relative he had heard was in a mass grave. The man had been to the large mass grave by the church, he said, but they redirected him to the police. He wanted to give Chief Lobas a picture, but Lobas explained that this was not the way things were done. ""We cannot go around opening all the body bags holding this picture,"" he said. ""Do you understand? It will waste too much time."" Lobas explained that they had to begin burying the unidentified bodies because there was not enough space at the morgues. But he assured the man that fingerprints and photographs were being taken and would be kept. ""Even though the people themselves are buried the information remains,"" he said. ""The photographs remain."" The calls kept coming in - a body on Yablunska Street, another body next to a school. ""We have cleared these two addresses already, give us more to collect,"" Lobas said. He saw a window for a cigarette and went to the playground. The number of bodies each day was already beginning to fall, and he thought the job might be finished soon. ""There are no weekends here now, we will keep working until the collection of the bodies is complete,"" he said. He flicked his cigarette away. His phone was ringing.

"Daniel Kinahan, originally from Ireland, moved to Dubai in 2016 The world of sport has been warned over its involvement with the Kinahan organised crime group, which has been hit with worldwide financial sanctions. Among those sanctioned is Daniel Kinahan - a well-known figure in boxing circles who has worked with world champions Tyson Fury andJosh Taylor. Garda (Irish police) commissioner Drew Harris said it was ""now absolutely explicit"" that ""if you deal with"" the individuals or businesses sanctioned then ""you are involved in a criminal network"". There are no allegations of wrongdoing against any boxers who have worked with Kinahan. The Irish Kinahan cartel emerged in Dublin in the 1990s, and Irish, American and British law enforcement have launched coordinated action against what the US says is one of the world's largest crime groups. A reward of up to $5m (Â£3.84m) has been offered by the US for information on the three most senior members. In total, seven members and three associated businesses are targeted. ""On the business of sport, today we have made it very clear through this announcement who and what exactly the Kinahan organised crime group is,"" said Harris. ""Individuals, specific individuals, have been sanctioned. It's then for businesses to make a decision, considering the probity of their own business, the probity of all the business that comes from sport, and also then their fans, and even just then the reputation of a sport and whether they should carry on in any business dealings with any of these sanctioned individuals. In fact then, in the US that is in fact prohibited."" US sanctions Kinahan Cartel leaders Sanctions will deal 'heavy blow' to Kinahan Cartel activities Assistant commissioner John O'Driscoll condemned Kinahan's standing in boxing, telling reporters at a news conference in Dublin his influence was ""destroying or attempting to destroy a sport that is so important to inner city communities"". Kinahan is a co-founder of the MTK Global agency, which represents a number of boxing's leading fighters, including Fury. Kinahan says he cut ties with the company in 2017. While Kinahan says he is no longer associated with the agency, last year Furyexpressly thanked himfor organising a high-profile bout with then world champion Anthony Joshua, which later fell through. Just weeks ago, Fury was photographed in Dubai with Kinahan. Kinahan is also understood to have been an adviser to Scotland's world boxing champion Taylor, who is also represented by MTK Global. Taylor once described Kinahan as a ""great adviser"" who is doing great things for the sport of boxing. The BBC has contacted Fury's promoters, Top Rank, and Taylor and his team for comment. Despite Kinahan's well-known links to the drug trade, boxing chiefs have defended his involvement with the sport. Last month, World Boxing Council (WBC) president Mauricio Sulaiman offered his ""full backing"" to the Irishman's continued involvement after a meeting in Dubai. The BBC has contacted the WBC for comment. One of the businesses sanctioned by the US is Hoopoe Sports, a sports management company for combat sports. Its website lists a number of prominent boxers as clients. Another boxing company, Probellum, has denied any involvement with Kinahan. After aBBC investigation revealed his continued presencein the sport last year, Kinahan insisted allegations ofcriminality are part of a ""campaign"" against him. ""It is absolutely a matter for sport and leaders of sport and the participants in that to take a look at who they are doing business with and whether they are comfortable with that and take the right steps,"" said National Crime Agency deputy director of investigations Matthew Horne. ""That is an appropriate matter for the sporting community to address."" Horne added that sporting bodies and broadcasters need to ""take great care"" and ensure that Kinahan no longer has any ties to any organisations they do business with. ""If there is a relationship with Daniel Kinahan then clearly he is sanctioned and that has implications for other organisations,"" he told BBC Sport. ""But it really will be a matter for sport and sport organisations to make those assessments based on what we have released today working with our partners internationally."" In a statement, Sky Sports said it is ""aware of recent developments"" including the sanctions. It added: ""We always scrutinise and act responsibly in our boxing relationships.""

"The carbon-cutting promises made at COP26 would see the world warm by just under 2C this century, according to a new analysis. The study finds that if all the pledges made by countries are implemented ""in full and on time"", temperatures would rise by 1.9-2C. However, there is far grimmer news on the idea of keeping warming under 1.5C. The paper finds there is just a 6-10% chance of staying under this key threshold. Why the battle for British coal matters to the world UN scientists: It's 'now or never' to fix climate change Climate change fuels southern Africa storms When political leaders met in Glasgow last November, many of them brought new and improved plans to reduce their carbon emissions. Others, such as India,announced new, long-term targetsto bring their CO2 output to net zero. The focus of the meeting was to try to improve the pledges so thatglobal temperatures this century don't rise by more than 1.5Cabove the levels recorded in the middle of the 19th Century. Scientists haveconcluded,externalthat going beyond this level is very dangerous for the world, particularly for people living in small island nations and developing states. During the gathering in Glasgow, researchers carried outrapid analyses of the new pledges and promises. They all indicated these new plans would reduce the rise in global temperatures that the world is experiencing. The key question, though, is by how much. India's prime minster Modi is greeted by Boris Johnson at COP26 This new,peer reviewed study,externalbuilds on those early findings. The authors first look at the plans that countries have made for the short term up to 2030. On their own, these would see temperatures rise by 2.6C this century, with devastating consequences for tens of millions of people. But if countries fulfil their longer-term goals of reducing warming gases to as close to zero as possible, then the impact on temperatures is far greater. ""This is the first paper that says there's actually a better than 50% chance of keeping temperatures below 2C if these targets are implemented,"" said lead author Prof Malte Meinshausen, from the University of Melbourne. ""But it is not a good news story because our study clearly shows that increased action this decade is necessary for us to have a chance of not shooting past 1.5 degrees by a wide margin."" Extreme weather events such as flooding are likely to increase as the climate warms The authors say that support, financial and technical, is needed for developing countries to make significant cuts in their carbon output. Even if these happen, the 1.5C threshold of the COP21 Paris agreement  is in serious trouble, according to this analysis. At best, there's a 10% chance of limiting warming to that level this century. What's making that unlikely is that in the short term, carbon emissions are going up not down. The new study finds that CO2 will increase by 13% up to 2030, rather than going down by around 45%. That's the amount of cuts that scientists say is necessary to stave off more dangerous warming. ""The really key thing is the importance of reducing emissions over the period to 2030,"" said co-author Christophe McGlade from the International Energy Agency. ""There are options available for policymakers to respond to the current crisis that can also be in line with our long-term emission goals, things like reducing oil use by lowering speed limits. It has an immediate impact in terms of lowering oil demand, it reduces some of the stress in the oil markets, and it would also help to reduce emissions."" Curbing speed limits could reduce demand for oil, say experts Other researchers in this area believe that this new report shows that stabilising temperatures at a safer level will need the deployment of carbon-removal approaches, including machines to suck CO2 from the sky. ""The only way to 1.5C is to come back down to 1.5C from above it,"" said Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, who was not involved with the new study.

"Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, driven by a sharp increase in petrol and diesel costs. The UK inflation rate rose to 7% in the year to March, the highest rate since 1992 and up from 6.2% in February. Prices are rising faster than wages and there is pressure on the government to do more to help those struggling. The cost of living is expected to rise even further after the energy price cap was increased, driving up gas and electricity bills for millions. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? 'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices' Tesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble Student loan interest rate to hit 12% in England Fuel had the biggest impact on the inflation rate, with average petrol prices rising by 12.6p per litre between February and March, the largest monthly rise since records began in 1990,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. This compares with a rise of 3.5p per litre between the same months of 2021. Diesel prices also rose by 18.8p per litre this year, compared with a rise of 3.5p per litre a year ago. The rise in the inflation rate was higher than the 6.7% expected by analysts and was also driven up by furniture, restaurant and food prices. The figures for March do not yet reflect the average Â£700-a-year increase in energy bills thattook place from 1 April when the energy price cap was raised. Sara Gerritsma says her petrol costs have shot up by about Â£120 a month Since late last year, prices have been rising fast as pandemic restrictions have been eased and firms face higher energy and shipping costs which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now adding to the pain, as the price of oil and other commodities climb higher. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters and demand for oil from other producers has increased since the invasion, leading to higher prices. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. Ukraine and Russia are also the world's main suppliers of sunflower oil and the war has hit prices. In the UK, the price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March, according to the ONS. Andrew Selley, chief executive of wholesaler BidFood, which supplies 45,000 caterers and food service businesses across the UK, said increasing electricity, fuel and packaging costs were impacting the price of all its products. But he told the BBC products affected by the war in Ukraine, such as wheat-based foods, sunflower oil, chicken and white fish, were particularly hard hit. ""I've been in the business for over 30 years. I've never seen a situation where everything seems to be going up [in price],"" he said, adding that some of these costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers. The firm had previously sourced a lot of its chicken from Poland but Ukrainian workers had returned to fight in the war and the country was keeping more of its chicken to feed refugees meaning it was now sourcing from other countries, driving prices up by a fifth. Sara Gerritsma, a student from Leicestershire with a partner and six year-old child, said she may have to give up her paramedic degree due to the rising cost of fuel. The 32-year-old only started the three-year course in October but she has a 2.5 hour roundtrip each day to get to university in Northampton, and her petrol costs have shot up by about Â£120 a month. ""It would be really frustrating giving up my course. It was a big decision changing my career at 32,"" Sara told the BBC. ""But recently we have sat down and gone through everything and thought, can I afford to be a full-time student?"" The sharp rise in prices is also putting pressure on businesses. Paul White, who owns the pizzeria 6/CUT in Eccles, Greater Manchester, said the increase in the minimum wage, the end of VAT relief, and rising fuel and food prices have all hit his company. The restaurant is also spending Â£500 more a week on its energy bills. ""We need to find an extra Â£1,400 a week to cover the costs of everything that's come on in the last few weeks,"" he told the BBC. He says he will have to put up prices, and is looking to charge each customer about 50p to Â£1 extra to cover his rising overheads. But he is also worried people might start eating out less as their budgets are squeezed. This is no longer a cost of living squeeze, but a financial throttling for many people. Price rises are accelerating and their wages, benefits and pensions are failing to keep pace. In the words of the ONS, there were ""no large offsetting downward contributions"" to the inflation rate. In other words, nothing is getting significantly cheaper. So avoidance of price rises is impossible. Even if you do not have a car and are avoiding surging fuel costs, lots of other necessities are getting more expensive. Experts say the only option is trying to budget as best we can, across every part of our lives. Most importantly, they also stress the importance of seeking early, and free, help before falling into unmanageable debt. Research for the consultancy Retail Economics found the least affluent UK households saw discretionary income fall by 5.2% or Â£26 in March, compared with the same month last year. The Retail Economics-HyperJar Cost of Living Tracker said households on average incomes had Â£52 each less spare cash, a fall of Â£52. Chief executive Richard Lim said it was a ""real concern to see the least affluent families under this amount of pressure even before accounting for the energy price hikes"". ""The most disadvantaged households will experience the brunt of the crisis,"" he added. Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, which focuses on those on lower incomes, warned the cost of living crisis would ""continue to worsen before it starts to ease at some point next year"". He said with wages not keeping pace with rising prices, people were facing ""the biggest squeeze since the mid-70s."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know this is a worrying time for many families, which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around Â£22bn in this financial year, including for the most vulnerable through our Household Support Fund."" But Labour criticised the government for increasing taxes when ""the cost of living is hitting households hard"". Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called for ""unfair tax hikes"" to be immediately reversed and said people needed ""urgent help"" with energy bills. And the SNP said the ""cost of living crisis continues to spiral out of control with no sign of the UK government stepping up to the challenge to protect families and households"".

The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US military aid  'Crime scene' call  Mariupol latest  This is Nathan Williams and Gareth Evans in London handing over to our colleagues Jude Sheerin in Washington DC and Max Matza in Seattle. The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk.

They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier

"Sir David Amess was fatally stabbed during a constituency surgery in October IS fanatic Ali Harbi Ali has been given a whole-life sentence for murdering Sir David Amess MP. Ali stabbed the Conservative MP for Southend West more than 20 times after tricking his way into a constituency surgery in Essex last year. Sir David's family said it broke their hearts that he would have ""greeted the murderer with a smile of friendship"". At the Old Bailey, Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said: ""This was a murder that struck at the heart of our democracy."" Sir David, 69, was killed at the surgery he was holding at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea on 15 October. He was stabbed after 26-year-old Ali had gone into the meeting pretending to be an NHS employee moving to the area. This video can not be played Sir David Amess' murder by Ali Harbi Ali ""sent shockwaves"" through the community Ali, from Kentish Town in north London, told the court he had plans to target various MPs, including cabinet minister Michael Gove. He told his trial he was motivated by a desire to seek revenge against MPs who had voted for airstrikes on Syria. Members of Sir David's family wiped away tears during the 40-minute hearing. After sentencing, they said they felt ""no elation"" in a statement issued through the Metropolitan Police. They added: ""It breaks our heart to know that our husband and father would have greeted the murderer with a smile of friendship and would have been anxious to help. ""How sickening to think what happened next. It is beyond evil."" Two plain clothes officers were the first police to arrive at Belfairs Methodist Church where they detained the suspect Tracy Ayling QC, for Ali, told the court she had been instructed by her client not to say anything in mitigation. Ali pursed his lips briefly but otherwise showed little emotion as the judge handed down his sentence. ""The defendant has no remorse or shame for what he has done - quite the reverse,"" said the judge. He described Sir David's death as a loss ""of national significance"". He added: ""He had done nothing whatsoever to justify the attack upon him, let alone his murder. ""On the contrary, he had devoted 38 years of his life to the lawful service of the public, and was engaged in doing so when he was murdered."" This video can not be played Jurors were shown bodycam footage of plain-clothed police officers tackling Ali Harbi Ali to the ground MPs who had once been on Ali's list of potential targets provided victim impact statements in which they described the effect it had had on their lives. Mike Freer, Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said he and his staff would now wear stab vests and panic alarms for constituency surgeries. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said he had been at home in west London when Ali carried out armed reconnaissance outside in the months prior to attacking Sir David. ""Our security and that of our home was threatened and that has put a profound pressure on our lives,"" he said. MP's shock at being researched by killer Prince Charles presents city status to Southend Tories retain seat in by-election after MP's death The jury took just 18 minutes on Monday to convict Ali of murder and preparing acts of terrorism. During the trial, he said he had no regrets or shame, saying: ""If I thought I did anything wrong, I wouldn't have done it"". The court was told he had planned to die as a ""martyr"", assuming he would be shot by police. Julie Cushion, a long-standing aide and friend of Sir David who was at the church, shared her anguish about the killing and said she still felt guilt and anger. In an impact statement read by the prosecution, she said: ""I can still see and hear the sounds and images of the time, like the crashing of furniture. ""I remember the awful feeling of distress while we waited for help - feeling helpless and hopeless as there was nothing I could physically do to help."" She said the look on Ali's face - ""smug, so self-satisfied"" - had stayed with her. She said she was now working for the constituency's new MP and was haunted by the fear of a similar attack. Conservative Anna Firth, who won the by-election in February, welcomed Ali's whole-life sentence. She said Sir David's ""incredible work and legacy will live on through the many charities and good causes he championed"". The judge imposed a whole-life sentence, as opposed to a life sentence with a minimum term, which means Ali will not be considered for parole and will never be released from prison. Others serving whole-life sentences include sexual predator Wayne Couzens, whoraped and murdered Sarah Everard in London, far-right extremist Thomas Mair, whomurdered Labour MP Jo Cox, andIpswich serial killer Steve Wright.

"Tesco profits more than trebled last year amid rising sales and a fall in  Covid-related costs. The UK's largest supermarket chain reported pre-tax profits of Â£2.03bn, up from Â£636m the previous year. Group sales, excluding fuel, rose by 2.5% to Â£54.8bn, while in the UK retail sales rose by 2.3% year on year. However, Tesco warned of ""significant uncertainties"" and said performance would be affected by the the investment needed to keep prices down. Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Clearly, the external environment has become more challenging in recent months. ""Against a tough backdrop for our customers and with household budgets under pressure, we are laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check - working in close partnership with our suppliers, as well as doing everything we can to reduce our own costs."" Mr Murphy added that Tesco was managing to keep the rise in the cost of living a ""bit under the number for the overall market"". However, products that require a lot of energy to produce are experiencing the highest cost pressures. Tesco accepted a 20% cost price increase in milk from its suppliers less than two weeks ago. However, the UK's largest dairy Arlarecently warnedthat with cost increases of some 36%, farmers faced tough cost challenges.

Commenting on Tesco profits, chief executive of Retail Economics, Richard Lim said the increases were ""mightily impressive"". As the cost of living crisis continues, Mr Lim said many shoppers would be trading down to own-label brands, switching retailers and scaling back on premium purchases. However, he said Tesco was ""well-positioned"", given the ""competitive advantage"" offered by its loyalty scheme and ""meaningful negotiating power"" it had with suppliers. Tesco online business was lower as sales declined by 6.5% because some customers chose to return to shopping in stores as the pandemic eased.

"This video can not be played Footage shows panicked crowds on NYC subway New York City police have named ""a person of interest"" after a morning rush-hour shooting at a subway station that left more than 20 people injured. Police said they were looking for Frank R James, 62, in connection with the attack as he had rented a U-Haul van that may be linked to the shooting. The key to the van, rented in Philadelphia, was found at the scene. ""We are looking to determine if he has any connection to the train,"" NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said. The New York Police Department (NYPD) asked ""anyone with information on his whereabouts"" to call a hotline. Mr James has not been named as a suspect in the attack. Being identified as a person of interest means police believe he may have information concerning the crime. Police say Frank R James rented a van that may be linked to the shooting The New York Times reports that Mr James, who has addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia, appears to have posted dozens of videos on social media in recent years, in which he expresses bigoted views. More recently he had also criticised New York City Mayor Eric Adams. In a briefing late on Tuesday, police gave more details of the incident which saw a male attacker detonate two smoke grenades and open fire at Brooklyn's 36th Street station. The attack unfolded shortly before 08:30 local time (12:30 GMT) on Tuesday, and police said the man had a Glock 9 mm semi-automatic handgun. ""He then fired that weapon at least 33 times, striking 10 people,"" police chief Mr Essig said. Seven men and three women were shot. Images from the scene showed bloodied passengers lying on the floor of the smoke-filled station. Another 13 people ""suffered injuries related to smoke inhalation, falling down or a panic attack"", the police chief said. All of the victims are expected to survive. ""The male then fled the scene, and detectives are actively trying to determine his whereabouts,"" Ms Essig said. Investigators found the Glock handgun, three extended magazines, a hatchet and a range of potential incendiary devices at the scene. A $50,000 (Â£38,450) reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the suspect. Police say the gunman was roughly 5ft 5in tall and 170lb (77kg). He was said to be wearing a construction vest, grey hooded sweatshirt, and a gas mask. The attacker's motive was not immediately known. Law enforcement officers stand guard at the scene of the shooting in the Brooklyn borough of New York City New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said earlier on Tuesday that the shooting was not initially being treated as an act of terrorism. Witnesses have described hearing people shouting for medical assistance and fleeing in panic. Brooklyn resident Yayha Ibrahim said he saw people running from the 36th Street station. ""I saw a lady, she was shot right in her leg and she was screaming for help,"" he told Reuters news agency. Rescue workers ""did a good job of coming quick and fast, and the ambulance came in and they took her"", he added. ""My subway door opened into calamity. It was smoke and blood and people screaming,"" eyewitness Sam Carcamo told the Associated Press. He added that a billow of smoke poured out of the train once its doors opened. Images shared on social media showed injured people inside the smoke-filled station Initial police investigations into what happened may have been hampered by a failure in the station's surveillance system. ""At that particular station there appeared to be some form of malfunction with the camera system,"" Mayor Adams later said. Responding to the attack, President Joe Biden expressed gratitude to ""all the first responders who jumped into action, including civilians who didn't hesitate to help their fellow passengers."" US cities have seen a rise in gun violence over the past two years. ""This insanity that is seizing our city has to stop,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said after the attack. ""We say no more.

"Jude Law, Mads Mikkelsen and Eddie Redmayne star in the latest Harry Potter franchise film References to a gay relationship in the new Fantastic Beasts movie were removed by Warner Bros for Chinese audiences. Six seconds of the third instalment, The Secrets of Dumbledore, which alluded to the romantic past between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, were cut. Harry Potter authorJK Rowling said Dumbledore was gay in 2007,external, but the movies had never explicitly referenced his sexuality until now. The producers, Warner Bros, said the ""spirit of the film remains"". Now in the Chinese version of the new movie, the edited-out dialogue between Jude Law's titular character and Grindelwald, played by Mads Mikkelsen, contained the lines ""because I was in love with you"" and ""the summer Gellert and I fell in love"". The rest of the film remained the same, including an understanding that the characters share an intimate bond. In a statement to Variety,external, Warner Bros said it was ""committed to safeguarding the integrity of every film we release"" and that that sometimes meant ""sensitively"" making ""nuanced cuts"" for certain markets. ""Our hope is to release our features worldwide as released by their creators but historically we have faced small edits made in local markets,"" they said. ""In the case of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, a six-second cut was requested and Warner Bros accepted those changes to comply with local requirements but the spirit of the film remains intact."" ""We want audiences everywhere in the world to see and enjoy this film, and it's important to us that Chinese audiences have the opportunity to experience it as well, even with these minor edits,"" it added.

Homosexuality has been legal in China for more than two decades and the Chinese Society of Psychiatry stopped classifying it as a mental disorder in 2001. But same-sex marriage is not recognised, and some LGBT people still struggle for acceptance, especially when it comes to close family members with traditional expectations. A report by the United Nations Development Programme in 2016 found no more than 15% of LGBT people in China come out to their close family members. ""Some people who have already come out successfully are proud,"" Xie Xiao, a member of CINEMQ, a queer cinema collective based in Shanghai,told the BBC in 2020. ""Meanwhile some people are scared to death of whether their family members know anything about their sexuality.""

"Tesco profits more than trebled last year amid rising sales and a fall in  Covid-related costs. The UK's largest supermarket chain reported pre-tax profits of Â£2.03bn, up from Â£636m the previous year. Group sales, excluding fuel, rose by 2.5% to Â£54.8bn, while in the UK retail sales rose by 2.3% year on year. However, Tesco warned of ""significant uncertainties"" and said performance would be affected by the the investment needed to keep prices down. Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Clearly, the external environment has become more challenging in recent months. ""Against a tough backdrop for our customers and with household budgets under pressure, we are laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check - working in close partnership with our suppliers, as well as doing everything we can to reduce our own costs."" Mr Murphy added that Tesco was managing to keep the rise in the cost of living a ""bit under the number for the overall market"". However, products that require a lot of energy to produce are experiencing the highest cost pressures. Tesco accepted a 20% cost price increase in milk from its suppliers less than two weeks ago. However, the UK's largest dairy Arlarecently warnedthat with cost increases of some 36%, farmers faced tough cost challenges. Mr Murphy said strong product availability had been maintained but added that products such as sunflower oil were a challenge due to the war in Ukraine. Tesco staff to see pay rise to Â£10.10 an hour Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco It is also said customer behaviour is also returning to more normal patterns as shoppers rely less on supermarket trips as the UK emerges from the pandemic. Commenting on Tesco profits, chief executive of Retail Economics, Richard Lim said the increases were ""mightily impressive"". As the cost of living crisis continues, Mr Lim said many shoppers would be trading down to own-label brands, switching retailers and scaling back on premium purchases. However, he said Tesco was ""well-positioned"", given the ""competitive advantage"" offered by its loyalty scheme and ""meaningful negotiating power"" it had with suppliers.

"Former counter-terrorism officer Tony Thorne says he warned his bosses about faults in the intelligence software in 2014 A key intelligence database used by police to investigate extremists was ""not fit for purpose"" when introduced in 2014, a former counter-terrorism officer has told the BBC. The officer, who retired in 2018, says the National Common Intelligence Application (NCIA) had serious flaws. Counter Terrorism Policing says ""substantial improvements"" were made following a significant review after terror attacks in 2017, including at the Manchester Arena. BBC Newsnight has collaborated with BuzzFeed News on a detailed investigation into problems with the IT system, which cost hundreds of millions of pounds and was designed to allow police forces across the UK to share secret intelligence seamlessly. Former detective constable Tony Thorne, who was part of a pilot project in 2013, told the BBC the NCIA was known to be ""clunky"", ""clumsy"" and to produce inconsistent results. During the pilot, Mr Thorne said users sitting side-by-side at computer terminals were watched while they conducted identical searches. When these searches yielded different results Mr Thorne says he was immediately concerned. ""They came up with different data - the bio details that were coming back were completely different,"" he said. ""There was something wrong there."" He told BBC Newsnight the 2013 trial also found that the system allowed data to be destroyed as users could accidentally overwrite it - and that there was no way of monitoring if any information had been altered. Mr Thorne said he tested this by accessing an intelligence file. ""I was able to go in and edit it, and it couldn't be unedited. I said, 'We shouldn't be able to do that.'"" ""To have [intelligence data] in one area is a fantastic thing - it can't get lost, it backs up,"" he continued, ""but from the very start the application was just not fit for purpose."" The NCIA system roll-out to police forces began in 2014. Delays meant the Metropolitan Police did not receive it until 2019, but it had been deployed to the north-west before the Manchester Arena bomb attack that killed 22 people on 22 May 2017. Apublic inquiry,externalinto the bombing is still under way. Top row (left to right): Alison Howe, Martyn Hett, Lisa Lees, Courtney Boyle, Eilidh MacLeod, Elaine McIver, Georgina Callander, Jane Tweddle - Middle row (left to right): John Atkinson, Kelly Brewster, Liam Curry, Chloe Rutherford, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Megan Hurley, Michelle Kiss - Bottom row (left to right): Nell Jones, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Philip Tron, Saffie-Rose Roussos, Sorrell Leczkowski, Wendy Fawell A government spokesperson told the BBC: ""It is a matter for the chair of the Manchester Arena Inquiry to decide whether the systems Counter Terrorismâ¯Policing used impacted their ability to prevent the attack."" The spokesperson added that the NCIA has ""greatly enhanced"" counter-terrorism work in the years since the bombing in 2017. But Tony Thorne says it was rolled out too quickly and put to use before faults had been corrected. ""It should never have gone out,"" he said. Mr Thorne says he felt ""physically sick"" when he heard news bulletins about the Manchester Arena bombing, because he feared the faults he'd warned his bosses about in 2014 could have played a part in the failure to stop the attack. ""I couldn't 100% say, 'Yes, NCIA was the cause of it,' but it'd be a factor,"" he said. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Most of the evidence about intelligence handling was heard in secret at the inquiry. But lawyers for families of some of the victims said it was already clear from what had been made public that there were""multiple opportunities to uncover and prevent the outrage"". Members of Salman Abedi's family were known supporters of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, proscribed in 2005 for links to al-Qaeda Four days before the attack, Abedi travelled back from Libya but wasn't questioned On two occasions, MI5 failed to act on highly relevant intelligence received in the months before the attack. It was thought to involve criminality and its significance was not fully appreciated at the time Counter-terrorism police had 1,300 text messages on file which Abedi had exchanged withAbdalraouf Abdallah- who had been arrested for terrorism offences and would later be convicted. But police say they only identified Abedi by name after the attack BBC Newsnight spoke to the father of the youngest person to be killed in the Manchester Arena bombing, Saffie Roussos. Andrew Roussos was deeply critical of counter-terrorism police and the security service MI5 when he gave evidence to the public inquiry. Andrew Roussos' eight-year-old daughter was killed when a suicide bomber detonated a home-made explosive at the end of an Ariana Grande concert He told the BBC: ""If you don't join the dots then how is our country going to be secure? We're talking about who's in front of you and the evidence you're already looking through. ""He even states his name within that text message,"" he continued, referring to the exchanges between Abedi and Abdallah, in which Abedi gave his full name and discussed martyrdom. Families say trailing Abedi would have led to bomb Bomber's messages held 'for years' before attack Mr Roussos praised Tony Thorne for raising his concerns: ""I want to give him a hug. I want to shake his hand. I commend people that will come forward and say, 'You know what, guys?' This is wrong."" Counter Terrorism Policing, who oversee the work of counter-terrorism units around the UK, did not deny that there had been significant problems with the NCIA database, but said that after 2017: ""Thirty-two late-stage terror attacks have been disrupted and saved many lives"", adding that the ""NCIA has been an essential tool in helping us achieve this"". Tony Thorne says he has spoken out about the NCIA programme and the people who ran it in the interest of informing the public. He has not divulged anything which would be damaging to national security - nor given any information, intelligence or methods that would jeopardise or threaten national security.

"Jude Law, Mads Mikkelsen and Eddie Redmayne star in the latest Harry Potter franchise film References to a gay relationship in the new Fantastic Beasts movie were removed by Warner Bros for Chinese audiences. Six seconds of the third instalment, The Secrets of Dumbledore, which alluded to the romantic past between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, were cut. Harry Potter authorJK Rowling said Dumbledore was gay in 2007,external, but the movies had never explicitly referenced his sexuality until now. The producers, Warner Bros, said the ""spirit of the film remains"". Now in the Chinese version of the new movie, the edited-out dialogue between Jude Law's titular character and Grindelwald, played by Mads Mikkelsen, contained the lines ""because I was in love with you"" and ""the summer Gellert and I fell in love"". The rest of the film remained the same, including an understanding that the characters share an intimate bond. In a statement to Variety,external, Warner Bros said it was ""committed to safeguarding the integrity of every film we release"" and that that sometimes meant ""sensitively"" making ""nuanced cuts"" for certain markets. ""Our hope is to release our features worldwide as released by their creators but historically we have faced small edits made in local markets,"" they said. ""In the case of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, a six-second cut was requested and Warner Bros accepted those changes to comply with local requirements but the spirit of the film remains intact."" ""We want audiences everywhere in the world to see and enjoy this film, and it's important to us that Chinese audiences have the opportunity to experience it as well, even with these minor edits,"" it added.

Homosexuality has been legal in China for more than two decades and the Chinese Society of Psychiatry stopped classifying it as a mental disorder in 2001. But same-sex marriage is not recognised, and some LGBT people still struggle for acceptance, especially when it comes to close family members with traditional expectations. A report by the United Nations Development Programme in 2016 found no more than 15% of LGBT people in China come out to their close family members. ""Some people who have already come out successfully are proud,"" Xie Xiao, a member of CINEMQ, a queer cinema collective based in Shanghai,told the BBC in 2020.

"The US has announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine President Biden says the support will include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected ""wider assault"" in the east This comes after Ukraine's President Zelensky made another impassioned plea for heavy weaponry Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan says Ukraine is ""a crime scene"" He made the comments on a visit to the town of Bucha, where images of streets strewn with bodies shocked the world And a report from the OSCE says Russia carried out international human rights violations in Ukraine Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons, we are moving our live coverage. Please join usat the new webpage here. The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US military aid  'Crime scene' call  Mariupol latest  This is Nathan Williams and Gareth Evans in London handing over to our colleagues Jude Sheerin in Washington DC and Max Matza in Seattle. The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999995
"Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, driven by a sharp increase in petrol and diesel costs. The UK inflation rate rose to 7% in the year to March, the highest rate since 1992 and up from 6.2% in February. Prices are rising faster than wages and there is pressure on the government to do more to help those struggling. The cost of living is expected to rise even further after the energy price cap was increased, driving up gas and electricity bills for millions. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? 'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices' Tesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble Student loan interest rate to hit 12% in England Fuel had the biggest impact on the inflation rate, with average petrol prices rising by 12.6p per litre between February and March, the largest monthly rise since records began in 1990,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. This compares with a rise of 3.5p per litre between the same months of 2021. Diesel prices also rose by 18.8p per litre this year, compared with a rise of 3.5p per litre a year ago. The rise in the inflation rate was higher than the 6.7% expected by analysts and was also driven up by furniture, restaurant and food prices. The figures for March do not yet reflect the average Â£700-a-year increase in energy bills thattook place from 1 April when the energy price cap was raised. Sara Gerritsma says her petrol costs have shot up by about Â£120 a month Since late last year, prices have been rising fast as pandemic restrictions have been eased and firms face higher energy and shipping costs which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now adding to the pain, as the price of oil and other commodities climb higher. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters and demand for oil from other producers has increased since the invasion, leading to higher prices. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. Ukraine and Russia are also the world's main suppliers of sunflower oil and the war has hit prices. In the UK, the price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March, according to the ONS. Andrew Selley, chief executive of wholesaler BidFood, which supplies 45,000 caterers and food service businesses across the UK, said increasing electricity, fuel and packaging costs were impacting the price of all its products. But he told the BBC products affected by the war in Ukraine, such as wheat-based foods, sunflower oil, chicken and white fish, were particularly hard hit. ""I've been in the business for over 30 years. I've never seen a situation where everything seems to be going up [in price],"" he said, adding that some of these costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers. The firm had previously sourced a lot of its chicken from Poland but Ukrainian workers had returned to fight in the war and the country was keeping more of its chicken to feed refugees meaning it was now sourcing from other countries, driving prices up by a fifth. Sara Gerritsma, a student from Leicestershire with a partner and six year-old child, said she may have to give up her paramedic degree due to the rising cost of fuel. The 32-year-old only started the three-year course in October but she has a 2.5 hour roundtrip each day to get to university in Northampton, and her petrol costs have shot up by about Â£120 a month. ""It would be really frustrating giving up my course. It was a big decision changing my career at 32,"" Sara told the BBC. ""But recently we have sat down and gone through everything and thought, can I afford to be a full-time student?"" The sharp rise in prices is also putting pressure on businesses. Paul White, who owns the pizzeria 6/CUT in Eccles, Greater Manchester, said the increase in the minimum wage, the end of VAT relief, and rising fuel and food prices have all hit his company. The restaurant is also spending Â£500 more a week on its energy bills. ""We need to find an extra Â£1,400 a week to cover the costs of everything that's come on in the last few weeks,"" he told the BBC. He says he will have to put up prices, and is looking to charge each customer about 50p to Â£1 extra to cover his rising overheads. But he is also worried people might start eating out less as their budgets are squeezed. This is no longer a cost of living squeeze, but a financial throttling for many people. Price rises are accelerating and their wages, benefits and pensions are failing to keep pace. In the words of the ONS, there were ""no large offsetting downward contributions"" to the inflation rate. In other words, nothing is getting significantly cheaper. So avoidance of price rises is impossible. Even if you do not have a car and are avoiding surging fuel costs, lots of other necessities are getting more expensive. Experts say the only option is trying to budget as best we can, across every part of our lives. Most importantly, they also stress the importance of seeking early, and free, help before falling into unmanageable debt. Research for the consultancy Retail Economics found the least affluent UK households saw discretionary income fall by 5.2% or Â£26 in March, compared with the same month last year. The Retail Economics-HyperJar Cost of Living Tracker said households on average incomes had Â£52 each less spare cash, a fall of Â£52. Chief executive Richard Lim said it was a ""real concern to see the least affluent families under this amount of pressure even before accounting for the energy price hikes"". ""The most disadvantaged households will experience the brunt of the crisis,"" he added. Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, which focuses on those on lower incomes, warned the cost of living crisis would ""continue to worsen before it starts to ease at some point next year"". He said with wages not keeping pace with rising prices, people were facing ""the biggest squeeze since the mid-70s."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know this is a worrying time for many families, which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around Â£22bn in this financial year, including for the most vulnerable through our Household Support Fund."" But Labour criticised the government for increasing taxes when ""the cost of living is hitting households hard"". Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called for ""unfair tax hikes"" to be immediately reversed and said people needed ""urgent help"" with energy bills. And the SNP said the ""cost of living crisis continues to spiral out of control with no sign of the UK government stepping up to the challenge to protect families and households"".

"iPhone users at a shopping mall in China A major producer of Apple's iPhone has become the latest manufacturer to halt operations because of the lockdown in Shanghai. Technology company Pegatron says it has temporarily suspended production at two of its factories in China. The announcement came even as authorities eased some of Shanghai's coronavirus regulations on Tuesday. It means that some of the city's 25 million people are able to leave their homes for the first time in weeks. The city was locked down in late March after infections surged in the key manufacturing and financial hub. In a stock exchange filing Pegatron said it had halted operations at its factories in Shanghai and nearby Kunshan ""in response to Covid-19 prevention requirements from local government"". The company said it would work with authorities ""to resume the operations as soon as possible"". Major Apple MacBook manufacturer Quanta, and iPad maker Compal Electronics, have also paused activities in Chinese cities, according to Japanese newspaper Nikkei. Pegatron did not give any further details when contacted for comment by the BBC. Apple, Quanta and Compal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shanghai's U-turn on its Covid approach Shanghai lockdown residents 'running out of food' Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said he expected the shutdowns to have an impact on production. He estimated that the production of 3 million iPhones has been affected so far this month, ""with more to come if this continues"". Mr Ives also told the BBC that production of 2 million iPads and 1 million MacBooks may also be affected. ""The Pegatron closures throw gasoline on the raging fire which is the supply chain for Apple and other parts of the iPhone ecosystem,"" he said. ""This amplifies supply chain issues for iPhones."" Another Taiwanese company Foxconn, which also assembles iPhones for Apple, halted operations at its factory in Shenzhen last month. It shifted production to other manufacturing sites, while resuming operations in Shenzhen with employees working in a closed loop system, which saw staff living and working at the plant. Since the pandemic began in 2019, China has enforced shutdowns affecting millions of people in major cities including Xi'an and Wuhan. The lockdown of Shanghai is the largest to date and the city is a key centre for the financial industry, manufacturing and home to the world's biggest port.

"Gilbert Gottfried was a US stand-up comedian and actor Stars including Amy Schumer, Mark Hamill and Seth MacFarlane have led the tributes to ""one-of-a-kind"" US comic and actor Gilbert Gottfried, after he died aged 67 following a long illness. The stand-up comedian was known for voicing the wise-cracking parrot Iago in Disney's 1992 animated film Aladdin. He also appeared in films like Problem Child, Look Who's Talking Too and Beverly Hills Cop II. ""Gilbert was so sweet. Genuinely kind, a legend,"" actress Schumer posted. Stars Wars star Hamill also shared a tribute online. ""He was a unique voice in comedy on so many levels,"" he wrote, ""Unpredictable, one-of-a-kind, hilarious & irreplaceable!""

""I am so sad to read about the passing of Gilbert Gottfried,""she wrote, alongside a picture of them together,external. ""Funny, politically incorrect but a softie on the inside."" ""We met many times; he even pranked me on a plane, replacing my interpreter Jack Jason (they're like twins). The stand-up comedian and actor was known for his roles in Aladdin and Problem Child Gottfried was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of a hardware store owner, and began performing stand-up aged 15, before going on to write and perform sketches on Saturday Night Live. Later moving into movies, he played accountant Sidney Bernstein in the 1987 film Beverly Hills Cop II, which reunited him with his former SNL colleague Eddie Murphy. In the early 1990s, he got his major breakout role as the adoption agent Igor Peabody in the dark US comedy sleeper hit film Problem Child and its sequel Problem Child 2; and then portrayed the parrot Iago in Aladdin.

""You'd think that maybe he was a guy who worked in the back of a library, putting books onto the racks,"" he said. ""He was just the nicest, quietest little guy, and then you'd say action, and like an atomic bomb, he would just explode."" The director recalled how he had to stand up to studio executives to allow him to let the camera roll on after takes in order to catch some of Gottfried's improvisations. ""So they were yelling, 'What are you doing there? You're way over budget on film.' And I go, 'Well, we're doing a comedy, right?' And they go, 'Yeah.' And I said, 'Well, we got Gilbert Gottfried',"" he explained. ""And when I'd say action, Gilbert Gottfried does the script, and then he just starts going. You don't say cut. You just let him go. [I'd say] 'Don't look at how long it is - watch the film, and see what you think.' And so they called me back, and they go, 'All right. You're OK because he's that funny.'"" Producer Dara Kravitz and her husband in 2017 As his comedic style developed, Gottfried became well-known for his exaggerated shrill squawking voice, squintingand an emphasis on shocking humour,external- courting controversy for an endless series of crude jokes at 1991 Emmys ceremony, as well as gags about 9/11.

"The US has announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine President Biden says the support will include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected ""wider assault"" in the east This comes after Ukraine's President Zelensky made another impassioned plea for heavy weaponry Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan says Ukraine is ""a crime scene"" He made the comments on a visit to the town of Bucha, where images of streets strewn with bodies shocked the world And a report from the OSCE says Russia carried out international human rights violations in Ukraine Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons, we are moving our live coverage. Please join usat the new webpage here. The Moskva, pictured in 2008 Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry. A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand. The statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship. ""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."" It did not specify the cause of the fire. But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa. Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board. The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to ""go to hell"", before they were ultimately taken prisoner. Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw
from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW,
Marie-Luise Wolff, has said. There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the
Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the
Russian side. It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders,but Kyiv had told him he was not
welcome due to his close ties with Russiaand his support for
the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to
Germany. ""We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from
Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an
ambitious timetable,"" Wolff said. Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy
supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022
growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in
Ukraine. In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever. ""Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever,"" he says. Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: ""All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. ""To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. ""Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."" He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: ""The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."" Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US military aid  'Crime scene' call  Mariupol latest  This is Nathan Williams and Gareth Evans in London handing over to our colleagues Jude Sheerin in Washington DC and Max Matza in Seattle. The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory. ""We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory,"" the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing. ""If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv,"" it added. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month. As we reported earlier, war crimes prosecutors have been visiting the site of civilian killings in Bucha. Images of the town's streets strewn with bodies shocked the world earlier this month, and local officials say hundreds of civilians were killed and buried in mass graves. ""We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed,"" the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told reporters earlier. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,â Khan later wrote on Twitter. He also described Ukraine as a ""crime scene"". Khan has been pictured visiting the site of a mass burial in Bucha. A Ukrainian soldier mans a Howitzer for drills in Kharkiv in June 2021 The $800m worth of US weaponry pledged by President Biden on Wednesday to Ukraine includes artillery and radar systems that may require ""additional training"" for Ukrainian troops. ""The systems that will probably require some additional training for Ukrainian forces are the howitzers (and) ... the counter artillery radar,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The radar system, he said, is ""not a very difficult system to operate, but it's not one that they have in their inventory"". Howitzers are a type of relatively short-barrelled cannon, used to lob shells into enemy lines. According to the US Defense Department, the shipment will include 18 Howitzers along with 40,000 artillery rounds. It will also include hundreds of missiles and Switchblade drones - also known as kamikaze drones due to the way they can be flown into their target. The US is also sending 11 helicopters, hundreds of armoured vehicles, anti-personnel mines, body armour and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment. The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials. The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" he said. On the first day of the invasion, the small garrisonrefused calls from the ship for it to surrender, telling the ship to ""go to hell"". Earlier on Wednesday a fire was reported on the ship. Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel. He said the ship could have as many as 510 crew members on board. Presidents Zelensky held talks with the presidents of Poland and the Baltic states The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have become the latest world leaders to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine. They also visited the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv. Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch said the aim of the trip was to show support to President Zelensky and the defenders of Ukraine ""in a decisive moment"". Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said it was ""hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-Century Europe"". The four presidents also met Ukrainan Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal during a visit to Borodyanka President Biden made the announcement after a phone call with President Zelensky The US is to send an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine. The announcement follows a phone call between Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden. Biden said the support would include new weapons tailored to combat Russiaâs expected âwider assaultâ in the east of Ukraine. The package also includes helicopters and what Biden called ânew capabilitiesâ such as artillery systems and armoured personnel carriers. Senior US defence officials say the total military aid provided by the US now stands at more than $3bn. Biden has said the weaponry supplied so far has helped ensure the failure of Russiaâs initial war aims. But he added it was not the time to rest, saying: âI assured President Zelenskyy that the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people."" It is ""at least plausible"" to consider whether genocide could be an issue in relation to the war in Ukraine, according to a legal expert. As we have been reporting,US President Joe Biden has said there was evidence of genocidal acts by Russian troops in Ukraine. This was the first time he used the word genocide - defined under international law as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. Philippe Sands QC said to prove ""genocidal intent"" was ""very difficult"" in court. But speaking on BBC Radio 4, the lawyer and University College London professor said: ""I understand why both President Zelensky and President Biden are now using this word, because this is wrongdoing on a scale that is so great that I think it is at least plausible to raise the genocide issue.â We have reports of more people being killed in Ukraine's north-eastern region of Kharkiv. At
least seven people were killed and 22 wounded by shelling in the past 24 hours, according to Kharkiv's governor Oleh Synegubov. He has also said thatUkrainian troops have shot down two Russian planesthat attacked the region. Kharkiv - which sits near the border - has been under attack since the start of the war. But unlike regions further to the west, which have seen Russian troops move away in recent days, it is still in the firing line. This is because of its position on the edge of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, the area Russia hopes to take in its next offensive. The UN chief said there was more to be done to guarantee the safety of Ukrainian evacuees A potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appears unlikely at this stage, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said. He told reporters this afternoon: ""At the present moment a global ceasefire in Ukraine doesn't
seem possible."" Instead, he said the UN was focusing its efforts on supporting evacuees and boosting humanitarian aid. Guterres said the UN had made proposals to Russia to
""bring the parties together... to manage"" humanitarian access and the evacuation of civilians, but had not yet received a response from Moscow. ""There are lots of things that can be done in order to
guarantee evacuation of civilians,"" he said. Donetsk Regional Police have shared footage of the moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk. This video can not be played War in Ukraine: The moment a puppy is rescued from the rubble If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments: US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have just spoken by phone. They discussed additional defensive and
financial aid for Ukraine as well as tightening sanctions and alleged Russian
war crimes, Zelensky wrote on Twitter. It comes after the Ukrainian president made another impassioned plea to the West to send heavy weaponry to repel Russian aggression. In an online English-language address, he said Ukraine needed heavy artillery, armoured vehicles, tanks, air defence systems and combat aircraft. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech foreign
ministry says its diplomats have returned to the embassy in Kyiv for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The
ministry tweeted a photo of three diplomats raising the Czech flag in front of
the building. In a statement,
the ministry said it was one of the many steps the country was taking to show its
support for Ukraine. It would always stand with Ukraine, it
said. The Czech
Republic has been one of the more muscular supporters of Ukraine as it defends
itself from Russian aggression. It was the first Nato or EU country to send tanks
to the country, while a crowd-funding effort organised by the Ukrainian Embassy
and the Czech Defence Ministry to buy weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces
has approached 1bn Czech koruna, (Â£34m, 41m euros).  Russia has shifted the focus of its invasion to eastern Ukraine after withdrawing forces from Kyiv and the north. And in recent days, Ukrainian officials have warned that it is preparing to launch a new offensive in the east targeting the Donbas region. This has led analysts to examine Russian military activity around eastern Ukraine more closely. These satellite images from Maxar show Russian military vehicles assembling just 8km (5 miles) from the border. Territory in the region has been seized back from Russian troops More than 100 civilians have been killed in the north-eastern Sumy region -
according to its military chief. Dmytro Zhyvytsky said many corpses were discovered with their
hands tied. Some showed signs of torture or gunshot wounds to the head. He alleged that invading Russian soldiers had ""fired on
everyone"", including the elderly and children. Many people from the city were missing or had been
captured, he added. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these claims. The discoveries in Sumy appear reminiscent of atrocities
uncovered in Bucha. Russia has repeatedly denied committing any war crimes
there. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court earlier
labelled Ukraine a ""crime scene"" after visiting Bucha. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9292554
"Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, driven by a sharp increase in petrol and diesel costs. The UK inflation rate rose to 7% in the year to March, the highest rate since 1992 and up from 6.2% in February. Prices are rising faster than wages and there is pressure on the government to do more to help those struggling. The cost of living is expected to rise even further after the energy price cap was increased, driving up gas and electricity bills for millions. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? 'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices' Tesco vows to rein in prices as profits treble Student loan interest rate to hit 12% in England Fuel had the biggest impact on the inflation rate, with average petrol prices rising by 12.6p per litre between February and March, the largest monthly rise since records began in 1990,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. This compares with a rise of 3.5p per litre between the same months of 2021. Diesel prices also rose by 18.8p per litre this year, compared with a rise of 3.5p per litre a year ago. The rise in the inflation rate was higher than the 6.7% expected by analysts and was also driven up by furniture, restaurant and food prices. The figures for March do not yet reflect the average Â£700-a-year increase in energy bills thattook place from 1 April when the energy price cap was raised. Sara Gerritsma says her petrol costs have shot up by about Â£120 a month Since late last year, prices have been rising fast as pandemic restrictions have been eased and firms face higher energy and shipping costs which they have passed on to consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now adding to the pain, as the price of oil and other commodities climb higher. Russia is one of the world's largest oil exporters and demand for oil from other producers has increased since the invasion, leading to higher prices. Although the UK imports just 6% of its crude oil from Russia, it is still affected when global prices rise. Ukraine and Russia are also the world's main suppliers of sunflower oil and the war has hit prices. In the UK, the price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March, according to the ONS. Andrew Selley, chief executive of wholesaler BidFood, which supplies 45,000 caterers and food service businesses across the UK, said increasing electricity, fuel and packaging costs were impacting the price of all its products. But he told the BBC products affected by the war in Ukraine, such as wheat-based foods, sunflower oil, chicken and white fish, were particularly hard hit. ""I've been in the business for over 30 years. I've never seen a situation where everything seems to be going up [in price],"" he said, adding that some of these costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers. The firm had previously sourced a lot of its chicken from Poland but Ukrainian workers had returned to fight in the war and the country was keeping more of its chicken to feed refugees meaning it was now sourcing from other countries, driving prices up by a fifth. Sara Gerritsma, a student from Leicestershire with a partner and six year-old child, said she may have to give up her paramedic degree due to the rising cost of fuel. The 32-year-old only started the three-year course in October but she has a 2.5 hour roundtrip each day to get to university in Northampton, and her petrol costs have shot up by about Â£120 a month. ""It would be really frustrating giving up my course. It was a big decision changing my career at 32,"" Sara told the BBC. ""But recently we have sat down and gone through everything and thought, can I afford to be a full-time student?"" The sharp rise in prices is also putting pressure on businesses. Paul White, who owns the pizzeria 6/CUT in Eccles, Greater Manchester, said the increase in the minimum wage, the end of VAT relief, and rising fuel and food prices have all hit his company. The restaurant is also spending Â£500 more a week on its energy bills. ""We need to find an extra Â£1,400 a week to cover the costs of everything that's come on in the last few weeks,"" he told the BBC. He says he will have to put up prices, and is looking to charge each customer about 50p to Â£1 extra to cover his rising overheads. But he is also worried people might start eating out less as their budgets are squeezed. This is no longer a cost of living squeeze, but a financial throttling for many people. Price rises are accelerating and their wages, benefits and pensions are failing to keep pace. In the words of the ONS, there were ""no large offsetting downward contributions"" to the inflation rate. In other words, nothing is getting significantly cheaper. So avoidance of price rises is impossible. Even if you do not have a car and are avoiding surging fuel costs, lots of other necessities are getting more expensive. Experts say the only option is trying to budget as best we can, across every part of our lives. Most importantly, they also stress the importance of seeking early, and free, help before falling into unmanageable debt. Research for the consultancy Retail Economics found the least affluent UK households saw discretionary income fall by 5.2% or Â£26 in March, compared with the same month last year. The Retail Economics-HyperJar Cost of Living Tracker said households on average incomes had Â£52 each less spare cash, a fall of Â£52. Chief executive Richard Lim said it was a ""real concern to see the least affluent families under this amount of pressure even before accounting for the energy price hikes"". ""The most disadvantaged households will experience the brunt of the crisis,"" he added. Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, which focuses on those on lower incomes, warned the cost of living crisis would ""continue to worsen before it starts to ease at some point next year"". He said with wages not keeping pace with rising prices, people were facing ""the biggest squeeze since the mid-70s."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know this is a worrying time for many families, which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around Â£22bn in this financial year, including for the most vulnerable through our Household Support Fund."" But Labour criticised the government for increasing taxes when ""the cost of living is hitting households hard"". Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called for ""unfair tax hikes"" to be immediately reversed and said people needed ""urgent help"" with energy bills. And the SNP said the ""cost of living crisis continues to spiral out of control with no sign of the UK government stepping up to the challenge to protect families and households"".

I've never seen a situation where everything seems to be going up [in price],"" he said, adding that some of these costs would ultimately be passed on to consumers. The firm had previously sourced a lot of its chicken from Poland but Ukrainian workers had returned to fight in the war and the country was keeping more of its chicken to feed refugees meaning it was now sourcing from other countries, driving prices up by a fifth. Sara Gerritsma, a student from Leicestershire with a partner and six year-old child, said she may have to give up her paramedic degree due to the rising cost of fuel. The 32-year-old only started the three-year course in October but she has a 2.5 hour roundtrip each day to get to university in Northampton, and her petrol costs have shot up by about Â£120 a month. ""It would be really frustrating giving up my course. It was a big decision changing my career at 32,"" Sara told the BBC. ""But recently we have sat down and gone through everything and thought, can I afford to be a full-time student?"" The sharp rise in prices is also putting pressure on businesses. Paul White, who owns the pizzeria 6/CUT in Eccles, Greater Manchester, said the increase in the minimum wage, the end of VAT relief, and rising fuel and food prices have all hit his company. The restaurant is also spending Â£500 more a week on its energy bills. ""We need to find an extra Â£1,400 a week to cover the costs of everything that's come on in the last few weeks,"" he told the BBC. He says he will have to put up prices, and is looking to charge each customer about 50p to Â£1 extra to cover his rising overheads. But he is also worried people might start eating out less as their budgets are squeezed. This is no longer a cost of living squeeze, but a financial throttling for many people. Price rises are accelerating and their wages, benefits and pensions are failing to keep pace. In the words of the ONS, there were ""no large offsetting downward contributions"" to the inflation rate. In other words, nothing is getting significantly cheaper. So avoidance of price rises is impossible. Even if you do not have a car and are avoiding surging fuel costs, lots of other necessities are getting more expensive. Experts say the only option is trying to budget as best we can, across every part of our lives. Most importantly, they also stress the importance of seeking early, and free, help before falling into unmanageable debt. Research for the consultancy Retail Economics found the least affluent UK households saw discretionary income fall by 5.2% or Â£26 in March, compared with the same month last year. The Retail Economics-HyperJar Cost of Living Tracker said households on average incomes had Â£52 each less spare cash, a fall of Â£52. Chief executive Richard Lim said it was a ""real concern to see the least affluent families under this amount of pressure even before accounting for the energy price hikes"". ""The most disadvantaged households will experience the brunt of the crisis,"" he added. Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, which focuses on those on lower incomes, warned the cost of living crisis would ""continue to worsen before it starts to ease at some point next year"". He said with wages not keeping pace with rising prices, people were facing ""the biggest squeeze since the mid-70s."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know this is a worrying time for many families, which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around Â£22bn in this financial year, including for the most vulnerable through our Household Support Fund."" But Labour criticised the government for increasing taxes when ""the cost of living is hitting households hard"". Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called for ""unfair tax hikes"" to be immediately reversed and said people needed ""urgent help"" with energy bills. And the SNP said the ""cost of living crisis continues to spiral out of control with no sign of the UK government stepping up to the challenge to protect families and households"".

"The Edward Colston statue was thrown into Bristol's harbour after being pulled down in June 2020 The acquittal of four people on trial for toppling Bristol's Edward Colston statue has prompted the attorney general to contact the Court of Appeal. Suella Braverman is seeking clarification of the law around what can be used as a defence to criminal charges arising from protests. She said the Colston case has led to ""uncertainty"" and asked for clarification on human rights defences. The referral will not affect the acquittals in the case. Milo Ponsford, 26, Rhian Graham, 30, Jake Skuse, 33, and Sage Willoughby, 22, were charged with criminal damage after the memorial to the slave trader wastoppled on 7 June 2020. (Left to right) Sage Willoughby, Jake Skuse, Milo Ponsford and Rhian Graham were cleared of criminal damage They werecleared after a trialbut the verdict prompted adebate about the criminal justice systemafter the defendants opted to stand trial in front of a jury and did not deny involvement in the incident. The defendants claimed in court that the presence of a statue of a man involved in the slave trade was a hate crime and it was therefore not an offence to remove it. The prosecution argued it was ""irrelevant"" who Colston was and the case was one of straightforward criminal damage. Edward Colston was a member of the Royal African Company and bequeathed his wealth to charities when he died Ms Braverman has contacted the Court of Appeal concerning the scope of defences that can be used for criminal charges arising from protests and the directions which should be given to juries. She said the case has caused uncertainty between the offence of criminal damage and the right to protest peacefully. The Court of Appeal will be asked to clarify the law around whether someone can use a defence related to their human rights when they are accused of criminal damage. ""After careful consideration, I have decided to refer the Colston statue case to the Court of Appeal to clarify the law around protests,"" said Ms Braverman. ""Trial by jury is an important guardian of liberty and critical to that are the legal directions given to the jury. ""It is in the public interest to clarify the points of law raised in these cases for the future. ""This is a legal matter which is separate from the politics of the case involved,"" she added.

"Former counter-terrorism officer Tony Thorne says he warned his bosses about faults in the intelligence software in 2014 A key intelligence database used by police to investigate extremists was ""not fit for purpose"" when introduced in 2014, a former counter-terrorism officer has told the BBC. The officer, who retired in 2018, says the National Common Intelligence Application (NCIA) had serious flaws. Counter Terrorism Policing says ""substantial improvements"" were made following a significant review after terror attacks in 2017, including at the Manchester Arena. BBC Newsnight has collaborated with BuzzFeed News on a detailed investigation into problems with the IT system, which cost hundreds of millions of pounds and was designed to allow police forces across the UK to share secret intelligence seamlessly. Former detective constable Tony Thorne, who was part of a pilot project in 2013, told the BBC the NCIA was known to be ""clunky"", ""clumsy"" and to produce inconsistent results. During the pilot, Mr Thorne said users sitting side-by-side at computer terminals were watched while they conducted identical searches. When these searches yielded different results Mr Thorne says he was immediately concerned. ""They came up with different data - the bio details that were coming back were completely different,"" he said. ""There was something wrong there."" He told BBC Newsnight the 2013 trial also found that the system allowed data to be destroyed as users could accidentally overwrite it - and that there was no way of monitoring if any information had been altered. Mr Thorne said he tested this by accessing an intelligence file. ""I was able to go in and edit it, and it couldn't be unedited. I said, 'We shouldn't be able to do that.'"" ""To have [intelligence data] in one area is a fantastic thing - it can't get lost, it backs up,"" he continued, ""but from the very start the application was just not fit for purpose."" The NCIA system roll-out to police forces began in 2014. Delays meant the Metropolitan Police did not receive it until 2019, but it had been deployed to the north-west before the Manchester Arena bomb attack that killed 22 people on 22 May 2017. Apublic inquiry,externalinto the bombing is still under way.

The spokesperson added that the NCIA has ""greatly enhanced"" counter-terrorism work in the years since the bombing in 2017. But Tony Thorne says it was rolled out too quickly and put to use before faults had been corrected. ""It should never have gone out,"" he said. Mr Thorne says he felt ""physically sick"" when he heard news bulletins about the Manchester Arena bombing, because he feared the faults he'd warned his bosses about in 2014 could have played a part in the failure to stop the attack. ""I couldn't 100% say, 'Yes, NCIA was the cause of it,' but it'd be a factor,"" he said. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Most of the evidence about intelligence handling was heard in secret at the inquiry. But lawyers for families of some of the victims said it was already clear from what had been made public that there were""multiple opportunities to uncover and prevent the outrage"". Members of Salman Abedi's family were known supporters of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, proscribed in 2005 for links to al-Qaeda Four days before the attack, Abedi travelled back from Libya but wasn't questioned On two occasions, MI5 failed to act on highly relevant intelligence received in the months before the attack. It was thought to involve criminality and its significance was not fully appreciated at the time Counter-terrorism police had 1,300 text messages on file which Abedi had exchanged withAbdalraouf Abdallah- who had been arrested for terrorism offences and would later be convicted. But police say they only identified Abedi by name after the attack BBC Newsnight spoke to the father of the youngest person to be killed in the Manchester Arena bombing, Saffie Roussos. Andrew Roussos was deeply critical of counter-terrorism police and the security service MI5 when he gave evidence to the public inquiry. Andrew Roussos' eight-year-old daughter was killed when a suicide bomber detonated a home-made explosive at the end of an Ariana Grande concert He told the BBC: ""If you don't join the dots then how is our country going to be secure? We're talking about who's in front of you and the evidence you're already looking through. ""He even states his name within that text message,"" he continued, referring to the exchanges between Abedi and Abdallah, in which Abedi gave his full name and discussed martyrdom. Families say trailing Abedi would have led to bomb Bomber's messages held 'for years' before attack Mr Roussos praised Tony Thorne for raising his concerns: ""I want to give him a hug. I want to shake his hand. I commend people that will come forward and say, 'You know what, guys?' This is wrong."" Counter Terrorism Policing, who oversee the work of counter-terrorism units around the UK, did not deny that there had been significant problems with the NCIA database, but said that after 2017: ""Thirty-two late-stage terror attacks have been disrupted and saved many lives"", adding that the ""NCIA has been an essential tool in helping us achieve this"". Tony Thorne says he has spoken out about the NCIA programme and the people who ran it in the interest of informing the public. He has not divulged anything which would be damaging to national security - nor given any information, intelligence or methods that would jeopardise or threaten national security.

"iPhone users at a shopping mall in China A major producer of Apple's iPhone has become the latest manufacturer to halt operations because of the lockdown in Shanghai. Technology company Pegatron says it has temporarily suspended production at two of its factories in China. The announcement came even as authorities eased some of Shanghai's coronavirus regulations on Tuesday. It means that some of the city's 25 million people are able to leave their homes for the first time in weeks. The city was locked down in late March after infections surged in the key manufacturing and financial hub. In a stock exchange filing Pegatron said it had halted operations at its factories in Shanghai and nearby Kunshan ""in response to Covid-19 prevention requirements from local government"". The company said it would work with authorities ""to resume the operations as soon as possible"". Major Apple MacBook manufacturer Quanta, and iPad maker Compal Electronics, have also paused activities in Chinese cities, according to Japanese newspaper Nikkei. Pegatron did not give any further details when contacted for comment by the BBC. Apple, Quanta and Compal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shanghai's U-turn on its Covid approach Shanghai lockdown residents 'running out of food' Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said he expected the shutdowns to have an impact on production. He estimated that the production of 3 million iPhones has been affected so far this month, ""with more to come if this continues"". Mr Ives also told the BBC that production of 2 million iPads and 1 million MacBooks may also be affected. ""The Pegatron closures throw gasoline on the raging fire which is the supply chain for Apple and other parts of the iPhone ecosystem,"" he said. ""This amplifies supply chain issues for iPhones."" Another Taiwanese company Foxconn, which also assembles iPhones for Apple, halted operations at its factory in Shenzhen last month. It shifted production to other manufacturing sites, while resuming operations in Shenzhen with employees working in a closed loop system, which saw staff living and working at the plant. Since the pandemic began in 2019, China has enforced shutdowns affecting millions of people in major cities including Xi'an and Wuhan. The lockdown of Shanghai is the largest to date and the city is a key centre for the financial industry, manufacturing and home to the world's biggest port.

"Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in 2018 An ex-policeman who sued his former force after being poisoned in the Salisbury Novichok attack says a financial settlement has been reached. Det Sgt Nick Bailey was the first person to enter the home of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia after they were found poisoned in March 2018. Lawyer Patrick Maguire, who represents Mr Bailey, said the incident had a ""major impact"" on the former officer. He added the settlement with Wiltshire Police felt like a ""huge step forward"". Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived the attack after spending several weeks in hospital Mr Bailey made three attempts to go back to work with his force of 18 years,but left after he said he ""couldn't deal with being in a police environment"". He was contaminated when he touched the door handle of Mr Skripal's home. A spokesman for Wiltshire police said their legal advisors were ""fully engaged in the civil legal process"". ""Although we can confirm that a settlement has now been reached in this case, it would not be appropriate to comment any further,"" he added. ""We wish Nick and his family the very best for the future."" Both Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a bench in the Maltings area of Salisbury but survived the attack. Later Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after she came into contact with a perfume bottle thought to have been used to store the nerve agent and then discarded. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, was left seriously ill but recovered. Dawn Sturgess died after coming into contact with a perfume bottle, thought to have been used in the attack An inquest into Ms Sturgess' death will be heard at a later date. Two Russian nationals have been accused of travelling to the UK to try to murder Mr Skripal with Novichok, smearing the highly toxic substance on the door handle of his home in Salisbury. Thought to be from the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU, they were caught on CCTV in Salisbury the day before the attack.

"Many residents along the coast fear their homes may collapse after mudslides At least 45 people in South Africa have been killed in floods caused by days of heavy rain, the authorities say. It happened in the coastal province of KwaZulu-Natal, where many people are still missing and emergency services are searching for survivors. Some in the city of Durban are standing on rooftops awaiting rescue,but local media report that only one helicopter is available to lift people away,external. Key roads across the city are shut and mudslides have destroyed many homes. It comes asscientists warn that climate change is fuelling heavier rainfall than usual in southern Africa. BBC Africa Live: Updates from the continent The mayor of eThekwini - which is the area including Durban and its surrounding towns - has apologised to residents who were left stranded after the emergency call centre was overwhelmed overnight.
