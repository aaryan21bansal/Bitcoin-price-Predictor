"Arnold Mukueto, Glen Elamo and Hooman Sojoodi were part of a gang found guilty of the violent abduction A naked kidnap victim fought his way out of the boot of a car where a gang was holding him captive as they drove through the streets of Edinburgh. Emmanuel Chidubem Emmanuel struggled with the kidnappers as they tried to force him back into the BMW X5 in front of shocked passers-by. At the High Court in Edinburgh, four men were convicted of assaulting and abducting Mr Emmanuel. Police said it was an ""extremely frightening experience"" for the victim. Mr Emmanuel, 27, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was punched, kicked, and hit with a blunt weapon during his ordeal on 10 February. His clothing was cut and he was stripped, blindfolded and trussed up at a house in the Gilmerton area of the capital. The gang accessed his online bank account and took cash from it before putting him in the car. He was driven through the city streets before he managed to disable the vehicle by pulling out fuses. He fought with his captors after the boot was opened at Buckstone Road. Julie Arbuckle, 47, a social worker, witnessed the incident, which happened in broad daylight at 12:30, and called the police. Giving evidence, she said: ""They were all kicking and punching him and trying to get him into the car. At one point the naked guy, they had got him in the car but he got out the other door."" She said the incident was ""frantic and shocking"". She said the victim kept trying to get away and wriggle from their grasp. ""He looked quite injured,"" she said. ""His whole face was swollen."" The social worker said she shouted at the attackers to get off him because the police were coming and they began to flee the scene. She said Mr Emmanuel came over to her car and said ""thank you"". She told him the police were on their way. Mr Emmanuel told the court he was trussed round the hands, legs and body and a bed sheet was wrapped over him and taped down. ""I think I was gagged with a sock,"" he added. He was then led from the house and put in the boot of the car but started to try and free himself and got his hands out of the bonds. Once he managed to get out of the car, he said he took an object from the boot to use as a weapon to ward off his captors. Hooman Sojoodi, 22, of Enfield, North London, Sanchez Facey, 23, of Edmonton, North London, Glen Elamo, 20, who is serving a prison sentence in England, and Arnold Mukueto, 22, a prisoner, had denied assaulting and abducting Mr Emmanuel. But forensic evidence from fingerprints and DNA linked them to the BMW and the house where the attack began. They will be sentenced next month. After the trial, Det Insp Bruce Coutts said: ""This was an extremely frightening experience for the victim and we believe that the men were intent on causing him serious harm. ""We are extremely grateful to the public and our colleagues from other forces who came forward to provide vital information which helped ensure this conviction.""

"President Trump joked in July that if Tom Price failed on the Republican healthcare plan he would be fired US Health Secretary Tom Price has resigned over the use of expensive private planes for official business. He previously apologised after making 26 private flights since May at a cost of $400,000 (Â£300,000) to taxpayers. Government officials, except those dealing with national security matters, are required to take commercial flights for work related travel. Three other members of President Donald Trump's cabinet are under scrutiny for using private planes while working. A White House statement said President Trump had accepted Mr Price's resignation, adding that Don J Wright had been designated as acting health secretary. Mr Wright is currently deputy assistant secretary for health. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? In his letter of resignation,seen by the New York Times,,externalMr Price said he regretted that ""recent events have created a distraction"" from the work of the health department. An investigation by the political news websitePolitico,externalfound that Mr Price's travels had cost more than $1m (Â£750,000). As well as the $400,000 for private flights, that figure includes the cost of military aircraft used for Mr Price's trips abroad, Politico added. President Trump had earlier said he was ""not happy"" with the expense. Mr Price had promised to repay the cost of his seats on private flights, saying: ""The taxpayers won't pay a dime for my seat on those planes."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington In July Donald Trump joked that if Tom Price didn't get a Republican healthcare plan through Congress, he would be fired. People laughed. Obamacare repeal went down in flames again this week, and Mr Price is out. No-one is laughing now - no Republicans, at least. The situation is more complicated than that, of course. An ever-ballooning price tag for Mr Price's private jet trips became a scandal too big to ignore. The exorbitant spending, breaking with past practices, cut directly against Mr Trump's campaign promise to rein in wasteful spending. If Mr Price had given the president the legislative victory he desperately wanted, the secretary may have been spared. Instead, he was marched to the gallows. The risk for the administration has not passed. Other officials have racked up their own inordinately high travel expenses. Senior presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway was on one of Mr Price's flights - hinting that the scandal may reach inside the White House. The precedent has been established that such extravagances can be a fireable offence. Hours before Mr Price's resignation he told White House reporters: ""He's a very fine man. We're going to make a decision sometime tonight."" Possible candidates to succeed Mr Price include Scott Gottlieb, currently commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Seema Verma, who is administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This video can not be played ""Good man"": Price resignation announced after Trump teases media Three other members of Mr Trump's cabinet are under scrutiny for their use of private planes while on the job: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke flew from Las Vegas to Montana last June on a private jet that cost taxpayers more than $12,000, according to Politico and the Washington Post Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is accused of flying with his wife to view last month's solar eclipse Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt has spent more than $58,000 on non-commercial travel As well as the Vegas-Montana trip - a route served by commercial flights - Mr Zinke is also reported to have used private jets between St Croix and St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands in March, and a military aircraft to travel to Norway in May. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is reported to have used a private jet on a route served by commercial flights Interior department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement that, as with previous interior secretaries, Mr Zinke ""travelled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available"". ""All travel is pre-approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Dame Louise Casey compares the government's Universal Credit welfare plan to ""jumping over a cliff"" Families could be left homeless and destitute if Theresa May insists on pressing ahead with Universal Credit, a former top adviser has warned. Dame Louise Casey urged the prime minister to delay the rollout of the new benefit system so it can be fixed. A dozen Tory MPs are calling for it to be paused, theDaily Telegraph says.,external Official figures show,external24% of new Universal Credit claimants wait longer than six weeks to be paid in full - causing many to fall behind on rent. That could make a big difference to families who were ""close to the edge,"" Dame Louise told the BBC. They ""will end up in dire circumstances, more dire than I think we have seen in this country for years"". Universal Credit 'a factor in rent arrears' The government says the new system, which merges six existing benefits into one, offers extra support and that budgeting and financial help is available. Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Gauke is expected to make a decision in the coming days about whether the rollout should be accelerated. But Dame Louise, who has advised four prime ministers on social policy over the past 18 years, including Mrs May, said the implementation had to be got right. ""I completely agree that we all should be wedded to the principle, and therefore the overall policy, that work should pay,"" she said. But she added: ""If it means that we are looking at more and more people that are ending up homeless, or ending up having their kids taken away, or ending up in more dire circumstances, that cannot be the intention. ""It can't be and it won't be the intention of Theresa May or [First Secretary of State] Damian Green or any of those people. I just don't believe that they would want that to happen."" She suggested ministers were blindly ""pressing on"" with the policy because they did not want to be accused of doing a U-turn. But she said: ""It's like jumping over a cliff - once you have jumped, people end up at the bottom and we don't want that to happen."" This video can not be played Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams ""commends"" Tory rebellion against Universal Credit Garry Dunningham, 24, lives in a tent by the river in Great Yarmouth. He says he and his girlfriend were evicted from their shared flat about six months ago once their landlord found out they were on Universal Credit. ""Basically because we were on Universal Credit and he's had a lot of people not paying the rent... we got kicked out."" Garry says he has tried 58 private landlords across the town but no-one will take them. ""As soon as I go to meet them and say I am on Universal Credit, it's a no: 'We ain't got no rooms.'"" He says being homeless has affected his chances of finding work: ""You need an address. It's a vicious circle."" He has even offered to pay rent and a deposit in advance ""but they won't even do that"". ""No-one's giving us the benefit of the doubt. You can't always judge everyone by what other people have done but that's what they're doing. ""I've walked down the street and there's been house after house empty... and no one will let us in."" Garry Dunningham, left, spoke to BBC social affairs correspondent, Michael Buchanan The BBC understands Tory MPs, led by Heidi Allen, have written to Mr Gauke, demanding the national rollout of the policy be paused. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams welcomed the move, saying a ""pause"" could be used to bring in advance payments, rather than loans, for struggling families and to scrap charges for calling the Universal Credit helpline number, among other things. Conservative MP Stephen McPartland said his concern with Universal Credit was that for ""every pound these people earn, extra, the government's taking 63p back off them"". ""To me that is an effective tax rate of 63%, which is ridiculous. So the lowest paid are effectively having to pay some of the highest taxes,"" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One. This video can not be played ""The higher rate tax payers only pay 45p in the pound, so why are these low earners paying 63p?"" asks Tory MP The Department of Work and Pensions said Universal Credit was working and people were moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. ""The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money. Advance payments and budgeting support is available for anyone who needs extra help,"" a spokesman said. Dame Louise first came to prominence as Tony Blair's ""anti-social behaviour tsar"" and also led a programme for David Cameron to tackle ""troubled families"". She has now left the government to work for an international homelessness charity. She also told the BBC she was concerned that a report she published last year on integration had been placed in a box marked ""too difficult"". The government has yet to issue a formal response to the review, which accuses public bodies of ignoring or condoning divisive or harmful religious practices for fear of being called racist.

"A group of ""young pioneers"" on the way home on the Pyongyang metro While global headlines are dominated by Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un threatening mutual destruction, daily life in North Korea is continuing almost as normal. Photos taken in September during a visit by a team fromNK News,externalshow people going about their lives. Only here and there do the effects of sanctions or the anti-US propaganda sneak into the frame. These North Koreans are having a picnic near the Ullim waterfall near the port city of Wonsan. With food, beer and karaoke, there's nothing to suggest tensions are having any impact on the mood. These students at a children's camp are sporting bright tracksuits - which if you look closer, all bear the logos of Western brands like Nike or Adidas. Presumably they are copies and the children are most likely not aware of any Western brand image behind them. Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea North Korea crisis in 300 words This big passenger ferry used to connect Wonsan with the Japanese port of Niigata. Yet due to sanctions imposed in 2006, the ferry service got shut down. That means the vessel has for years been moored in Wonsan, but remarkably still has a crew. Clams are a very popular treat especially in the country's coastal cities. Most of them are normally destined for export and not for the local population. Since the latest round of UN sanctions in early August banned all exports of seafood, they might now be more available again on the local market. For a long time, electric bikes imported from Japan or China were only to be found in the capital. But increasingly, they can be spotted also in smaller cities, possibly suggesting that economic development outside Pyongyang is slowly picking up. But transport often remains extremely basic. Many cities have countless bicycles and here, a man is using an ox-pulled wagon to transport piles of old cardboard for recycling in the city of Hamhung. The woman in the centre in the next picture has a plastic bag from Japanese-Chinese budget brand Miniso. According to North Korea watchers NK News who provided the photos, Miniso opened the first ever foreign brand store in the capital this spring. Because of tougher sanctions though, the store has since changed its name. While life largely appears to be continuing as normal, there are signs that the long period of sanctions is taking a toll. Some petrol stations are closed and power shortages have led to people installing small solar panels outside their apartment windows - as can be seen on this apartment tower near the southern border city of Kaesong. Despite the economic difficulties, the propaganda machine continues to roll. Each year, the Day of the Foundation is celebrated with a mass dance in the capital. This young woman is getting ready for the performance. N Korea: Where is the war of words heading? North Korea: What would a war look like? The perceived threat from the outside is always present. There are anti-American banners with patriotic slogans, and government guides take visitors to the so-called Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum. Despite the tensions, there are enough smiles to go around. North Korea insists it remains ready for war at any time. Below, one of many tank traps stands on the side of a highway. The concrete structure has explosives at the bottom which in case of an invasion will make the huge structure collapse onto the road to block enemy tanks.

"Yasmin Evans, Jonny Nelson and Hacker T Dog will be let off the leash The hosts of the BBC's new live Saturday morning children's TV show are promising to bring back the giddy mayhem of classic shows like Going Live! and Live and Kicking. ""It's going to be an absolute zoo on set, and I don't think anyone, including ourselves, is ready for what's going to happen."" Yasmin Evans is speaking less than two days away from co-presenting two hours of silly games, sillier sketches, celebrity interviews, viewer phone-ins and cartoons on Saturday Mash-Up! on BBC Two and CBBC. With a script on the table in front of her but without a full rehearsal until the day before she and co-host Jonny Nelson go live, the pair are dizzy with seat-of-your-pants anticipation. ""Being too prepared, especially when it's a live show - I don't think that's the right way to do it,"" Evans says. ""Well it had better not be, because I'm not!"" In the gunge on Going Live! Left-right: Doc Cox, Peter Simon, Sinitta and Ruth Madoc As the BBC 1Xtra DJ and soon-to-be children's TV star lists the features that will be in Saturday Mash-Up!, Nelson chips in with an essential ingredient: ""Anarchy."" ""Anarchy,"" Evans repeats, before adding: ""A lot of gunge."" If that formula sounds familiar, you're probably old enough to fondly remember Saturday morning TV of yesteryear - from Multi-Coloured Swap Shop through Saturday Superstore, Going Live, Live & Kicking, The Saturday Show, Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow and TMi. ITV went from Tiswas to SM:TV Live via the Wide Awake Club, but it's a decade since the Saturday morning zoo TV format was finally abandoned. ""I like the anarchy thing,"" Nelson continues. ""Because it's live, and event-type TV hasn't been done for so long. Not like this. I think it's going to give them [the viewers] something very different to what they're used to."" There is one presenter missing from our interview - Hacker T Dog, who Evans and Nelson admit is more experienced than both of them, and who is likely to provide the biggest dose of anarchy. Before Hacker T Dog, there was Going Live's Gordon the Gopher and of course Spit the Dog from Tiswas, and the new show unashamedly harks back to what made those older shows so well-loved. The first thing Evans did when she found out she got the presenting job, she says, was to turn to YouTube to watch 45 minutes of Wonky Donkey - Ant and Dec's crazed phone-in game show from SM:TV. Evans says the new show will have a game that she describes with some pride as ""Wonky Donkeyesque"". Can Evans and Nelson tempt young viewers to stay for two hours? For Nelson, he went back and watched lots of Live and Kicking, whose host pairings included Jamie Theakston and Zoe Ball, which he said ""got me excited, but it also made me understand the scale of how important this is"". With hours to fill with riotous games and unpredictable guests and callers, the best bits often came when things didn't go to plan and the presenters had to somehow muddle through while attempting to suppress laughter. ""Those are the elements that we remember certainly from our childhoods,"" Nelson says. ""A lot of the time you tuned in because it was going to be mad. ""You didn't know what Jamie Theakston, Zoe Ball or Ant and Dec were going to do on that morning - who was going to make the other one laugh, or who was going to get their lines wrong, or what bit of the set's going to fall down, or what someone on the phone's going to say. ""I think the second the first thing goes wrong on the show and we style it out, God willing, that's going to be quite a relief."" Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston ruled Saturday mornings on Live and Kicking Evans and Nelson may not have had much rehearsal time, but they do already have the warmth of old friends, and with their infectious mix of nerves and enthusiasm it's not hard to imagine one or both dissolving into giggles as another piece of the set topples over. But can the formula appeal to a young generation of viewers? The reason that was always given for the disappearance of live Saturday morning TV was that kids today have so many other channels to choose from, and so many devices, so it could no longer be the focal point that it once was. Phillip Schofield, who was Going Live!'s ringmaster in the late 1980s and early 90s, recently told BBC 5 live that if they tried to do the same programme today it would make for ""a very different show"". Phillip Schofield said there would be more pressure today ""It would be a lot faster, it would be a lot cooler, it would be absolutely alive with social platforms,""he said on 5 Live's I Was There. ""If I'm honest, I'm very glad that that was my time because I still think of those as the glory days of TV, when there were less channels, and people had more time, and they were less likely to get bored, and they'd give you the benefit of doubt on something but stick with you. ""It was harder to click off and click on to something else. The pressure I think would be immense now."" Saturday Mash-Up!'s hosts and producer stress that they are bringing the format up to date - taking some ideas from the heyday and adapting them for the pace and technology of modern life. ""Television as a whole is a lot faster than it was 20 or 30 years ago,"" says series producer Jamie Wilson. ""Life is faster isn't it? ""An interview on Going Live might have been 12 minutes, whereas an interview on our show might be four minutes or five at a push."" Saturday Mash-Up! will have pop stars - but surely none with better hair than Kajagoogoo on Saturday Superstore Some ideas haven't grown old, though. ""I think the idea of phoning in and chatting to your idol is just as exciting now,"" Wilson says. ""There are some really timeless ideas within those old formats that we're keen on, but there's a big dose of new stuff, like the digital interaction that just didn't exist in the 80s and 90s."" He rightly points out that, in today's fragmented media market, live event shows like Strictly Come Dancing and Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Take Away have managed to remain some of the biggest fixtures on TV. ""Saturday mornings always had that kind of feel,"" Wilson says. ""There's something for everyone, and it was a real 'in the moment', live, exciting place to be. ""So I'm not sure why it went away in the first place, but it definitely felt it was just as relevant, and will hopefully be just as entertaining now.""

"Repair costs for the Elizabeth Tower in the Palace of Westminster have now doubled to an estimated Â£61m, parliamentary authorities have said. The project is more complex and extensive than originally thought, when the estimate of Â£29m to Â£45m was made. While there were ""unique challenges"" in working on a historic site, Parliament said it was disappointed at the rising bill and would launch a review. Big Ben chimed for the last time in August pending the work beginning. The rising cost was announced as Parliament confirmed it had appointed construction firm Robert McAlpine to carry out the renovation, which could take up to four years, following a tendering process. The authorities said the revised figure followed more detailed and technical assessment of the 160-year-old Tower's condition, including the state of stonework and the cost of removing and repainting the metal in the tower and reglazing the clock face. Big Ben will chime only on New Year's Eve and other special occasions More extensive ground works will be required in the Palace of Westminster, due to the quantity of pipes and other utility-related infrastructure under the surface, to support the scaffolding required. While the estimated cost of the work has risen from Â£29m to Â£44m, the level of contingency funding to be put aside in case of ""unexpected events"" has gone up from Â£5.8m to Â£17.2m. The authorities also said they had transferred the cost of fire safety work, due to be carried out as part of another project and already budgeted for, to the restoration of the tower. They said they had ""expressed their disappointment in the cost increases, and the unreliability of the original estimate"" and ""instructed officials to provide regular updates on progress"". ""In advance of tendering contracts, the initial high level estimates were set at a lower level to avoid cost escalation from the market,"" they said in a statement. ""Subsequent estimates, using better data and more extensive surveys, better reflect the true likelihood of the costs. We believe that we now have a more accurate estimate of the cost of the works and will report regularly to the committees on the progress of work."" The news that Big Ben would not sound again before 2021, except for special occasions such as New Year and Remembrance Sunday, prompted criticism from Theresa May and other MPs. The House of Commons said it would look again at the duration of the project and the scope for hearing the bell's famous bongs more often.

"The Food Standards Agency is investigating after reports of safety breaches at a factory owned by one of the UK's largest chicken suppliers. The Guardian and ITV News said workers at a 2 Sisters Food Group site in the West Midlands had changed slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Lidl and The Co-op have stopped taking chickens from the site while investigations continue. 2 Sisters said,externalit viewed the allegations ""extremely seriously"". The FSA said its inspectors found ""no evidence"" of breaches at the West Bromwich factory on Thursday but they were continuing to review the evidence. The company also supplies Tesco and Sainsbury's, which are investigating the allegations. An undercover reporter claimed to have witnessed workers changing the ""kill dates"" on chickens and allegedly saw meat of different ages being mixed together and codes on crates of meat altered. The Guardian and ITV News said in a statement that more than 20 workers had confirmed the unhygienic practices took place, while some said they would no longer eat chicken from supermarkets. Some workers also claimed the chicken that supermarkets reject is sometimes repackaged at the factory and sent out again. Food safety: Five things to watch out for Raw chicken 'should not be washed' The FSA said it took any allegations of inaccurate labelling and breaches in hygiene regulations ""very seriously"". It urged the Guardian and ITV News to share the full details with the FSA, such as the footage taken and witness interview transcripts, so that it could investigate thoroughly and promptly. FSA chairman Heather Hancock said: ""Should we find any evidence of any risk to public health, any products on the market which we believe to be a cause of concern will be urgently removed from sale."" She reminded consumers to follow FSA guidelines for chicken: Cover and chill raw chicken Never wash raw chicken Only use clean hands, utensils and chopping boards when handling raw chicken Cook chicken thoroughly until there is no pink meat and the juices run clear Tesco said it carried out its own regular audits of all its suppliers, adding that it took the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and would be carrying out a ""rigorous investigation"". Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer all issued statements announcing the launch of independent investigations. The 2 Sisters company was founded in 1993 by Ranjit Singh Boparan and now employs 23,000 staff. Although it has diversified, the bulk of the group's income still comes from processing poultry. The company said it had been made aware of the allegations on Thursday but had ""not been given the time or the detailed evidence to conduct any thorough investigations to establish the facts, which makes a fulsome response very difficult"". It said hygiene and safety remained at the ""core"" of its business, which was subject to frequent unannounced audits from the FSA and Red Tractor - the food industry's assurance scheme - among others. It said the West Midlands site in question had received nine audits - five unannounced - during July and August this year alone. It added in a statement: ""If, on presentation of further evidence, it comes to light any verifiable transgressions have been made at any of our sites, we will leave no stone unturned in investigating and remedying the situation immediately.""

"This video can not be played There was a festive atmosphere at the rally Tens of thousands of Catalan separatists have taken part in a final rally ahead of Sunday's planned referendum on independence from Spain. Regional President Carles Puigdemont told the crowd that he believed Catalonia would be taking its first steps as a sovereign nation. Thousands of extra police have been drafted in from across Spain as the government seeks to stop the ballot. Google has deleted an app used to direct voters to polling stations. Phone users in the region who try to download the app from Google Play get a message saying it is not available locally although those who already havethe app,externalcan still use it. The corporation said it was complying with a court order. How Spain is battling to halt Catalan vote Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain has its own language and culture, and a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. A woman holds a Catalan separatist flag in Barcelona on Friday Pressure for a vote on self-determination has grown over the past five years but in the 2015 regional election, won by an alliance of pro-independence parties, about 40% of voters backed parties loyal to Spain. Police across Catalonia have been ordered to prevent public buildings being used as polling stations on Sunday. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence Masses of referendum materials have been confiscated by police in recent weeks and officials involved in running the campaign face prosecution. However, the Catalan government said on Friday it planned to open more than 2,000 polling stations regardless. Spain plays cat and mouse During his speech at Friday's rally Mr Puigdemont said: ""Friends, so that victory is definite, on Sunday let's dress up in referendum (clothes) and leave home prepared to change history."" He and his predecessor, Artur Mas, later arrived for the rally in Barcelona where the stage was decorated with the words ""Referendum is democracy"" in giant letters. This video can not be played Tractors have gathered in Barcelona to show support for the referendum Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy stared down Catalan secessionists when they held a trial referendum in 2014, offering no concessions to their demand for a legal vote. He has pledged to stop the 2017 vote, saying it goes againstthe constitution,externalwhich refers to ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards"". Spanish unionists argue Catalonia already enjoys broad autonomy within Spain, along with other regions like the Basque Country and Galicia. Government spokesman IÃ±igo Mendez de Vigo accused the Catalan government of being inflexible and one-sided but it is a charge Catalan nationalists throw back at Madrid itself. In other developments on Friday: Hundreds, if not thousands, of tractors were driven into Barcelona and other towns to act as protective barriers around polling stations Restrictions were introduced on commercial light aircraft and helicopters flying over Barcelona this weekend to prevent activists trailing banners, according to local media Referendum activists occupied schools across Catalonia in a move to keep them open for the vote Despite the tension in the region, demonstrations by independence campaigners have been largely peaceful. ""I don't believe there will be anyone who will use violence or who will want to provoke violence that will tarnish the irreproachable image of the Catalan independence movement as pacifist,"" Mr Puigdemont said.

"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary Ryanair has bowed to regulator demands and spelled out more options on offer to passengers affected by its planned flight disruption. It has avoided possible legal action by emailing those affected by more than 20,000 flight cancellations. On its site, Ryanair acknowledges it is required,externalto offer those on cancelled flights full refunds or comparable tickets on rival carriers. Civil Aviation Authority boss Andrew Haines said Ryanair had ""capitulated"". Earlier this week, MrAndrew Haines said he was ""furious""the airline had not been complying with the law by failing to offer to re-route passengers on rival airlines. In the airline's first wave of cancellations Ryanair offered affected passengers a Â£40 voucher per cancelled flight as a way to say sorry. The budget airline said it had taken on more extra staff to process the expected increase in customer claims. Ryanair was forced by the CAA to clarify that passengers affected who previously ""may have chosen an option that was not suitable for them as a result of any misunderstanding of their EU261 rights"" were entitled to change their mind, for example by opting for a flight on another airline instead of a refund. If no Ryanair flight was available to get customers to their ticketed destination, customers can now opt for a comparable flight on Easyjet, Jet2, Vueling, Cityjet, Aer Lingus, Norwegian or Eurowings, the airline clarified. Mr Haines confirmed Ryanair had contacted the aviation watchdog late on Friday afternoon and said; ""Our job is to protect passengers' rights and ensure that all airlines operating in the UK are fully compliant with important consumer laws. ""Where we find that an airline is systematically flouting these rules, we will not hesitate to take action, to minimise the harm and detriment caused to passengers, as we have done with Ryanair in recent days.  It appears that Ryanair has now capitulated. ""We will review their position in detail and monitor this situation to ensure that passengers get what they are entitled to in practice,"" Haines added. Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said: ""We are committed to processing all such claims within 21 days of receipt and hope to have all such claims settled before the end of October."" Ryanair cancelled up to 50 flights a day through to the end of October, affecting 315,000 passengers. It then cancelled another 18,000 flights between November and March, affecting the travel plans of another 400,000 passengers. The disruption was brought about because of an error with pilot holiday rotas and Ryanair said cancelling flights would ""eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations"".

"The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has suggested that interest rates could rise ""in the near term"". Many experts think that could mean as early as November. So how would a rate rise of 0.25%, to 0.5%, affect borrowers and savers? We know there are more savers than borrowers, so more people are likely to be pleased at the prospect of rising rates, than those who will be disappointed. According to the Bank of England, 43% of homeowners are on variable or tracker rates. In theory most of those will see their mortgage repayments rise when the Bank of England raises rates. By contrast 57% of borrowers are on fixed-rate deals, and will not be affected immediately. Currently 90% of new home-owners are on fixed deals, and they tend to have the largest loans. But depending on when their two or five-year term finishes, borrowers will inevitably face higher repayments eventually. According to the Nationwide Building Society, a 0.25% rise in base rates would have a modest affect on anyone on a standard variable rate (svr). On the average mortgage of Â£125,000 an increase of 0.25% would increase monthly payments by Â£15 to Â£665. That would amount to an extra Â£185 per year. The following table assumes there is 20 years left on a mortgage, and that the rate rises from the current average of 2.56% to 2.81%. As Mark Carney is fond of reminding us, the rises in base rates will be small, and the pace will be gradual. So while the impact of the first hike may be small, someone with a mortgage advance of Â£150,000 could eventually find themselves paying as much as Â£161 a month more, according to figures supplied by the Halifax, Britain's largest lender. The average easy-access savings account is currently paying 0.35% in annual interest. Some banks accounts are paying as little as 0.01%. So any rise in base rates could be a welcome boost for savers, even though any increase would be small. One other problem in recent years has been that banks and building societies have been able to borrow money from the Bank of England very cheaply, so they haven't needed to compete for deposits from savers. The Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) and the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) have therefore helped to depress returns for savers. ""The good news for savers is that both the FLS and TFS are ending at the beginning of 2018, so perhaps providers will start to need funds from savers once more,"" said Anna Bowes, a director of Savings Champion. ""This, as well as a Bank of England base rate rise, will hopefully really make a difference.""

"Wang Yam has been serving a life sentence since 2009 One of the oddest murder cases in recent years - one that led to two semi-secret trials and claims of a miscarriage of justice - has ended with the convicted killer remaining behind bars. The Court of Appeal has upheld the 2009 conviction of 55-year-old Wang Yam for the murder of an elderly author, despite the evidence against him being, in the words of the court, ""entirely circumstantial"". And so Yam will stay in HMP Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire, serving a life sentence for killing 86-year-old Allan Chappelow in 2006. In June that year, police discovered Mr Chappelow's decomposing body under a four-foot high pile of his own manuscripts, at his large home in Hampstead, north-west London. He had been battered with a blunt instrument. Mr Chappelow had written two biographies of George Bernard-Shaw in the 1960s. He had also been a press photographer but in more recent years he had kept himself to himself. He was wealthy and struggling to maintain his increasingly crumbling home, which would otherwise be worth millions. Wang Yam came from a different world. His grandfather was one of Mao's comrades during the rise of Chinese communism. The grandson was an engineer and academic and ultimately a dissident who sought asylum after the failed Tiananmen Square uprising. He had one failed marriage, a failed business and more than Â£1 million in debts. And that, according to the prosecution, was where the worlds of the two men collided. Prosecutors say Mr Chappelow was killed for his wealth Yam was accused of killing Mr Chappelow in what appeared to be an identity theft and fraud gone wrong. He had acquired details of Mr Chappelow's banking arrangements and tried to trick institutions into giving him access to his money multiple times. He had also used Mr Chappelow's mobile and sim card. Yam left the country the day after the police put a cordon up around the dead author's home. But while there was circumstantial evidence to tie him to the crime, there was nothing to tie him to the murder scene. No DNA, no fingerprints and no apparent connection to Mr Chappelow. It took two trials to get a murder conviction after the first jury failed to reach a verdict. And then the case became stranger when the prosecution sought a then rare application to have part of the case heard behind closed doors on grounds of national security. In the open part of the case, Yam's defence was that a mystery gang had given him the items from Mr Chappelow's home and he was playing along with them to gather evidence for the authorities. The BBC'sNewsnight has previously reported that Yam had a relationship with MI6,externalbut we don't know (nor could we say if we did) whether this formed part of the secret sessions of the trial. Yam was convicted in January 2009 and given life with a minimum term of 20 years. He failed to get the conviction overturned and then failed to get the case re-opened at the European Court of Human Rights. But last year, new doubts emerged. The Criminal Cases Review Commission - the body that looks at potential miscarriages of justice - referred the conviction back to the Court of Appeal. It concluded that the police had failed to reveal material to the Crown Prosecution Service that may have helped the defence. A new witness, who had been living nearby, had suffered an extraordinarily frightening confrontation with a knife-wielding man on his doorstep. Was this an alternative suspect? Two other men came forward with stories. One witness said he believed Mr Chappelow had been a frequent visitor to a gay cruising spot of Hampstead Heath and that he had been seen with other men. Was this the key to solving the mystery of the DNA in the home that neither belonged to the author, his occasional handyman nor Wang Yam? A third and final witness had a strange conversation with a man carrying a large piece of sawn timber through Mr Chappelow's front gate. It struck the witness as odd, and it could have been around the time of the murder. What did this all amount to? As far as the Court of Appeal ruled on Friday, not a lot. The knife-wielding man episode happened nine months after the killing - and the Court of Appeal concluded it wasn't sufficiently connected to the circumstances of Mr Chappelow's death to be something that would have influenced a jury. The judges ruled the same in relation to the material providing from the other two witnesses. It didn't add up to anything conclusive. Like so much else about this case, it was very, very circumstantial.

"Yasmin Evans, Jonny Nelson and Hacker T Dog will be let off the leash The hosts of the BBC's new live Saturday morning children's TV show are promising to bring back the giddy mayhem of classic shows like Going Live! and Live and Kicking. ""It's going to be an absolute zoo on set, and I don't think anyone, including ourselves, is ready for what's going to happen."" Yasmin Evans is speaking less than two days away from co-presenting two hours of silly games, sillier sketches, celebrity interviews, viewer phone-ins and cartoons on Saturday Mash-Up! on BBC Two and CBBC. With a script on the table in front of her but without a full rehearsal until the day before she and co-host Jonny Nelson go live, the pair are dizzy with seat-of-your-pants anticipation. ""Being too prepared, especially when it's a live show - I don't think that's the right way to do it,"" Evans says. ""Well it had better not be, because I'm not!"" In the gunge on Going Live! Left-right: Doc Cox, Peter Simon, Sinitta and Ruth Madoc As the BBC 1Xtra DJ and soon-to-be children's TV star lists the features that will be in Saturday Mash-Up!, Nelson chips in with an essential ingredient: ""Anarchy."" ""Anarchy,"" Evans repeats, before adding: ""A lot of gunge."" If that formula sounds familiar, you're probably old enough to fondly remember Saturday morning TV of yesteryear - from Multi-Coloured Swap Shop through Saturday Superstore, Going Live, Live & Kicking, The Saturday Show, Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow and TMi. ITV went from Tiswas to SM:TV Live via the Wide Awake Club, but it's a decade since the Saturday morning zoo TV format was finally abandoned. ""I like the anarchy thing,"" Nelson continues. ""Because it's live, and event-type TV hasn't been done for so long. Not like this. I think it's going to give them [the viewers] something very different to what they're used to."" There is one presenter missing from our interview - Hacker T Dog, who Evans and Nelson admit is more experienced than both of them, and who is likely to provide the biggest dose of anarchy. Before Hacker T Dog, there was Going Live's Gordon the Gopher and of course Spit the Dog from Tiswas, and the new show unashamedly harks back to what made those older shows so well-loved. The first thing Evans did when she found out she got the presenting job, she says, was to turn to YouTube to watch 45 minutes of Wonky Donkey - Ant and Dec's crazed phone-in game show from SM:TV. Evans says the new show will have a game that she describes with some pride as ""Wonky Donkeyesque"". Can Evans and Nelson tempt young viewers to stay for two hours? For Nelson, he went back and watched lots of Live and Kicking, whose host pairings included Jamie Theakston and Zoe Ball, which he said ""got me excited, but it also made me understand the scale of how important this is"". With hours to fill with riotous games and unpredictable guests and callers, the best bits often came when things didn't go to plan and the presenters had to somehow muddle through while attempting to suppress laughter. ""Those are the elements that we remember certainly from our childhoods,"" Nelson says. ""A lot of the time you tuned in because it was going to be mad. ""You didn't know what Jamie Theakston, Zoe Ball or Ant and Dec were going to do on that morning - who was going to make the other one laugh, or who was going to get their lines wrong, or what bit of the set's going to fall down, or what someone on the phone's going to say. ""I think the second the first thing goes wrong on the show and we style it out, God willing, that's going to be quite a relief."" Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston ruled Saturday mornings on Live and Kicking Evans and Nelson may not have had much rehearsal time, but they do already have the warmth of old friends, and with their infectious mix of nerves and enthusiasm it's not hard to imagine one or both dissolving into giggles as another piece of the set topples over. But can the formula appeal to a young generation of viewers? The reason that was always given for the disappearance of live Saturday morning TV was that kids today have so many other channels to choose from, and so many devices, so it could no longer be the focal point that it once was. Phillip Schofield, who was Going Live!'s ringmaster in the late 1980s and early 90s, recently told BBC 5 live that if they tried to do the same programme today it would make for ""a very different show"". Phillip Schofield said there would be more pressure today ""It would be a lot faster, it would be a lot cooler, it would be absolutely alive with social platforms,""he said on 5 Live's I Was There. ""If I'm honest, I'm very glad that that was my time because I still think of those as the glory days of TV, when there were less channels, and people had more time, and they were less likely to get bored, and they'd give you the benefit of doubt on something but stick with you. ""It was harder to click off and click on to something else. The pressure I think would be immense now."" Saturday Mash-Up!'s hosts and producer stress that they are bringing the format up to date - taking some ideas from the heyday and adapting them for the pace and technology of modern life. ""Television as a whole is a lot faster than it was 20 or 30 years ago,"" says series producer Jamie Wilson. ""Life is faster isn't it? ""An interview on Going Live might have been 12 minutes, whereas an interview on our show might be four minutes or five at a push."" Saturday Mash-Up! will have pop stars - but surely none with better hair than Kajagoogoo on Saturday Superstore Some ideas haven't grown old, though. ""I think the idea of phoning in and chatting to your idol is just as exciting now,"" Wilson says. ""There are some really timeless ideas within those old formats that we're keen on, but there's a big dose of new stuff, like the digital interaction that just didn't exist in the 80s and 90s."" He rightly points out that, in today's fragmented media market, live event shows like Strictly Come Dancing and Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Take Away have managed to remain some of the biggest fixtures on TV. ""Saturday mornings always had that kind of feel,"" Wilson says. ""There's something for everyone, and it was a real 'in the moment', live, exciting place to be. ""So I'm not sure why it went away in the first place, but it definitely felt it was just as relevant, and will hopefully be just as entertaining now.""

"A soldier walks past a smashed artefact at Nimrud The rich archaeological heritage of Iraq suffered grievous damage at the hands of so-called Islamic State. As its fighters are driven back, British Museum teams are among the first to assess the extent of the destruction. After IS declared a caliphate in the summer of 2014, thousands of archaeological sites in Iraq fell into the hands of its fighters. Terrible acts of vandalism followed, with videos released by the group showing its memberssmashing artefacts at Mosul Museumand blowing up parts of the site of the Assyrian capital of Nimrud. Archaeologists returning to areas recaptured from IS have found other ancient sites turned into car parks, statues smashed and manuscripts disappeared. But there is good news too - with IS having failed to destroy many artefacts, previously undiscovered treasures found amid the ruins, and the first modern explorations of sites it never captured revealing exciting new finds. Onlyrecently liberated from IS fightersfollowing a huge military operation, Iraq's second largest city of Mosul - and the area that surrounds it - is of great historical importance. The Assyrian city of Nineveh, which dates to the 7th Century BC and once hosted palaces, temples and mansions, is on the outskirts of modern Mosul. The lamassu on the right of the Nergal Gate, photographed in 1977 It has been 70% destroyed by IS, with parts of the walls bulldozed and gates which had been excavated and restored knocked down. Magnificentwinged bulls which guarded the entrance to the Nergal Gatehave been mutilated and Nebi Yunus, the site of a palace, has suffered far greater damage than expected and is in danger of collapse because of tunnelling. But among all this dreadful news is a glimmer of something positive. At Nebi Yunus, it seems that IS was driven out just in time. Iraqi forces found a network of tunnels, largely following the course of ancient sculptures which lined the palace walls. Tunnels dug by IS in an attempt to find antiquities, or serve as communications routes, revealed unseen artefacts While these tunnels have hugely damaged the archaeology of the mound, IS did not have time to loot or destroy these sculptures. The discoveries in the tunnels - reliefs, sculptures, and cuneiform slabs - are spectacular. The reliefs are truly exceptional, depicting religious and cultic scenes, priests, and what appears to be a demigoddess or a high-priestess. About 20 miles south of Mosul is Nimrud, the Assyrian city of Kalhu - a great city between 1350 and 610 BC. Excavations at Nimrud began in the mid-19th Century and continued until 1992, revealing some of the most important monuments of Assyrian art. Since March 2015 the site has been systematically destroyed by IS - with about 80% of it lost. IS levelled the Ziggurat -a stepped pyramid which was once more than 34m high,external- with heavy machines, its features now lost or hidden in rubble. It also destroyed the lamassus - winged bull sculptures - in the nearby Ishtar temple and destroyed the entrance of the Nabu Temple, along with the fish-cloaked statues which flanked it. Bulldozers and explosives were used to destroy the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, king of Assyria from 883 to 859 BC. IS posted a video in April 2015 showing parts of Nimrud being blown up Photos show IS destruction of Nimrud The unrivalled riches of Nimrud The men who uncovered Assyria Iraqi archaeologist Faleh Noman, who undertook British Museum training and has been appointed by the Iraqi government to lead assessment of the sites, found ""barbaric"" destruction. ""The main entrance to the palace leading to the throne room has been completely destroyed and the lamassu demolished. ""The wall reliefs and lamassu of the second gateway have also been damaged, with only one large wall relief remaining intact."" Inside the palace, he found that sledgehammers have been used to damage reliefs. Iraqi forces recaptured Nimrud from IS in November 2016 Across the Mosul region alone, Iraqi officials believe that at least 66 sites were destroyed. There has also been looting, with many of the tunnels dug by the extremists carved out with the aim of finding antiquities to sell on the black market: heritage turned into weaponry. Archaeologists at Tello work under the protection of Iraqi antiquities police It is a situation which led the Iraqi government to appeal for international help and, in turn, the creation of a British Museum scheme to train Iraqi archaeologists in heritage management and fieldwork skills, including excavation and photography. The training includes two field projects in areas that were never held by IS - in the south of Iraq at the site of Tello, and in a Kurdish area of the north, at Darband-i Rania. Tello, the modern Arabic name for the ancient Sumerian city of Girsu, is one of the world's earliest known cities and is a mega-site with a layout similar to Nineveh or Nimrud. This video can not be played Meet the archaeologists training to save Iraq's heritage Following the discovery of cuneiform tablets, it  revealed to the world the existence of the Sumerians, who invented writing 5,000 years ago and may have developed a form of early democracy well before the ancient Greeks. It also includes fragile remains of monumental architecture such as the Bridge of Girsu - the oldest bridge yet found - which will be the focus of conservation works. Excavations in late 2016 and early 2017 were carried out in the heart of the sacred district, known as the Mound of the Palace. Mudbrick walls of a newly discovered temple at Tello are being excavated More than 80 years after French pioneers first discovered the ruins of a Hellenistic palace, we were able to miraculously unearth extensive mudbrick walls belonging to the Ningirsu temple. Dedicated to the storm god, this was one of the most important sacred places of Mesopotamia and widely praised for its magnificence. However, until now it was known only by cuneiform texts and its discovery represents a significant milestone in the history of archaeological research in Iraq. Finds at Tello include a stone foundation tablet Of this 4,000-year-old religious complex, we have exposed what appears to be the central part of the sanctuary: a decorated entrance, the cella - with an offering altar, passageways marked by colossal inscribed stones, and also scattered remains of pavements and fired bricks. Collapsed layers of the superstructure have yielded 100 cones, most of which commemorate the reconstruction of the temple by Sumerian rulers. Among the unique finds were a fragment of a marble foundation tablet of the Sumerian ruler Ur-Bau, a terracotta plaque with a Sumerian couple, two cylinder seals - one belonging to a deity and the other featuring a presentation scene of deities in front of the sun god - and a unique impression of a Sumerian demon. These objects and other important artefacts have already been safely delivered to the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. Excavations in northern Iraq have focused on a site at Darband-i Rania There have also been important finds at the site in northern Iraq. Darband-i Rania is a pass at the western edge of the Zagros Mountains, on a historic route from Mesopotamia to Iran. Alexander the Great passed through it in 331 BC, and in the 8th and 7th centuries BC it was at the eastern edge of the Assyrian empire. We are hoping to learn more about the early imperial control of this strategic location in the first millennium BC. Thefocus has been at the western end of the pass - at Qalatga Darband,external, a site overlooking the Lower Zab River which was discovered in declassified spy satellite imagery from the 1960s. Alexander the Great passed through the area in 331 BC, with Qalatga Darband established by his successors Large numbers of carved limestone blocks that lie scattered across the site indicate the presence of substantial remains, while drone imagery suggests the existence of large buried buildings. Analysis of surface ceramics suggest that the site can be dated to the 1st and 2nd Centuries BC. It appears that Qalatga Darband was founded in the Hellenistic period by the Seleucids, the successors to Alexander the Great. The site then came under Parthian rule. A substantial fortification wall protecting the southern and western side of the settlement appears to date to this period and makes excellent sense as the Parthians were protecting their empire from the Romans. The presence of a large fortified structure at the north end of the site has been confirmed and stone presses hint at facilities for wine production. Excavations have unearthed large buried buildings, ceramics and wine presses at Qalatga Darband Investigation of a huge stone mound at the southern end of the site is uncovering remains of a monumental building which appears to be a temple for the worship of Greco-Roman deities. And excavations at the nearby site of Usu Aska have confirmed the existence of a fort tentatively dated to the Assyrian period. With walls six metres thick and still standing five metres high, it must have been a formidable installation for controlling movement through the pass. The Parthians annihilated the Roman legions and captured their standards - the construction of the wall may well have been a direct reaction to the rising threat from Rome. The ongoing work is adding a new chapter to the history of Iraqi Kurdistan, a region which, in archaeological terms, has previously been almost completely unexplored. The recovery and rediscovery of these ancient sites will hopefully feed into a better future for Iraq - a country with an incredibly rich heritage. It is the cradle of civilisation, with a huge number of remains from deep prehistory to the present day. As parts of Iraq become safer, archaeological expeditions are once again exploring this unique heritage. This research will generate new insights into the rise and fall of the many civilisations that have flourished here - and bring hope for the future. About this piece.

"Henry Bolton's surprise election as UKIP leader marks one of the most meteoric rises in British politics in recent years. The former army officer turned security consultant only joined the party in 2014 and, until recently, was scarcely a household name within UKIP let alone national politics. Although he started out the leadership campaign trail as a relative outsider, he steadily gained a series of endorsements from other contenders as they dropped out. Crucially, he received a nod from Nigel Farage, who was anxious not to see Anne Marie Waters, an anti-Islam campaigner and the bookies' favourite, win the contest. Henry Bolton elected UKIP leader It was not an outright endorsement - Mr Farage merely agreed to act as his ""political referee"" - but the best known former UKIP leader said he was ""delighted"" by Mr Bolton's victory, describing him on Twitter as ""real man of substance"". Mr Bolton beat Ms Waters into second place in the contest, winning with nearly 4,000 of the 12,915 votes cast. Henry Bolton and wife Tatiana Smurova-Bolton The new UKIP leader has been on a long political journey, having stood as a Liberal Democrat candidate against the future Chancellor Philip Hammond in Weybridge and Runnymede in 2005, coming third with 7,000 votes, soundly beating UKIP's candidate. The 54-year-old, who was born in Kenya, was commissioned in the Wessex Regiment in the Territorial Army in 1992, and promoted to captain in 1994. He served as a infantry officer and tank crewman in Germany, Belize, Cyprus and Bosnia. In 2013, he was awarded the OBE in the New Year Honours ""for services to international security and stabilisation"" during a tour of duty in Helmand, Afghanistan - where he served as stabilisation team leader, of the provincial reconstruction team. Mr Bolton had the backing of former leader Nigel Farage He also worked for the United Nations and spent three years working with the European Union in Common Security and Defence Policy roles. After leaving the army, for eight years he was a police officer in the Thames Valley force, during which time he received an award for outstanding bravery. In 2016, he stood for the post of Kent Police and Crime Commissioner, finishing in second place. Mr Bolton has insisted he is committed to the job for the long term and not merely keeping the seat warm for Nigel Farage to make yet another return. Some UKIP supporters were shocked by the result He has said seeing Brexit through and delivering on the wishes of those who voted to leave is its ""core task"" but, at the same time, he has said UKIP cannot be a single issue party. He faces a tough task in trying to heal the wounds caused by a divisive leadership contest. Speaking to Kent News during the campaign,externalhe warned against UKIP turning itself into the ""UK Nazi party"" under the ""wrong leadership"". ""Ukip was set up to fight the 'totalitarian' effects of EU influence on British society,"" he added. ""Therefore, I will not sit back and watch the party be hijacked by those who seek to now seize on our success to drive forward their own agenda."" In his victory speech he quoted a motto from the Sandhurst Military Academy, from which he graduated, insisting that his intention was to ""serve to lead"". He has said he does not expect to be paid in the role. He lives in Kent with his wife Tatiana and his three children, the youngest of whom was born during a train journey between Kent and London in 2016. He is chairman of the Manston Airport supporters group Why Not Manston.

"Tens of thousands more UK citizens applied for citizenship in other EU countries in the 12 months after the Brexit vote than in the previous year, according to data obtained by the BBC. Ireland received by far the most applications for dual nationality. But for all the countries that had data covering July 2016 to June 2017, applications have more than doubled. In countries which had data only for calendar years, there was a sharp rise from 2015 to 2016 as well. Among well-known UK citizens to apply for citizenship elsewhere in Europe is the Oscar-winning actor Colin Firth - it was confirmed last week that his application for Italian citizenship had been successful. Yes, even Mr Darcy is feeling flustered. British actor Colin Firth (pictured with his Italian wife) is now an Italian as well as a British citizen Reality Check and Radio 4's More or Less contacted all EU countries to ask about the number of citizenship applications they had received from British people, before and after the referendum in June 2016. It has not been possible to get full figures for every country, but the data we have compiled (reproduced at the end of this article) shows just how many people are taking precautionary steps in case the Brexit negotiations fail. In the 12 months before the referendum, 25,207 Britons applied for Irish passports; in the 12 months directly after the vote that number rose to 64,400. Sharp increases have also been seen elsewhere. In Spain, where some applicants have to give up their British citizenship because dual nationality is not allowed in all cases, the numbers rose from 2,300 before the referendum to 4,558 after. In other countries around the EU - Sweden (from 969 to 2,002), Denmark (from 289 to 604) and Poland (from 152 to 332) for example - the number of applications also more than doubled. Then there are countries where data is made available in slightly different ways. In Germany it comes state by state - so in Berlin there were 60 applications from British citizens in the year before the referendum, and 810 in the year after. France, meanwhile, provides figures on a calendar year basis, and again the increase is clear - there were 385 applications in 2015, rising to 1,363 in 2016, and rising further to 2,129 in the first eight months of this year. There is no precise way of knowing why people make citizenship applications when they do, but it seems safe to assume that political circumstances play a role. In Ireland, for example, where monthly figures are available, the highest number of applications so far came in March, April and May this year - in the period just before or just after the British government triggered Article 50 and the countdown to the UK leaving the EU. Roughly a million UK citizens already live elsewhere in the EU, and many more in the UK have the right to apply for citizenship in other EU countries. Since the referendum they have been doing just that in record numbers. Of course this is not simply a one-way street. There are more than three million EU citizens living in the UK who are equally worried about their  status post-Brexit. And again, the number of citizenship applications in the UK is striking. In the 12 months before the UK voted to leave the EU, 15,871 people from EU countries applied; in the 12 months after it was 28,502. Perhaps these figures don't come as a surprise. But they are a reminder of why the issue of citizens' rights is at the centre of the current Brexit negotiations - and why all sides say it is a priority to resolve. Brexit often seems to be about complex and distant concepts. But these are real people, worried about the future for themselves and their families.

You can hear more about these statistics onMore or Lesson BBC Radio 4 at 16:30 on Friday, 29 September or on BBC iPlayer Radio. These are all the figures from countries that were able to give us pre-referendum and post-referendum figures for passport applications by UK citizens. These are the figures comparing the number of applications in the whole of 2015 with those for the whole of 2016. The figures for Austria, Belgium, Germany and Italy are only successful applications as opposed to all applications. The figure for Slovenia is for all people who applied for citizenship in the UK, not necessarily just UK citizens. We did not receive data from the remaining six EU countries.

"On Mr Trump's reality TV show, his catchphrase was ""You're fired!"" Donald Trump's old catchphrase was ""you're fired"" - and while he has been president, his senior team has had a very high turnover. Here is a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with the most recent. William Barr will step down on 23 December, President Trump said Mr Barr, 70, came out of semi-retirement in 2019 to replace Jeff Sessions for the cabinet role. During his lengthy legal career, he also served as attorney general under President George HW Bush in the early 1990s. Democratic critics of Mr Barr accused him of shielding his ex-boss from justice. But despite his support for the president, Trump and many of his supporters turned on Mr Barr over his unwillingness to support the president's election lawsuits. His resignation comes into effect on 23 December - less than a month before his term is due to end, when President Trump leaves office. Tensions flared between the two after Mr Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in November's election. He was also criticised by the president for not publicly disclosing during the race that his justice department was investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter. Mr Barr's resignation letter to President Trump began by saying he ""appreciated the opportunity to update"" the president on the Department of Justice's review of voter fraud allegations in the recent election and ""how these allegations will continue to be pursued"". One year, ten months A former Microsoft executive, Mr Krebs had led the agency since its inception in 2018 in the aftermath of alleged Russian interference in 2016's presidential elections. As director he was responsible for improving cybersecurity across all levels of government, and safeguarding the security of the 2020 elections. Mr Krebs had been praised by both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the latest election. But he reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over aCisa website called Rumor Control,external, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself. Hours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Mr Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Mr Biden. President Trump said he ""terminated"" Mr Krebs for ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on voting integrity. Two years. Mark Esper was appointed in 2019. He replaced an acting secretary of defence who was standing in after James Mattis left in 2018 over differences with Donald Trump on Syria, among other things. Mr Esper's relations with the president turned out to be equally rocky, towards the end at least. He was ""terminated"" in the post in a tweet from Mr Trump, who announced the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christopher Miller, was replacing him. The secretary disagreed with the president on a number of issues, most publicly on the use of active-duty military forces to quell street protests. Mr Esper was also far more conciliatory towards Nato than Mr Trump. Mr Esper had reportedly been preparing to resign - or to be sacked - since the president's election defeat. Just short of 17 months. Mrs Conway served as Donald Trump's campaign manager in the three months up to his election in November 2016. She then became senior counsellor at the White House, and one of the president's closest advisers. She became noted for her colourful and high-profile defences of the president, and her sparring with journalists. She said she wanted to spend more time focusing on her children. Her decision to step down came hours after one of her daughters, Claudia, tweeted that her mother's job had ""ruined [her] life"" - a message that later went viral. Among Mrs Conway's many colourful lines, one of the most famous was ""alternative facts"", the phrase she used to describe then White House press secretary Sean Spicer's highly questioned figures about the number of people attending Mr Trump's inauguration. Four years, first as election campaign manager, then senior adviser. Mr Parscale served as digital media director for Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The 44-year-old was promoted to campaign manager for the president's 2020 re-election bid in February 2018. He has been a warm-up act for Mr Trump at rallies. Mr Parscale has reportedly been blamed by the US president's inner circle for a poorly attended rally in Oklahoma in June. He boasted that more than one million people registered to attend the event, but the local fire department said fewer than 6,200 showed up. Mr Parscale blamed a blocked security gate, protesters and the media for the disappointing turnout. Mr Trump announced on social media that Mr Parscale was being replaced by Bill Stepien, a former aide to ex-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The president did not offer any reasons for the decision and praised Mr Parscale's work on digital and data strategies. Two years, five months. Mr Parscale is still working as a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Mr Mulvaney assumed the role of acting White House chief of staff in January 2019. He previously served as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Despite his key White House roles, he was never part of the Trump inner circle. My Mulvaney's departure had been long rumoured and followed some high-profile slip-ups. Most notably, he was perceived to have implicated the president in the impeachment inquiry in an off-the-cuff remark at the White House podium, in which he shrugged off criticism over an alleged corrupt deal with Ukraine by saying: ""We do that all the time."" Mr Trump was reportedly outraged by the gaffe. In a written statement, Mr Mulvaney said: ""Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election."" Mr Trump announced on 6 March that Mr Mulvaney was being replaced by North Carolina lawmaker Mark Meadows. One year, two months. Mr Mulvaney is now working as US special envoy to Northern Ireland. Mr Sondland was appointed as US ambassador to the European Union in June 2018. Before entering into politics, he was best known as a multi-millionaire hotelier. He originally backed a Trump rival in the 2016 presidential race, but when Mr Trump was elected, he donated $1m (Â£781,000) to his inaugural committee. Mr Sondland was fired after testifying against Mr Trump in the impeachment proceedings. In his testimony, he accused the president of seeking a ""quid pro quo"" with Ukraine. On 7 February, Mr Sondland said he had been advised that the president intended ""to recall [him] effective immediately"". In a statement issued by his lawyer, he said: ""I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo for his consistent support, and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the US mission to the European Union."" Just over one and a half years. Lt Col Alexander Vindman is a decorated Iraq war veteran who served as the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council. He was born in Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, and moved to the US with his family when he and his twin brother, Yevgeny, were aged three. Lt Col Vindman's lawyer said he was fired after testifying as a witness in Mr Trump's impeachment case. His lawyer said he was escorted from the White House, while his twin brother, a senior lawyer for the National Security Council, was also sent back to the Department of the Army. During the impeachment proceedings, Lt Col Vindman described a phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart as ""improper"" and said it had left him in ""shock"". Mr Trump defended the decisionto fire him, describing the Ukraine expert as ""very insubordinate"". He said Lt Col Vindman had incorrectly reported the contents of a ""perfect"" phone call. One year, seven months. Lt Col Vindman announced in July that he had retired from the military after 21 years of service because his future would be ""forever limited"". His lawyer said the 45-year-old had been the victim of a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation"" by the president. Mr Spencer, a former Marines pilot-turned-investment banker, was sworn in as the 76th secretary of the US Navy in August 2017. During his time in the post, he also performed stints as acting secretary of defence and deputy secretary of defence. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said he asked Mr Spencer to resign over ""his lack of candour"" regarding the case of a Navy Seal convicted of posing with a corpse while serving in Iraq. The case of Edward Gallagherhas sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials. The president reinstated Chief Petty Officer Gallagher's rank after he was demoted following his conviction, and later hit out at plans to hold a disciplinary review that could have resulted in him being stripped of his Seals membership. In a statement announcing the firing, Mr Esper alleged Mr Spencer had proposed a deal with the White House behind his back to resolve the case. Mr Trump, however, said he was not happy with ""cost overruns"" and how Gallagher's trial was run, and suggested this was why Mr Spencer was fired. In his resignation letter, Mr Spencer said it was apparent that he and Mr Trump did not have the same view of ""good order and discipline"". ""I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took,"" he wrote. Two years, three months. Before joining the cabinet, Mr McAleenan worked as commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. He oversaw the president's tough policies aimed at curbing immigration across the Mexican border. In a tweet, President Donald Trump said Mr McAleenan wanted to ""spend more time with his family and go into the private sector."" During his tenure, analysts described a turbulent relationship between the two. Mr McAleenan has also criticised the ""uncomfortable"" tone of debate about immigration in America. Six months Mr Bolton assumed the post in April 2018, becoming Mr Trump's third national security adviser after Michael Flynn and HR McMaster. At that time, the president's decision to appoint Mr Bolton came as a surprise. He remained an unapologetic cheerleader of the 2003 Iraq war, which the US president himself once lambasted as ""a big mistake"". Mr Bolton was praised, however, by conservative admirers as a straight-talking foreign policy ""hawk"". Mr Trump announced Mr Bolton's departure in a tweet, writing that his national security adviser's services were ""no longer needed"". But Mr Bolton quickly fired back, writing on Twitter that he had actually offered his resignation, but Mr Trump had told him ""let's talk about it tomorrow"". Mr Bolton's exit follows an argument with Mr Trump over the administration's peace talks with the Taliban. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters: ""[The president] didn't like a lot of his policies, they disagree."" According to White House sources, the National Security Council - which advises the president - had become a separate entity during Mr Bolton's tenure. A former senior Trump administration official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that Mr Bolton did not attend meetings, and followed his own initiatives. ""He's running his own show,"" said the official. One year, four months. Just a few days after his departure, Mr Bolton resumed his former job as the head of two political action committees: the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC. So-called PACs promote the views of their members on selected issues, and have become an important tool for funnelling large funds into the political process and influencing elections. Mr Bolton released a book in June 2020 - The Room Where it Happened -about his time in the White House. In it, he paints a picture of a president ignorant of basic geopolitical facts and whose decisions were frequently driven by a desire for re-election. The White House had sought to block the book's release citing national security concerns. Read more: Ten biggest claims in John Bolton's Donald Trump book As director of national intelligence, Mr Coats oversaw all 17 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA. His office also had the authority to receive whistleblower complaints and decide if they should be referred to Congress. But Mr Coats' assessments were routinely contradicted by President Trump, who has been critical of the US intelligence community. In January, the president called his intelligence chiefs passive and naive in their assessment of the threat posed by Iran. On 28 July, President Donald Trump tweeted Mr Coats would step down in mid-August and Texas congressman John Ratcliffe would be nominated to replace him. In his resignation letter to the president, Mr Coats said America's intelligence community had become ""stronger than ever"" during his two-and-half-year tenure. ""As a result, I now believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life,"" he wrote. Mr Coats, a former senator and diplomat, said in February the president had asked him to stay in the post, yet their differences on foreign policy appeared irreconcilable at times. But the timing of his removal has been questioned by critics. The announcement came three days after a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which was the subject of a whistleblower complaint. The White House released a rough transcript of the call which shows Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic frontrunner for the 2020 presidential elections. Two and a half years. Mr Acosta, a former federal prosecutor, was sworn in as Secretary in April 2017 - the first Hispanic appointee to the Cabinet. He was chosen for the role after Mr Trump's first choice, fast-food billionaire Andrew Puzder, withdrew. During his tenure, Mr Acosta oversaw initiatives to expand on promote workplace apprenticeships. But he was criticised for proposing massive cuts to the International Labor Affairs Bureau, a section of the department that combats human trafficking, child labour and forced labour. Mr Acosta had been defending his role in a 2008 plea deal that saw a light sentence for financier Jeffrey Epstein after he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges. Epstein was charged in July with new sex trafficking charges related to that case. Top Democrats had called on Mr Acosta to resign for engaging in ""an unconscionable agreement"" with Epstein. Mr Acosta said he negotiated the deal to ensure Epstein did not walk free, and that he was happy about the new case moving forward. While announcing his resignation, the former US attorney from Florida said he felt the ""right thing was to step aside"" so his past controversies would not overshadow the administration's accomplishments. Mr Trump, who stood next to Mr Acosta while he spoke to reporters, noted: ""This was him, not me."" He said Mr Acosta was ""a great Labour Secretary"". Just over two years. Ms Sanders started out as deputy press secretary before replacing Sean Spicer in the top post - the third woman to ever hold the White House role. While Press Secretary, she was accused of lying to journalists and frequently criticised the media for spreading ""fake news"" about the Trump administration. Press briefings also became increasingly rare during her tenure as Mr Trump took charge of his own messaging. Mrs Sanders hosted fewer news conferences than any of the preceding 13 press secretaries, according to the American Presidency Project. Exact reasons are unclear, but President Trump announced her resignation on Twitter and lauded her as a ""warrior"". During her resignation speech, Ms Sanders said her role had been ""the honour of a lifetime"". Nearly two years. Ms Sanders is a regular contributor on television news channel Fox News, and is active among conservative groups. Rod Rosenstein eventually submitted a resignation letter, effective from 11 May, after months of rumours about his departure. It came shortly after the release of the report into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election - an investigation he oversaw. Reports say he specially timed his departure to allow for Robert Mueller's probe to wind down first. His relationship with the president was always publicly fraught - with the lawyer frequently coming under fire on Mr Trump's Twitter feed. There were even reports in 2018 that Mr Rosenstein at one point planned to secretly record the president in order to justify his removal under the 25th amendment of the US constitution. Despite this, Mr Rosenstein's resignation letter paid tribute to Mr Trump. In it, Rosenstein said he was ""grateful"" for the opportunity to serve under him and even signed it off borrowing his campaign slogan of ""America first"". Just over two years from his confirmation. Kirstjen Nielsen became Homeland Security Secretary in December 2017. Her sprawling department, responsible for domestic security, covers everything from borders to responding to national emergencies. She faced criticism for enforcing some of the most controversial elements of President Trump's domestic agenda, such as the separation of children from their migrant parents at the Mexican border. In a resignation letter she said it was the ""right time for me to step aside"". There have been tensions between her and the president for months, who blamed her for a rise in migrants at the Mexican border. Days earlier President Trump withdrew his nominee to lead another key department dealing with immigration, saying he wanted to go in a ""tougher direction"". It is widely thought he wants someone ""tougher"" at Homeland Security too. 16 months. Six months after her resignation, the White House announced that she would be rejoining the Homeland Security department as a member of its National Infrastructure Advisory Council. In June 2020, the Australian government announced that it had hired her to help prepare a cyber security strategy. Brock Long was appointed administrator of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency by President Trump in April 2017 and confirmed by the Senate two months later. Fema is responsible for co-ordinating the response to disasters and in his tenure he oversaw 220 of them. He was quickly battered by two hurricanes. Harvey hit Texas with catastrophic effect in August 2017, while Maria a month later devastated Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US. He was one of those who bore heavy criticism for the response afforded to Puerto Rico. Mr Long gave no explicit reason for his departure, saying in a statement that it was ""time to go home to my family"". During his tenure, he was investigated for using government vehicles to commute from his home in North Carolina to Washington. He was later ordered to pay back the government $151,000 (Â£117,000) for the cost of several private journeys he claimed on expenses. 21 months from confirmation. Mr Long is executive chairman of Hagerty Consulting, an emergency management consultancy firm where he worked before joining FEMA. A former Navy SEAL, Ryan Zinke was picked to lead the agency that oversees federal land, including national parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone. He served as a congressman in his home state of Montana before the cabinet appointment. President Trump tweeted that Mr Zinke would be leaving the administration at the end of 2018. He did not offer any further details and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired. ""Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,"" Mr Trump said. Mr Zinke was under a number of investigations for his conduct in office.They include a land deal in Montana,externalinvolving Mr Zinke and the chairman of oilfield services Halliburton. Almost two years. In January 2019, Mr Zinke became managing director of Artillery One, an investment firm specialising in the technology and energy sectors. While details of the role are unclear, the company said Mr Zinke would help to ""pursue investing and development opportunities globally"". The retired Marine general was initially nominated to oversee Homeland Security before Mr Trump promoted him to chief of staff in July 2017, replacing Reince Priebus. However, on 8 December Mr Trump announced that Gen Kelly would leave his post by the end of the year. Key Trump aide John Kelly to leave job By December 2018 his relationship with the president was said to have deteriorated, with some reports saying the pair were no longer on speaking terms. Earlier in the year Mr Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an ""idiot"" after the quote was included in a book by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward. About one year, five months. (He was previously Homeland Security secretary from January to July 2017.) Mr Kelly serves on the board of Caliburn International, a professional services firm where we worked . The professional services company has several government contracts, including one to operate a migrant detention centre in Florida. A distinguished former Marine Corps general, Gen Mattis served in the Gulf War, the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War. Before his retirement in 2013 he served as head of US Central Command, and went on to several private sector roles before being tapped to join President Trump's cabinet. He positioned himself as one of the cooler heads throughout the president's term, and was referenced by Democrats and Republicans alike as a ""grown-up"" in the room - a far cry from his ""Mad Dog Mattis"" nickname. The move came just one day after the president controversially announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. Although not referring directly to that, in his resignation letter Gen Mattis said the president had the right to have a defence secretary ""whose views are better aligned"" with his. The two had diverging public views on a number of subjects, including Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,"" Gen Mattis wrote. President Trump was so angered with the letter than he accelerated Gen Mattis' departure date and said he was ""essentially fired."" Just under two years. Gen Mattis has returned to his former role as Fellow at the Hoover Institution - a think tank based at Stanford University. As a Fellow, the institute said he plans ""to focus his research and writing on domestic and international security policy."" In June 2020, he denounced Mr Trump's use of military force to quell anti-racism protests near the White House, and accused his former boss of setting up a ""false conflict"" between the military and civilian society. The former governor of South Carolina was the first non-white woman to be appointed to Mr Trump's cabinet, and the first female, minority governor of her state. She had limited foreign policy experience prior to her role as US envoy and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump during his campaign. As ambassador, she affirmed sanctions on Russia would continue, and that the US military could be deployed in the response to North Korean missile tests. But she frequently clashed with the president over several foreign policy issues, including a proposed ban on immigration to the US from several Muslim-majority countries. Trump names former critic as UN envoy In a news conference with Mr Trump, Mrs Haley announced she was stepping aside after a ""rough"" eight years as governor and envoy. She will be leaving her post at the end of 2018, but said she did not yet know what her next steps would be. Mrs Haley said she wanted to make sure Mr Trump's administration ""has the strongest person to fight"" for the US at the UN. While accepting her resignation, Mr Trump thanked her and said she did a ""terrific job"", making the role ""very glamorous"". One year, eleven months In April 2019, Ms Haley began sitting on the board of directors at Boeing. Critics suggested that she received the appointment as a reward for the tax breaks and subsidies which Boeing received while she was governor. The following March, the company announced that she had resigned because she opposed their move to seek financial support from the government amid the coronavirus crisis. The Alabama Republican was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, in early 2016. During the campaign, he became one of Mr Trump's closest national security advisers and, in government, was a supporter of the president's policies on immigration and law enforcement. Mr Sessions became a frequent target of the president's ire as soon as he stepped aside, in March 2017, from the investigation over alleged Russian collusion with Mr Trump's campaign. The recusal allowed his deputy Rod Rosenstein to oversee the inquiry, which led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. At various times, Mr Trump publicly belittled Mr Sessions as ""beleaguered"", ""VERY weak"", and ""DISGRACEFUL"". But Mr Sessions reacted to most of the insults in silence. US media reported that Gen Kelly had called Mr Sessions to say the president wanted him to step down. Mr Trump did not speak to Mr Sessions himself, and announced the departure on Twitter. In his resignation letter, Mr Sessions made clear the decision was not his own, saying: ""Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation."" One year, nine months In July 2020, Mr Sessions lost the Republican nomination for his old Senate seat in Alabama, losing to a candidate backed by Mr Trump. Mr Trump tweeted his delight at the result. Conceding defeat, Mr Sessions said he still had no regrets over recusing himself from the investigations into allegations of Russian interference. The lawyer served as the attorney general of Oklahoma from 2011 - 2017. He had sued the EPA, the agency which he presided over, a number of times in his role as the state's attorney general. Donald Trump announced that Mr Pruitt had resigned due to ""unrelenting attacks"" on himself and his family. Since taking office, Mr Pruitt was mired in series of scandals concerning his spending habits and alleged misuse of office, and is the subject of at least a dozen investigations into his conduct. He angered many liberals and environmentalists by severely curtailing the agency's activities and repealing many measures designed to protect the environment. The long list of Scott Pruitt controversies While accepting Mr Pruitt's resignation, Mr Trump tweeted that he had done ""an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him"". One year, four months A lieutenant general with the US Army, HR McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he ""might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker"". Mr Trump reportedly disliked his ""gruff and condescending"" manner and the pair reportedly disagreed on the administration's policy towards Russia, North Korea and Iran. Gen Kelly, White House chief of staff at the time, also had little positive to say about him. Thirteen months. Gen McMaster works as a fellow and lecturer at Stanford University. He is also a board member of Spirit of America, a charity which ""improves the safety and success"" of US military personnel and diplomats deployed abroad. In 2020, he is set to release a memoir called ""Battlegrounds"". The former president of the Goldman Sachs bank was appointed as head of the National Economic Council as Mr Trump took office, so becoming the president's top economic adviser. In his time at the White House, he helped push through sweeping reforms on taxes, one of the most significant policy achievements of the administration. But the two were not reported to be close, and rumours of Mr Cohn's departure continued to swirl. A staunch globalist, Mr Cohn had reportedly vowed to quit if Mr Trump pressed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US. According to US media, Mr Cohn initially planned to resign after Mr Trump blamed ""both sides"" for violence at a deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. Fourteen months. Since leaving, Mr Cohn has become a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Mr Tillerson was the first Secretary of State to be appointed under the Trump administration. A former oil executive, Mr Tillerson pushed for an end to sanctions on Russia and for the resumption of peace talks with North Korea. But his tenure was reportedly mired by clashes with the president over policy, and by the resignation of several high-ranking career diplomats. Mr Trump said his differences with Mr Tillerson came down to personal ""chemistry"". Indications of the pair's deteriorating relationship first surfaced after reports that Mr Tillerson had called the president a ""moron"". The comment was allegedly made after Mr Trump had pushed for a tenfold increase in America's nuclear arsenal. In a subsequent media appearance, the president challenged Mr Tillerson to ""compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win"". President Trump announced his departure in a tweet, though Mr Tillerson's spokesperson said he had not told about it beforehand. Fourteen months. Ms Hicks served as Mr Trump's press secretary and handled media requests during his campaign. She became his fourth director of strategic communications for the Trump White House after Anthony Scaramucci was fired after just 10 days in the job. The fashion model-turned-spokeswoman previously worked as a publicist for Ivanka Trump's fashion label before entering politics with Mr Trump's bid for the White House. Her resignation came a day after she testified to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told ""white lies"" for her boss. Her departure came only weeks after another top aide to Mr Trump, Rob Porter - with whom Ms Hicks was reported to have been in a relationship - quit amid allegations by two ex-wives of abuse. Six years in the Trump Organization, and three years with Mr Trump during his campaign and presidency. After leaving the White House, Ms Hicks became chief communications officer at Fox Corporation, an American broadcasting firm. In February 2020, she returned to the White House, taking on the role of counsellor to the president and reporting to Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. A doctor and former healthcare executive, Mr Shulkin had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as ""fantastic"" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team. Mr Shulkin had come under fire for alleged improper behaviour by department staff on a trip to Europe in 2017, including his own acceptance of tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. He denied wrongdoing but agreed to reimburse the government for his wife's air fare for the trip. Mr Shulkin won praise from veterans' groups, but his lack of action on privatising the Veterans Health Administration had angered conservatives. In parting, he condemned the ""toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive"" environment in Washington. Fourteen months In October 2019, the former VA Secretary published a book tracing his 13 months in the Trump administration. Rob Porter, pictured holding the document for President Trump, was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives A former political aide, Mr Porter was described as Mr Trump's ""right-hand man"" during his tenure. As Staff Secretary he helped to manage the flow of paperwork reaching Trump, from policy memos to speeches and news briefing documents. He was also responsible for circulating documents among senior staff for comment. Mr Porter resigned soon after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional abuse. One, Colbie Holderness, supplied a photo of herself with a black eye to the media. He denies all the accusations of abuse. The Daily Mail, which broke the story, reported that Mr Porter did not receive security clearance for his White House job after the FBI interviewed his ex-wives during background checks. After his resignation, questions quickly arose over how early the president's chief of staff, Gen Kelly, had been made aware of the accusations by the FBI, and if they had played a role in his diminished security clearance. One year. Since leaving, the Daily Mail reported that Mr Porter was secretly hired to help with President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the campaign's chief operating officer, Michael Glassner, denied the accusation. Andrew McCabe, a career FBI agent, served as the bureau's acting director for nearly three months after the president sacked James Comey. He was sacked days before he could retire with pension rights. The attorney has faced repeated criticism from President Trump, who claims his ties to Democrats made him partial in the ongoing Russia investigation. His wife, Jill McCabe, ran a failed Democratic bid for a state senate seat in Virginia in 2015, during which she received $500,000 (Â£355,000) from a political action group allied with Hillary Clinton - a move which Mr Trump apparently found unforgiveable. He was fired by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators. Mr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Before his departure, he had been under an internal investigation into the FBI's handling of two key inquiries during the 2016 presidential campaign: the revelations that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server while secretary of state; and suspicions that Russia was interfering to help Mr Trump win the presidency. Two years as FBI deputy director, including a year under Mr Trump's administration. Mr McCabe has retired from the FBI and is a contributor to news broadcaster CNN. The former Georgia congressman was a long-standing opponent of the Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare. Mr Price was confirmed by the Senate along party lines, amid allegations of insider trading while he worked on healthcare laws - which he denied. As health secretary, Mr Price was involved in President Trump's repeated failures to push through bills repealing Obamacare. An analysis of transport spending by Politico discovered that Mr Price had, between May and late September, spent more than $1m on flights. Some $500,000 of that was on military flights approved by the White House, but private charter flights made up at least $400,000 where commercial flights were available. Mr Trump said he was ""not happy"". Almost eight months. Steve Bannon joined the Trump campaign after leading the right-wing Breitbart News website, which rose to prominence through its attacks on mainstream Republicans, as well as those on the left. The website helped to elevate the so-called ""Alt-right"", which critics label a white supremacist group. Like other aides to Mr Trump, he made his fortune as an investment banker, but later turned to financing film and television programmes such as the popular 90s sitcom Seinfeld. Some of Mr Trump's most influential advisers, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been pushing for his departure for months. His firing came amid a public backlash to Mr Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which an anti-racist protester was killed by a 20-year-old man with Nazi sympathies. Fired one year after being named campaign chief. After his departure, Mr Bannon briefly rejoined Breitbart News as executive chairman. He drew ire from President Trump after the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury, which detailed several comments made by Mr Bannon that were critical of the administration. Mr Bannon remains active within politics and has served as an informal advisor to right-wing parties across Europe, Brazil and Israel. As part of this work he co-founded of The Movement, a Brussels-based organisation helping to promote the election of right-wing populist parties across Europe. The brash, Wall Street bigwig has known President Trump for years, and defended him in TV interviews. While in the job, he appeared to accuse then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's outbursts may have cost him any post alongside Gen Kelly, who was replacing Reince Priebus as chief of staff. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Gen Kelly was sworn-in. Ten days (although his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus 15 days.) Mr Scaramucci is a contributor to several media outlets and has founded his own media group, The Scaramucci Post. He is also a trustee of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Foundation. Mr Scaramucci has been a vocal critic of President Trump since his departure, and has been the target of several visceral tweets by the commander-in-chief. The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played key roles. President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". Six months. Mr Spicer is a public affairs officer with the US Navy and was appointed by President to serve on the US Naval Academy's Board of Visitors. He has also written a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President in which he referred to Trump as ""unicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow"". In a surprise public appearance, he entered as a contestant on popular TV show Dancing with the Stars in 2019. Mr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. He was criticised first by Democrats for the timing, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought. The president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation. However Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a ""showboat"" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking of the ""Russia thing"" when he made the decision to sack him. Three years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump. Since leaving he has been highly critical of the Trump administration. In August 2019, a Department of Justice report concluded that, after losing his job, Mr Comey divulged unclassified information from a memo he had written on his private conversations with Mr Trump. It ruled that he broke FBI rules by giving the contents of a memo to a friend so that it could be shared with a reporter. But the inspector general did not recommend Mr Comey be sued for the breach. Technically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president. His departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Mr Flynn has admitted to lying to the FBI about their pair discussing US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. 23 days. Mr Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI.In June 2020, a federal court moved to dismiss charges against him. The president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Ms Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order. A White House statement said Ms Yates had ""betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States"". It also described her as ""weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration"". 10 days. She previously served as deputy attorney general from May 2015 until January 2017. Ms Yates is a partner at law firm King & Spalding, and lectures at Georgetown University Law Centre. It is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on. At the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News. Mr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard. But there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president. Seven years, seven months. Less than two months under Mr Trump. Mr Bharara is a Scholar in Residence at New York University Law School, and co-hosts a legal podcast called ""Cafe Insider"". Paul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it. He was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair. The Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a statement wishing him well. But a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US. He has since been jailed for hiding $55m (Â£42m) from US tax authorities - money he was paid by pro-Russia politicians. Three months. Manafort is serving a more than seven-year sentence for fraud. He was released from prison in May 2020 after his lawyers argued that he was at high risk of contracting coronavirus. He is serving the rest of his sentence under home confinement.

"The 59-year-old man (not pictured here) held on to plastic bellows between two carriages A man has survived a 160km/h (99mph) ride holding on to the side of a high-speed train in Germany, officials say. Deutsche Bahn said he grabbed plastic bellows connecting two carriages of the Bielefeld-Hannover express on Thursday, using just a small ledge to stand on. The 59-year-old man acted after the ICE train with his luggage inside had started moving away from the station. Rail officials alerted the driver, who slowed down the train before stopping at a station 25km down the track. ""The 59-year-old can thank the rail personnel for the fact that he is still alive,"" a police spokesperson was quoted as saying. The man - who was unhurt and is believed to be from Romania - then continued his journey to Hannover inside the carriage. He was later expected to be questioned by police, reports said. It was not immediately clear whether any charges would be brought against him.

"At least 21 employees at the US embassy in Havana fell ill The US is withdrawing more than half of its staff at its embassy in Cuba in response to mysterious attacks which left its diplomats unwell. Washington is also warning Americans not to visit the country because some attacks occurred in hotels. At least 21 staff reported health problems ranging from mild brain trauma and deafness to dizziness and nausea. Describing the US decision as ""hasty"", Cuba said it would affect bilateral ties but co-operation would continue. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the two countries would continue to co-operate in investigating the attacks and said diplomatic ties would be maintained. Earlier reports suggested that sonic attacks were to blame. Cuba denies any involvement. At least two Canadians were also affected. The US is ordering all non-essential staff in the embassy in Havana to leave, along with all family members. Only ""emergency personnel"" will remain. The US has suspended visa processing in Cuba indefinitely. US-Cuba thaw halted amid diplomat injuries Details of new 'sonic attack' emerge ""Until the government of Cuba can ensure safety of our people, we will be reduced to emergency personnel,"" a US state department official said. ""At least 21 employees have been targeted in specific attacks,"" the official said. Despite an investigation involving the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Cuban authorities, there is still no full explanation as to the cause of the incidents since late 2016. ""We don't know the means, the methods or how the attacks are being carried out,"" the official said on Friday. Late 2016:US embassy staff and at least one Canadian began to notice symptoms May:US expels two Cuban diplomats for failing to protect its diplomats August:US says 16 employees have been treated but attacks seem to have stopped Early September:US says attacks are continuing and 19 staff members have now been hurt 29 September:Washington pulls diplomatic staff, warns US citizens not to visit and says 21 embassy employees now injured But earlier reports suggested they were sonic attacks in which staff in Havana were targeted by audio waves, leaving several with chronic hearing issues. Using an inaudible sound device for a stealth attack ""is quite plausible from a technical point of view"", Denis Bedat, a specialist in bio-electromagnetics, told AFP news agency this week. ""Ultrasonic waves, beyond the acoustic capacity of humans, can be broadcast with an amplifier, and the device does not need to be large, or used inside or outside a house."" He gave as an example the Active Denial System (ADS), an anti-riot gun used by US police forces that emits electromagnetic waves which produce a sudden unbearable burning sensation. What is a covert sound weapon? The US has not blamed Cuba for the suspected attacks. Both the US and Cuban governments ""have not yet identified the guilty party"", the state department official said. ""We have not ruled out the possibility of a third country as a part of the investigation but that investigation continues,"" the official added. President Raul Castro had reportedly given his personal assurance to the then-US charge d'affaires in Havana that Cuba was not behind the attacks. The US reopened its embassy in Havana in 2015 following decades of frozen relations. In 2016 President Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. In June President Donald Trump announced a partial roll-back of Mr Obama's Cuba policies but said he would not close the US embassy in Havana. One resident of Havana, Andres Murci, told Reuters news agency: ""With the new Trump administration, everything has been lost, everything has gone backwards. We are turning back to the same thing we had before. Everything we advanced with Obama has now turned back.""

"Ayahuasca is a potent hallucinogenic brew that has been used by shamans, or healers, in the Amazon for centuries for medical and spiritual purposes. It is one of the strongest psychedelic drugs in the world, and its use has been spreading from South America to Europe. Many experts say ayahuasca is dangerous, and it is illegal in the UK, but one doctor says it should be researched as a treatment for mental health issues. After undergoing traditional therapy over a number of years, Jonathan Gold found out about ayahuasca online, reading that it ""could be like 10 years of therapy in one night"". He travelled to a rural part of the Netherlands for a ceremony where he drank a very small amount the drug, resulting in a ""trip"" that lasted about eight hours. ""The ceremony is like this epic, eight-hour journey, it really is a journey,"" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""It was like night and day... a dramatic change that I would notice on a daily basis. If we say my self-esteem before the ceremony was at 10%, after the ceremony it was 90-100%. It really was that dramatic."" Experts, however, believe taking drugs at retreats is dangerous. Harry Shapiro, director of the online drug information service DrugWise, says: ""People are naively going off and taking a very strong drug."" Some people have had terrifying experiences and violent reactions. And Mr Shapiro says: ""There is no support there if it goes wrong."" Ayahuasca is a potent hallucinogenic brew that has been used by shamans, or healers, in the Amazon for centuries for medical and spiritual purposes. Many backpackers have taken it while in South America over the past few decades, but there are now growing number of ayahuasca ceremonies being conducted in Europe. Taking ayahuasca is illegal in the UK Ayahuasca, also known as yage, is a blend of two plants - the ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) and a shrub called chacruna (Psychotria viridis), which contains the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT). DMT - and therefore ayahuasca - is illegal in the UK, the US and many other countries. It could have serious implications for anybody who has a history of mental health problems, warns the Talk To Frank website. It says the drug could also be responsible for triggering issues in those who are predisposed to mental health problems but unaware of the fact. When David Rees and his friend Sam took the drug in 2014, Sam spent the whole experience laughing. ""On the surface he was cool, had his act together, all he did was talk about what a great time he had. There was no sign anything was wrong,"" David says. David Rees believes his friend killed himself because he had taken ayahuasca But he believes Sam had opened Pandora's box by taking the drug. ""It brought to the surface things he'd been carrying his whole life and he didn't have the support to deal with it and integrate this emotion into his life. And I think that's why he decided to kill himself,"" he says. Despite such dangers, one addiction psychiatrist and psychopharmacology researcher is calling for ayahuasca to be investigated as a possible treatment for conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - under strict controls. ""If we can show it works and can be used safely, it's absolutely ethical we develop it for medicine,"" says Dr Ben Sessa - who is not advocating taking the drug on a retreat. ""We need to find a way to make these as safe as possible because to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say they have no uses unless they're 100% safe is just not good science."" Dr Bia Labate, one of the world's leading ayahuasca experts, agrees there is lots of potential and anecdotal evidence for its use in medicine. ""There are currently 80 subjects in a clinical trial in Brazil looking at its impact on people with depression - it's very rigorous and very promising.  In Brazil it has helped people with depression who have been resistant to other treatments,"" she says. But she adds that medicinal benefits are not the drug's only ""mission"". ""There is a cultural, religious and spiritual use, which is the most important thing. A path for people interested in personal growth and spirituality, and that's where I think it has the strongest appeal"". Dr Christos Dimitriou, a consultant psychiatrist who specialises in depression and PTSD, says the most important thing is for people in distress to be assessed by professionals and given a tailored treatment plan, not try to solve it themselves on a retreat. He says ayahuasca still needs ""huge amounts"" of research. ""There is a lot of work being done with MDMA [methylenedioxymethamphetamine] for PTSD and ketamine for depression. It's a long process before something is ready that a doctor can use with confidence in specific amounts. We are light years away from ayahuasca being in that category."" Harry Shapiro from DrugWise says he is most concerned about people taking the drug at retreats in Europe - as there is no guarantee they won't have a bad experience. ""Proper clinical trials to see if there is a genuine medical benefit are fine. These proper cultural ceremonies are fine. But I am doubtful whether this kind of drug tourism is a good idea. There's no support there if it goes wrong,"" he says. ""People are naively going off and taking a very strong drug. You should do your research before you head off to a weekend retreat in the country and start experimenting.""

"Former soldier and police officer Henry Bolton has been elected UKIP leader - the party's fourth in just over a year. Mr Bolton, who saw off challenges from better-known contenders, told UKIP members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line."" Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she won. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he was delighted andpraised Mr Bolton,externalas ""a man of real substance"". The party's leadership has been in flux since Mr Farage quit, following the 2016 referendum which saw the UK vote to leave the EU - the issue for which UKIP had long campaigned. Who is new UKIP leader Henry Bolton? Mr Bolton's win came as a surprise to some as Sharia Watch founder Ms Waters had been the bookies' favourite and London Assembly member Peter Whittle was considered a front runner. In the end, Mr Bolton won with 30% of the 12,915 votes cast, Ms Waters got 21% and Mr Whittle came in fifth with 11% in a seven-way contest. The 54-year-old former soldier, who also served with Thames Valley police and has worked for the UN, stood for UKIP as police and crime commissioner in Kent in 2016, coming second. In 2005, he was a parliamentary candidate for the Lib Dems. This video can not be played UKIP's chairman says he is ânot worriedâ about any legal action as the party ""did our due diligence"" Speaking at the UKIP conference in Torquay, Mr Bolton urged party members to ""rally around the party"", saying: ""Without being united, we cannot lead."" ""We can't lead the nation and we can't hold the government to account and we can't achieve our core purpose at all,"" he said. He promised to reorganise the party to increase its effectiveness and said he wanted to project UKIP ""firmly and decisively into British politics for the good of the nation"". Winner: Henry Bolton, 3,874 votes (29.9%) Anne Marie Waters, 2,755 votes (21.3%) David Kurten, 2,201 votes (17%) John Rees-Evans, 2,021 votes (15.6%) Peter Whittle, 1,413 votes, (10.9%) Jane Collins, 566 votes, 4.4% Aidan Powlesland, 85 votes, 0.65% Controversy about Ms Waters's candidacy had prompted threats from some MEPs that they would leave the party if she won. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said Mr Bolton would be seen as the continuity candidate. UKIP also unveiled a new logo at its conference, replacing its well-known purple pound sign, with a lion - whichsome, including Gary Lineker, suggested,externalbore a resemblance to that of the Premier League. Party chairman Paul Oakden told the BBC's Daily Politics he was not worried the similarities might lead to legal issues: ""We did our due diligence before we put these logos to the membership and as I said, we are perfectly comfortable."" Former party leader Paul Nuttall quit after the general election, which saw UKIP's vote share shrink to 1.8% from 12.6% in 2015 - the year before the UK voted to leave the European Union. His predecessor Diane James, who replaced Nigel Farage, lasted just 18 days in the job, saying she did not have enough authority in the party. Mr Farage returned for a spell as interim leader.

"Tougher controls on the sale of wood burning stoves are being discussed by the mayor's office London Mayor Sadiq Khan is seeking new powers to ban wood burning in the most polluted areas of the capital. The mayor has written to the Environment Secretary Michael Gove asking for greater powers to tackle air pollution not caused by traffic. Mr Khan wants to introduce a network of ""zero-emission zones"" where the burning of wood or coal is completely prohibited. He also wants tougher controls on the sale of wood-burning stoves. Under the mayor's proposals only low-emission versions of wood-burning stoves would be allowed to remain on the market. There are currently 187 areas of London where pollution regularly exceeds European limits. Mr Khan's plans also include curbing emissions from machinery on building sites, such as diesel-powered diggers, and boats on the Thames. Mr Khan said in a statement: ""With more than 400 schools located in areas exceeding legal pollution levels, and such significant health impacts on our most vulnerable communities, we cannot wait any longer and I am calling on government to provide the capital with the necessary powers to effectively tackle harmful emissions from a variety of sources."" A spokesman for Mr Khan said the proposals would include ""very small zones to curb pollution caused by wood-burning stoves"" by 2025. ""It is one of a number of ideas and it would need legislation from government and it would be at least six years away from happening,"" they added. Under the mayor's plans, councils would get the power to enforce the ban, including the ability to carry out inspections and issue fines. But under theThe Clean Air Act,externallocal councils can already set up Smoke Control Areas where only smokeless fuels should be burnt, or wood is burnt only in ""exempt appliances"". Homeowners can be fined Â£1,000,although there is no evidence anyone in London has been. Air pollution causes an estimated 9,500 early deaths a year in London and 40,000 across Britain. A new Â£10 ""toxicity charge"" is set to be introduced in October this year for pre-2006 diesel and petrol cars entering the London congestion charge zone.

Mr Musk told the audience he aimed to start sending people to Mars in 2024. His SpaceX company would begin building the necessary ships to support the mission next year. He says he is refocusing SpaceX to work on just one type of vehicle - known as the BFR - which could do all of the firm's current work and interplanetary travel. Elon Musk: ""That's not a typo"" Mr Musk first laid out his Mars travel ambitions at the IAC in 2016. Twelve months on, he returned with more detail. His BFR, although still massive, is now a little smaller at 106m in height and 9m in width. The major difference compared with the original version, however, was cost, the South African-born American said. ""I think we've figured out how to pay for it. This is very important."" Elon Musk and the hyperbolic hyperloop 'announcement' Musk warns of 'killer robot' arms race The route to affordability, he explained, was in refocusing all of the company's efforts into the one system - and then using that to meet all its customers' needs. Artwork: The BFR would launch much bigger or many more satellites than current rockets This means the BFR would launch satellites and service the space station - as SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule do now - but also take people to the Moon and Mars, and do what is termed ""point to point"" travel on Earth. ""Most of what people consider to be long-distance trips could be completed in less than half-an-hour,"" he told the Adelaide audience. ""Some of our customers are conservative and they want to see the BFR fly several times before they're comfortable launching [on it],"" Mr Musk said. ""So what we plan to do is to build ahead and have a stock of Falcon 9 and Dragon vehicles, so that customers can be comfortable if they want to use the old rocket, the old spacecraft - they can do that because we'll have a bunch in stock. ""But all of our resources will then turn to building BFR."" Artwork: Musk envisages colonies on Mars As well as being the CEO and chief designer at SpaceX, Mr Musk also founded the Tesla electric car company and is chairman of SolarCity which specialises in renewables technologies, such as high-storage batteries. He has attracted a rock-star following from fans who love his visionary thinking. And although his promises have often taken much longer to deliver, he has achieved a number of notable firsts. These include 16-in-a-row successful landings of orbital-class rockets back on Earth after they have completed their missions. Two of these rockets have even flown a second time. This video can not be played Elon Musk's 'underground road plan' Key to his thinking is the concept of reusability. Space activity is currently expensive only because it is disposable, he says. There is no reason, he claims, why rocket systems cannot be made to operate like airliners where the most significant ongoing cost is the fuel in the tanks. His Falcon 9 rocket is partially reusable; the BFR would be totally reusable. The same vehicle would fly time and time again. Mr Musk recognises that his ambitious timelines sometimes slip. When he put up a slide in Adelaide stating that the first cargo (no humans aboard) versions of BFR would go to Mars in 2022, he said: ""That's not a typo, although it is aspirational."" Elon Musk rolls out cheapest Tesla yet Australia to host 'historic' large battery Artwork: Why haven't we got a lunar base yet, Musk complained His many fans in the audience lapped up the presentation, but his numerous business customers will also have stiffened slightly at the news that SpaceX is to begin diverting its energies towards the all-new rocket system. These customers are extremely conservative - as Mr Musk himself concedes. They are only just beginning to grapple with the idea that they can put their very expensive satellites on ""second-hand"" Falcons. Now they must also get used to the idea that the Falcon will eventually be replaced by another rocket system - the BFR. Prof Alan Duffy is from the centre for astrophysics and supercomputing at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. He was among the 4,000-strong audience at the IAC. ""This is SpaceX's Elon Musk. This is what he does,"" he told the BBC. ""What I love about SpaceX - and why the world's scientists and engineers are willing to give them that credence - is that they make things profitable at every step of the way. ""They have a big vision, they work towards it, but the steps they take are always with the profit in mind. And if there's a profit there, you can guarantee that businesses will see it through."" Elon Musk has hinted that BFR stands for ""Big F****** Rocket"" He has set out timelines that are aggressive even for him Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Musk warns of 'killer robot' arms race Row between Musk and Zuckerberg over AI Elon Musk and the hyperbolic hyperloop 'announcement' Elon Musk rolls out cheapest Tesla yet Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres under fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"The Michelin Guide complimented the hotel's ""elegant oval dining room"" as well as its cooking A Scottish country house hotel has followed a celebrated French chef by asking to be stripped of its Michelin star rating. Boath House, which has held a Michelin star for the past 10 years, said the dining guide's expectations were ""at odds with achievable profit margins"". The hotel at Auldearn, near Nairn, said customers wanted a ""more informal and relaxed"" experience. Last week, Sebastien Bras asked for his eatery to be dropped from the guide. His restaurant in Le Suquet, France, has held three stars since 1999, but Mr Brassaid he wanted to be dropped from Michelin's 2018 rosterin order ""to start a new chapter"". In a statement, Boath House owners Don and Wendy Matheson said they too wanted to ""re-evaluate their relationship"" with the Michelin Guide, after deciding to ""move Boath House in a new direction"". Mrs Matheson said: ""Whilst we are extremely proud of the Michelin star we gained 10 years ago and it undoubtedly enhanced our reputation, our restaurant has consistently made a loss. ""We believe that the expectations from Michelin are at odds with achievable profit margins and put an enormous stress on a small family-run business like ours. ""The feedback we are hearing time and time again from our customers is that they want an experience that is more informal and relaxed and this extends to the restaurant, the food and even how it is served."" Mrs Matheson says the expectations from Michelin ""put an enormous stress"" on a small family-run business According to the current Michelin Guide, Boath House is ""an elegant oval dining room in an early 19C mansion. Well-balanced modern menus showcase the chef's skill and understanding. ""Cooking is accomplished, with vivid presentation and interesting flavours - and much of the produce is from their garden or orchard. Sit at bespoke oak tables and take in the lake view."" Responding to Boath House's move, the editor of the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland, Rebecca Burr, said: ""It's obviously up to individual restaurants how they want to run their businesses, and there is absolutely no formula for winning or retaining a Michelin star. ""There has certainly been a trend towards more informal dining over the past 10 years or so, and in fact Michelin has been at the absolute forefront of recognising and celebrating that."" Boath House's decision to walk away from its star rating comes as it continues a major overhaul of its operations. The hotel is to open a ""casual and rustic"" cafe in its walled garden next year, having already made changes to its dining room to allow for ""more approachable and less expensive options"". Boath House's announcement comes after French chef Sebastien Bras (left) said he also wants to be stripped of his Michelin rating A major refurbishment of the hotel's rooms is also taking place. Mrs Matheson added: ""The aim is to provide a warm, comfortable touch of contemporary luxury combined with homely charm. ""Using local artisanal suppliers, the interiors of this design-led restaurant with rooms intends to deliver a Highland experience without undue formality. ""We are confident that this is where the accommodation and dining market is going and that we will have a more sustainable product. ""It will be interesting to see whether this will be reflected in subsequent reviews of our restaurant with rooms by industry bodies in the hospitality sector.""

"Bertie (left) from Surrey, Ukiyo from Addiscombe in south London and Missy from Coulsdon have all been killed Forensic experts are re-examining the case of the""Croydon cat killer"", thought to have mutilated about 250 cats across the country. The killings began in London in 2015 but more have been reported across the UK, including in Manchester and Birmingham. Many cats have been dismembered, with the deaths described as ""gruesome"" by animal welfare workers. A new forensic lab in Surrey is to examine some corpses for new evidence. Initially, foxes had been thought to be responsible but London charity Snarl revealed some 50 foxes had been found with identical injuries to the cats, and suggested five rabbit deaths and two swan decapitations could also be linked. In Northampton,two owners found the dismembered bodies of their cats left in carrier bagson their doorstep. Rusty, a one-year-old cat, was deliberately mutilated and left on the doorstep of its owner's home Dr Alex Stoll, lead forensic veterinary pathologist at the University of Surrey, said: ""It is becoming increasingly well-documented that animal cruelty can be used as a component part of domestic violence. ""There is a growing body of evidence to indicate that people who harm animals are more likely to abuse humans."" His colleague Jo Millington said forensic experts would try to establish whether attacks had been carried out by a human or a scavenging animal. ""A big part of what we are doing is to be certain the animals have been subjected to human intervention,"" she said. And they would also look for human DNA on the remains, she added. Ukiyo's remains were found in West Norwood Dr Stoll, one of the experts behind the new lab dedicated to combating crimes against animals, said the service - set up in partnership with ArroGen Veterinary Forensics - aimed to increase prosecution success rates and arm agencies such as the RSPCA and police with evidence. He said a current lack of forensic veterinary expertise meant some cases might not be prosecuted, or prosecutions would fail.

"Lukasz Herba, left, and his brother Michal are suspects in the alleged kidnap A man accused of conspiring to kidnap British model Chloe Ayling should be extradited to Italy to face trial, a judge has ruled. Michal Konrad Herba, 36, and his brother Lukasz Herba are facing charges over the alleged abduction of 20-year-old Ms Ayling. A hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled he should join his brother in custody in Italy. His lawyers said they would lodge a High Court appeal on Monday. Prosecutors had requested Mr Herba be sent to court in Milan in relation to an offence of kidnapping, arising from events between 11 and 17 July. At the magistrates' court, Judge Paul Goldspring said: ""I have decided you should be surrendered to Italy to face trial for the kidnap."" Ms Ayling claimed she was drugged and bundled into the boot of a car after being tricked into attending a fake photo shoot in the town in Italy on 11 July. It is alleged the brothers demanded a 300,000 euro (Â£265,000) ransom for the model. Michal Konrad Herba denies any involvement and his brother has said he did not knowingly take part in any crime. Speaking after the alleged abduction, the model said she feared for her life Speaking after the ruling Mr Herba's lawyer said his client had ""repeatedly offered"" to give evidence to the Italian authorities via video link. ""They have refused to hear his evidence and instead persisted with this coercive extradition request. ""He was confident that once he told the Italian authorities the whole truth behind this case they would drop their extradition request. However, they refused this offer."" At an earlier hearing,Mr Herba's lawyers said the case was a ""sham"", invented as a ""publicity stunt"". The 36-year-old has been in custody since his arrest in the Tividale area of Sandwell, West Midlands, in August. His brother is being held in Milan where he was arrested after handing Ms Ayling over to the British embassy there on 17 July.

"Scottish Dawn members mask their faces and carry distinctive yellow flags featuring the group's ""life rune"" symbol The Scottish Dawn neo-Nazi group has beenbanned by Home Secretary Amber Rudd under the UK's anti-terror laws. From today, being a member or active supporter of the organisation is a criminal offence - with a sentence of up to 10 years in prison for anyone convicted of being involved. On its website, the group describes itself as a ""patriotic society for the defence of our race and nation active across Scotland"". Despite claiming to have been inspired by SNP founder Arthur Donaldson, it despises the party and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and is vehemently opposed to multiculturalism and the ""global liberal elite"". The group's first public appearances came at an anti-refugee protest in Alloa in March, when a small number of hooded and masked supporters stood alongside other extremist groups including the National Front and Scottish Defence League. They appeared at a similar protest in Wishaw the following month. The group first appeared at an anti-refugee protest in Alloa earlier this year Members stand out through their distinctive yellow flags, which feature the black ""life rune"" symbol that was used by the Nazis and has since been adopted by other neo-Nazi groups. In keeping with other racist hate groups across the UK and Europe, and the alt-right in the US, Scottish Dawn is keen to foster a more modern image than that of the stereotypical bovver-booted skinhead in an attempt to disguise its Nazi ideology and lure in new members. It describes itself as ""identitarian"" - a term that originated among extreme right-wing groups in France and has since been adopted across northern Europe by neo-Nazis looking to appeal to a younger, more contemporary generation. The group claims to have held regular litter-picking days and to have volunteered at an animal sanctuary. And members are also encouraged to participate in ""regular hikes in Scotland's beautiful countryside"", with the group claiming to ""offer the opportunity for both health and socialising"". Leading Scottish Dawn figures were secretly filmed by undercover journalists duringa seven-month investigation on behalf of the Ferret website,externaland theDaily Record newspaper,external- with one member being exposed as a former UKIP activist. This video can not be played What is National Action? Ms Rudd's announcement that Scottish Dawn and another neo-Nazi group called NS131 would be banned came the day after11 men were arrested under anti-terror lawsas part of an investigation into the National Action organisation. The raids were in addition to three other men - including two British soldiers - beingcharged under anti-terror laws earlierthis month over allegations that they were  members of National Action. National Action became the first far-right hate group to be banned under the UK's anti-terror laws last year, after it praised Thomas Mair for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox. At the time, Ms Rudd described National Action as a ""racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic organisation"". National Action praised neo-Nazi terrorist Thomas Mair for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox last year Scottish Dawn and NS131 both emerged shortly after National Action was outlawed, and the authorities believe the groups were created as a way for National Action supporters to get around the ban. The links between Scottish Dawn and National Action were exposed by the undercover journalists, who recorded one member saying that ""there are some members in the group that were in National Action"". Ms Rudd said she would not allow the ""vile racist"" group to ""masquerade under different names"". Despite the ban, Scottish Dawn's website was still accessible on Friday morning. Under the Terrorism Act 2000, the home secretaryhas the power to ban an organisation if she believes it is ""concerned in terrorism"",external. This is defined as either committing or preparing to commit acts of terrorism, as well as promoting, encouraging or glorifying terrorism. The home secretary also has the power to ban any aliases of an outlawed group in order to prevent it simply carrying on under a different name once it has been banned - as in the case of Scottish Dawn. There are currently more than 70 groups proscribed under the act, including so-called Islamic State, as well as Al Shabaab, Al Qa'ida, Boko Haram and the Haqqani Network. A further 14 organisations in Northern Ireland were proscribed under previous legislation. Under the act, anyone who is an active member or supporter of a banned organisation in the UK faces up to 10 years in prison, with the authorities also given powers to seize assets and remove online material.

Mr Haines confirmed Ryanair had contacted the aviation watchdog late on Friday afternoon and said; ""Our job is to protect passengers' rights and ensure that all airlines operating in the UK are fully compliant with important consumer laws. ""Where we find that an airline is systematically flouting these rules, we will not hesitate to take action, to minimise the harm and detriment caused to passengers, as we have done with Ryanair in recent days.  It appears that Ryanair has now capitulated. ""We will review their position in detail and monitor this situation to ensure that passengers get what they are entitled to in practice,"" Haines added. Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said: ""We are committed to processing all such claims within 21 days of receipt and hope to have all such claims settled before the end of October."" Ryanair cancelled up to 50 flights a day through to the end of October, affecting 315,000 passengers. It then cancelled another 18,000 flights between November and March, affecting the travel plans of another 400,000 passengers. The disruption was brought about because of an error with pilot holiday rotas and Ryanair said cancelling flights would ""eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations"". The budget airline said it has updated the Frequently Asked Questions section of its website to reflect all of these changes.

"At least 21 employees at the US embassy in Havana fell ill The US is withdrawing more than half of its staff at its embassy in Cuba in response to mysterious attacks which left its diplomats unwell. Washington is also warning Americans not to visit the country because some attacks occurred in hotels. At least 21 staff reported health problems ranging from mild brain trauma and deafness to dizziness and nausea. Describing the US decision as ""hasty"", Cuba said it would affect bilateral ties but co-operation would continue. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the two countries would continue to co-operate in investigating the attacks and said diplomatic ties would be maintained. Earlier reports suggested that sonic attacks were to blame. Cuba denies any involvement. At least two Canadians were also affected. The US is ordering all non-essential staff in the embassy in Havana to leave, along with all family members. Only ""emergency personnel"" will remain. The US has suspended visa processing in Cuba indefinitely. US-Cuba thaw halted amid diplomat injuries Details of new 'sonic attack' emerge ""Until the government of Cuba can ensure safety of our people, we will be reduced to emergency personnel,"" a US state department official said. ""At least 21 employees have been targeted in specific attacks,"" the official said. Despite an investigation involving the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Cuban authorities, there is still no full explanation as to the cause of the incidents since late 2016. ""We don't know the means, the methods or how the attacks are being carried out,"" the official said on Friday. Late 2016:US embassy staff and at least one Canadian began to notice symptoms May:US expels two Cuban diplomats for failing to protect its diplomats August:US says 16 employees have been treated but attacks seem to have stopped Early September:US says attacks are continuing and 19 staff members have now been hurt 29 September:Washington pulls diplomatic staff, warns US citizens not to visit and says 21 embassy employees now injured But earlier reports suggested they were sonic attacks in which staff in Havana were targeted by audio waves, leaving several with chronic hearing issues. Using an inaudible sound device for a stealth attack ""is quite plausible from a technical point of view"", Denis Bedat, a specialist in bio-electromagnetics, told AFP news agency this week. ""Ultrasonic waves, beyond the acoustic capacity of humans, can be broadcast with an amplifier, and the device does not need to be large, or used inside or outside a house."" He gave as an example the Active Denial System (ADS), an anti-riot gun used by US police forces that emits electromagnetic waves which produce a sudden unbearable burning sensation. What is a covert sound weapon? The US has not blamed Cuba for the suspected attacks. Both the US and Cuban governments ""have not yet identified the guilty party"", the state department official said. ""We have not ruled out the possibility of a third country as a part of the investigation but that investigation continues,"" the official added. President Raul Castro had reportedly given his personal assurance to the then-US charge d'affaires in Havana that Cuba was not behind the attacks. The US reopened its embassy in Havana in 2015 following decades of frozen relations. In 2016 President Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. In June President Donald Trump announced a partial roll-back of Mr Obama's Cuba policies but said he would not close the US embassy in Havana. One resident of Havana, Andres Murci, told Reuters news agency: ""With the new Trump administration, everything has been lost, everything has gone backwards. We are turning back to the same thing we had before. Everything we advanced with Obama has now turned back.""

"This video can not be played Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney hints interest rates may rise on Radio 4's Today Interest rates could rise in the ""relatively near term"" the Governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC. In the clearest indication yet that there could be a rate rise as early as November, Mark Carney suggested that it was time for the bank to ""ease its foot off the accelerator"". The next opportunity for a change in interest rates is the Bank's monetary policy committee meeting on 2 November. The governor also warned against ""reckless"" household borrowing. He said that while overall lending to UK consumers had come down markedly since the financial crisis, there was a danger from rapid ""frothy"" growth in some areas of household borrowing. UK annual growth rate revised down Balls: Treasury 'washed its hands' of duty May in strong defence of free market ""What we're worried about is a pocket of risk - a risk in consumer debt, credit card debt, debt for cars, personal loans,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. He said banks had ""not been as disciplined as they should be"" in their underwriting standards and pricing of this debt. Pressed on when the Bank was likely to raise interest rates, a move that would make borrowing more expensive, Mr Carney confirmed the latest analysis from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. ""If the economy continues on the track that it's been on, and all indications are that it is, in the relatively near term we can expect that interest rates will increase,"" he said. It's not quite a promise to raise rates next month. But Mr Carney's remarks do reinforce the expectation that it is going to happen. That said, he also made it plain that we shouldn't expect any great drama. He used a motoring metaphor and it's not a question of hitting the brakes - rather, as he put it, easing off the accelerator. So what we can expect next month is probably a reversal of the rate cut the Bank made in the aftermath of the EU referendum. That was, to continue the motoring analogy, intended to pump a little more fuel into the economy at a time when the bank seemed to fear it might stall. Now we have higher inflation and that is the basis for a rate rise. On the other hand economic growth has slowed which is why Mr Carney hints at a very modest rise that will leave rates very close to their all-time low. Speculation has been growing that the Bank could raise interest rates at its next meeting. The last time rates were raised was July 2007 before the financial crisis. Since then interest rates have been kept low in order to boost the economy by keeping cost of borrowing down. Recent low unemployment figures and stronger inflation have made a rise in rates more likely. ""We're talking about just easing the foot off the accelerator to keep with the speed limit of the economy and so interest rate increases when they come - when and if they come - will be to a limited extent and gradual,"" Mr Carney said. However new figures from the Office for National Statistics for the three months to June showed the economy growing at just 1.5% a year, a slower pace than previously estimated. Chris Williamson, chief business economist, at IHS Markit said it would be unprecedented for the Bank of England to tighten interest rate policy given ""such anaemic growth"". Despite Mr Carney's comments the pound slipped against the dollar and the euro  following the ONS's revision of the growth figures. The Bank Governor also responded tocomments from former shadow chancellor Ed Ballsand former prime minister Gordon Brown that there should be changes to the way the Bank of England cooperates with the Treasury to ensure financial stability. Mr Carney rejected suggestions that reform was needed, arguing the system was ""incredibly well designed"" with the Bank's current role of identifying and highlighting risks to the economy, but with the big decisions resting with the government.

"Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed in the 1998 attack ""I hate them. I know it's a strong word. I hate what they've done."" For Donna-Maria Barker, the loss of her 12-year-old son in the 1998 Omagh bomb is still searingly raw. James Barker was one of 29 people - including a woman pregnant with twins - killed in the Real IRA attack in 1998. But, despite the pain of the memory, Mrs Barker will return to Northern Ireland - and Omagh - this weekend for a service dedicated to ""children of the Troubles"". Omagh bomb relatives sue NI police chief Timeline of Omagh bomb legal cases The service takes place in Fivemiletown Methodist Church in County Tyrone, on Sunday. It will include the dedication of a quilt to Alan Jack, the Troubles' youngest victim, who died aged five months after a bomb in Strabane in 1972. Ms Barker, who is originally from Londonderry but lives in England, will dedicate a patch of the memorial quilt to her son - but said she will also visit the town where her son died. She is being hosted by the organisation, the South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF). Donna-Maria Barker pictured in 2001, with Michael Gallagher (left) whose son was also killed in the bomb She said it was a ""very difficult decision and it is going to be hard"". ""I am so lucky that my youngest son, Oliver-Tristan, will accompany me. I'm doing it for James, only James, not for myself,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. No one has been convicted over the bombing and Ms Barker said she believes that she will never see justice in her lifetime. This video can not be played 'I hate them and what they've done to my life' Earlier this year, relatives of the victimsannounced they would sue the PSNI's chief constablefor failings they believed allowed the killers to escape justice. ""It's very sad, but if I lose that anger in me, I lose the fight for James. And, I know being a Catholic myself, that you have to forgive and forget. No, no. ""It'd have been different if my child had have been seriously ill, or knocked over, or killed by a car or something like that. ""But this was vicious. They wanted to maim and kill and I hate them. I hate what they've done to my life and my kids' life. ""In my short life, I don't think I'll ever get justice."" That anger is something that Ms Barker also directs at herself. ""People will say, '19 years, life goes on'. Life doesn't go on. But, I have to live with it, what I did. To take him to Ireland, to give him a better quality of life - I have to live with that every single day of my life. ""Yes, I do blame myself. And that's why my life will be in a rut. I can't go forward."" However, the memory of James, and the encouragement of her children, is what helped her decide to return to Northern Ireland this weekend. ""I was at the grave yesterday, it was my birthday, and I stayed for about an hour, an hour and a half. ""My children said, 'Mum, you have to do it, you have to do it for James'. And he will live on in that quilt."" Director of Services at SEFF Kenny Donaldson said the organisation was ""honoured"" to host the Barker family and many other families. He said the memorial quilt would include 62 patches dedicated to ""individual innocents murdered through terrorism - Protestant, Roman Catholic and Dissenter and which contains a special central tribute to children murdered through terrorism"". He added: ""We will also be working with individual families in enabling them to meet with people and/or visit places which have significance with the injustices, loss and memories which they hold. ""Our core aim is to contribute towards bringing about a level of healing for those who have been so grievously wronged.""

"Mr Juncker, a critic of Brexit, regularly expresses scepticism about the state of talks It would take a ""miracle"" for Brexit talks to progress quickly enough to persuade the EU to start discussing trade soon, a top official has said. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed progress had been made between the two sides this week. But asked if it was enough to persuade the EU to agree to open trade talks, as the UK wants, at a summit next month, he replied only if ""miracles happen"". But British PM Theresa May said she was ""pleased"" with recent developments. Speaking in Estonia, where she is attending an EU security summit, Mrs May said there had been movement on issues such as citizens' rights during the fourth round of Brexit talks which concluded on Thursday. British negotiators, led by Brexit Secretary David Davis, suggested there had been ""decisive"" steps forward although his EU counterparts have been more cautious, suggesting there was a lot more work to be done. Macron wants joint EU defence force Russia warns Poland over WW2 memorials A guide to key issues in EU-UK talks At a meeting next month, the other 27 EU leaders could decide whether ""sufficient progress"" has been made in the talks to date, which have focused on separation issues such as the Irish border and money, to move on to to consider the UK's future relationship with the EU after it leaves in March 2019. Asked for his view as he arrived at the summit in Tallinn, Mr Juncker replied: ""By the end of October we will not have sufficient progress."" While he acknowledged ""we are making progress"", he said ""at the end of this week I am saying there will be no sufficient progress from now until October, unless miracles would happen"". European Council President Donald Tusk - who represents the EU 27 - has already suggested meeting the deadline is unlikely, while the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a decision on opening the second phase of talks could be ""weeks or months"" away, amid speculation it could slip to December. Mrs May was more bullish as she arrived, suggesting that there had been progress in the seven days since she gave a number of guarantees - including on honouring contributions to the EU budget - in a speech in Italy. ""In Florence, I set out the progress that has been made in the negotiations and my vision for a deep and special partnership with the EU,"" she said. Mrs May used a meeting with British troops to emphasise the UK's commitment to defending Europe ""I am pleased with the progress in the negotiations, and look forward to developing that special partnership as it's in the interests of EU as well."" Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suggested this week's Boeing-Bombardier trade dispute illustrated the difficulties the UK could face in doing trade deals with other countries after leaving the EU. ""I think it could well turn out to be a lesson for the UK,"" he said in Tallinn. ""I think it should that we are stronger together as a trading bloc, and that is something for people to consider."" At Friday's summit, Mrs May will make it clear to EU leaders that the UK is ready to continue contributing troops, equipment and money to EU operations and align foreign policy with Brussels where appropriate. Addressing British troops stationed in the the country earlier, Mrs May said the UK was not leaving Europe and was ""unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe's security"". Some 800 troops have been in Tapa since April, alongside Estonian and French forces, as part of a Nato effort to reassure eastern European nations fearful of Russia's increasing assertiveness.

"Trump met South Korean President Moon Jae-in during UN meetings earlier this month US President Donald Trump will travel to five Asian countries in November to participate in regional summits, the White House has announced. He will visit Japan, China, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and the US state of Hawaii for an 11-day trip. ""The president's engagements will strengthen the international resolve to confront the North Korean threat"", the White House statement said. North Korea and the US have engaged in heated rhetoric in recent months. So what will the key issues be for the US president on his first official trip to Asia? The economically-isolated Asian country conducted its sixth nuclear explosive test earlier this month despite international condemnation, and has promised to conduct another test in the Pacific Ocean. At a speech to the United Nations, Mr Trump threatened to annihilate North Korea, saying the country's leader, Kim Jong-un,"" is on a suicide mission"". In exchange, Mr Kim in a rare statement, vowed to ""tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire"". Mr Trump will seek to rally the country's neighbours - including China - to continue an economic sanctions campaign against North Korea. Where is the war of words with US heading? China to shut down North Korean companies Several countries, especially Japan, were upset when Mr Trump withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact - a deal which had been more than five years in the making and affected 40% of the global economy. The 11 remaining countries, including Japan and Vietnam, will continue the pact and have left the door open for the US to rejoin at any time, however a US trade representative has vowed that Mr Trump will not change his decision. ""Bilateral negotiations are better for the United States than multilateral negotiations,"" said trade representative Robert Lighthizer. TPP trade deal will continue without Trump Territorial disputes have pitted several smaller nations against much-larger China, which views the sea as part of its sphere of influence. Japanese and Filipino sailors have often clashed at sea with Chinese military vessels, and nations have been so far unable to establish a clear border. Filipino protesters burned effigies of Trump and Duterte earlier this month After a US Navy destroyer collided with a merchant ship in the South China Sea in August - resulting in 10 dead US sailors - a state-run newspaper in Beijing said the ""US Navy has behaved arrogantly in the Asia-Pacific region"". Mr Duterte's human rights record has been criticised, as his country wages war against drug dealers and users. As a result, it had been rumoured in Washington that Mr Trump may skip the ASEAN summit happening in Manila. But now the White House schedule confirms that he will attend.

"The Playboy publisher's chosen resting place has seen him called a legend - and a creep In life, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner cavorted with a harem of young women in the infamous Playboy Mansion - a byword for hedonism and sexual excess. In death, he will lie next to just one: the iconic Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe. Hefner, whodied on Wednesday aged 91, bought the crypt next to hers in 1992, for $75,000 (Â£55,930). The situation has divided public opinion, with some seeing a touching gesture and others a sleazy intrusion. Hefner fans on social media praised him for appreciating Monroe - his first cover girl, who died in 1962. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But others pointed out that while Hefner launched his brand and his lifestyle off the back of that first Playboy issue in December 1953, Monroe was embarrassed by the shoot that appeared in it - and feared for her future career. She had agreed to pose nude as a young woman, short on acting work and desperate for money. She received $50 in modelling fees. Four years later, Hefner paid a Chicago calendar company $500 so he could show Monroe with ""nothing but the radio on"" - and sold 50,000 magazines almost overnight. Allow Twitter content?

"Mr Foster, who moved to Cardiff for university, was a sales representative for an outdoor clothing firm A climber from Wales has been killed by a rock fall in Yosemite National Park in California. Andrew Foster, 32, originally from Cheltenham, was trapped while his wife, Lucy, 28, was seriously hurt whenrocks fell from El Capitan. Park ranger Scott Gediman said it was a tragic situation of ""wrong place, wrong time"" for the Cardiff couple. Mrs Foster remains in a ""critical condition"" after being airlifted from the collapse, park officials said. Scott Gediman, of Yosemite National Park, said Mrs Foster was being treated for life threatening injuries in an area hospital and had been told of her husband's death. This video can not be played Tourists captured more rock falls later that afternoon The El Capitan rock formation is the world's largest granite monolith and one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite. The pair, found with climbing equipment, are believed to have been scouting out the ascent from a trail when a ""sheet"" of granite plummeted from a height of 200m (656ft). It happened shortly before 14:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Wednesday. This video can not be played Peter Zabrok was on El Capitan when the first rock fall happened on Wednesday ""With all the craziness I don't exactly know where they were going but chances are they were going up,"" said Mr Gediman. ""From what I understand they were buried under rock... they were crushed by falling rocks."" Mr Foster proposed to his wife in the Alps in 2015 and the couple married last year. They flew out for the trip from Heathrow Airport on 11 September and had spent two weeks at the national park. This video can not be played Yosemite park ranger Scott Gediman told BBC Radio Wales it was a tragic situation of ""wrong place, wrong time"" They posted photos and films on their Facebook pages showing their preparations and training ahead of the trip to Yosemite. Mr Foster went to Cleeve School in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, before going to Cardiff University in 2003 to study engineering. In 2006 he began working for the Cardiff-based outdoor activity shop Up and Under, before joining the international company Patagonia. Up and Under said: ""His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious."" A Patagonia spokesman said: ""He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors. ""Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Lucy and their families."" This video can not be played Footage of a further rock fall at Yosemite National Park this week Paying tribute on Facebook, Mr Foster's friend Jess Spate said: ""Everyone who climbed with him will remember his good humour and his unrivalled sense of adventure."" Mrs Foster is originally from Staffordshire and went to school in Market Drayton in nearby Shropshire. She studied ecology at Cardiff University from 2008 and works for the international engineering company AECOM. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We're providing support and assistance to both families following this tragic event and remain in contact with local authorities."" One witness, Mike Kane, tweeted that the collapse was ""very loud"", adding it was a ""miracle more [were] not hurt"". Mr Foster's death is the first fatality from a rock fall in the park in four years, according to the parks service. Another rock fall at the site on Thursday led to one injured person being airlifted to hospital. Rachael Evans' husband was slightly hurt while she and her sister Ruth Merrell had a lucky escape following the second larger rock fall. Ms Evans told BBC Radio 4 the rock fall had ""sounded like thunder"". Art Cormier, a regular climber who witnessed Thursday's rock fall, said Yosemite locals knew of the ""regular risk"" of rock falls in the popular spot. El Capitan is one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite Mrs Foster is rescued from Yosemite following a rock fall Rescue workers at the scene of the rock fall in Yosemite The sheer, imposing face of El Capitan towers above a valley of pine trees, granite glowing in the pale morning sun. An occasional crack ricochets across the landscape, a reminder of the thunder and dust which erupted two days in a row with devastating effect. This has been a tough time here in Yosemite but park rangers say rock falls are not actually that unusual: 80 are recorded every year and many more go unreported. Rarely do they have such devastating effect though â but while the mood of adventurers is sombre it is also resolute. El Capitan draws people, it lures them in, because it is untamed, because of the risks. Already climbers are setting out again. This tragedy will not stop them from gambling in the wilderness.

"Tens of thousands more UK citizens applied for citizenship in other EU countries in the 12 months after the Brexit vote than in the previous year, according to data obtained by the BBC. Ireland received by far the most applications for dual nationality. But for all the countries that had data covering July 2016 to June 2017, applications have more than doubled. In countries which had data only for calendar years, there was a sharp rise from 2015 to 2016 as well. Among well-known UK citizens to apply for citizenship elsewhere in Europe is the Oscar-winning actor Colin Firth - it was confirmed last week that his application for Italian citizenship had been successful. Yes, even Mr Darcy is feeling flustered. British actor Colin Firth (pictured with his Italian wife) is now an Italian as well as a British citizen Reality Check and Radio 4's More or Less contacted all EU countries to ask about the number of citizenship applications they had received from British people, before and after the referendum in June 2016. It has not been possible to get full figures for every country, but the data we have compiled (reproduced at the end of this article) shows just how many people are taking precautionary steps in case the Brexit negotiations fail. In the 12 months before the referendum, 25,207 Britons applied for Irish passports; in the 12 months directly after the vote that number rose to 64,400. Sharp increases have also been seen elsewhere. In Spain, where some applicants have to give up their British citizenship because dual nationality is not allowed in all cases, the numbers rose from 2,300 before the referendum to 4,558 after. In other countries around the EU - Sweden (from 969 to 2,002), Denmark (from 289 to 604) and Poland (from 152 to 332) for example - the number of applications also more than doubled. Then there are countries where data is made available in slightly different ways. In Germany it comes state by state - so in Berlin there were 60 applications from British citizens in the year before the referendum, and 810 in the year after. France, meanwhile, provides figures on a calendar year basis, and again the increase is clear - there were 385 applications in 2015, rising to 1,363 in 2016, and rising further to 2,129 in the first eight months of this year. There is no precise way of knowing why people make citizenship applications when they do, but it seems safe to assume that political circumstances play a role. In Ireland, for example, where monthly figures are available, the highest number of applications so far came in March, April and May this year - in the period just before or just after the British government triggered Article 50 and the countdown to the UK leaving the EU. Roughly a million UK citizens already live elsewhere in the EU, and many more in the UK have the right to apply for citizenship in other EU countries. Since the referendum they have been doing just that in record numbers. Of course this is not simply a one-way street. There are more than three million EU citizens living in the UK who are equally worried about their  status post-Brexit. And again, the number of citizenship applications in the UK is striking. In the 12 months before the UK voted to leave the EU, 15,871 people from EU countries applied; in the 12 months after it was 28,502. Perhaps these figures don't come as a surprise. But they are a reminder of why the issue of citizens' rights is at the centre of the current Brexit negotiations - and why all sides say it is a priority to resolve. Brexit often seems to be about complex and distant concepts. But these are real people, worried about the future for themselves and their families.

You can hear more about these statistics onMore or Lesson BBC Radio 4 at 16:30 on Friday, 29 September or on BBC iPlayer Radio. These are all the figures from countries that were able to give us pre-referendum and post-referendum figures for passport applications by UK citizens. These are the figures comparing the number of applications in the whole of 2015 with those for the whole of 2016. The figures for Austria, Belgium, Germany and Italy are only successful applications as opposed to all applications. The figure for Slovenia is for all people who applied for citizenship in the UK, not necessarily just UK citizens. We did not receive data from the remaining six EU countries.

"This video can not be played Commuters tried to rescue the trapped and injured A stampede on a footbridge at a Mumbai railway station has left 22 people dead and injured more than 30, Indian officials report. The tragedy occurred during the morning rush hour at Elphinstone station, which connects two major local lines. It was triggered by overcrowding and people seeking shelter from monsoon rains, the officials said. The injured have been taken to a nearby hospital and senior railway officials are at the scene. ""The incident occurred as heavy rains lashed Mumbai and passengers took refuge on the foot overbridge. People at the front slipped and the huge crowd toppled over, leading to the stampede,"" Indian Railways spokesman Ravindra Bhakar told AFP news agency. ""Twenty-two dead have been confirmed, 14 men and eight women... Some 32 passengers are injured."" Akash Koteja, one of the injured, said: ""Trains were rolling in and some people wanted to get out of the station, but others were not making way. When a few tried, it led to a stampede."" TV footage from the scene showed commuters trying to rescue fellow passengers from the crush and revive people by pumping their chests. ""We put everybody who was injured in cars, police vans and ambulances and tried to take them to the hospital as quickly as possible,"" said one witness quoted by AFP. An investigation has been launched into the causes of the disaster, but overcrowding on India's vast, crumbling railway network is a perennial problem. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai says the incident has once again put the spotlight on Mumbai's transport infrastructure, which is often criticised for being old and insufficient given the millions of people who use it every day. Relatives of victims sought news at the hospital Indian Prime Minster Narendra Moditweeted,external: ""My deepest condolences to all those who have lost their lives due to the stampede in Mumbai. Prayers with those who are injured."" He added that Railway Minister Piyush Goyal was in Mumbai ""taking stock of the situation and ensuring all assistance"". The chief minister of Maharashtra state, whose capital is Mumbai, announced compensation for the families of the dead and said the medical bills of the injured would be paid. Devendra Fadnavis also promised to take ""strict action"" action against those responsible for the stampede. ""My heart goes out to the families who lost their loved ones,"" he said during a visit to Singapore. Did you witness the stampede at Elphinstone station?

"Artwork: The BFR would assume the roles performed by current SpaceX vehicles People will soon be able to fly from city to city within minutes, rocket and car entrepreneur Elon Musk says. Mr Musk made the promise at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Adelaide, Australia. A promotional video,externalsays the London-New York journey would take 29 minutes. Mr Musk told the audience he aimed to start sending people to Mars in 2024. His SpaceX company would begin building the necessary ships to support the mission next year. He says he is refocusing SpaceX to work on just one type of vehicle - known as the BFR - which could do all of the firm's current work and interplanetary travel. Elon Musk: ""That's not a typo"" Mr Musk first laid out his Mars travel ambitions at the IAC in 2016. Twelve months on, he returned with more detail. His BFR, although still massive, is now a little smaller at 106m in height and 9m in width. The major difference compared with the original version, however, was cost, the South African-born American said. ""I think we've figured out how to pay for it. This is very important."" Elon Musk and the hyperbolic hyperloop 'announcement' Musk warns of 'killer robot' arms race The route to affordability, he explained, was in refocusing all of the company's efforts into the one system - and then using that to meet all its customers' needs. Artwork: The BFR would launch much bigger or many more satellites than current rockets This means the BFR would launch satellites and service the space station - as SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule do now - but also take people to the Moon and Mars, and do what is termed ""point to point"" travel on Earth. ""Most of what people consider to be long-distance trips could be completed in less than half-an-hour,"" he told the Adelaide audience. ""Some of our customers are conservative and they want to see the BFR fly several times before they're comfortable launching [on it],"" Mr Musk said. ""So what we plan to do is to build ahead and have a stock of Falcon 9 and Dragon vehicles, so that customers can be comfortable if they want to use the old rocket, the old spacecraft - they can do that because we'll have a bunch in stock. ""But all of our resources will then turn to building BFR."" Artwork: Musk envisages colonies on Mars As well as being the CEO and chief designer at SpaceX, Mr Musk also founded the Tesla electric car company and is chairman of SolarCity which specialises in renewables technologies, such as high-storage batteries. He has attracted a rock-star following from fans who love his visionary thinking. And although his promises have often taken much longer to deliver, he has achieved a number of notable firsts. These include 16-in-a-row successful landings of orbital-class rockets back on Earth after they have completed their missions. Two of these rockets have even flown a second time. This video can not be played Elon Musk's 'underground road plan' Key to his thinking is the concept of reusability. Space activity is currently expensive only because it is disposable, he says. There is no reason, he claims, why rocket systems cannot be made to operate like airliners where the most significant ongoing cost is the fuel in the tanks. His Falcon 9 rocket is partially reusable; the BFR would be totally reusable. The same vehicle would fly time and time again. Mr Musk recognises that his ambitious timelines sometimes slip. When he put up a slide in Adelaide stating that the first cargo (no humans aboard) versions of BFR would go to Mars in 2022, he said: ""That's not a typo, although it is aspirational."" Elon Musk rolls out cheapest Tesla yet Australia to host 'historic' large battery Artwork: Why haven't we got a lunar base yet, Musk complained His many fans in the audience lapped up the presentation, but his numerous business customers will also have stiffened slightly at the news that SpaceX is to begin diverting its energies towards the all-new rocket system. These customers are extremely conservative - as Mr Musk himself concedes. They are only just beginning to grapple with the idea that they can put their very expensive satellites on ""second-hand"" Falcons. Now they must also get used to the idea that the Falcon will eventually be replaced by another rocket system - the BFR. Prof Alan Duffy is from the centre for astrophysics and supercomputing at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. He was among the 4,000-strong audience at the IAC. ""This is SpaceX's Elon Musk. This is what he does,"" he told the BBC. ""What I love about SpaceX - and why the world's scientists and engineers are willing to give them that credence - is that they make things profitable at every step of the way. ""They have a big vision, they work towards it, but the steps they take are always with the profit in mind. And if there's a profit there, you can guarantee that businesses will see it through."" Elon Musk has hinted that BFR stands for ""Big F****** Rocket"" He has set out timelines that are aggressive even for him Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Musk warns of 'killer robot' arms race Row between Musk and Zuckerberg over AI Elon Musk and the hyperbolic hyperloop 'announcement' Elon Musk rolls out cheapest Tesla yet Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres under fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"The Food Standards Agency is investigating after reports of safety breaches at a factory owned by one of the UK's largest chicken suppliers. The Guardian and ITV News said workers at a 2 Sisters Food Group site in the West Midlands had changed slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Lidl and The Co-op have stopped taking chickens from the site while investigations continue. 2 Sisters said,externalit viewed the allegations ""extremely seriously"". The FSA said its inspectors found ""no evidence"" of breaches at the West Bromwich factory on Thursday but they were continuing to review the evidence. The company also supplies Tesco and Sainsbury's, which are investigating the allegations. An undercover reporter claimed to have witnessed workers changing the ""kill dates"" on chickens and allegedly saw meat of different ages being mixed together and codes on crates of meat altered. The Guardian and ITV News said in a statement that more than 20 workers had confirmed the unhygienic practices took place, while some said they would no longer eat chicken from supermarkets. Some workers also claimed the chicken that supermarkets reject is sometimes repackaged at the factory and sent out again. Food safety: Five things to watch out for Raw chicken 'should not be washed' The FSA said it took any allegations of inaccurate labelling and breaches in hygiene regulations ""very seriously"". It urged the Guardian and ITV News to share the full details with the FSA, such as the footage taken and witness interview transcripts, so that it could investigate thoroughly and promptly. FSA chairman Heather Hancock said: ""Should we find any evidence of any risk to public health, any products on the market which we believe to be a cause of concern will be urgently removed from sale."" She reminded consumers to follow FSA guidelines for chicken: Cover and chill raw chicken Never wash raw chicken Only use clean hands, utensils and chopping boards when handling raw chicken Cook chicken thoroughly until there is no pink meat and the juices run clear Tesco said it carried out its own regular audits of all its suppliers, adding that it took the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and would be carrying out a ""rigorous investigation"". Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer all issued statements announcing the launch of independent investigations. The 2 Sisters company was founded in 1993 by Ranjit Singh Boparan and now employs 23,000 staff. Although it has diversified, the bulk of the group's income still comes from processing poultry. The company said it had been made aware of the allegations on Thursday but had ""not been given the time or the detailed evidence to conduct any thorough investigations to establish the facts, which makes a fulsome response very difficult"". It said hygiene and safety remained at the ""core"" of its business, which was subject to frequent unannounced audits from the FSA and Red Tractor - the food industry's assurance scheme - among others. It said the West Midlands site in question had received nine audits - five unannounced - during July and August this year alone. It added in a statement: ""If, on presentation of further evidence, it comes to light any verifiable transgressions have been made at any of our sites, we will leave no stone unturned in investigating and remedying the situation immediately.""

"Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed in the 1998 attack ""I hate them. I know it's a strong word. I hate what they've done."" For Donna-Maria Barker, the loss of her 12-year-old son in the 1998 Omagh bomb is still searingly raw. James Barker was one of 29 people - including a woman pregnant with twins - killed in the Real IRA attack in 1998. But, despite the pain of the memory, Mrs Barker will return to Northern Ireland - and Omagh - this weekend for a service dedicated to ""children of the Troubles"". Omagh bomb relatives sue NI police chief Timeline of Omagh bomb legal cases The service takes place in Fivemiletown Methodist Church in County Tyrone, on Sunday. It will include the dedication of a quilt to Alan Jack, the Troubles' youngest victim, who died aged five months after a bomb in Strabane in 1972. Ms Barker, who is originally from Londonderry but lives in England, will dedicate a patch of the memorial quilt to her son - but said she will also visit the town where her son died. She is being hosted by the organisation, the South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF). Donna-Maria Barker pictured in 2001, with Michael Gallagher (left) whose son was also killed in the bomb She said it was a ""very difficult decision and it is going to be hard"". ""I am so lucky that my youngest son, Oliver-Tristan, will accompany me. I'm doing it for James, only James, not for myself,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. No one has been convicted over the bombing and Ms Barker said she believes that she will never see justice in her lifetime. This video can not be played 'I hate them and what they've done to my life' Earlier this year, relatives of the victimsannounced they would sue the PSNI's chief constablefor failings they believed allowed the killers to escape justice. ""It's very sad, but if I lose that anger in me, I lose the fight for James. And, I know being a Catholic myself, that you have to forgive and forget. No, no. ""It'd have been different if my child had have been seriously ill, or knocked over, or killed by a car or something like that. ""But this was vicious. They wanted to maim and kill and I hate them. I hate what they've done to my life and my kids' life. ""In my short life, I don't think I'll ever get justice."" That anger is something that Ms Barker also directs at herself. ""People will say, '19 years, life goes on'. Life doesn't go on. But, I have to live with it, what I did. To take him to Ireland, to give him a better quality of life - I have to live with that every single day of my life. ""Yes, I do blame myself. And that's why my life will be in a rut. I can't go forward."" However, the memory of James, and the encouragement of her children, is what helped her decide to return to Northern Ireland this weekend. ""I was at the grave yesterday, it was my birthday, and I stayed for about an hour, an hour and a half. ""My children said, 'Mum, you have to do it, you have to do it for James'. And he will live on in that quilt."" Director of Services at SEFF Kenny Donaldson said the organisation was ""honoured"" to host the Barker family and many other families. He said the memorial quilt would include 62 patches dedicated to ""individual innocents murdered through terrorism - Protestant, Roman Catholic and Dissenter and which contains a special central tribute to children murdered through terrorism"". He added: ""We will also be working with individual families in enabling them to meet with people and/or visit places which have significance with the injustices, loss and memories which they hold. ""Our core aim is to contribute towards bringing about a level of healing for those who have been so grievously wronged.""

"This video can not be played Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney hints interest rates may rise on Radio 4's Today Interest rates could rise in the ""relatively near term"" the Governor of the Bank of England has told the BBC. In the clearest indication yet that there could be a rate rise as early as November, Mark Carney suggested that it was time for the bank to ""ease its foot off the accelerator"". The next opportunity for a change in interest rates is the Bank's monetary policy committee meeting on 2 November. The governor also warned against ""reckless"" household borrowing. He said that while overall lending to UK consumers had come down markedly since the financial crisis, there was a danger from rapid ""frothy"" growth in some areas of household borrowing. UK annual growth rate revised down Balls: Treasury 'washed its hands' of duty May in strong defence of free market ""What we're worried about is a pocket of risk - a risk in consumer debt, credit card debt, debt for cars, personal loans,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. He said banks had ""not been as disciplined as they should be"" in their underwriting standards and pricing of this debt. Pressed on when the Bank was likely to raise interest rates, a move that would make borrowing more expensive, Mr Carney confirmed the latest analysis from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. ""If the economy continues on the track that it's been on, and all indications are that it is, in the relatively near term we can expect that interest rates will increase,"" he said. It's not quite a promise to raise rates next month. But Mr Carney's remarks do reinforce the expectation that it is going to happen. That said, he also made it plain that we shouldn't expect any great drama. He used a motoring metaphor and it's not a question of hitting the brakes - rather, as he put it, easing off the accelerator. So what we can expect next month is probably a reversal of the rate cut the Bank made in the aftermath of the EU referendum. That was, to continue the motoring analogy, intended to pump a little more fuel into the economy at a time when the bank seemed to fear it might stall. Now we have higher inflation and that is the basis for a rate rise. On the other hand economic growth has slowed which is why Mr Carney hints at a very modest rise that will leave rates very close to their all-time low. Speculation has been growing that the Bank could raise interest rates at its next meeting. The last time rates were raised was July 2007 before the financial crisis. Since then interest rates have been kept low in order to boost the economy by keeping cost of borrowing down. Recent low unemployment figures and stronger inflation have made a rise in rates more likely. ""We're talking about just easing the foot off the accelerator to keep with the speed limit of the economy and so interest rate increases when they come - when and if they come - will be to a limited extent and gradual,"" Mr Carney said. However new figures from the Office for National Statistics for the three months to June showed the economy growing at just 1.5% a year, a slower pace than previously estimated. Chris Williamson, chief business economist, at IHS Markit said it would be unprecedented for the Bank of England to tighten interest rate policy given ""such anaemic growth"". Despite Mr Carney's comments the pound slipped against the dollar and the euro  following the ONS's revision of the growth figures. The Bank Governor also responded tocomments from former shadow chancellor Ed Ballsand former prime minister Gordon Brown that there should be changes to the way the Bank of England cooperates with the Treasury to ensure financial stability. Mr Carney rejected suggestions that reform was needed, arguing the system was ""incredibly well designed"" with the Bank's current role of identifying and highlighting risks to the economy, but with the big decisions resting with the government.

"This replica Citroen 2CV was crafted out of fruitwood. Could future cars contain wooden parts? Car parts of the future could be made out of a surprising material. Wood. Researchers in Japan are working to create a strong material out of wood pulp that could replace steel parts in vehicles within a decade. Work is also charging ahead in the country to develop plastics that can withstand high temperatures, to replace metal for parts near the engine. These innovations are part of a wider industry push to make cars lighter. ""There is a rush to try and cut as much weight as possible, especially on cars which will pollute more, like SUVs [sports utility vehicles] or pick-up trucks,"" says Paolo Martino, principal automotive components analyst at IHS Markit. Slimmer cars consume less fuel. The US Department of Energy says a 10% reduction in vehicle weight can improve fuel economy by up to 8%. Manufacturers also want to make electric models as light as possible so they can travel further on a single charge, and help resolve the battery ""range anxiety"" faced by car owners, Mr Martino says. And that's where the humble tree could come in. After all, wood has been used to build ships, homes and furniture for millennia. Researchers at Kyoto University in Japan say a material made from wood pulp could be as strong as steel, but 80% lighter. Wood was often used for some car parts, but never near the engine The team chemically treats wood pulp, which consists of millions of cellulose nanofibres (CNFs), and disperses these CNFs into plastic. Blending CNFs with plastics creates a strong, hybrid material that could replace steel in auto parts, they say. Prof Hiroyuki Yano, who leads the work at Kyoto University, says the material could be used to make door panels, fenders and car bonnets. The researchers are working with the Japanese government, carmakers and other manufacturers to develop the material. Cellulose nanofibres are already used in a range of products, from ink to transparent displays. While the material faces plenty of competition from more commercially established lightweight  options, like carbon fibre, Prof Yano believes CNF-based parts could be viable alternatives. But Vivek Vaidya, senior vice president at consultancy Frost & Sullivan, has some doubts. Wood has been used as a building material for millennia He thinks it's feasible that ""non-performance"" parts - anything but the engine, transmission and wheels - could be mass-produced from wood pulp-based materials, but that parts manufacturers might struggle to keep pace with auto production lines. ""Most components are supplied on-demand, [so] whether a wood or organic material can be made available in a just-in-time way is definitely a question mark,"" he says. Separately in Japan, researchers are working on specialised plastics for car parts. Prof Tatsuo Kaneko, from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, is developing plastics made with biological molecules. The new material is also lighter than steel and can tolerate temperatures of up to 300C, the researchers say. ""Plastics haven't been used in car parts requiring higher heat resistance around [the] engine block because they haven't been able to withstand the heat,"" Prof Kaneko says. ""But the bioplastics I have produced can withstand higher temperatures."" Researchers in Japan say bioplastics could replace metal for parts near the engine He's working with a number of Japanese carmakers, auto part and electronics makers - as well as foreign companies - on the research. And one of the biggest advantages of using the material, which he says could be a viable alternative to steel in around five years, would be a drop in vehicle weight. While lighter plastic car parts might help cut vehicle emissions and increase the range of electric cars, doesn't their manufacture bring other environmental risks? Prof Kaneko acknowledges that substituting materials like glass for bioplastics could increase pollution, as the waste is non-biodegradable. Where will the deadly floods strike next? How 'the invisible network' poses a major security threat Why switching to fully electric cars will take time How to make money the Instagram way But he argues that his materials are kinder overall to the environment than traditional plastics. The manufacture of conventional petroleum-based plastics results in large amounts of carbon dioxide, whereas bioplastics, made from micro-organisms, produce lower volumes of waste, he maintains. The drive to use ""greener"" materials is gathering speed among automakers more broadly. Frost & Sullivan's Mr Vaidya says manufacturers are trying to shrink the total carbon footprint of a vehicle and ""not just the emissions that come out of the tailpipe"". The push serves tightening regulations and consumer demand. Both theUK and Franceplan to ban new diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040, to reduce pollution and carbon emissions. China, the world's biggest car market, wantselectric battery carsand plug-in hybrids to account for at least one-fifth of its vehicle sales by 2025. Lightweight carbon fibre is prized in high-performance sports cars ""There's definite movement towards improving the green credentials of the car by using materials that are more environmentally friendly,"" Mr Vaidya says. To shed weight BMW has focused oncarbon fibre, and last month unveiled a new slimmed down M5 sedan with a carbon fibre reinforced plastic roof. Toyota uses the same material for parts in its Prius Prime and Lexus LC 500 models, cutting weight and boosting battery range in the Prius. For Jaguar,aluminiumis a big focus. The company says the metal weighs about one third of the equivalent amount of steel. ""Every 100kg saved with an aluminium chassis helps to reduce the vehicle's CO2 emissions by 9g per km, and fuel usage during its life by up to 800 litres,"" Jaguar says. And niche component makers like Corning, which markets its toughened Gorilla Glass for use in windshields and other glass-components, says its high-tech glass is a third lighter than conventional car windows.

"Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed in the 1998 attack ""I hate them. I know it's a strong word. I hate what they've done."" For Donna-Maria Barker, the loss of her 12-year-old son in the 1998 Omagh bomb is still searingly raw. James Barker was one of 29 people - including a woman pregnant with twins - killed in the Real IRA attack in 1998. But, despite the pain of the memory, Mrs Barker will return to Northern Ireland - and Omagh - this weekend for a service dedicated to ""children of the Troubles"". Omagh bomb relatives sue NI police chief Timeline of Omagh bomb legal cases The service takes place in Fivemiletown Methodist Church in County Tyrone, on Sunday. It will include the dedication of a quilt to Alan Jack, the Troubles' youngest victim, who died aged five months after a bomb in Strabane in 1972. Ms Barker, who is originally from Londonderry but lives in England, will dedicate a patch of the memorial quilt to her son - but said she will also visit the town where her son died. She is being hosted by the organisation, the South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF). Donna-Maria Barker pictured in 2001, with Michael Gallagher (left) whose son was also killed in the bomb She said it was a ""very difficult decision and it is going to be hard"". ""I am so lucky that my youngest son, Oliver-Tristan, will accompany me. I'm doing it for James, only James, not for myself,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. No one has been convicted over the bombing and Ms Barker said she believes that she will never see justice in her lifetime. This video can not be played 'I hate them and what they've done to my life' Earlier this year, relatives of the victimsannounced they would sue the PSNI's chief constablefor failings they believed allowed the killers to escape justice. ""It's very sad, but if I lose that anger in me, I lose the fight for James. And, I know being a Catholic myself, that you have to forgive and forget. No, no. ""It'd have been different if my child had have been seriously ill, or knocked over, or killed by a car or something like that. ""But this was vicious. They wanted to maim and kill and I hate them. I hate what they've done to my life and my kids' life. ""In my short life, I don't think I'll ever get justice."" That anger is something that Ms Barker also directs at herself. ""People will say, '19 years, life goes on'. Life doesn't go on. But, I have to live with it, what I did. To take him to Ireland, to give him a better quality of life - I have to live with that every single day of my life. ""Yes, I do blame myself. And that's why my life will be in a rut. I can't go forward."" However, the memory of James, and the encouragement of her children, is what helped her decide to return to Northern Ireland this weekend. ""I was at the grave yesterday, it was my birthday, and I stayed for about an hour, an hour and a half. ""My children said, 'Mum, you have to do it, you have to do it for James'. And he will live on in that quilt."" Director of Services at SEFF Kenny Donaldson said the organisation was ""honoured"" to host the Barker family and many other families. He said the memorial quilt would include 62 patches dedicated to ""individual innocents murdered through terrorism - Protestant, Roman Catholic and Dissenter and which contains a special central tribute to children murdered through terrorism"". He added: ""We will also be working with individual families in enabling them to meet with people and/or visit places which have significance with the injustices, loss and memories which they hold. ""Our core aim is to contribute towards bringing about a level of healing for those who have been so grievously wronged.""

"Pippa, now 21, with baby Violet Pippa has plenty to feel anxious about. Four years ago, aged 17 and having mental health issues, she dropped out of sixth form. By the age of 19, she was pregnant, single and homeless. After months of sofa-surfing and hostels, the council found her a flat which she moved into three weeks after her baby was born. ""I am so grateful for all the support I have had,"" she says. She got a job in a local cafe - but the wages were so low, she decided to return to education. Pippa and baby Violet, 18 months, have now moved to another city, where she has just started anaccess to higher education,externalcourse. She hopes to study law at university. ""I want to finish my education to get a job to support me and my child, but I worry about affording to survive while I do it,"" she says. She has found a housing association flat and gets by on a mixture of benefits and grants. She had a few savings, but these were eaten up by the move. ""I also lost a lot of the support network I had."" she says. ""I worry about money almost all the time."" Pippa's case is extreme in that she faces multiple challenges - but new research for a charity suggests millions of young people are struggling financially and that, overall, young women are having a tougher time than young men. Young women are consistently more likely than young men to face money problems, workplace discrimination and worries about the future, says the Young Women's Trust. Of 4,000 18- to 30-year-olds surveyed in England and Wales: a third felt more anxious than this time last year 25% of the women said their financial situation was worse, compared with 21% of the men 45% of the women were worried about their mental health, compared with 38% of the men a third of the women reported gender discrimination at work or while looking for work Another young mother, Shanae, 24, from London, is a clinical researcher with the NHS. ""I had graduated with a 2:1 but because I was a young woman, and a young black mother on top of that, the environment around me made me feel as if my potential was dented,"" she says. ""I always had to bring more to the table."" Shanae, 24, is a clinical researcher with the NHS The research suggests low pay and insecure work are on the rise among young people. Of those surveyed: 17% had been paid less than the legal minimum wage 30% had been offered a zero-hours contract 45% were living with their parents 44% of the women and 34% of the men felt ""worn down"" A government spokesman said helping all young people to get on in life and access skilled jobs ""has been a priority"". ""Female employment is at a record high, with youth unemployment down 40% since 2010. ""We have also acted to ensure young people can keep more of what they own, including raising the national minimum wage and cutting income tax. ""Our Help to Buy schemes have supported more than 275,000 first-time buyers so far achieve their dream of owning a home."" But for Young Women's Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton ""the traditional stereotype of youthful swagger and optimism seems to have been replaced by worry and anxiety, ""We are used to each generation having more opportunities than the last, but there is a feeling now that things are going backwards."" ""These are very worrying times for young people, especially young women, who are hardest hit."" Pippa is determined to provide for her child and afford a roof over their heads. ""I hate asking for help or letting anyone know I struggle. It's humiliating. I don't want to be seen as a stereotype,"" she says. ""All I'm qualified to do right now is minimum-wage jobs, and no-one can feasibly survive on that, let alone with a child or children.""

"Mr Foster, who moved to Cardiff for university, was a sales representative for an outdoor clothing firm A climber from Wales has been killed by a rock fall in Yosemite National Park in California. Andrew Foster, 32, originally from Cheltenham, was trapped while his wife, Lucy, 28, was seriously hurt whenrocks fell from El Capitan. Park ranger Scott Gediman said it was a tragic situation of ""wrong place, wrong time"" for the Cardiff couple. Mrs Foster remains in a ""critical condition"" after being airlifted from the collapse, park officials said. Scott Gediman, of Yosemite National Park, said Mrs Foster was being treated for life threatening injuries in an area hospital and had been told of her husband's death. This video can not be played Tourists captured more rock falls later that afternoon The El Capitan rock formation is the world's largest granite monolith and one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite. The pair, found with climbing equipment, are believed to have been scouting out the ascent from a trail when a ""sheet"" of granite plummeted from a height of 200m (656ft). It happened shortly before 14:00 local time (21:00 BST) on Wednesday. This video can not be played Peter Zabrok was on El Capitan when the first rock fall happened on Wednesday ""With all the craziness I don't exactly know where they were going but chances are they were going up,"" said Mr Gediman. ""From what I understand they were buried under rock... they were crushed by falling rocks."" Mr Foster proposed to his wife in the Alps in 2015 and the couple married last year. They flew out for the trip from Heathrow Airport on 11 September and had spent two weeks at the national park. This video can not be played Yosemite park ranger Scott Gediman told BBC Radio Wales it was a tragic situation of ""wrong place, wrong time"" They posted photos and films on their Facebook pages showing their preparations and training ahead of the trip to Yosemite. Mr Foster went to Cleeve School in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, before going to Cardiff University in 2003 to study engineering. In 2006 he began working for the Cardiff-based outdoor activity shop Up and Under, before joining the international company Patagonia. Up and Under said: ""His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious."" A Patagonia spokesman said: ""He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors. ""Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Lucy and their families.""

One witness, Mike Kane, tweeted that the collapse was ""very loud"", adding it was a ""miracle more [were] not hurt"". Mr Foster's death is the first fatality from a rock fall in the park in four years, according to the parks service. Another rock fall at the site on Thursday led to one injured person being airlifted to hospital. Rachael Evans' husband was slightly hurt while she and her sister Ruth Merrell had a lucky escape following the second larger rock fall. Ms Evans told BBC Radio 4 the rock fall had ""sounded like thunder"". Art Cormier, a regular climber who witnessed Thursday's rock fall, said Yosemite locals knew of the ""regular risk"" of rock falls in the popular spot. El Capitan is one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite Mrs Foster is rescued from Yosemite following a rock fall Rescue workers at the scene of the rock fall in Yosemite The sheer, imposing face of El Capitan towers above a valley of pine trees, granite glowing in the pale morning sun. An occasional crack ricochets across the landscape, a reminder of the thunder and dust which erupted two days in a row with devastating effect. This has been a tough time here in Yosemite but park rangers say rock falls are not actually that unusual: 80 are recorded every year and many more go unreported. Rarely do they have such devastating effect though â but while the mood of adventurers is sombre it is also resolute. El Capitan draws people, it lures them in, because it is untamed, because of the risks. Already climbers are setting out again. This tragedy will not stop them from gambling in the wilderness.

"This video can not be played Commuters tried to rescue the trapped and injured A stampede on a footbridge at a Mumbai railway station has left 22 people dead and injured more than 30, Indian officials report. The tragedy occurred during the morning rush hour at Elphinstone station, which connects two major local lines. It was triggered by overcrowding and people seeking shelter from monsoon rains, the officials said. The injured have been taken to a nearby hospital and senior railway officials are at the scene. ""The incident occurred as heavy rains lashed Mumbai and passengers took refuge on the foot overbridge. People at the front slipped and the huge crowd toppled over, leading to the stampede,"" Indian Railways spokesman Ravindra Bhakar told AFP news agency. ""Twenty-two dead have been confirmed, 14 men and eight women... Some 32 passengers are injured."" Akash Koteja, one of the injured, said: ""Trains were rolling in and some people wanted to get out of the station, but others were not making way. When a few tried, it led to a stampede."" TV footage from the scene showed commuters trying to rescue fellow passengers from the crush and revive people by pumping their chests. ""We put everybody who was injured in cars, police vans and ambulances and tried to take them to the hospital as quickly as possible,"" said one witness quoted by AFP. An investigation has been launched into the causes of the disaster, but overcrowding on India's vast, crumbling railway network is a perennial problem. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai says the incident has once again put the spotlight on Mumbai's transport infrastructure, which is often criticised for being old and insufficient given the millions of people who use it every day.

"Mr Juncker, a critic of Brexit, regularly expresses scepticism about the state of talks It would take a ""miracle"" for Brexit talks to progress quickly enough to persuade the EU to start discussing trade soon, a top official has said. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed progress had been made between the two sides this week. But asked if it was enough to persuade the EU to agree to open trade talks, as the UK wants, at a summit next month, he replied only if ""miracles happen"". But British PM Theresa May said she was ""pleased"" with recent developments. Speaking in Estonia, where she is attending an EU security summit, Mrs May said there had been movement on issues such as citizens' rights during the fourth round of Brexit talks which concluded on Thursday. British negotiators, led by Brexit Secretary David Davis, suggested there had been ""decisive"" steps forward although his EU counterparts have been more cautious, suggesting there was a lot more work to be done. Macron wants joint EU defence force Russia warns Poland over WW2 memorials A guide to key issues in EU-UK talks At a meeting next month, the other 27 EU leaders could decide whether ""sufficient progress"" has been made in the talks to date, which have focused on separation issues such as the Irish border and money, to move on to to consider the UK's future relationship with the EU after it leaves in March 2019. Asked for his view as he arrived at the summit in Tallinn, Mr Juncker replied: ""By the end of October we will not have sufficient progress."" While he acknowledged ""we are making progress"", he said ""at the end of this week I am saying there will be no sufficient progress from now until October, unless miracles would happen"". European Council President Donald Tusk - who represents the EU 27 - has already suggested meeting the deadline is unlikely, while the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a decision on opening the second phase of talks could be ""weeks or months"" away, amid speculation it could slip to December. Mrs May was more bullish as she arrived, suggesting that there had been progress in the seven days since she gave a number of guarantees - including on honouring contributions to the EU budget - in a speech in Italy. ""In Florence, I set out the progress that has been made in the negotiations and my vision for a deep and special partnership with the EU,"" she said. Mrs May used a meeting with British troops to emphasise the UK's commitment to defending Europe ""I am pleased with the progress in the negotiations, and look forward to developing that special partnership as it's in the interests of EU as well."" Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suggested this week's Boeing-Bombardier trade dispute illustrated the difficulties the UK could face in doing trade deals with other countries after leaving the EU. ""I think it could well turn out to be a lesson for the UK,"" he said in Tallinn. ""I think it should that we are stronger together as a trading bloc, and that is something for people to consider."" At Friday's summit, Mrs May will make it clear to EU leaders that the UK is ready to continue contributing troops, equipment and money to EU operations and align foreign policy with Brussels where appropriate. Addressing British troops stationed in the the country earlier, Mrs May said the UK was not leaving Europe and was ""unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe's security"". Some 800 troops have been in Tapa since April, alongside Estonian and French forces, as part of a Nato effort to reassure eastern European nations fearful of Russia's increasing assertiveness.

"Dame Vera wanted to see the cliffs protected for future generations A campaign backed by Dame Vera Lynn to buy land at the top of Dover's white cliffs has reached its Â£1m target in under three weeks. Amid fears the land could be sold to developers, the National Trust urgently appealed for funds on 4 September - with a deadline of 22 September. More than 17,500 people had donated money to buy 700,000 sqm of land. Dame Vera - The Forces' Sweetheart - thanked people for protecting the ""national icon"". The National Trust owns the clifftop but later found more land had become available Shecelebrated her 100th birthdayat her home in Ditchling, Sussex, this year - became known as the Forces' Sweetheart after her performances of the 1942 classic, The White Cliffs of Dover. ""I am delighted to learn that the small part I played in the campaign to protect the white cliffs of Dover has been so effective,"" Dame Vera said. ""Over many years, I have been a supporter of the National Trust and the vital work that they do in preserving our heritage and landscapes - long may this continue. ""My thanks to everyone who embraced the campaign to protect this national icon. The white cliffs of Dover are a significant landmark and it is so encouraging to know that they will now be protected for future generations."" The land is a haven for flowers, grasses, birds and butterflies The trust bought the clifftop in 2012 but later found out the 700,000 sqm of land had become available. The current landowner has requested confidentiality and their name has not been revealed. Between the South Foreland lighthouse and Langdon Cliffs, the area is a haven for more than 40 species of flowers and grasses, butterflies including the Adonis blue and marbled white and birds including the peregrine falcon and skylark. It also has several structures from World War Two including two large gun emplacements. The trust wants to return the land to chalk grassland, make the military structures watertight and create access routes for visitors.
