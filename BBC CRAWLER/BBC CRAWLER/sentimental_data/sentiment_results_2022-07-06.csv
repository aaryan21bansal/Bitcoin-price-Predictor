"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer asks Boris Johnson why he promoted Chris Pincher despite previous sexual allegations Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has become the latest cabinet member to resign as pressure continues to mount on Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was among a group of UK ministers who earlier urged Mr Johnson to quit. In his resignation letter, Mr Hart said colleagues had done their utmost to ""turn the ship around"" but he no longer thought that was possible. Mr Johnson has defied calls to resign, as he tries to face down a growing mutiny among his cabinet. In a letter addressed to Mr Johnson and handed to the chief whip, Mr Hart insisted he had ""desperately hoped"" not to have to write it but saw ""no other option"". Government resignations: Who has gone, who is staying? Javid's and Sunak's resignation letters in full He said Mr Johnson would be remembered as a prime minister ""with energy, vision, determination and humour"". ""There was never a dull moment in your government and I will be forever grateful to have been given the chance to be part of it,"" he said. In his letter, he also said he had ""never been a massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best way of forcing change"". Mr Hart is the third cabinet minister to step down afterChancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid quit within minutes of one anotheron Tuesday. As of Wednesday night, 16 ministers had resigned, along with 20 government aides and five others. Levelling Up Secretary and former leadership rival to Mr Johnson, Michael Gove, wassacked by the prime ministerafter being part of the group of senior Tories urging him to go. Home Secretary Priti Patel, a former close ally, has also joined the group of rebel ministers. Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, called on the prime minister to ""reflect on his position and allow someone else to take on that mantle to deliver the Conservative manifesto"". It follows Mr Johnson's decision to appoint Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip earlier this year,despite being aware of misconduct allegations against him. Simon Hart told MPs it was ""business as usual in the Wales Office"" Came to Parliament in 2010 with a background in rural affairs as chief executive of the Countryside Alliance and a former master of the South Pembrokeshire Hunt The Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP was previously a junior minister in the Cabinet Office He was made a minister after Mr Johnson's December 2019 general election victory During Wednesday's Welsh Questions, Mr Hart was asked by Plaid Cymru MP, Liz Saville Roberts, ""when will he be going?"" In his response, he insisted it was ""business as usual in the Wales Office"". One of Mr Hart's predecessors, Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb, has called for Mr Johnson to resign ""for the good of the country"". He said trust in the UK government ""had been draining away month after month"" as controversies piled up. Mr Crabb, who confirmed he voted against Mr Johnson in the confidence vote last month, wrote in anarticle for the Pembrokeshire Herald,external: ""Every day I open my email inbox, every Q&A session I hold in the constituency, every time I visit Tesco or Morrisons in Haverfordwest, the feedback I receive is consistent and overwhelming: Boris Johnson should resign."" Fay Jones says she will quit on Thursday if Mr Johnson is still in office Mr Hart's resignation came after three other Welsh Conservative MPs quit their roles as government aides, with a fourth threatening to follow suit. Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams and Vale of Clwyd MP James Davies have both quit. Brecon and Radnorshire MP Fay Jones, aParliamentary Private Secretary,external(PPS) to theLeader of the House of Commons,externalsaid she would step down on Thursday if Mr Johnson was still in office after he had overseen an ""erosion of trust and decency at the heart of government"". Mr Williams, a PPS to the Treasury, said it was becoming impossible for Mr Johnson to rebuild trust with the public, while Mr Davies added that it was ""clear that the party and the country are no longer governable"" under him. On Tuesday night,Virginia Crosbie became the first Welsh MP to call publicly for Mr Johnson to goas she resigned from her post in the Wales Office. Liz Saville Roberts said the prime minister was the ""best recruiting sergeant for independence"" During Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Saville Roberts accused Mr Johnson of putting ""political survival over public duty"". But she said whatever happened ""the same Westminster arrogance will continue to dictate our futures in Wales"", asking him if he wanted a ""medal for being the best recruiting sergeant for independence we could wish for?"" The prime minister responded: ""I see the bonds of our union are being strengthened the whole time."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford called for a general election to determine which political party should occupy Downing Street. ""Let the people of the United Kingdom decide whether this is a government they want to see continue or whether, as I believe they would want, to see a fresh start,"" he said.

"Boris Johnson has faced the resignations of Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid Politicians in Northern Ireland have been reacting to resignations in Boris Johnson's cabinet. The chancellor and health secretary resigned from government, saying they no longer have confidence in the prime minister to lead the country. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said thepublic expected government to be conducted ""properly, competently and seriously"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid echoed this,saying the government was not ""acting in the national interest"". They have been replaced by Steve Barclay as health secretary and Nadhim Zahawi as chancellor. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis remains in the cabinet andwelcomed Mr Zahawi's promotion as a ""great appointment"".,external Visiting a Belfast school in Belfast on Wednesday, Mr Lewis maintained that Boris Johnson continued to have his support. He said the prime minister had received an ""overwhelming mandate"" from voters in 2019 and from the Conservative Party. He told reporters the government had a duty to ""get on with delivering for people"". Northern Ireland Minister Conor Burns is also staying on - he said he holds an ""enduring gratitude"" to Mr Johnson for his appointment to the Northern Ireland Office. Live: Johnson makes Zahawi chancellor after Sunak quits Timeline: How No 10's story on what PM knew unravelled Can Boris Johnson survive these resignations? ""He delivered the hardest Brexit possible,"" says the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Ms O'Neill said Boris Johnson had been ""bad for the people of the north"". ""He has failed workers and their families struggling with the cost of living,"" she said. She added: ""He has failed victims of the conflict and their families. ""He delivered the hardest Brexit possible against the wishes of the majority of our people, our political representatives and our businesses and he has torn up international agreements and shown contempt for international law. ""He has attacked the Good Friday Agreement, backing the boycott of our democratic institutions to placate Tory Brexiteers and the DUP in a desperate attempt to hold on to power. ""The current Tory chaos at Westminster is a daily reminder of the complete ineptitude and arrogance of this British government."" Sir Jeffrey says his priority is the removal of the Irish Sea border Sir Jeffrey did not comment directly on the news, describing the Conservative Party's leadership and ""those who occupy cabinet positions"" as a party matter. ""Our focus remains on working to see the removal of the Irish Sea border brought about through the NI Protocol,"" he said. The protocol ispart of the 2019 Brexit deal and keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. ""Every day it remains, it is undermining our economy and constitution. Not one unionist MP or MLA supports the protocol,"" he said. ""The legislation, making its legislative journey through parliament, is important in seeing the removal of the protocol and is necessary if we are to see solid foundations upon which to re-establish devolved government in NI."" DUP MP Sammy Wilson backed the prime minister and said ""stability"" was needed in government instead of the ""self-indulgence"" of a leadership contest. ""What we need is stability, not this self indulgence of who should lead the Conservative party."" Mr Wilson told GB News. """"We've got a prime minister, he was elected [...] with a strong majority, he is a flawed man. We know that in Northern Ireland, he's made promises he can't keep.

Stephen Farry says the PM ""should have gone a long time ago"" Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Farry said: ""I never thought that Boris Johnson was fit to be prime minister in the first place but events have proven me and countless others right and he has really dragged down standards of integrity in public office and the norms of democracy in the UK. ""I certainly believe he has to go. ""He should have gone a long time ago but tonight I think it is inevitable that he has to go and do so very quickly."" ""The sooner he is out the better,"" says the SDLP leader Mr Eastwood described the prime minister as ""an absolute disaster for Northern Ireland"". ""He's breaking international law around the protocol,"" he told BBC News NI. ""He's breaking international law around the legacy proposals. ""He's looking to take us out of the ECHR.

"MI5 head Ken McCallum (left) and FBI director Christopher Wray (right) made an unprecedented joint appearance in London The heads of UK and US security services have made an unprecedented joint appearance to warn of the threat from China. FBI director Christopher Wray said China was the ""biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security"" and had interfered in politics, including recent elections. MI5 head Ken McCallum said his service had more than doubled its work against Chinese activity in the last three years and would be doubling it again. MI5 is now running seven times as many investigations related to activities of the Chinese Communist Party compared to 2018, he added. The FBI's Wray warned that if China was to forcibly take Taiwan it would ""represent one of the most horrific business disruptions the world has ever seen"". In response, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said British intelligence was trying to ""hype up the China threat theory"" and he advised the head of MI5 to ""cast away imagined demons"". He said the FBI director had also been ""playing up the China threat to smear and attack China"" revealing a ""Cold War mentality"" and urged him to stop making ""irresponsible"" remarks. The first ever joint public appearance by the two directors came at MI5 headquarters in Thames House, London. McCallum also said the challenge posed by the Chinese Communist Party was ""game-changing"", while Wray called it ""immense"" and ""breath-taking"". Wray warned the audience - which included chief executives of businesses and senior figures from universities - that the Chinese government was ""set on stealing your technology"" using a range of tools. He said it posed ""an even more serious threat to western businesses than even many sophisticated businesspeople realised"". He cited cases in which people linked to Chinese companies out in rural America had been digging up genetically modified seeds which would have cost them billions of dollars and nearly a decade to develop themselves. He also said China deployed cyber espionage to ""cheat and steal on a massive scale"", with a hacking programme larger than that of every other major country combined. The MI5 head said intelligence about cyber threats had been shared with 37 countries and that in May a sophisticated threat against aerospace had been disrupted. Both men warned that China was drawing lessons from the Russian invasion of Ukraine McCallum also pointed to a series of examples linked to China. These included a British aviation expert who had received an approach online and had been offered an attractive employment opportunity. He travelled to China twice to be ""wined and dined"" before being asked for technical information on military aircraft by a company which was actually a front for Chinese intelligence officers. ""That's where we stepped in,"" said McCallum. He also said one engineering firm had been approached by a Chinese company which led to its technology being taken before the deal was then called off, forcing the company, Smith's Harlow, to go into administration in 2020. And he pointed to the interference alert issued by Parliament in January about the activities of Christine Lee. He said these types of operations aimed to amplify pro-Chinese communist party voices and silence those that questioned its authority. ""It needs to be challenged,"" the MI5 head said. In the US, the FBI director said the Chinese government had directly interfered in a congressional election in New York this spring because they did not want a candidate who was a critic and former protester at Tiananmen Square to be elected. They had done so, he said, by hiring a private investigator to dig up derogatory information. When they could not find anything, he said there had been an effort to manufacture a controversy using a sex worker before even suggesting staging a car accident. Wray said China was drawing ""all sorts of lessons"" from the conflict in Ukraine. This included trying to insulate themselves from any future sanctions of the type that have hit Russia. If China did invade Taiwan, the economic disruption would be much greater than that seen this year, he said, with western investments in China becoming ""hostages"" and supply chains disrupted. ""I don't have any reason to think their interest in Taiwan has abated in any fashion,"" the FBI director told journalists after the speech. The MI5 head said new legislation would help to deal with the threat but the UK also needed to become a ""harder target"" by ensuring that all parts of society were more aware of the risks. He said that reform of the visa system had seen over 50 students linked to the Chinese military leaving the UK. ""China has for far too long counted on being everybody's second-highest priority,"" Wray said, adding: ""They are not flying under the radar anymore.""

"Rafael Nadal had a medical timeout at the end of the second set and looked in discomfort for much of the match Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Rafael Nadal fought through injury to come from behind to beat Taylor Fritz and reach the Wimbledon semi-finals. The Spaniard, who had a medical timeout at the end of the second set and struggled with his movement for long spells, won 3-6 7-5 3-6 7-5 7-6 (10-4). It keeps Nadal's bid for a calendar Grand Slam on track and sets up a semi-final against Nick Kyrgios. Nadal, who had strapping on his abdomen in his previous match, was bothered by the same issue again. The first question he faced after the forehand winner that sealed victory, in a match that at one point he looked like he might not be able to finish, was 'how did you do that?' It was the one on anyone's lips who witnessed the events on an enthralled Centre Court. ""I don't know,"" the 36-year-old said. ""The body in general is fine, but in the abdominal [area] something is not going well, being honest. I had to find a way to serve a little bit different. ""For a lot of moments I was thinking I would not be able to finish the match but the crowd, the energy, thanks for that."" Live scores, results and order of play Listen to the latest Wimbledon Daily podcast Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Nadal, who was in sublime form in his previous two matches, had got off to a good start with a break in the opening game but Fritz raced to the net to launch a stunning forehand down the line to break back for 3-3. From then on Nadal seemed troubled physically and when he handed Fritz a break with a double fault, the American wasted no time serving out the set with three aces in a row. The Spanish 22-time Grand Slam champion went off court for treatment at 3-4 in the second set and although he returned to take that set, his movement continued to be hampered and he struggled on his backhand side and on his serve, which increasingly dropped in speed. Hanging his head while sitting at the changeovers, Nadal looked lost, calling on the trainer at the end of a third set that he handed to Fritz when he sent a forehand wide. He had a chat with the trainer but no treatment, merely shaking his head before heading over to the baseline. Nadal was broken eight times in the match, his serve frequently 25mph slower than that of his opponent, but he held it to love to take the fourth set and force a decider that had looked so unlikely at times. This was a reminder that this is one of his sport's all-time greats and whose fighting spirit is his trademark. Nadal had break points at 3-3 in the fifth, one of which was saved by a cruel net cord, before he finally converted the fourth with a delicate forehand drop shot. But Fritz, who had beaten Nadal earlier this year in the Indian Wells final and won the Eastbourne title just before arriving at the All England Club, responded brilliantly with an immediate break back and hold to leave the Spaniard serving to stay in the match as the clocked ticked past four hours. He held firm and Fritz quickly held his own serve again with an ace, with Nadal then roaring when he took it into the tie-break, where he quickly went 5-0 ahead. A drop shot from the Spaniard left Fritz lying on his back, watching Nadal's winner go past him at the end of a 25-shot rally, before the two-time Wimbledon champion turned a final screw with a forehand that put him into his eighth Wimbledon semi-final. ""It's been a tough afternoon against a great player,"" said Nadal, who has a perfect record of winning all eight of his quarter-finals here. ""Credit to Taylor that he has been doing great all season."" Nadal arrived at Wimbledon a couple of weeks after having treatment on his chronic foot condition after he won a record-extending 14th French Open title without being able to feel his left foot because of anaesthetic injections. The abdominal issue that troubled him against Fritz had already affected him in his fourth-round match and while he now has a day off to recover, it remains to be seen what the impact of this gruelling encounter will have on his chances in the semi-final against an in-form Kyrgios. ""I hope to be ready to play it,"" Nadal said. ""Nick is a great player on all the surfaces but especially on grass. He's having a great grass-court season. I need to be at 100% to keep having chances."" The pair have met twice at Wimbledon before, with Kyrgios stunning Nadal in the fourth round in 2014 on his tournament debut before meeting again five years later. That time the Spaniard triumphed against an irate Kyrgios, who spent much of the match audibly questioning Nadal's speed of play. Nadal has already won the Australian and French Opens this year and is bidding to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Grand Slam titles in the same year.

"Amazon is under investigation in the UK over concerns that the company is giving an unfair advantage to certain sellers on its marketplace. The markets watchdog said that Amazon's practices may be anti-competitive and leading to worse deals for customers. The investigation will centre on how Amazon decides which products are given preferential listing spots. Amazon said it believed it had always worked hard to help small businesses selling on Amazon to succeed, This investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) follows a similar probe launched by the European Commission in May. The online retail giant not only hosts the marketplace where independent businesses can advertise their products, but it also sells its own products there too. According the CMA, Amazon may be giving preference to its own retail business and disadvantaging third-party sellers. Amazon and Google probed over fake 5-star reviews Amazon investigated by German anti-trust watchdog The regulator also said that for a fee, Amazon offers services to these independent businesses - including storage, packaging, and delivery - and may be giving an unfair advantage to the sellers that purchase these services. If the CMA decides, after concluding its investigation, that Amazon is guilty, then it has the power to impose a financial penalty or direct the company to change its practices. Sarah Cardell, General Counsel at the CMA, said: ""Millions of people across the UK rely on Amazon's services for fast delivery of all types of products at the click of a button."" ""This is an important area so it's right that we carefully investigate whether Amazon is using third-party data to give an unfair boost to its own retail business and whether it favours sellers who use its logistics and delivery services - both of which could weaken competition,"" Ms Cardell said. Thousands of UK businesses use Amazon to sell their products, she added. ""Any loss of competition is a loss to consumers and could lead to them paying more for products, being offered lower quality items or having less choice."" The CMA's investigation will focus firstly on how Amazon collects third-party seller data, and whether it then uses this information to give itself an unfair advantage in relation to business decisions made by its retail arm. Secondly, the probe will look in to how Amazon decides which suppliers are given preferred first choice in the ""Buy Box"", a section displayed prominently on Amazon's product pages. Being placed in the box provides customers with one-click options to ""Buy Now"" or ""Add to Basket"". Lastly, the regulator has promised to investigate how Amazon decides which products are eligible to be sold under the Prime label, giving them free and faster delivery. A spokesperson for Amazon said: ""We will work closely with the CMA during their investigation, although we believe we've always worked hard to help small businesses selling on Amazon to succeed, which is in both their and our best interests."" ""We remain proud of the continued support we provide to businesses of all sizes across the UK."" The CMA said it would seek to liaise with the European Commission as its own investigation in the UK progresses. Alongside this case, the CMA also has an open investigation into Amazon and Google, over concerns that fake five star reviews on their websites could be misleading shoppers. The watchdog is also worried that ""law-abiding businesses"" which sell over Amazon and Google may be losing out to firms using false recommendations.

"A woman uses her phone outside the offices of NSO Apple has announced a new security feature to protect high-risk users from spyware cyber-attacks. Lockdown Mode will be available in the autumn with the next operating system across all of the company's iPhones, iPads and Macs. The setting blocks certain functions and prevents unknown users from calling. It comes after Apple devices owned by activists, politicians and journalists were infected with spyware. Apple is currently suing Israeli spyware firm NSO Group,accusing it of targeting victims in 150 different countries with its powerful Pegasus spyware. The firm's software could infect both iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. NSO Group says its tools are made to target terrorists and criminals and insists it only supplies Pegasus to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human rights records. NSO Group: Israeli spyware company added to US trade blacklist Pegasus spyware seller: Blame our customers, not us, for hacking When the extent of the alleged surveillance was revealed last July, Apple faced criticism from privacy and security experts for not protecting users. It quickly released an emergency software update to all devices to patch up the vulnerability that Pegasus had secretly been using for years. Now the company is releasing Lockdown Mode as a wider security feature it claims can protect devices from all known spyware currently on the market. Lockdown Mode will include the following protections: Messages: Most message attachment types other than images are blocked. Some features, like link previews, are disabled Web browsing: Certain complex web technologies, like just-in-time JavaScript compilation, are disabled unless the user excludes a trusted site Calls: Incoming invitations including FaceTime calls, are blocked if the user has not previously sent the initiator a call or request Wired connections with a computer or accessory are blocked when iPhone is locked At launch, Lockdown Mode will be available to all users in the device settings, but Apple suggests it should only be activated if someone is a risk of what it calls ""mercenary spyware attacks"" - for example a journalist or opposition leader in a repressive regime. This video can not be played Whatâs it like to have spyware on your phone? ""While the vast majority of users will never be victims of highly targeted cyber-attacks, we will work tirelessly to protect the small number of users who are,"" said Ivan KrstiÄ, Apple's head of security engineering and architecture. Apple announced it will double the bounty threshold it pays out to ethical hackers who discover security flaws in Lockdown Mode to $2m (Â£1.7m). The US firm will also donate $10m to a fund helping organisations expose the misuse of spyware. ""The global spyware trade targets human rights defenders, journalists, and dissidents, and facilitates violence, reinforces authoritarianism, and supports political repression,"" said Lori McGlinchey, director, technology and society at the Ford Foundation, which will oversee the grant. In November, US officials placed NSO Group on a trade blacklist, saying the software had ""enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists"". NSO Group is also being sued by WhatsApp, which accuses it of using the messaging service as a vehicle to spread Pegasus.

"A number of residents left Slovyansk on Wednesday morning as authorities urged people to leave Residents have been told to leave Ukraine's eastern city of Slovyansk, a day after two people were killed in a Russian attack on a market. Civilians boarded minibuses on Wednesday morning as Russian forces advanced from the north and east. UK defence intelligence said there was a ""realistic possibility"" the battle for Slovyansk would be the next key contest in the struggle for the Donbas. Russian forces were likely to be 16km (10 miles) north of the city, it said. Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the Russians had turned the entire Donetsk region into a hotspot where it was dangerous for a civilian to remain. ""I call on everyone to evacuate, evacuation saves lives,"" he said on his social media feed. Russia switched its focus to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region in March, after a failed bid to capture the capital Kyiv. It has taken control of Luhansk region, to the north and east of Slovyansk, and has now pushed on to the rest of Donetsk. The industrial Donbas embraces Donetsk and Luhansk. Russian commentators said the fall of the last city in Luhansk had cleared the way for an advance towards towns to the west and south. However, Ukraine's regional chief in Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said the military continued to frustrate Russian forces on the border with Donetsk region, particularly around the main road from Lysychansk to Bakhmut. Russian military expert Vladislav Shurygin told Izvestia newspaper that it would take the army several days to clear mines, but the next large-scale battles would be for Slovyansk and neighbouring Kramatorsk, as well as pushing Ukrainian forces out of range of the city of Donetsk. Slovyansk was seized by Russian-backed forces when the war first erupted in 2014, but recaptured two and a half months later. As residents remembered the anniversary of the army's success on Tuesday, Russian artillery pounded the city, setting the market on fire. Two people were killed and seven wounded when Russian forces bombarded a market in Slovyansk on Tuesday Elsewhere in Ukraine, a civilian was killed early on Wednesday in a Russian cruise missile strike on a cafe in the southern Mykolaiv region, local leaders said. And in Kharkiv in the north a security guard was killed when a university building was shelled overnight. Irish leader MicheÃ¡l Martin visited some of the towns around Kyiv on Wednesday which had suffered serious damage in Russia's bombardment. The Taoiseach also went to the site of a mass grave in Bucha where residents had been murdered. Although Russian forces pulled back from around Kyiv a month into the invasion, Russian Security Council chief Nikolai Patrushev has reiterated that the Kremlin's main aim is still to replace Ukraine's leaders and capture a broad swathe of its territory. A close ally of the Russian leader, he repeated President Vladimir Putin's earlier claims of ""de-Nazifying"" and demilitarising Ukraine, saying that those goals would be achieved despite Western military aid to Kyiv. In reality Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has no connection to the far right: he is a former comedian, democratically elected and ethnically Jewish. A measure of Mr Putin's thinking at the time of the invasion was revealed in a French documentary last week, which broadcast a tense nine-minute phone call in which he told President Emmanuel Macron that President Zelensky was not democratically elected and came to power during a bloodbath when people were burned alive. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that broadcasting the call was a breach of diplomatic etiquette, although Russia had nothing to be ashamed of.

"Khalid Basfar is a member of the diplomatic staff at Saudi Arabia's embassy in London The UK Supreme Court has ruled that diplomats cannot hide behind immunity to exploit workers, in a victory for campaigners against modern slavery. Diplomats are normally protected from both criminal charges and civil cases in the countries where they are posted. But the court found a Saudi diplomat accused of exploiting a Filipina domestic worker in London did not have immunity in relation to the allegation. The decision paves the way for the woman to seek compensation. Lawyers said it was the first ruling of its kind in the world. The case was brought by Josephine Wong, 30, who alleges she was forced to work for Khalid Basfar and his family in conditions of modern slavery. Her lawyers say she was confined to the house at all times except to take out the rubbish, subjected to verbal abuse, and given only left-over food to eat when her employers were at home. She alleges that she was made to work from 07:00 until around 23:30 every day of the week, with no days off or rest breaks, and that she was forced to wear a door-bell so her employers could summon her at any moment. She alleges that after being brought to the UK from Saudi Arabia in 2016, she was not paid anything for seven months. She says she was then paid about Â£1,800 for six months' work in one lump sum - a fraction of her contractual entitlement - and after that not paid again. Ms Wong managed to escape in 2018 and brought a claim against Mr Basfar in an employment tribunal. He argued that Ms Wong's claim should be struck out on the basis of his diplomatic protection. Under article 31 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, diplomats enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution. But any commercial activity outside their professional work can be the subject of civil claims. The UK Supreme Court's justices have now ruled - by a majority of three to two - that if the facts of the case are proved, Mr Basfar does not have diplomatic immunity because his alleged exploitation of her amounted to commercial activity. In a summary of its judgement,external, the court said: ""The extent of control over Ms Wong's person and dominion over her labour exercised by Mr Basfar on the assumed facts of this case was so extensive and despotic as to place her in a position of domestic servitude. ""Further, on the assumed facts Mr Basfar gained a substantial financial benefit by deliberately and systematically exploiting Ms Wong's labour for almost two years, initially for a fraction of her contractual entitlement to wages and latterly for no pay at all. This conduct is accurately described as a commercial activity practised for personal profit."" The court also noted: ""There is evidence that exploitation of migrant domestic workers by foreign diplomats is a significant problem, so that the question raised on this appeal is one of general importance."" Anti-slavery campaigners have welcomed the ruling. Ms Wong's lawyer, Nusrat Uddin, told the BBC: ""It's justice at last for our client. And for all of the potential victims at risk of being exploited by diplomats. It allows recourse to take legal action and that's extremely empowering. ""We hope that this will act as a deterrent and that other countries - for example the United States - will take the UK's lead on this."" James Fookes, Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group Co-ordinator at the charity Anti-Slavery International, said in a statement: ""We don't know the full extent of abuse and exploitation of domestic workers in the UK, but this ruling is the first of its kind in the world and will shine more light on this serious issue and will hopefully lead the way to greater protection."" Mr Basfar's solicitors declined to comment on the ruling. There was also no immediate response from the Saudi embassy in London.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer asks Boris Johnson why he promoted Chris Pincher despite previous sexual allegations Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has become the latest cabinet member to resign as pressure continues to mount on Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He was among a group of UK ministers who earlier urged Mr Johnson to quit. In his resignation letter, Mr Hart said colleagues had done their utmost to ""turn the ship around"" but he no longer thought that was possible. Mr Johnson has defied calls to resign, as he tries to face down a growing mutiny among his cabinet. In a letter addressed to Mr Johnson and handed to the chief whip, Mr Hart insisted he had ""desperately hoped"" not to have to write it but saw ""no other option"". Government resignations: Who has gone, who is staying? Javid's and Sunak's resignation letters in full He said Mr Johnson would be remembered as a prime minister ""with energy, vision, determination and humour"". ""There was never a dull moment in your government and I will be forever grateful to have been given the chance to be part of it,"" he said. In his letter, he also said he had ""never been a massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best way of forcing change"". Mr Hart is the third cabinet minister to step down afterChancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid quit within minutes of one anotheron Tuesday. As of Wednesday night, 16 ministers had resigned, along with 20 government aides and five others. Levelling Up Secretary and former leadership rival to Mr Johnson, Michael Gove, wassacked by the prime ministerafter being part of the group of senior Tories urging him to go. Home Secretary Priti Patel, a former close ally, has also joined the group of rebel ministers. Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, called on the prime minister to ""reflect on his position and allow someone else to take on that mantle to deliver the Conservative manifesto"". It follows Mr Johnson's decision to appoint Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip earlier this year,despite being aware of misconduct allegations against him. Simon Hart told MPs it was ""business as usual in the Wales Office"" Came to Parliament in 2010 with a background in rural affairs as chief executive of the Countryside Alliance and a former master of the South Pembrokeshire Hunt The Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP was previously a junior minister in the Cabinet Office He was made a minister after Mr Johnson's December 2019 general election victory During Wednesday's Welsh Questions, Mr Hart was asked by Plaid Cymru MP, Liz Saville Roberts, ""when will he be going?"" In his response, he insisted it was ""business as usual in the Wales Office"". One of Mr Hart's predecessors, Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb, has called for Mr Johnson to resign ""for the good of the country"". He said trust in the UK government ""had been draining away month after month"" as controversies piled up. Mr Crabb, who confirmed he voted against Mr Johnson in the confidence vote last month, wrote in anarticle for the Pembrokeshire Herald,external: ""Every day I open my email inbox, every Q&A session I hold in the constituency, every time I visit Tesco or Morrisons in Haverfordwest, the feedback I receive is consistent and overwhelming: Boris Johnson should resign."" Fay Jones says she will quit on Thursday if Mr Johnson is still in office Mr Hart's resignation came after three other Welsh Conservative MPs quit their roles as government aides, with a fourth threatening to follow suit. Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams and Vale of Clwyd MP James Davies have both quit. Brecon and Radnorshire MP Fay Jones, aParliamentary Private Secretary,external(PPS) to theLeader of the House of Commons,externalsaid she would step down on Thursday if Mr Johnson was still in office after he had overseen an ""erosion of trust and decency at the heart of government"". Mr Williams, a PPS to the Treasury, said it was becoming impossible for Mr Johnson to rebuild trust with the public, while Mr Davies added that it was ""clear that the party and the country are no longer governable"" under him. On Tuesday night,Virginia Crosbie became the first Welsh MP to call publicly for Mr Johnson to goas she resigned from her post in the Wales Office. Liz Saville Roberts said the prime minister was the ""best recruiting sergeant for independence"" During Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Saville Roberts accused Mr Johnson of putting ""political survival over public duty"". But she said whatever happened ""the same Westminster arrogance will continue to dictate our futures in Wales"", asking him if he wanted a ""medal for being the best recruiting sergeant for independence we could wish for?"" The prime minister responded: ""I see the bonds of our union are being strengthened the whole time."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford called for a general election to determine which political party should occupy Downing Street. ""Let the people of the United Kingdom decide whether this is a government they want to see continue or whether, as I believe they would want, to see a fresh start,"" he said.

"The pound has fallen to two-year lows against the dollar amid rising concerns about recession around the world as energy prices continue to soar. Analysts said sterling - which was trading below $1.19 at one point - is also weak because markets are worried about future UK economic growth. Sterling could fall even further after predictions of UK economic stagnation and as inflation rises, they added. London shares regained some ground following falls on Tuesday. The resignation of two senior government ministers on Tuesday evening, including former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, was not a significant factor in the pound's fall, Rabobank head currency strategist Jane Foley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. ""The market is so much more concerned with growth, and what is this government going to do... the news in itself didn't create too many additional woes,"" she said. UK household energy bills to hit Â£3,000 per year Sunak letter reveals tensions over economy On Tuesday the pound fell below $1.19 for the first time since March 2020, when the first UK Covid lockdown was brought in. It was trading at $1.189 in late trading in London on Wednesday afternoon - off the two-year low of $1.187. It later rose to trade above $1.19. But Sterling rose against a weaker euro, up 0.5% to 85.46 pence, over concerns about the economic fallout from surging energy prices. A weak pound means that imports such as food become more expensive, and it pushes up the price of petrol at the pumps. It also means that UK holidaymakers get less for their money when buying abroad. However, UK products and services that are sold abroad can become more attractively priced for foreign customers. The pound to dollar rate was flat on Wednesday, while markets rose in London and Europe, with some analysts saying they were resetting to a lower level. The FTSE 100 stock market in London, which fell nearly 3% on Tuesday, managed to gain 1.2% on Wednesday to close at 7,107.77. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said markets could have regained some ground on investor hope that a planned corporation tax rise in 2023 could be scrapped. It could also be that stocks were ""oversold"" on Tuesday, he added. The dollar is performing strongly due to US interest rate rises and because investors see it as a safe bet. ""Now many people are worried about recession - recession in the US, recession in Europe, and of course we've got our cost of living crisis here in the UK,"" Ms Foley said. ""Sterling is still weak on its own, and that is despite the fact that the Bank of England have hiked interest rates five times this cycle already, and the reason for that is that the market is very concerned about the growth outlook here in the UK,"" she said. Sterling could fall even further, she said. One of the issues concerning investors is the shortage of UK labour, which hasn't gone back to pre-pandemic levels ""because we've lost a lot of workers"", she said. Many people left the labour market during the pandemic, and due to a combination of Covid and Brexit, foreign workers who had left did not return. The recent fall in sterling also came about because of the UK government ""aggravating the Northern Ireland protocol"", said George Godber, a fund manager with Polar Capital. Investors have been worried that the escalating dispute over the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland risks seeing the government scrapping parts of that deal, which could trigger a trade war. ""International investors don't like that, and it puts a lot of pressure on the pound, and that in turn feeds through to the economy,"" he said. ""The petrol prices are high because sterling has been weak."" Changes in prices at the pump for petrol are mainly down to the price of crude oil, and how the pound is performing against the dollar, because crude oil is traded in dollars. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi says the Prime Minister's focus is on ""delivering"" Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who was appointed to the role on Tuesday, said in terms of cutting taxes, ""nothing is off the table"". He referred to corporation tax saying he wanted to take a careful look at all the measures he could bring to ""bear down on inflation but also return to that dynamic economy that delivers growth."" Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, told the Today programme that the Bank would  do ""whatever is necessary"" to make sure the soaring cost of living did not become a long term problem.

"Rishi Sunak's shock resignation letter revealed clearly that his approach to the handling of the economy was ""fundamentally too different"" from that of the prime minister for him to stay in the government. He acknowledged both he and the prime minister wanted a ""low-tax, high-growth economy, and world class public services"", but Mr Sunak said this could only be ""responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions"". He said the public needed to know that ""whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one"". The former chancellor and Boris Johnson had been preparing for a joint speech on the economy next week, but during the course of those preparations Mr Sunak said it had ""become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different"". Now his replacement Nadhim Zahawi has said he and Prime Minister Boris Johnson want to ""rebuild the economy"" and get soaring inflation under control. Mr Zahawi said ""nothing is off the table"" in terms of cutting taxes. So what are some of the options open to the new Chancellor? Mr Zahawi has said he wants to do two things: cut taxes and ""bear down"" on inflation. Those are not usually happy bedfellows. Cutting taxes puts more money into the economy, which drives prices up - so how can he walk this line? A temporary cut in VAT - the tax paid when buying goods and services - from 20% to 17.5%, say, would lower the price of goods and services in the basket used to calculate inflation - taxes would get cut, and prices would go down. But there would be some problems with this. The cut might not be passed on by struggling businesses. Even if it were, the extra money in people's pockets would be chasing the same number of goods in an economy where supply is the problem, risking pushing inflation, which is already rising at its fastest rate for 40 years, up even further. In any event, prices would just go back up again when the VAT cut was reversed. Furthermore, cutting VAT would mostly benefit high earners, according to George Dibb, head of the Institute for Public Policy Research's Centre for Economic Justice. ""The big risk with cutting VAT is that it could be inflationary, but it would also just put more money in everyone's pockets despite families coming out of the pandemic in very different positions."" ""Cutting VAT actually just benefits those on the highest incomes,"" Mr Dibb said. ""It doesn't really help the lowest earners who are the most affected by the cost-of-living crisis."" Mr Zahawi could bring forward the 1p income tax cut that Rishi Sunak promised would happen in 2024. before the next election. The Taxpayers' Alliance, a pressure group that campaigns for lower taxes, has said if the government wanted to give families ""a respite from tax rises, they'd do well to simply bring forward the planned income tax cut instead of tricking taxpayers into thinking they're better off"". However, Rishi Sunak delayed that cut to the tax people pay on their income because it's quite expensive - it would cost the government around Â£5bn. The move is also likely to again benefit higher earners more than anyone else, according to Lukasz Krebel, an economist at the New Economics Foundation think tank told the BBC. ""The new chancellor's priority should be to tackle the cost of living crisis and tax cuts are not the best way of doing this as they are untargeted and much of the benefits will go towards subsidising those on higher incomes,"" said Mr Krebel. It would also benefit higher earners much more than lower earners, and it wouldn't slow down how quickly prices rise. Mr Zahawi has hinted that he may scrap a planned corporation tax rise due in 2023 - this is the only tax he has so far specifically mentioned. The tax on company profits is due to rise from 19% to 25% in April 2023. In an interview with BBC Breakfast on Thursday, Mr Zahawi said: ""Companies make investment decisions over the long term. One of the taxes they can compare globally is corporation tax, and I want to take a very careful look at all the measures that I can bring to bear, to bear down on inflation but also return to that dynamic economy that delivers growth."" In March 2020 the Treasury expected the tax to raise an extra Â£12bn next year, rising to Â£17bn in 2026. That now looks optimistic as company profits are squeezed by higher costs and lower consumer demand. Reversing some of it would not be that expensive, and would send a pro-business, pro-growth, traditionally conservative message. Some Conservative MPs fear that increasing the tax will discourage foreign investment in the UK, which has fallen since the country voted to leave the EU. Historically, the amount of money raised by corporation tax has increased even as the rate declined. But according to Mr Dibb, at the left-leaning IPPR think tank, abandoning the proposed rise in  corporation tax will do nothing to stimulate the economy. ""The problem with cutting corporation tax is it won't do what Mr Zahawi wants it to do,"" he said. ""Cutting it doesn't increase private sector investment. It is a cash handout to companies."" ""We need a proper industrial strategy. Firms don't invest because they get tax cuts, they invest because they see future growth opportunities."" Mr Dibb said that recent figures showed that private sector investment had fallen in the previous quarter, despite corporation tax cuts implemented by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak. This sentiment was echoed by Mr Krebel, from the New Economics Foundation who said that ""cutting corporation taxes would be a costly measure but unlikely to offer much of economic boost, since business growth ultimately depends on strong demand in the economy."" So if cutting taxes while lowering inflation is a tough trick to pull off, what are some of the other options Mr Zahawi has at his disposal to ease the burden? Low-income households will soon start to get government payments to help with the cost of living, and particularly their winter energy bills. Will the new chancellor consider extending direct assistance for households? Direct payments are unusual - certainly for a Conservative government - but these are unusual times. Cost-of-living payments serve a dual purpose of being popular and comparatively easy to administer. Next week, low-income households on means-tested benefits will receive the first instalment of financial support straight into their bank accounts. Adding more payments during a tough winter ahead would allow people to spend the money quickly on the things that really matter - heating, eating and getting around. However, direct payments are short-term by nature - unlike change to tax rises - and they still need to be paid for. Mr Zahawi would need to find the money, at the same time as he faces pressure to cut taxes too. These payments also risk being inflationary in themselves, adding to the likelihood of soaring prices in the longer-term. Moreover, any government that keeps stepping in - as it has with furlough and cost of living payments - raises public expectations that it will do the same in every crisis situation. Over time, that could become expensive and unmanageable. Pound slides to two-year low against the dollar Most only have Â£500 of savings says Lloyds boss Why did Rishi Sunak resign?

Fritz 6-3 5-7 6-3 5-7 6-7 (4-10) Nadal BBC Sport Let's hear from Rafael Nadal after that epic win over Taylor Fritz:""I honestly enjoy a lot playing these kind of matches in front of you guys. I can't thank you enough for the support ""It's been a tough afternoon against a great player. Credit to Taylor that he has been doing great all season. Personally for me it was not an easy match at all so it is great to be in the semi-finals."" On his injury issues:""The body in general is fine, but in the abdominal something is not going well, being honest. I had to find a way to serve a little bit different. For a lot of moments I was thinking I would not be able to finish the match but the crowd, the energy, thanks for that."" Laura RobsonFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra I think he will adjust. He has 48 hours to turn it around and try and find a solution, maybe that is more tape. Again we don't know what has gone on because it is one of the difficult parts of the body to handle. He was able to find a way through that. I think in the key moments he was still going for it, still going for the big serves and not really caring what will happen with his ab. I think it will be electric on Friday. Fritz 6-3 5-7 6-3 5-7 6-7 (4-10) Nadal Rafael Nadal confirms the problem that was bothering him from the second set onwards was an abdominal injury. That does pose many questions ahead of Friday's semi-final with Nick Kyrgios. The Spaniard does at least have a day off tomorrow - but the injury will impact his preparation no doubt. Let's hope he will be fit enough to play that semi-final. Full on-court reaction from the second seed on its way shortly. #bbctennis GT:How on earth did Rafa win that??? Sahil Oberoi:Yesterday I called Novak a 'mentality monster', Rafa just reminded us who patented that term. GOAT. Laura RobsonFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra Where do you start? What a win that was. We were so sure he was going to stop but as Rafa does he finds a way through. It is hard to imagine the match against Kyrgios being any more dramatic than this one. I feel for Taylor Fritz, he looks absolutely devastated. He will learn so much from this loss.

"MI5 head Ken McCallum (left) and FBI director Christopher Wray (right) made an unprecedented joint appearance in London The heads of UK and US security services have made an unprecedented joint appearance to warn of the threat from China. FBI director Christopher Wray said China was the ""biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security"" and had interfered in politics, including recent elections. MI5 head Ken McCallum said his service had more than doubled its work against Chinese activity in the last three years and would be doubling it again. MI5 is now running seven times as many investigations related to activities of the Chinese Communist Party compared to 2018, he added. The FBI's Wray warned that if China was to forcibly take Taiwan it would ""represent one of the most horrific business disruptions the world has ever seen"". In response, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said British intelligence was trying to ""hype up the China threat theory"" and he advised the head of MI5 to ""cast away imagined demons"". He said the FBI director had also been ""playing up the China threat to smear and attack China"" revealing a ""Cold War mentality"" and urged him to stop making ""irresponsible"" remarks. The first ever joint public appearance by the two directors came at MI5 headquarters in Thames House, London. McCallum also said the challenge posed by the Chinese Communist Party was ""game-changing"", while Wray called it ""immense"" and ""breath-taking"". Wray warned the audience - which included chief executives of businesses and senior figures from universities - that the Chinese government was ""set on stealing your technology"" using a range of tools. He said it posed ""an even more serious threat to western businesses than even many sophisticated businesspeople realised"". He cited cases in which people linked to Chinese companies out in rural America had been digging up genetically modified seeds which would have cost them billions of dollars and nearly a decade to develop themselves. He also said China deployed cyber espionage to ""cheat and steal on a massive scale"", with a hacking programme larger than that of every other major country combined. The MI5 head said intelligence about cyber threats had been shared with 37 countries and that in May a sophisticated threat against aerospace had been disrupted. Both men warned that China was drawing lessons from the Russian invasion of Ukraine McCallum also pointed to a series of examples linked to China. These included a British aviation expert who had received an approach online and had been offered an attractive employment opportunity. He travelled to China twice to be ""wined and dined"" before being asked for technical information on military aircraft by a company which was actually a front for Chinese intelligence officers. ""That's where we stepped in,"" said McCallum. He also said one engineering firm had been approached by a Chinese company which led to its technology being taken before the deal was then called off, forcing the company, Smith's Harlow, to go into administration in 2020. And he pointed to the interference alert issued by Parliament in January about the activities of Christine Lee. He said these types of operations aimed to amplify pro-Chinese communist party voices and silence those that questioned its authority. ""It needs to be challenged,"" the MI5 head said. In the US, the FBI director said the Chinese government had directly interfered in a congressional election in New York this spring because they did not want a candidate who was a critic and former protester at Tiananmen Square to be elected. They had done so, he said, by hiring a private investigator to dig up derogatory information. When they could not find anything, he said there had been an effort to manufacture a controversy using a sex worker before even suggesting staging a car accident. Wray said China was drawing ""all sorts of lessons"" from the conflict in Ukraine. This included trying to insulate themselves from any future sanctions of the type that have hit Russia. If China did invade Taiwan, the economic disruption would be much greater than that seen this year, he said, with western investments in China becoming ""hostages"" and supply chains disrupted. ""I don't have any reason to think their interest in Taiwan has abated in any fashion,"" the FBI director told journalists after the speech. The MI5 head said new legislation would help to deal with the threat but the UK also needed to become a ""harder target"" by ensuring that all parts of society were more aware of the risks. He said that reform of the visa system had seen over 50 students linked to the Chinese military leaving the UK. ""China has for far too long counted on being everybody's second-highest priority,"" Wray said, adding: ""They are not flying under the radar anymore.""

"Rafael Nadal had a medical timeout at the end of the second set and looked in discomfort for much of the match Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Rafael Nadal fought through injury to come from behind to beat Taylor Fritz and reach the Wimbledon semi-finals. The Spaniard, who had a medical timeout at the end of the second set and struggled with his movement for long spells, won 3-6 7-5 3-6 7-5 7-6 (10-4). It keeps Nadal's bid for a calendar Grand Slam on track and sets up a semi-final against Nick Kyrgios. Nadal, who had strapping on his abdomen in his previous match, was bothered by the same issue again. The first question he faced after the forehand winner that sealed victory, in a match that at one point he looked like he might not be able to finish, was 'how did you do that?' It was the one on anyone's lips who witnessed the events on an enthralled Centre Court. ""I don't know,"" the 36-year-old said. ""The body in general is fine, but in the abdominal [area] something is not going well, being honest. I had to find a way to serve a little bit different. ""For a lot of moments I was thinking I would not be able to finish the match but the crowd, the energy, thanks for that."" Live scores, results and order of play Listen to the latest Wimbledon Daily podcast Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Nadal, who was in sublime form in his previous two matches, had got off to a good start with a break in the opening game but Fritz raced to the net to launch a stunning forehand down the line to break back for 3-3. From then on Nadal seemed troubled physically and when he handed Fritz a break with a double fault, the American wasted no time serving out the set with three aces in a row. The Spanish 22-time Grand Slam champion went off court for treatment at 3-4 in the second set and although he returned to take that set, his movement continued to be hampered and he struggled on his backhand side and on his serve, which increasingly dropped in speed. Hanging his head while sitting at the changeovers, Nadal looked lost, calling on the trainer at the end of a third set that he handed to Fritz when he sent a forehand wide. He had a chat with the trainer but no treatment, merely shaking his head before heading over to the baseline. Nadal was broken eight times in the match, his serve frequently 25mph slower than that of his opponent, but he held it to love to take the fourth set and force a decider that had looked so unlikely at times. This was a reminder that this is one of his sport's all-time greats and whose fighting spirit is his trademark. Nadal had break points at 3-3 in the fifth, one of which was saved by a cruel net cord, before he finally converted the fourth with a delicate forehand drop shot. But Fritz, who had beaten Nadal earlier this year in the Indian Wells final and won the Eastbourne title just before arriving at the All England Club, responded brilliantly with an immediate break back and hold to leave the Spaniard serving to stay in the match as the clocked ticked past four hours. He held firm and Fritz quickly held his own serve again with an ace, with Nadal then roaring when he took it into the tie-break, where he quickly went 5-0 ahead. A drop shot from the Spaniard left Fritz lying on his back, watching Nadal's winner go past him at the end of a 25-shot rally, before the two-time Wimbledon champion turned a final screw with a forehand that put him into his eighth Wimbledon semi-final. ""It's been a tough afternoon against a great player,"" said Nadal, who has a perfect record of winning all eight of his quarter-finals here. ""Credit to Taylor that he has been doing great all season."" Nadal arrived at Wimbledon a couple of weeks after having treatment on his chronic foot condition after he won a record-extending 14th French Open title without being able to feel his left foot because of anaesthetic injections. The abdominal issue that troubled him against Fritz had already affected him in his fourth-round match and while he now has a day off to recover, it remains to be seen what the impact of this gruelling encounter will have on his chances in the semi-final against an in-form Kyrgios. ""I hope to be ready to play it,"" Nadal said. ""Nick is a great player on all the surfaces but especially on grass. He's having a great grass-court season. I need to be at 100% to keep having chances."" The pair have met twice at Wimbledon before, with Kyrgios stunning Nadal in the fourth round in 2014 on his tournament debut before meeting again five years later. That time the Spaniard triumphed against an irate Kyrgios, who spent much of the match audibly questioning Nadal's speed of play. Nadal has already won the Australian and French Opens this year and is bidding to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Grand Slam titles in the same year.

"Mars has stopped supplying supermarket chain Tesco with its Whiskas pet food in a row over prices. The two companies are engaged in a price dispute which Tesco said it hoped would be ""resolved soon"". The UK's biggest supermarket said it would not pass on ""unjustifiable price increases"" from suppliers its to customers. Mars said it could not comment on individual commercial relationships or situations. As the cost of living rises for shoppers, retailers like supermarkets are fighting to retain customers and protect profit. It comes after US food retailerKraft Heinz pulled its productsfrom sale at Tesco in a similar dispute over the price of its products including soup and ketchup. Tesco added: ""We're sorry that this means some products aren't available right now, but we have plenty of alternatives to choose from and we hope to have this issue resolved soon."" The price rises from Mars, whose pet products include Whiskas, Dreamies and Pedigree, come as inflation is at a 40-year high, at 9.1%. The supermarket rows you don't usually hear about What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Customers are also struggling with rises in energy bills, with the average bill now expected to rise to Â£3,000 per year in October. ""The pet food industry, like many others, is operating in a volatile context marked by wide-ranging inflationary pressures, and we continue to absorb these rising costs as much as possible,"" said Mars. It added: ""The in-store price continues to be at the sole discretion of the retailer."" Some Tesco stores have experienced a lack of Mars pet foods on their shelves as a result of the dispute, and there are also some stock shortages on Tesco's website. Mars said: ""We are aware that some of our Petcare products are currently out of stock at Tesco stores. ""There are many reasons why our products may be out of stock in certain stores from time to time. We cannot comment on individual commercial relationships or situations."" The tussle between Tesco and Mars and Heinz illustrates the challenges facing suppliers and supermarkets as they struggle with huge cost increases. ""Suppliers are now saying: 'This is what I can afford to sell this product to you for. And if you don't agree I am going to stop supplying you,'"" says Ged Futter, founder of The Retail Mind and former buyer for Asda supermarket. He added: ""I've never seen as many suppliers prepared to stop the trucks."" ""Tesco can't afford to have empty shelves for months on end. If customers see large swathes of empty shelves, then they have to go somewhere else,"" Mr Futter told the Today programme. Supermarkets have buyers who agree deals with suppliers to provide them with products. For many items, like olive oil and tinned tomatoes, it can be an annual contract. Both sides are allowed, under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, to adjust terms and conditions. The editor-in-chief of the Grocer magazine, Adam Leyland, says in the past retailers typically demanded changes but now it is suppliers who are clamouring to renegotiate what they are getting paid.

"Mars has stopped supplying supermarket chain Tesco with its Whiskas pet food in a row over prices. The two companies are engaged in a price dispute which Tesco said it hoped would be ""resolved soon"". The UK's biggest supermarket said it would not pass on ""unjustifiable price increases"" from suppliers its to customers. Mars said it could not comment on individual commercial relationships or situations. As the cost of living rises for shoppers, retailers like supermarkets are fighting to retain customers and protect profit. It comes after US food retailerKraft Heinz pulled its productsfrom sale at Tesco in a similar dispute over the price of its products including soup and ketchup. Tesco added: ""We're sorry that this means some products aren't available right now, but we have plenty of alternatives to choose from and we hope to have this issue resolved soon."" The price rises from Mars, whose pet products include Whiskas, Dreamies and Pedigree, come as inflation is at a 40-year high, at 9.1%. The supermarket rows you don't usually hear about What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Customers are also struggling with rises in energy bills, with the average bill now expected to rise to Â£3,000 per year in October. ""The pet food industry, like many others, is operating in a volatile context marked by wide-ranging inflationary pressures, and we continue to absorb these rising costs as much as possible,"" said Mars. It added: ""The in-store price continues to be at the sole discretion of the retailer."" Some Tesco stores have experienced a lack of Mars pet foods on their shelves as a result of the dispute, and there are also some stock shortages on Tesco's website. Mars said: ""We are aware that some of our Petcare products are currently out of stock at Tesco stores. ""There are many reasons why our products may be out of stock in certain stores from time to time. We cannot comment on individual commercial relationships or situations."" The tussle between Tesco and Mars and Heinz illustrates the challenges facing suppliers and supermarkets as they struggle with huge cost increases. ""Suppliers are now saying: 'This is what I can afford to sell this product to you for. And if you don't agree I am going to stop supplying you,'"" says Ged Futter, founder of The Retail Mind and former buyer for Asda supermarket. He added: ""I've never seen as many suppliers prepared to stop the trucks."" ""Tesco can't afford to have empty shelves for months on end. If customers see large swathes of empty shelves, then they have to go somewhere else,"" Mr Futter told the Today programme. Supermarkets have buyers who agree deals with suppliers to provide them with products. For many items, like olive oil and tinned tomatoes, it can be an annual contract. Both sides are allowed, under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, to adjust terms and conditions. The editor-in-chief of the Grocer magazine, Adam Leyland, says in the past retailers typically demanded changes but now it is suppliers who are clamouring to renegotiate what they are getting paid. ""Suppliers are saying we need change and we need it quickly. Supermarkets have been dragging their feet for a long time. This has been building from last year and the dial has now turned up.

"Zara Aleena had hoped to become a solicitor A woman who was killed as she returned home from a night out died from head and neck injuries, a coroner has heard.

"A man accused of opening fire on a Fourth of July parade near Chicago has been charged with seven counts of murder, officials say. The 21-year-old would be punished ""for the killing spree he has unleashed against our community"", Lake County State Attorney Eric Rinehart said. The attack in Highland Park left seven dead and more than 30 others injured. Mr Rinehart added that dozens more charges would be filed before the investigation was over. ""These are just the first of many charges that will be filed,"" he said to cheers and applause from the crowd gathered for the news conference on Tuesday. ""I want to emphasise that. There will be more charges."" If convicted, the seven murder counts alone would carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole, Mr Rinehart said. The suspect, Robert Crimo, is accused of firing 70 bullets from a high-powered rifle down on to the crowd and disguising himself as a woman so he could escape alongside fleeing victims. The suspect disguised himself as a woman to escape alongside fleeing onlookers, police say After an eight-hour manhunt on Monday, police arrested the gunman and he was discovered with a second rifle similar to the one used in the attack. Three other firearms were also found at his home. Police said the suspect had two prior contacts with law enforcement but was still able to purchase five guns in the past year. Illinois state police said that the suspect's father sponsored his application for a firearm licence in December 2019, when he was just 19. But his uncle denied this in astatement to the Chicago Sun.,external The parents requested privacy and expressed solidarity with the victims through a lawyer's statement. ""We are all mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and this is a terrible tragedy for many families, the victims, the parade-goers, the community, and our own,"" it said. In April 2019, police were called to the suspect's home one week after he reportedly attempted to take his own life. And in September 2019, police were called by a family member who said he had made violent threats to ""kill everyone"". Police responded and seized 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from his home. He was not arrested and no further action was taken. Officials on Tuesday called for an education campaign to raise awareness of the state's red flag laws, which allow a judge to order that a person deemed dangerous have their weapons seized and be barred from buying more guns. The suspect is expected to appear in court on Wednesday. Six of the victims have been named so far. They include: Irina McCarthy, 35, and Kevin McCarthy, 37, died while protecting their two-year old son, who was uninjured Nicolas Toledo, 78, was visiting family when the Mexican father of eight was shot in his wheelchair Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63, worked at a local synagogue in Highland Park, which has a large Jewish population Stephen Straus, 88, was a financial advisor and father of two. His niece called him ""an honourable man"" who ""worked his whole life"" Katherine Goldstein, 64, had taken her daughter to Highland Park so she could reunite with school friends,the New York Times reported.,external By Nomia Iqbal in Highland Park, Illinois People are in a state of shock here. Some who attended the parade have returned to pick up their belongings. A few stand in silence as they survey the remnants and try to remember where they were sat or standing when the horror unfolded. One woman who managed to escape said she is getting help from community counsellors to process what has happened. The man accused of bringing terror to this town has now been charged with seven counts of murder - and there could be more to come. Applause and cheers rang out as the state attorney read out the charges at a news conference. But questions remain. It has been revealed that several years ago the suspect threatened to kill people and had a knife collection seized by police. People here now want to know why he was able to legally purchase several firearms last year.

"An employee earning Â£20,000 a year will pay Â£178 less National Insurance in 2022-23 than they did the previous tax year More than two million low-income workers will no longer pay National Insurance from now, owing to a change in the way the tax is collected. Employees can now earn Â£12,570 a year before paying National Insurance, up from Â£9,880 a year previously. Although, in April, the government increased the rate paid - to raise money to fund health and social care. Taken together, these changes mean workers earning less than about Â£34,000 a year will pay less. Analysts said the latest change, which takes effect in pay packets from Wednesday, marks another turn in the ""swings and roundabouts"" of National Insurance policy. While helping individuals manage the rising cost of living, any savings could quickly be cancelled out by increasing prices and bills, they said. Employees across the UK pay National Insurance on their wages, employers pay extra contributions for staff, and the self-employed pay it on their profits. The first alteration to payments came in April, when employees, businesses and the self-employed started paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. It meant that, instead of paying National Insurance contributions of 12% on earnings up to Â£50,270 and 2% on anything above that, employees now pay 13.25% and 3.25% respectively. The self-employed have seen their equivalent rates go up from 9% and 2%, to 10.25% and 3.25%. What will April's tax changes cost me? Ministers said the money raised was earmarked for health and social care in England, and would be available to the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to spend in the same way. The move met with disapproval from opposition parties and some backbench Conservative MPs as it coincided with price rises, and increases in energy bills. Rishi Sunak, when chancellor, responded by raising the earnings threshold at which National Insurance starts to be paid by employees to Â£12,570 - a policy that has now taken effect. The government said that 2.2 million workers would be taken out of paying National Insurance contributions completely, and would still receive credits towards their future state pension. Seven in 10 employees would be better off as a result of the changes, it said. For example, an employee on Â£20,000 a year will pay Â£178 less National Insurance in 2022-23 than they did the previous year, while someone on Â£50,000 will pay Â£197 more. The final change comes in April 2023, when National Insurance rates return to their previous level. The extra 1.25% charge will be collected as the new Health and Social Care Levy and, unlike National Insurance, will also be paid by state pensioners. Many employers now find themselves paying more in National Insurance Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at investment platform Bestinvest, said the savings for some people ""could be the difference between having dinner every night and sometimes going without"". ""For others, however, that amount will barely make a dent in their budgets as they struggle to pay the household bills amid rampant inflation as soaring food, fuel and energy prices become the norm,"" she added. Many employers are paying more in National Insurance, and business groups say that may affect their capacity to pay higher wages. ""Higher employer National Insurance contribution rates still mean less money in the economy for pay rises, let alone sustainable investment, recruitment and discretionary spending,"" said Tina McKenzie, from the Federation of Small Businesses. Overall, the increases in National Insurance for employers and higher-income workers will raise an extra Â£10.9bn in a year for the government, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Steven Cameron, director at pensions company Aegon, said that ministers had been ""playing swings and roundabouts"" with income tax and National Insurance. That was because the income tax threshold, known as the personal allowance, was frozen in the April 2021 Budget until 2026. The earnings level at which the higher rate of tax is paid has also been frozen. The result is that some people receiving pay rises are being drawn into a higher income tax bracket.

"Most Lloyds Bank customers have less than Â£500 of savings in their accounts, its chief executive said. Charlie Nunn said Lloyds had seen customers seeking debt advice jump up by a third in just the first six months of this year. Credit card spending on travel was up 300% on last year, but the majority of Lloyd's customers were worried about the cost of living, he said. It was possible for the UK to avoid the recession many are predicting, he said. It comes as UK households struggle with the soaring cost of food, energy bills and fuel asinflation rises at the fastest rate in 40 years. The head of the UK's biggest high street bank told the BBC: ""80% of individuals and UK customers and families have less than Â£500 pounds worth of savings in their current account and their savings account. ""They might have money elsewhere. But what we can see is less than Â£500. So it's a very important starting point for looking at financial resilience."" But he said half of these customers had increased their balances in the last few years and were in a healthier position than they were before the Covid pandemic. He said credit card spending was up - the fastest in 17 years according to most recent figures - with travel being the biggest driver. ""Travel which is a particularly big part of credit card spending has bounced back up almost 300% year on year, coming from Covid and the constraints around travel back to where people are now,"" he said. But he said 75% of Lloyd's 26m customers were worried about the cost of living. And 20% of them were cutting discretionary spending to afford essentials. ""Customers are concerned - and they should be. We've seen some areas where there's real points of challenge,"" he said. Although there was a sharp increase in people with problem debts, only 1% of customers were unable to pay their day to day bills, he said. Lloyds Bank chief executive Charlie Nunn said he thought the UK could avoid a recession Mr Nunn said he was concerned the UK was talking itself into a recession. ""We are concerned that I think we collectively are talking ourselves into the risk of too negative an outlook. There are pockets of strength in the economy. ""There are significant parts of the consumers in the UK who have strength and really want to spend and create that demand and we can continue to see opportunities to invest in growth. ""But yes, sentiment is challenging."" Lloyds Banking Group is the biggest lender to households and small business in the UK and it is often seen as a bellwether for the entire UK economy. So its chief executive has an important and influential perspective on household and business prospects. Mr Nunn predicted the economy and house prices would both be roughly flat for the rest of the year but predicted interest rates would rise to around 2% in the next year from the current 1.25%. This is much lower than the 3.5% others are predicting as high energy prices do a similar job as rising interest rates in forcing people to spend less, dampening inflationary pressure. ""We're saying no, we're saying we can see that it's going to be a difficult few quarters flat growth,"" he said. ""It could be plus or minus a bit but it will be flat growth in the next few quarters and really what we're focused on is making sure we're providing support to those customers who are going to struggle to make ends meet and the businesses as well because there are some sectors and some businesses that also have that stress."" Lloyds staff to get Â£1,000 cost of living payment Lloyds also employs over 65,000 people. The Bank of England governor has urged employers, workers and unions to exercise restraint when asking and offering pay rise to prevent an inflationary wage spiral. A call that drew fury from unions. Some employers like Lloyds have tried an interesting approach. Lloyds gave 99% of its workers a 3.6% pay rise plus a one-off autumn lump sum of at least Â£1,000. A more generous package at Rolls Royce - a 4% pay rise plus Â£2,000 lump sum - was rejected by unions as essentially being a below-inflation pay rise in disguise. Mr Nunn said: ""We very much want to support making sure that we don't build in inflation in a way that isn't needed. It felt like the right thing for this year. And it was the appropriate action in the context of this unprecedented inflation spike."" He said the bank would consider doing the same next year depending on the inflation picture. As a major lender to businesses big and small, Lloyds is exposed to the risk of firms going bust as their input costs soar at the same time as their customers incomes dwindle. But Mr Nunn said he was not preparing for a wave of companies unable to pay their debts. ""We don't see a significant increase in bad loan charges, that's not the scenario we have. We are seeing low growth, higher inflation and we're seeing slight increase in but stable unemployment. And that's how we think about the next four, six quarters.""

"A man accused of opening fire on a Fourth of July parade near Chicago has been charged with seven counts of murder, officials say. The 21-year-old would be punished ""for the killing spree he has unleashed against our community"", Lake County State Attorney Eric Rinehart said. The attack in Highland Park left seven dead and more than 30 others injured. Mr Rinehart added that dozens more charges would be filed before the investigation was over. ""These are just the first of many charges that will be filed,"" he said to cheers and applause from the crowd gathered for the news conference on Tuesday. ""I want to emphasise that. There will be more charges."" If convicted, the seven murder counts alone would carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole, Mr Rinehart said. The suspect, Robert Crimo, is accused of firing 70 bullets from a high-powered rifle down on to the crowd and disguising himself as a woman so he could escape alongside fleeing victims. The suspect disguised himself as a woman to escape alongside fleeing onlookers, police say After an eight-hour manhunt on Monday, police arrested the gunman and he was discovered with a second rifle similar to the one used in the attack. Three other firearms were also found at his home. Police said the suspect had two prior contacts with law enforcement but was still able to purchase five guns in the past year. Illinois state police said that the suspect's father sponsored his application for a firearm licence in December 2019, when he was just 19. But his uncle denied this in astatement to the Chicago Sun.,external The parents requested privacy and expressed solidarity with the victims through a lawyer's statement. ""We are all mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and this is a terrible tragedy for many families, the victims, the parade-goers, the community, and our own,"" it said. In April 2019, police were called to the suspect's home one week after he reportedly attempted to take his own life. And in September 2019, police were called by a family member who said he had made violent threats to ""kill everyone"". Police responded and seized 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from his home. He was not arrested and no further action was taken. Officials on Tuesday called for an education campaign to raise awareness of the state's red flag laws, which allow a judge to order that a person deemed dangerous have their weapons seized and be barred from buying more guns. The suspect is expected to appear in court on Wednesday. Six of the victims have been named so far. They include: Irina McCarthy, 35, and Kevin McCarthy, 37, died while protecting their two-year old son, who was uninjured Nicolas Toledo, 78, was visiting family when the Mexican father of eight was shot in his wheelchair Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63, worked at a local synagogue in Highland Park, which has a large Jewish population Stephen Straus, 88, was a financial advisor and father of two. His niece called him ""an honourable man"" who ""worked his whole life"" Katherine Goldstein, 64, had taken her daughter to Highland Park so she could reunite with school friends,the New York Times reported.,external By Nomia Iqbal in Highland Park, Illinois People are in a state of shock here. Some who attended the parade have returned to pick up their belongings. A few stand in silence as they survey the remnants and try to remember where they were sat or standing when the horror unfolded. One woman who managed to escape said she is getting help from community counsellors to process what has happened. The man accused of bringing terror to this town has now been charged with seven counts of murder - and there could be more to come. Applause and cheers rang out as the state attorney read out the charges at a news conference. But questions remain. It has been revealed that several years ago the suspect threatened to kill people and had a knife collection seized by police. People here now want to know why he was able to legally purchase several firearms last year.

"This video can not be played British Triathlon creates 'open' category for transgender athletes Triathlon has become the first British sport to establish a new 'open' category in which transgender athletes will compete. The British Triathlon Federation confirmed that for athletes over the age of 12, competitive women's events will be reserved ""for those who are female sex at birth"". The policy, which will begin from January, will see an 'open' category ""for all individuals including male, [male and female] transgender and those non-binary who were male sex at birth."" It will apply to all events where there are prizes, times or rankings at stake, including at the grassroots level of the sport. Triathlon is an increasingly popular multi-disciplinary participation sport in the UK comprising running, swimming and cycling. ""Where this is competitive activity, fairness is paramount,"" said Andy Salmon, chief executive of British Triathlon. ""Our sport is gender-affected. ""We believe this is the right policy for triathlon in Great Britain, and the right time to publish it. We have taken legal advice and are confident it's legally robust."" British Triathlon said the new approach followed a survey of more than 3,000 members that found 80% were in support of the two categories. The new policy replaces the existing guidelines set in 2018, which allow trans women to compete against female athletes if they have suppressed their testosterone. Salmon said he was ""not aware"" of any elite-level transgender triathletes in Britain - but he added: ""We didn't want to be a governing body that waited for that to be a problem before we tried to fix it. ""We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day, and we wanted to be ready for that day."" Listen to The Sports Desk podcast: Sport's transgender conundrum Trans athletes no threat to women's sport - Thomas Newsnight report - should trans athletes compete in female categories? Q&A: Transgender women in sport - key questions answered Last week Culture SecretaryNadine Dorries- following similar sentiment from UK Prime MinisterBoris Johnson- told the heads of UK sporting bodies that ""elite and competitive women's sport must be reserved for people born of the female sex"". However Salmon said its new policy was ""free from political pressure"" and pre-dated Dorries' comments. A number of British sports bodies are reviewing their transgender eligibility policies. British Triathlon's new approach also comes just weeks after Fina, swimming's world governing body,voted to stop transgender athletesfrom competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty. It is also aiming to establish an 'open' category at competitions, for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex. Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, welcomed Fina's decision. However, Britain's Olympic diving championTom Daleysaid he was ""furious"" about the new policy. World Athletics president Lord Coehas hintedhis sport will adopt a similar approach later this year. And the UCI, cycling's governing body, has updated its transgender guidelinesto double the period of timebefore a rider transitioning from male to female can compete in women's races. Neither British Swimming nor British Cycling have announced any subsequent changes to their policies in line with their international governing bodies. British Triathlon said in a statement: ""Our policy outlines that triathlon is a sport for everyone and that transphobic behaviour will not be tolerated. Allow Twitter content?

We are also a sport made up of three distinct disciplines, each of which have a long history with clear differentials between the performances achieved between males and females. ""We'll now take time to develop guidance for event organisers, clubs, officials and coaches, to share this autumn, before the policy comes into effect from 1 January 2023. ""British Triathlon wants to make clear that it does not tolerate transphobic behaviour, harassment, bullying or hate speech of any kind.

Chris Mosier, a triathlete who became the first transgender athlete to represent the United States in international competition,wrote on Twitter,external: ""British Triathlon's move to ban trans women doesn't address any real issue; it's discrimination plain and simple.

"Boris Johnson is battling to stay in office, amid a growing wave of resignations from his government in protest at his leadership. New chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has urged unity after his predecessor, the health secretary, and several junior ministers walked out. But the prime minister has been hit by six further resignations, taking the total to 16 in the past day. It comes as he prepares for PMQs later and a grilling by senior MPs. Mr Johnson's premiership has been plunged into crisis following the dramatic resignations of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. They quit within minutes of each other on Tuesday following a row over Mr Johnson's decision to appoint Chris Pincher deputy chief whip earlier this year. Their departures triggered a wave of resignations from more junior roles that has continued on Wednesday. In six further departures ahead of PMQs, education ministers Will Quince and Robin Walker, Justice Minister Victoria Atkins, Treasury minister John Glen, and ministerial aides Laura Trott and Felicity Buchan have all walked out. Follow live updates Sunak and Javid resignation letters in full Who has quit, who is staying? Mr Johnson has admitted it was a ""bad mistake"" to appoint Mr Pincher, despite being aware of misconduct allegations against him. It followed days of changing responses from No 10 over what exactly the PM knew about Mr Pincher's past conduct when he gave him the job. Mr Quince, who was sent out to defend the PM in media interviews two days ago, said Downing Street had given him ""inaccurate"" information. In a resignation letter, he added he had ""no choice"" to resign - adding that he had repeated No 10's assurances ""in good faith"". The row over Mr Pincher's appointment comes after the PM's relations with his backbenchers have been damaged by the Partygate scandal and unhappiness over tax rises. He survived a no-confidence vote among Tory MPs last month, meaning under current party rules he is immune from another challenge for a year. Several key cabinet ministers, including foreign secretary and potential leadership challenger Liz Truss, have rallied round the prime minister. However, rebel Tories want to use an upcoming vote to the backbench 1922 committee to scrap the year-long gap between contests, making it possible he could face another challenge later this summer. Boris Johnson is braced for more resignations, perhaps not from the cabinet but the next rung down the ministerial ladder. For a little while, after two cabinet resignations, Westminster wondered what might happen next - and so did the PM. Not in control of events, he was ringing around the rest of his cabinet to work out if they were still with him. They were, and the moment of greatest jeopardy for him has passed - for now at least. A smattering of more junior resignations did follow, but there's a defiance from his team; they point out their mandate from the electorate at the last election, in contrast with the anger and anguish among many Conservative MPs. You can read more analysis by Chris Mason here Mr Zahawi, who becomes the fourth chancellor in three years, was appointed alongside the prime minister's chief of staff, Steve Barclay, who became health secretary. A No 10 source said the new chancellor was ""more dynamic and more aligned"" with Mr Johnson, and described the new health secretary as a ""massive upgrade"". Mr Javid had warned the leadership was not ""acting in the national interest"", while Mr Sunak said the public expected government to be conducted ""properly, competently and seriously"". Mr Sunakalso referenced tensions over the economy in his resignation letter,telling the PM their approaches had become ""fundamentally too different"". Mr Javid, who has now resigned from Mr Johnson's cabinet for the second time, will make a resignation statement to Parliament later. The departures triggered a wave of resignations, including Solicitor General Alex Chalk, five ministerial aides, two trade envoys, and Bim Afolami as vice-chair of the Tory party. Ashfield MP Lee Anderson, a previously loyal supporter of Mr Johnson, also withdrew his support, saying in a Facebook post he could not ""look myself in the mirror"" and accept the PM's handling of Chris Pincher's appointment. If party bosses change the one-year rule on leadership challenges, rebel Tory MPs could try again to oust him later this summer, or in the autumn If Mr Johnson lost a vote of no confidence in Parliament, he would have to resign or call an election Otherwise, he would have to resign himself - possibly in the face of cabinet pressure, like Margaret Thatcher - or after a fresh wave of ministerial resignations Read more This video can not be played Watch: Johnson on appointing Pincher: I apologise for it Pressure on the prime minister was also elevated last month by the loss of by-elections inTiverton and HonitonandWakefieldand the resignation of Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen told the BBC the prime minister should resign and if he does not do so ""the party will have to force him out"". ""The 1922 committee will deal with this turbulent prime minister, it's what it was created for,"" he said. Bob Blackman, a member of the 1922 executive committee, said elections to replace the executive team - an event rebel Tories want to use to force a leadership rule change - will take place before Parliament's summer recess two weeks' time. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir said he would welcome a snap election and the country needed a change of government. He said: ""After all the sleaze, all the failure, it's clear that this Tory government is now collapsing."" The next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson used his powers to call one. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey told the BBC that Conservatives must do their ""patriotic duty"" and ""get rid of Boris Johnson today"". Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""the whole rotten lot"" in Mr Johnson's government should go, accusing ministers of ""lying to the public"".

"The Range said it would stop selling the items highlighted by digital creator Emma Conway The Range has discontinued weight-loss countdown coin savers in the shape of a bikini and a wedding dress, after complaints over sexist body shaming. The wall plaques include slots to stash Â£1 for every pound of weight lost - up to 40lb (18kg) on the bridal version. Emma Conway saw the items and asked if there were any for men. There were not. She said: ""I left the shop shaking. In 2022 a large chain is feeding into the narrative that women need to be smaller, to drop a dress size."" The Plymouth-based retailer told the BBC it had not set out to offend customers and would not be stocking either product again. Ms Conway, a digital creator, known on social media as Brummie Mummy of 2, told her 147,000 Instagram followers she did not have an issue with people wanting to lose weight for a variety of reasons. ""But I asked if there was one for men. Maybe a 'Lose Chunks To Fit In Your Trunks.' There wasn't,""she posted.,external ""It was just for women. To get a bikini body. And to fit in a smaller wedding dress...To put a sign in their houses which they would look at each day,"" she said. ""To help them get ready to go to the beach. The motivation is not to get fit and healthy. But to shrink themselves. Remember ladies we need to be tiny."" She added: ""Anyone reading this, remember how to get a bikini body is toâ¦buy a bikini.

The Range told the BBC in a statement: ""We appreciate that every 'body' is 'bikini ready' all the time, but some of our customers have found this a fun way to help them reach a goal. This product has, however, now been discontinued and we will not be stocking it again."" Brummie Mummy of 2's post attracted more than 10,000 likes and hundreds of replies. Among them was author, writer and podcast host, Alison Perry who wrote: ""This makes me so angry!"" ""The Range this might seem harmless to you but it's really not!"" she added. ""You're perpetuating the belief that women have to fit into a narrow beauty ideal to be acceptable. It's dangerous. ""Walking past this in one of your shops could trigger someone and set them off down a path of dieting or disordered eating. Not ok."" Instagram user pushingapianoupahilloftreacle wrote: ""I saw these the other day I could not believe it! Utterly amazed that they are allowed to sell this trash! I will be happily wearing my lovely size 18 bikinis this year with pride!"" There were also replies from women who said they did not have a problem with the idea of the wall plaques as motivational tools. But said they would prefer them to be gender neutral and not tied to events like a holiday or wedding. The Range had advertised its pink spotty bikini wall plaque on its website as ""a fun and unique way to save money and get fit"" and suggested ""you can treat yourself with the cash when you reach your target."" A similar plaque in the shape of a wedding dress had the words ""weight loss journey"" at the top. The Range's website said: ""Save up the pounds as you slim down to your goal weight for the big day with this Dress Size Pound Countdown Plaque. ""Shaped like a wedding dress with 40 coin-shaped slots, you can place a pound in each one as you lose weight for your special occasion, meaning more money spending money for your honeymoon!"" This is not the first time The Range's weight loss countdowns have attracted criticism. In October, The Independent reported that eating disorder charities said the items ""glamorised weight loss"".,external And in 2019, The Sun reported that they ""made women feel unworthy"".,external When the BBC put Ms Conway's comments to The Range it said: ""Occasionally we do inadvertently offend customers, although this is not something we ever set out to do.""

"This video can not be played Mariano Janin is fighting for access to his daughter's social media A father whose 14-year-old daughter killed herself is calling for parents to be able to access their children's social media after they die. Mariano Janin believes his daughter Mia saw bullying messages on her phone the night before her death in March 2021. He wants parents to be able to access any messages or videos a child may have seen on social media before they died. Bereaved parents have struggled to gain access to their child's social media account without a court order. Some charities have called for legislation to compel social media companies to hand over data linked to cases where children take their own lives. In anopen letter,external, 37 charities called for a clause to be added to theOnline Safety Bill,externalcurrently going through Parliament. Mariano Janin said his daughter Mia loved drama, and her hobbies included art and cheerleading Mr Janin said he knew Mia had experienced bullying at school. He worries a video or message may have tipped her over the edge, yet he does not know what she saw. The night before she died, Mia reportedly asked her parents if she could move school. An investigation found she had sent a voice message to a friend ahead of the first day back, in which she said she was ""mentally preparing herself to get bullied"". Her phone was handed to the police in the wake of her death but has remained locked. ""I just need to have closure to find out what happened. We need to do what we can to avoid this happening again,"" said Mr Janin. ""Every day now feels like I'm in slow motion,"" says Mr Janin, who lived with his wife, Marisa, Mia and their dog, Lola, in Childs Hill, north London. Several months after Mia took her own life, Marisa died from an aggressive form of sudden-onset cancer. ""When it happens, you don't see the future, you can't see your past; it's been a painful and slow-motion process. As as a parent you're not supposed to bury your kids,"" he said. The year 10 pupil was described by her father as funny and positive Mia was the third pupil at the Jewish Free School in north London to have taken their life since 2017. Head teacher David Moody, who was not in post at the time of Mia's death, said: ""Like the family, the school is waiting for the findings of the external investigations to be published and we hope that the publication will be as soon as possible."" He added that Ofsted inspectors were ""pleased with the sustained changes"" enacted by both governors and the new leadership team. Thirty-seven charities including the NSPCC, Barnardo's, Save the Children and 5Rights have joined together to make a plea for bereaved families to be given access to data if it leads to serious harm or plays a part in a young person's death. Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer and chair of the 5Rights Foundation, is calling for social media firms to be required by law to hand over data in such cases. ""The first thing to say is this case is one parent of many,"" Baroness Kidron said. ""I speak to a lot of parents whose children have taken their own lives. ""They try to access the material online and they face a block. That block goes on for years. There is no higher authority to appeal the sort of things tech companies tell them and it is absolutely inhuman.

"Nadhim Zahawi has been sacked as Conservative Party chairman for ""serious breaches"" of the ministerial code after it emerged he paid a penalty to HMRC over unpaid tax. Believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, Mr Zahawi made his fortune after co-founding the online polling company YouGov. The venture was a great success - but questions over the sale of shares in the company and whether this was taxed correctly prompted scrutiny of Mr Zahawi's financial affairs. Mr Zahawi said he was confident he had ""acted properly"", but an inquiry by the prime minister's independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus was highly critical. Key questions about Zahawi's tax affairs PM orders investigation into Zahawi tax row Before the issue hit the headlines, the 55-year-old was often relied upon as a solid media performer for the government and has held a number of high-profile roles, including vaccines minister and education secretary, as well as chancellor. Despite his rapid rise in politics, leading one of the great offices of state might have been unthinkable for Mr Zahawi as a child. ""I must be one of the luckiest human beings on earth,"" the Stratford-upon-Avon MP said reflecting on his early years. Born in Iraq in 1967 he could easily have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War. ""I would have been drafted in to the Iraqi army, had to go to front line and probably die,"" hetold Nick Robinson on the Political Thinking podcastlast year. Instead, he and his parents were forced to flee Iraq and he grew up in Britain. His family had been influential in the country - his grandfather was the governor of the Central Bank of Iraq and his signature appeared on the country's banknotes. However, when Saddam Hussein came to power in the late 1970s, they came under threat. Mr Zahawi's father, a businessman, got a tip-off that the authorities were coming for him and quickly arranged to fly out. His son has recalled the anxiety of watching the plane preparing to take off from Baghdad Airport. After all the passengers had boarded, a military vehicle drove up to the plane. His mother was in tears as they saw a passenger being removed. The passenger turned out not to be his father, but the man who had been sitting behind him on the aircraft. Mr Zahawi described it as a ""traumatic"" childhood moment ""stamped on his memory"". So instead of growing up in Iraq, Mr Zahawi grew up in Sussex. He was educated at private and comprehensive schools and became a keen equestrian. The children's TV show Teletubbies provided the young Nadhim Zahawi with one of his early business ventures But, as he was heading to university another disaster struck the family. A business venture of his father's fell through, and he, in Mr Zahawi's words, ""lost everything"" except a brown Vauxhall car. The young Nadhim Zahawi decided he would use the Vauxhall to become a minicab driver in order to help put food on the table. However, his mother insisted on her son going to university and pawned her jewellery so he wouldn't have to worry about the finances. After studying chemical engineering at University College London, he followed in his father's entrepreneurial footsteps and set up a firm selling Teletubbies merchandise - a company which attracted investment from the then-Conservative politician Jeffrey Archer. Speaking to the BBC's Profile programme,Lord Archer remembered the young Nadhim Zahawi as ""a born organiser"". ""If you said, 'I need six taxis, three aeroplanes and a double decker bus, all in 30 minutes', he went and did it,"" he said. Jeffrey Archer introduced Mr Zahawi to key Conservative figures Through Lord Archer's parties, Mr Zahawi met influential Conservative figures including the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In 1994 he became a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, south London and three years later unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in Erith and Thamesmead. When Lord Archer launched his campaign to become London mayor, Mr Zahawi joined his team. But the candidate was forced to pull out of the race, and Mr Zahawi had to look for alternative work. In 2000 he founded YouGov, along with another ex-member of team Archer - Stephan Shakespeare. Ten years later, after it had become a hugely successful global company, Mr Zahawi stood down from YouGov to run for Parliament. In 2010 he was successful, winning the safe Conservative seat of Stratford-Upon-Avon. The Warwickshire constituency of Stratford-Upon-Avon has been held by the Conservatives for over 100 years Parliament was still reeling from the MPs expenses scandal, and Mr Zahawi soon becameembroiled in his own transgressionwhen it emerged he had claimed expenses to supply his stables with electricity. He said he was ""mortified by this mistake"" and paid back the money. It didn't hinder his political progress too much and in January 2018 then-PM Theresa May made him an education minister. However, Mr Zahawi again found himself in trouble, this time for attending a gala held by the men-only Presidents Club. Anundercover reporter for the Financial Times had revealed,externalthe hostesses had been subjected to groping and lewd comments. Mr Zahawi said the event made him ""extremely uncomfortable"" and he left early. Nevertheless, his attendance at the event earned him a reprimand from Downing Street. Mr Zahawi remained a minister when Boris Johnson came to power in July 2019, moving from the education to the business department. Then in November 2020, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, he was handed what he has called ""the most important job I'll ever do"" - the position of vaccines minister. For almost 11 months he oversaw the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme, and was able to boast a fair amount of success, especially when the UK raced ahead of many other countries. Seen as a ""safe pair of hands"", he came to the education secretary role following the sacking of Gavin Williamson, who was unpopular with the public after the exams fiasco during the pandemic. As the country's new man in charge of education he faced the unprecedented challenge of ensuring a whole generation of children caught up after having missed months of school as a result of the pandemic. When Rishi Sunak dramatically quit as chancellor in July 2022, Mr Zahawi was given the role - one of the most important positions in the government. Mr Zahawi had been loyal to Mr Johnson, frequently defending him in media interviews. However, after days of turmoil and mass ministerial resignations, he called on Mr Johnson to leave. A few hours later Mr Johnson had announced his resignation. Liz Truss replaced him as prime minister and made Mr Zahawi minister for equalities and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He wasn't in the job for long. When Rishi Sunak took over as PM in October he moved Mr Zahawi to Conservative Party chairman and minister without portfolio, attending cabinet as part of his role. Media reports about his tax affairs first emerged when he was appointed chancellor last July. But further revelations this month piled pressure on Mr Zahawi. Now, after Mr Sunak asked his independent ethics adviser to investigate, he is no longer party chairman.

"Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston had called for the local community to show support for the pensioner A mayor has defended launching a fundraising page to cover the fine of a man who threatened a child. Bernard John Higgins, from Hemlington, was convicted at Teesside Magistrates' Court after confronting a boy allegedly responsible for causing trouble on the 65-year-old's estate. Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston asked people to donate Â£1 each towards the Â£107 Mr Higgins was ordered to pay. He said it had been ""wrong"" for the pensioner to be prosecuted. Mr Higgins, who is known as John, was last week given a 12-month conditional discharge after pleading guilty to usingthreatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour,externalto cause harassment, alarm or distress. Cleveland Police said the incident saw him ""seeking out and making threats towards a child under 10, including explicit threats of violence"". But Mr Preston said he had met Mr Higgins and understood he had been assaulted twice by yobs as well as having his fence torn down. He described Mr Higgins as verbally fighting back against troublemakers who had made his life a misery and said the fundraising was an opportunity ""to send a message... that we won't stand for victims being punished for standing up to yobs"". He toldBBC Radio Tees: ""I wanted to give the public the opportunity to show support. He lost his temper and was arrested after a campaign of abuse, harassment and torment by a group of kids who think it is OK to set fire to things, to abuse and bully. ""To see this go to court when so little real crime is followed up by authorities feels wrong."" Mr Preston denied he was undermining the legal system and said people ""should all follow and respect the law"". However, he added: ""Of course we know sometimes the law gets it completely wrong and what we need to do is show support. ""What I'm deliberately not saying is that it's OK to go out and seek revenge. What John did, he shouldn't have done, but he's at the end of his tether."" Mr Preston said he had visited Mr Higgins and his ""terrified neighbours"" a number of times in recent weeks and described the trouble they had faced as being ""out of control"". While the appeal had initially been intended to cover Mr Higgins' court costs, any money raised will instead be used to pay for a ""small tea party"" at a nearby community centre as the Â£107 fine is now being covered by a group of independent Middlesbrough councillors. The total raised currently stands at more than Â£500. Police added they were ""making positive progress to tackle antisocial behaviour"" in Hemlington, having made almost 120 arrests as part of a recent crackdown.

(Football League World,external) Want more transfer news from the EFL? Take a look at Wednesday's gossip here. Mark DruryBBC Radio Tees commentator George Edmundson has made 19 Championship starts in the heart of the Boro defence With half of January gone many Middlesbrough fans are looking for the club to kick-start a recruitment drive. Boro's flat performance in losing at home toBlackburn Roversin the FA Cup on Saturday has added to a sense of drift that has been developing in recent weeks. Middlesbrough are unbeaten in their last six Championship games, but four of those have been draws. Two came against struggling sides Boro would expect to beat in Plymouth Argyle and Cardiff City, while the 3-3 draw against Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day saw Michael Carrick's side surrender a 3-0 half-time lead. Boro want to do business this month and have a decision to make over Emmanuel Latte Lath who isthe subject of an offer from MLS side Atlanta Unitedwhich could total Â£20 million all told. Boro know there is Premier League interest in the striker but how long are they prepared to wait for offers to materialise? For Latte Lath's part, a move to the Premier League would be hard to turn down. Isaiah Jones joined fellow Championship side Luton Town last Friday and Liverpool loanee Ben Doak remains on Teesside despite offers for his services from Ipswich Town and Crystal Palace. Boro remain confident Doak is happy and wants to stay but have contingency plans in place. Boro's interest in Hull City defender Ryan Giles is part of a drive to reinvigorate the left-hand side of their attack. Michael Carrick is a big fan of the full-back who helped himself to 12 assists in Boro's play-off season two years ago. A deal has yet to be done though despite talks having taken place with the Tigers. They also want to sign George Edmundson to a permanent deal. The central defender has been a big hit at The Riverside in the first-half of his season-long loan deal. He's out of contract at Ipswich in the summer but the Tractor Boys are yet to give the green light to his move. In many ways the situation is the same as it was at the start of the month. If Latte Lath leaves, then expect Boro to reinvest that money around the rest of the squad. If he stays, business will be quieter. Whichever way things go in the next fortnight, Boro fans need to see some spark return to their play before the huge meeting with derby rivals Sunderland on 3 February. Middlesbroughhave renewed their interest in Hull City left-back Ryan Giles and want to sign the 24-year-old in January.(HullLive),external Want more transfer news from the EFL?

"The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and the Secretary of State for Health, Sajid Javid, have resigned from Boris Johnson's government. Here are their letters of resignation. Prime Minister, It was a privilege to have been asked to come back into Government to serve as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care at such a critical time for our country. I have given every ounce of energy to this task, and am incredibly proud of what we have achieved. The UK has led the world in learning to live with Covid. Thanks to the amazing rollout of our booster programme, investment in treatments, and innovations in the way we deliver healthcare, the British people have enjoyed months more freedom than other comparable countries. We have also made important strides in the recovery and reform of the NHS and adult social care. The longest waiters are down by 70% and, as you know, I have been working hard on wider modernisation of the NHS. I have also developed radical new approaches to dementia, cancer and mental health, and prepared the Health Disparities White Paper which will set out plans to level up health outcomes for communities that have been left behind for too long. Given the unprecedented scale of the challenges in health and social care, it has been my instinct to continue focusing on this important work. So it is with enormous regret that I must tell you that I can no longer, in good conscience, continue serving in this Government, I am instinctively a team player but the British people also rightly expect integrity from their Government. The tone you set as leader, and the values you represent, reflect on your colleagues, your party, and ultimately the country. Conservatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision-makers, guided by strong values. We may not always have been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest. Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are neither. The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction. I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership - and you have therefore lost my confidence too. It is three years since you entered Downing Street. You will forever be credited with seeing off the threat of Corbynism, and breaking the deadlock on Brexit. You have shone a very welcome light on the regional disparities on our country, an agenda that will continue to define our politics. These are commendable legacies in unprecedented times. But the country needs a strong and principled Conservative Party, and the Party is bigger than any one individual. I served you loyally and as a friend, but we all serve the country first. When made to choose between those loyalties there can only be one answer. Finally, I would like to put on record my thanks to ministerial and departmental colleagues, my admiration for NHS and social care staff, and my love for my family who have been immensely patient in these challenging times. Yours ever, S Javid Dear Prime Minister, It is with deep sadness that I am writing to you to resign from the Government. It has been an enormous privilege to serve our country as Chancellor of the Exchequer and I will always be proud of how during the pandemic we protected people's jobs and businesses through actions such as furlough. To leave ministerial office is a serious matter at any time. For me to step down as Chancellor while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other serious challenges is a decision that I have not taken lightly. However, the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously. I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning. I have been loyal to you. I backed you to become Leader of our Party and encouraged others to do so. I have served as your Chancellor with gratitude that you entrusted me with stewardship of the nation's economy and finances. Above all, I have respected the powerful mandate given to you by the British people in 2019 and how under your leadership we broke the Brexit deadlock. That is why I have always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagreed with you privately, I have supported you publicly. That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies and it is particularly important that the Prime Minister and Chancellor remain united in hard times such as those we are experiencing today. Our country is facing immense challenges. We both want a low-tax, high-growth economy, and world class public services, but this can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions. I firmly believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Our people know that if something is too good to be true then it's not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one. In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different. I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this. Kind regards, Rishi Sunak Dear Saj, Thank you for your letter this evening tendering your resignation. I was very sorry to receive it. You have served this Government, and the people of the United Kingdom, with distinction. Most recently, you have led the Department of Health and Social Care as we learn to live with Covid, forging ahead with plans to beat the Covid backlogs, recruit 50,000 nurses, build 40 new hospitals, and reform social care. These are the issues that matter to the people of this country, and the Government will continue to deliver on them. You have held significant positions in Government for the past decade, and have served myself and former Prime Ministers admirably. You have used your personal experience to bring about change in government, from fixing the injustices of Windrush to setting out recently a plan to address suicide. You will be greatly missed, and I look forward to your contributions from the backbenches. Yours ever, Boris Dear Rishi, I was sorry to receive your letter resigning from the Government. You have provided outstanding service to the country through the most challenging period for our economy in peacetime history. In March 2020, weeks after your appointment as Chancellor, we introduced a national lockdown to protect people from the pandemic. You acted to safeguard the economy with the pace, creativity and commitment which has been the hallmark of your tenure. The furlough scheme - conceived and implemented in a matter of weeks - supported 11.7 million jobs from 1.3 million employers. Through business loans and grants, you helped thousands of businesses to avoid insolvency. Emergency funding worth more than Â£140 billion, enabled the NHS and other critical public services to meet the enormous challenges we faced. These efforts primed the economy for a rapid recovery once the immediate dangers of the pandemic receded. At the Spending Review last year, you put us on track to deliver our promises to the British people, including 20,000 police officers and 40 new hospitals. We also set a clear plan to rebuild our economy and public services, including an historic funding settlement for the NHS and delivering six million tutoring courses to help pupils catch up lost learning. Through all of this, you have not shied from the tough decisions needed to repair our public finances whilst protecting public services and boosting economic growth. This has enabled us to provide support to households worth Â£37 billion, as we have faced global inflation pressures arising from Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. And we have begun to deliver tax cuts to families - including this week, a cut to National Insurance saving the average worker Â£330 a year. I have enormously valued your advice and deep commitment to public service and will miss working with you in government.

"The key line in all the resignation letters released tonight is that the chancellor felt his approach to the economy was ""fundamentally too different"" to that of Boris Johnson. The context here was the PM's plan for a joint speech with the chancellor as the anchor of a plan to show the government taking control of the cost of living crisis. That speech was due next week. They could not agree its contents. In particular, the chancellor said the public is ""ready to hear the truth"" about the tough times ahead of us. This echoes some comments made by the former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King that the government needed to level with the public about the fact that the inflation energy crisis has made the nation poorer. The cost-of-living crisis means a series of incredibly difficult trade-offs for government to make in the coming months. Public sector pay review bodies have begun to report back. The Treasury believes it is irresponsible even to be talking about pay claims matching the 9% inflation rate. And yet, a 10% rise in pensions is pencilled in for next year. Government departments are facing rising costs to provide public services, but cash budgets are yet to be increased. Tax cuts are being promised, but only in two years' time, if borrowing is under control. Fuel prices reach new records, but where did the 5p Budget reduction go? Domestic energy prices are heading even higher than predicted at the time of the chancellor's last cost of living package. Rishi Sunak was a crisis chancellor. He spent his time expanding the state, spending and levels of taxation, against his instincts, to deal with the pandemic and Ukraine crisis. His signature policy - the furlough scheme - squarely succeeded in its primary aim, of preventing long-term unemployment from the pandemic lockdown. When announced, there was no guarantee it would even function technically. It has helped keep unemployment levels very low, the shining light in a now shaky set of British economic figures. Rishi Sunak, however, was keen to draw a line under that support, even as it had made him popular. He rolled back the pandemic increase in universal credit. The energy crisis was not a ""whatever it takes"" moment. At Number 10, their instincts were to borrow more, tax less and support households more. Sunak wished to increase productivity, empower tech businesses and raise living standards. Clearly, personal tensions also emerged. Some in Number 10 felt that Sunak backers had pushed too hard to oust the PM in January. Sunak's team felt the run of negative stories leaked about the chancellor's finances in the spring were an operation to kill his leadership chances. Without Mr Sunak, and with a new chancellor, the PM will find it easier to tax less, perhaps spend more and so borrow more. There is talk of cuts to VAT. Some backers of the PM think that all the cost-of-living support has gone largely unnoticed and the government somehow needs to find a way to physically stop the energy price cap from going up a further Â£1,000. But that comes against increasing market concern about the UK's growing trading deficit, a slump in sterling, and fears of recession. It is exactly the sort of time a government might rely on having an Iron Chancellor, who can rein in his, or her, crisis-afflicted neighbour. But this may not be the likely direction of travel in Downing Street. Javid's and Sunak's resignation letters in full Government resignations: Who resigned, who stayed?

"This video can not be played British Triathlon creates 'open' category for transgender athletes Triathlon has become the first British sport to establish a new 'open' category in which transgender athletes will compete. The British Triathlon Federation confirmed that for athletes over the age of 12, competitive women's events will be reserved ""for those who are female sex at birth"". The policy, which will begin from January, will see an 'open' category ""for all individuals including male, [male and female] transgender and those non-binary who were male sex at birth."" It will apply to all events where there are prizes, times or rankings at stake, including at the grassroots level of the sport. Triathlon is an increasingly popular multi-disciplinary participation sport in the UK comprising running, swimming and cycling. ""Where this is competitive activity, fairness is paramount,"" said Andy Salmon, chief executive of British Triathlon. ""Our sport is gender-affected. ""We believe this is the right policy for triathlon in Great Britain, and the right time to publish it. We have taken legal advice and are confident it's legally robust."" British Triathlon said the new approach followed a survey of more than 3,000 members that found 80% were in support of the two categories. The new policy replaces the existing guidelines set in 2018, which allow trans women to compete against female athletes if they have suppressed their testosterone. Salmon said he was ""not aware"" of any elite-level transgender triathletes in Britain - but he added: ""We didn't want to be a governing body that waited for that to be a problem before we tried to fix it. ""We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day, and we wanted to be ready for that day."" Listen to The Sports Desk podcast: Sport's transgender conundrum Trans athletes no threat to women's sport - Thomas Newsnight report - should trans athletes compete in female categories? Q&A: Transgender women in sport - key questions answered Last week Culture SecretaryNadine Dorries- following similar sentiment from UK Prime MinisterBoris Johnson- told the heads of UK sporting bodies that ""elite and competitive women's sport must be reserved for people born of the female sex"". However Salmon said its new policy was ""free from political pressure"" and pre-dated Dorries' comments. A number of British sports bodies are reviewing their transgender eligibility policies. British Triathlon's new approach also comes just weeks after Fina, swimming's world governing body,voted to stop transgender athletesfrom competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty. It is also aiming to establish an 'open' category at competitions, for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex. Former Great Britain swimmer Sharron Davies, who has argued against transgender participation in women's elite swimming, welcomed Fina's decision. However, Britain's Olympic diving championTom Daleysaid he was ""furious"" about the new policy. World Athletics president Lord Coehas hintedhis sport will adopt a similar approach later this year. And the UCI, cycling's governing body, has updated its transgender guidelinesto double the period of timebefore a rider transitioning from male to female can compete in women's races. Neither British Swimming nor British Cycling have announced any subsequent changes to their policies in line with their international governing bodies. British Triathlon said in a statement: ""Our policy outlines that triathlon is a sport for everyone and that transphobic behaviour will not be tolerated. Allow Twitter content?

"Gary Curley is working more hours, in multiple roles, to fill shortfalls in his staffing After surviving the Covid lockdowns, hospitality businesses are now being faced with a cost of living crisis, soaring inflation and staffing shortages. Gary Curley runs the Sligachan Hotel on Skye. In 2019 his business would have 45 to 50 staff at this time of the year, but it currently has just 33. He and his wife have to fill most of the gaps caused by staff shortages. ""My wife and I are pretty hands-on but this year we have been working in every department,"" he says. ""My wife's been on breakfast, I've been in the kitchen, she's been doing housekeeping, I've been out in the bar. ""Every day we are having to jump in to help out and the days are getting longer."" He says the staffing situation means long hours and compromises he does not want to make. ""This is a business known for being open seven days a week, delivering good food and drink and having a friendly Scottish hospitality welcome, but we can't do that now. ""There are weeks when we can only open five days. We also close between 3pm and 5pm to give staff a break and get organised for dinner service. ""There are days we are having to turn people away and we don't want to do that."" Mr Curley said this was the most difficult year he had experienced in the industry, and blamed Brexit for the biggest issues. ""In 2019, a third of our staff were from the European Union. Now we are just not getting applications from there. ""Unless the government step in and take the issue seriously what you will see is a pretty apocalyptic future for hospitality."" Kelly Fairweather says she feels like she is taking hits in a boxing ring with the challenges she faces Kelly Fairweather has three businesses that she is struggling to keep going. She owns The Selkie cafe bar in Dundee, a bakery, and a housekeeping business called At Your Service. She saw her number of staff in the cleaning business drop from 11 to just three when European staff disappeared after Brexit. Pub numbers fall to lowest on record Rail strikes are a catastrophe - hospitality bosses She said: ""We now have customers who used us weekly, now we can only see them once a month. ""We also have a bakery which has been closed for three months because we have no staff. Across the three businesses we have 18 vacancies. ""It's like being in a boxing ring and constantly taking punches."" She saw the monthly electricity bill for her 28-seat cafe rise to Â£3,000 last month. Ms Fairweather said: ""There are no caps, no rules on who provides our energy and in hospitality if you haven't got three years of trading, you can't get a contract, so these guys can put up their prices as they wish. ""This month I have had eight texts from my provider saying my daily rate is going up and my price per unit is going up."" Dean Banks has had to invest in legal help to be able to recruit staff from the US Dean Banks, who owns Haar restaurant in St Andrews, said that in 2019 about 30% to 35% of his staff were EU nationals. Now that has fallen to about 10%. ""We have had to go through a process with lawyers and the government to be able to employ staff from the US, Australia and Canada,"" he said. ""It has been very costly for the business to do that."" He has also had to step back from his chef role to keep the business running. ""I've had to come out of the kitchen more and help around the business, everywhere from running the restaurant some nights, running the bar area, kitchen porter work. ""I have to work harder. I am here a lot more, doing about 100-110 hours a week because I want my business to do well, I want to keep my staff."" Skilled staff are increasingly difficult to find in hospitality The latest quarterly survey carried out by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce found hiring staff was a challenge, with recruitment difficulties up 10% in the last quarter. And new data from the Altus Group showed businesses were failing,with 200 pubs in England and Wales shutting in the first half of 2022. Paul Waterson from the Scottish Licenced Trade Association said: ""Pre-Brexit we were in a good position and then we lost a lot of staff and that is the main problem. ""This means recovery from the pandemic is halted, the development of the trade has been halted, one in three businesses are trading at different hours and some are shutting down part of the week, it is a very difficult situation."" Liam Thomson from UK Hospitality said there were currently 40,000 hospitality vacancies in Scotland. Scottish tourism is returning but businesses are struggling to meet demand due to rising costs and lack of staff He told BBC Scotland: ""We have members reducing the levels of occupancy to 75% or 80%, because they don't have enough staff to look after the guests. Some are only open to provide meals and drinks to residents for the same reason. ""Our members are experiencing cost rises cross the board - food, fuel energy prices, inflation. ""Many businesses are trying to keep prices down so it's a fine balance, and in trying to absorb those costs we found two thirds of our businesses are not actually making any profit. ""Businesses are now looking at how they will be able to operate beyond the summer and we are looking at a situation where we might lose them."" The Scottish Chambers of Commerce has called for tax cuts, to shield firms from the worst of the damage. At the end of last month a holiday took me across the north of Scotland. All the people I asked said that staffing a hospitality business is a nightmare. July and August bring the British school holidaymakers to the Highlands, but June is usually the month when they rely on European tourists. And while they have been returning in modest numbers - and in large numbers around the North Coast 500 route - it is clear that the capacity to welcome them is severely limited. It seems clear that there are three lessons. One, businesses are struggling, and they need help. Telling them to pay higher wages and invest in training can only take them so far. Two, the quality of Scotland's tourist offer has worsened. While the pictures on Instagram can bring people in large numbers, poor quality service will drive away the next year's harvest of business. Third, those with the most sought-after skills - notably chefs - have gained considerable workplace bargaining power. Lockdown and time away from hot, cramped kitchens for exceptionally long hours has shown them there is a better work-life balance to be had. And with many European workers having left, without replacements, they get to set the terms and conditions. It used to be that if the kitchen closed at 2pm and you couldn't get food for miles around, it was perceived as a sign of poor quality service. It may now be a sign of higher quality employment.

"This video can not be played Watch: Johnson on appointing Pincher: I apologise for it There was the whiff of panic hanging over it all. The prime minister's team had invited me in for a last-minute interview with Boris Johnson. Five o'clock Tuesday evening, in his Commons office. The mementoes of a political career are scattered around: an Olympic flag, a mocked-up plastic bus stop - with his name written on it as the destination. A framed newspaper front page marking a moment of victory. But was this the moment that marked his defeat? Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid resignation letters in full Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak resign from government PM apologises for giving Pincher government job The prime minister had decided he had to confront the awkward truth that the people who speak on his behalf hadn't been telling the truth, for days on end. As I left, one of his most loyal ministers was heading the other way up the stairwell. Others from ""team Boris"" - those who originally championed him as a prospective Conservative leader - were summoned too. Already it was obvious he was in peril. And then, for him, it got a whole lot worse. His health secretary, Sajid Javid walked. Walking matters, but words matter too. ""The British people rightly expect integrity from their government,"" he said. Yes, you heard that right. A man who sat around the cabinet table this morning, serving at the highest level in government, had concluded what the government's critics have been saying for months: it, and its leader, don't have integrity. The now former chancellor, Rishi Sunak, went further: the public expects the government to conduct itself ""properly, competently and seriously"". The man who sat alongside the prime minister this morning saying the government is none of those things. He also, incidentally, said he had concluded he couldn't share a platform with Mr Johnson this time next week to set out a joint economic strategy to address the cost of living crunch. There was a huge policy disagreement there too, on the most important issue for millions and millions of people right now. Suddenly, what we were witnessing was the potential collapse of the government. But hold on. As I type these words at just after half-past seven, we haven't had a cabinet resignation for about an hour-and-a-half. Plenty of cabinet ministers have made it known they are staying. And Boris Johnson is not - until we hear otherwise - someone expected to go easily. Things remain, to put it gently, fluid. The only question that matters tonight is, will Boris Johnson survive? The simple truth is we don't know. And here's another thing. Neither does he. He's no longer in control of events, or in control of his government. He has never faced a more perilous day in office. Pressure on PM increases as Sunak and Javid quit Javid's and Sunak's resignation letters in full PM apologises for giving Pincher government job Can people believe what No 10 is saying?

"Bob Dylan re-recorded Blowin' In The Wind for the first time last March A one-off Bob Dylan record is expected to fetch up to Â£1m when it is auctioned at Christie's on Thursday. The disc features a new version of the star's classic song Blowin' In The Wind, made in March 2021 with his long-time collaborator T Bone Burnett. ""It felt holy,"" he tells BBC News. ""It always feels holy for me, playing with Bob - and I think we did it in one take, if I'm not mistaken."" It is the first new studio recording of the song since Dylan wrote it in 1962. The one-off release also showcases a new type of record that combines some of the materials used in CDs and vinyl, and promises better sound quality and durability than vinyl. Playable on any regular turntable, the new format is described as ""the pinnacle of sound"" by Burnett, who helped develop it. Ultimately, only one deep-pocketed Dylan fan will get to own the new version of Blowin' In The Wind. However, fans can go to Christie's in London to hear the record before it is sold. The one-off record is etched with Bob Dylan and T Bone Burnett's signatures and housed in a custom walnut and white oak cabinet There, they will be ushered into a sedate side-room of the auction house, where the 10-inch disc is handled with silk gloves before being placed on a Â£30,000 hi-fi system. Listening on headphones, the warmth and precision of the sound is immediately apparent, save for a few pops and cracks (maybe four in total) attributable to dust or static on the surface of the record. Dylan's voice is smooth and dextrous throughout, having benefitted from an extended break in touring during the Covid-19 pandemic. When it appears, his characteristic rasp only adds to the weight of the lyrics, which are inextricably linked to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Lines like, ""How many times can a man turn his head / and pretend that he just doesn't see?"" resonate harder than ever when sung from the perspective of an 81-year-old who's witnessed history repeat decade after decade after decade. As a result, the song becomes more contemplative, a rumination on our failures. Dylan stretches out his syllables as though he's contemplating every line anew; taking almost a minute longer to reach the song's conclusion. Allow YouTube content?

Unlike the original, the 2021 re-recording features a full band, recorded live in the studio as Dylan sang. Their subtle and sympathetic arrangement - with Greg Leisz on mandolin and Don Was on bass - adds a new dimension to the song, without stealing focus from the message. It almost seems a shame that, in the words of the Christie's catalogue, ""this is the only copy of Bob Dylan's 2021 recording,.... that will ever be manufactured. No other versions of this recording will be released or sold"". ""We're only making one because we view this work as the equivalent of an oil painting,"" says Burnett, who is best known for his Grammy-winning work on Raising Sand by Alison Kraus and Robert Plant, as well as the soundtracks for O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Big Lebowski. Bob Dylan sells his master recordings to Sony Music 80 things you may not know about Bob Dylan Dylan 'beyond words' over Nobel Prize He hopes that future releases in the format will ""help develop a music space in the fine arts"", allowing artists to combat ""the devaluing of our work by the commoditisation of the internet"". ""I don't know what an original recording of Bob Dylan singing one of the most important songs of the last century is [worth] today, but I know it's not $0.001 divided by 5 billion, which is the reality that musicians face now."" The exclusivity of the new recording has informed its estimated sale price of between Â£600,000 and Â£1 million. Peter Klarnet, Christie's senior specialist in Americana, says it was hard to calculate an estimate, as nothing of this nature has ever been sold before. The closest analogy is the Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, which was limited to a single CD copy in 2015. That record was initially bought by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli for an unspecified sum. When he was later convicted of fraud, the US Department of Justice re-sold the album for a reported $4m (Â£3.35m), making it the most expensive work of music ever sold. Klarnet says he is unsure whether the Dylan could match that figure, but suggests his initial estimate is on the conservative side. T Bone Burnett has been playing with Bob Dylan since the 1970s Meanwhile, Burnett is enthused by the potential of his new physical audio format - known as an Ionic Original. Announced in April, it consists of ""lacquer painted onto an aluminium disc, with a spiral etched into it by music"". This is essentially the same technology that the music industry has used for decades to create test pressings, known as acetates or dubplates. Musicians generally agree that these acetates sound better than vinyl - but they degrade quickly, as the force of the needle pushing into the groove melts the lacquer. ""So we started looking into what they use on the Space Station to shield it from the direct light of the sun,"" says Burnett. ""And we've been able to coat the acetate with that, and it removes enough friction that the acetate doesn't degrade over thousands of plays."" He says the coating - made from a gradient of sapphire and quartz - also reduces the crackle associated with vinyl. ""Friction creates static electricity, which attracts dust, which causes pops,"" he explains. ""So with this coating removing friction, if some dust does land on the needle, it cleans it out. So the discs are essentially self-cleaning."" At the time of writing, the discs cannot be mass produced, meaning they are likely to remain collector's items and investment opportunities for now. But Burnett hopes they will be widely adopted in the future. ""I don't look at this as a replacement for anything,"" he says. ""I just look at it as another arrow in the quiver for every musician in the world [and] a whole new way of earning a living that we've never had before."" This isn't Burnett's first venture into audio formats. In 2008, he developed a hi-fidelity technology known as Î§ÎÎÎ (or Code), which allowed listeners to play ""studio quality"" recordings from a DVD player. Releases on the format included John Mellencamp's Life, Death, Love and Freedom - but the format died out relatively quickly. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

So the discs are essentially self-cleaning."" At the time of writing, the discs cannot be mass produced, meaning they are likely to remain collector's items and investment opportunities for now. But Burnett hopes they will be widely adopted in the future. ""I don't look at this as a replacement for anything,"" he says. ""I just look at it as another arrow in the quiver for every musician in the world [and] a whole new way of earning a living that we've never had before.""

"Mars has stopped supplying supermarket chain Tesco with its Whiskas pet food in a row over prices. The two companies are engaged in a price dispute which Tesco said it hoped would be ""resolved soon"". The UK's biggest supermarket said it would not pass on ""unjustifiable price increases"" from suppliers its to customers. Mars said it could not comment on individual commercial relationships or situations. As the cost of living rises for shoppers, retailers like supermarkets are fighting to retain customers and protect profit. It comes after US food retailerKraft Heinz pulled its productsfrom sale at Tesco in a similar dispute over the price of its products including soup and ketchup. Tesco added: ""We're sorry that this means some products aren't available right now, but we have plenty of alternatives to choose from and we hope to have this issue resolved soon."" The price rises from Mars, whose pet products include Whiskas, Dreamies and Pedigree, come as inflation is at a 40-year high, at 9.1%. The supermarket rows you don't usually hear about What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? Customers are also struggling with rises in energy bills, with the average bill now expected to rise to Â£3,000 per year in October. ""The pet food industry, like many others, is operating in a volatile context marked by wide-ranging inflationary pressures, and we continue to absorb these rising costs as much as possible,"" said Mars. It added: ""The in-store price continues to be at the sole discretion of the retailer."" Some Tesco stores have experienced a lack of Mars pet foods on their shelves as a result of the dispute, and there are also some stock shortages on Tesco's website. Mars said: ""We are aware that some of our Petcare products are currently out of stock at Tesco stores. ""There are many reasons why our products may be out of stock in certain stores from time to time. We cannot comment on individual commercial relationships or situations."" The tussle between Tesco and Mars and Heinz illustrates the challenges facing suppliers and supermarkets as they struggle with huge cost increases. ""Suppliers are now saying: 'This is what I can afford to sell this product to you for. And if you don't agree I am going to stop supplying you,'"" says Ged Futter, founder of The Retail Mind and former buyer for Asda supermarket. He added: ""I've never seen as many suppliers prepared to stop the trucks."" ""Tesco can't afford to have empty shelves for months on end. If customers see large swathes of empty shelves, then they have to go somewhere else,"" Mr Futter told the Today programme. Supermarkets have buyers who agree deals with suppliers to provide them with products. For many items, like olive oil and tinned tomatoes, it can be an annual contract. Both sides are allowed, under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, to adjust terms and conditions. The editor-in-chief of the Grocer magazine, Adam Leyland, says in the past retailers typically demanded changes but now it is suppliers who are clamouring to renegotiate what they are getting paid. ""Suppliers are saying we need change and we need it quickly. Supermarkets have been dragging their feet for a long time. This has been building from last year and the dial has now turned up. ""It's fraught on both sides. This is not an easy time."" Heinz pulls brands from Tesco shelves in price row Why are prices rising in the UK?

"All types of household energy bill are now heading above Â£3,000 a year this winter, say energy industry sources. The rise is 7% higher than the predicted prices on which the government's recently announced cost of living support package was based. The government said it didn't recognise the figures, but added it and Ofgem ""keep a close watch on energy prices"". National Energy Action said there were ""few signs of energy prices becoming affordable this winter"". The bleak prediction comes as households are already struggling with rising food and fuel prices. Every UK household is to get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this October, whilst poorest households will also get a payment of Â£650. When will households get the Â£400 energy grant? But adding to the uncertainty are the resignations of the chancellor and health secretary which are drawing ministers' attention inward and away from any economic rescue plan. The Â£3,000 household bill figure, seen by the BBC, is Â£200 higher than predicted by energy watchdog Ofgem in May. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April, with a further squeeze on incomes from the rising cost of living, as inflation hit 9.1% -the highest in 40 years. While the official figure for the energy price cap, which applies in England, Wales and Scotland, is due to be announced next month by Ofgem, the period over which it is assessed is now almost complete. In recent weeks, the price paid for gas to be delivered this winter has increased even more sharply. In recent days, the price paid per therm of gas has reached above Â£4, compared with an average so far of Â£2.60. This has been driven by volumes of Russian gas exports going down, the closure of a key gas export facility in the USA, and a weaker value of the pound sterling. The industry now anticipates that these price levels will sustain for most of the rest of the period, amid strike disruption to Norwegian supplies of gas. The figures seen by the BBC have been calculated using the same methodology announced by Ofgem. It means that on average, dual fuel users paying by direct debit face a bill of Â£3,018 per year. A household using the same amount of energy but paying by prepayment meter would be charged Â£3,048 per year. And for those paying the entire bill on receipt, the bill for average energy use would be Â£3,147. The last, most expensive way of paying a bill is assuming more importance, say industry sources: some customers are reducing or cancelling their direct debit payments now, building up huge sums to repay in winter. The price cap, in its early days, was ignored by millions of billpayers who used price comparison sites to find a cheaper gas and electricity tariff. Now every twist and turn is watched closely, because it directly affects the energy bill of 23 million homes. The option to shop around has been absent. Although we might be getting used to the reality of that bill going up every six months - a typical Â£1,000 a year increase would be the biggest shock of all, especially as it would start in the colder, darker winter months. Even the extra financial support from government which was widely welcomed by charities and campaigners was based on the expectation of a lower bill rise than that. All of which leads to unanswerable questions about how long this energy upheaval will last, and how deep the long-term impact will be. While the government has put in significant levels of support, especially for poorer households, the former Chancellor's package was based on an Ofgem estimate for household dual fuel bills of Â£2,800 a year, already over double the price a year before. Industry sources were sceptical that the government's plan to decouple electricity prices from gas prices, would have any impact on these numbers. National Energy Action chief executive Adam Scorer said: ""The government's package of support will lessen, but not avoid the pain. ""Millions will simply not be able to heat their homes. We will see serious ill health and early deaths for those most susceptible to the cold. ""This crisis will not just be measured in the cost of living. It will have a tragic cost in lives. We need to prepare for a winter unlike any other."" Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said she thought the government did the right thing by targeting more financial support towards those who need it most. ""But there are still things they could be doing to get money in the pockets of people who desperately need it in the cost-of-living crisis,"" she said. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand that global inflationary pressures are squeezing household finances which is why the government has introduced an extraordinary Â£37 bn package to help households, including Â£1,200 each for eight million of the most vulnerable households.""

"Bob Dylan re-recorded Blowin' In The Wind for the first time last March A one-off Bob Dylan record is expected to fetch up to Â£1m when it is auctioned at Christie's on Thursday. The disc features a new version of the star's classic song Blowin' In The Wind, made in March 2021 with his long-time collaborator T Bone Burnett. ""It felt holy,"" he tells BBC News. ""It always feels holy for me, playing with Bob - and I think we did it in one take, if I'm not mistaken."" It is the first new studio recording of the song since Dylan wrote it in 1962. The one-off release also showcases a new type of record that combines some of the materials used in CDs and vinyl, and promises better sound quality and durability than vinyl. Playable on any regular turntable, the new format is described as ""the pinnacle of sound"" by Burnett, who helped develop it. Ultimately, only one deep-pocketed Dylan fan will get to own the new version of Blowin' In The Wind. However, fans can go to Christie's in London to hear the record before it is sold. The one-off record is etched with Bob Dylan and T Bone Burnett's signatures and housed in a custom walnut and white oak cabinet There, they will be ushered into a sedate side-room of the auction house, where the 10-inch disc is handled with silk gloves before being placed on a Â£30,000 hi-fi system. Listening on headphones, the warmth and precision of the sound is immediately apparent, save for a few pops and cracks (maybe four in total) attributable to dust or static on the surface of the record. Dylan's voice is smooth and dextrous throughout, having benefitted from an extended break in touring during the Covid-19 pandemic. When it appears, his characteristic rasp only adds to the weight of the lyrics, which are inextricably linked to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Lines like, ""How many times can a man turn his head / and pretend that he just doesn't see?"" resonate harder than ever when sung from the perspective of an 81-year-old who's witnessed history repeat decade after decade after decade. As a result, the song becomes more contemplative, a rumination on our failures. Dylan stretches out his syllables as though he's contemplating every line anew; taking almost a minute longer to reach the song's conclusion. Allow YouTube content?

Unlike the original, the 2021 re-recording features a full band, recorded live in the studio as Dylan sang. Their subtle and sympathetic arrangement - with Greg Leisz on mandolin and Don Was on bass - adds a new dimension to the song, without stealing focus from the message. It almost seems a shame that, in the words of the Christie's catalogue, ""this is the only copy of Bob Dylan's 2021 recording,.... that will ever be manufactured. No other versions of this recording will be released or sold"". ""We're only making one because we view this work as the equivalent of an oil painting,"" says Burnett, who is best known for his Grammy-winning work on Raising Sand by Alison Kraus and Robert Plant, as well as the soundtracks for O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Big Lebowski. Bob Dylan sells his master recordings to Sony Music 80 things you may not know about Bob Dylan Dylan 'beyond words' over Nobel Prize He hopes that future releases in the format will ""help develop a music space in the fine arts"", allowing artists to combat ""the devaluing of our work by the commoditisation of the internet"". ""I don't know what an original recording of Bob Dylan singing one of the most important songs of the last century is [worth] today, but I know it's not $0.001 divided by 5 billion, which is the reality that musicians face now."" The exclusivity of the new recording has informed its estimated sale price of between Â£600,000 and Â£1 million. Peter Klarnet, Christie's senior specialist in Americana, says it was hard to calculate an estimate, as nothing of this nature has ever been sold before. The closest analogy is the Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, which was limited to a single CD copy in 2015. That record was initially bought by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli for an unspecified sum. When he was later convicted of fraud, the US Department of Justice re-sold the album for a reported $4m (Â£3.35m), making it the most expensive work of music ever sold. Klarnet says he is unsure whether the Dylan could match that figure, but suggests his initial estimate is on the conservative side. T Bone Burnett has been playing with Bob Dylan since the 1970s Meanwhile, Burnett is enthused by the potential of his new physical audio format - known as an Ionic Original. Announced in April, it consists of ""lacquer painted onto an aluminium disc, with a spiral etched into it by music"". This is essentially the same technology that the music industry has used for decades to create test pressings, known as acetates or dubplates. Musicians generally agree that these acetates sound better than vinyl - but they degrade quickly, as the force of the needle pushing into the groove melts the lacquer. ""So we started looking into what they use on the Space Station to shield it from the direct light of the sun,"" says Burnett. ""And we've been able to coat the acetate with that, and it removes enough friction that the acetate doesn't degrade over thousands of plays."" He says the coating - made from a gradient of sapphire and quartz - also reduces the crackle associated with vinyl. ""Friction creates static electricity, which attracts dust, which causes pops,"" he explains. ""So with this coating removing friction, if some dust does land on the needle, it cleans it out. So the discs are essentially self-cleaning."" At the time of writing, the discs cannot be mass produced, meaning they are likely to remain collector's items and investment opportunities for now. But Burnett hopes they will be widely adopted in the future. ""I don't look at this as a replacement for anything,"" he says. ""I just look at it as another arrow in the quiver for every musician in the world [and] a whole new way of earning a living that we've never had before."" This isn't Burnett's first venture into audio formats. In 2008, he developed a hi-fidelity technology known as Î§ÎÎÎ (or Code), which allowed listeners to play ""studio quality"" recordings from a DVD player. Releases on the format included John Mellencamp's Life, Death, Love and Freedom - but the format died out relatively quickly. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"A man accused of opening fire on a Fourth of July parade near Chicago has been charged with seven counts of murder, officials say. The 21-year-old would be punished ""for the killing spree he has unleashed against our community"", Lake County State Attorney Eric Rinehart said.

""These are just the first of many charges that will be filed,"" he said to cheers and applause from the crowd gathered for the news conference on Tuesday. ""I want to emphasise that.

"Gary Curley is working more hours, in multiple roles, to fill shortfalls in his staffing After surviving the Covid lockdowns, hospitality businesses are now being faced with a cost of living crisis, soaring inflation and staffing shortages. Gary Curley runs the Sligachan Hotel on Skye. In 2019 his business would have 45 to 50 staff at this time of the year, but it currently has just 33. He and his wife have to fill most of the gaps caused by staff shortages. ""My wife and I are pretty hands-on but this year we have been working in every department,"" he says. ""My wife's been on breakfast, I've been in the kitchen, she's been doing housekeeping, I've been out in the bar. ""Every day we are having to jump in to help out and the days are getting longer."" He says the staffing situation means long hours and compromises he does not want to make. ""This is a business known for being open seven days a week, delivering good food and drink and having a friendly Scottish hospitality welcome, but we can't do that now. ""There are weeks when we can only open five days. We also close between 3pm and 5pm to give staff a break and get organised for dinner service. ""There are days we are having to turn people away and we don't want to do that."" Mr Curley said this was the most difficult year he had experienced in the industry, and blamed Brexit for the biggest issues. ""In 2019, a third of our staff were from the European Union. Now we are just not getting applications from there. ""Unless the government step in and take the issue seriously what you will see is a pretty apocalyptic future for hospitality."" Kelly Fairweather says she feels like she is taking hits in a boxing ring with the challenges she faces Kelly Fairweather has three businesses that she is struggling to keep going. She owns The Selkie cafe bar in Dundee, a bakery, and a housekeeping business called At Your Service. She saw her number of staff in the cleaning business drop from 11 to just three when European staff disappeared after Brexit. Pub numbers fall to lowest on record Rail strikes are a catastrophe - hospitality bosses She said: ""We now have customers who used us weekly, now we can only see them once a month. ""We also have a bakery which has been closed for three months because we have no staff. Across the three businesses we have 18 vacancies. ""It's like being in a boxing ring and constantly taking punches."" She saw the monthly electricity bill for her 28-seat cafe rise to Â£3,000 last month. Ms Fairweather said: ""There are no caps, no rules on who provides our energy and in hospitality if you haven't got three years of trading, you can't get a contract, so these guys can put up their prices as they wish.

Dean Banks has had to invest in legal help to be able to recruit staff from the US Dean Banks, who owns Haar restaurant in St Andrews, said that in 2019 about 30% to 35% of his staff were EU nationals. Now that has fallen to about 10%. ""We have had to go through a process with lawyers and the government to be able to employ staff from the US, Australia and Canada,"" he said. ""It has been very costly for the business to do that."" He has also had to step back from his chef role to keep the business running. ""I've had to come out of the kitchen more and help around the business, everywhere from running the restaurant some nights, running the bar area, kitchen porter work. ""I have to work harder. I am here a lot more, doing about 100-110 hours a week because I want my business to do well, I want to keep my staff."" Skilled staff are increasingly difficult to find in hospitality The latest quarterly survey carried out by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce found hiring staff was a challenge, with recruitment difficulties up 10% in the last quarter. And new data from the Altus Group showed businesses were failing,with 200 pubs in England and Wales shutting in the first half of 2022. Paul Waterson from the Scottish Licenced Trade Association said: ""Pre-Brexit we were in a good position and then we lost a lot of staff and that is the main problem. ""This means recovery from the pandemic is halted, the development of the trade has been halted, one in three businesses are trading at different hours and some are shutting down part of the week, it is a very difficult situation."" Liam Thomson from UK Hospitality said there were currently 40,000 hospitality vacancies in Scotland. Scottish tourism is returning but businesses are struggling to meet demand due to rising costs and lack of staff He told BBC Scotland: ""We have members reducing the levels of occupancy to 75% or 80%, because they don't have enough staff to look after the guests. Some are only open to provide meals and drinks to residents for the same reason. ""Our members are experiencing cost rises cross the board - food, fuel energy prices, inflation. ""Many businesses are trying to keep prices down so it's a fine balance, and in trying to absorb those costs we found two thirds of our businesses are not actually making any profit. ""Businesses are now looking at how they will be able to operate beyond the summer and we are looking at a situation where we might lose them."" The Scottish Chambers of Commerce has called for tax cuts, to shield firms from the worst of the damage. At the end of last month a holiday took me across the north of Scotland. All the people I asked said that staffing a hospitality business is a nightmare. July and August bring the British school holidaymakers to the Highlands, but June is usually the month when they rely on European tourists. And while they have been returning in modest numbers - and in large numbers around the North Coast 500 route - it is clear that the capacity to welcome them is severely limited. It seems clear that there are three lessons. One, businesses are struggling, and they need help. Telling them to pay higher wages and invest in training can only take them so far. Two, the quality of Scotland's tourist offer has worsened. While the pictures on Instagram can bring people in large numbers, poor quality service will drive away the next year's harvest of business. Third, those with the most sought-after skills - notably chefs - have gained considerable workplace bargaining power. Lockdown and time away from hot, cramped kitchens for exceptionally long hours has shown them there is a better work-life balance to be had. And with many European workers having left, without replacements, they get to set the terms and conditions. It used to be that if the kitchen closed at 2pm and you couldn't get food for miles around, it was perceived as a sign of poor quality service. It may now be a sign of higher quality employment.

"All types of household energy bill are now heading above Â£3,000 a year this winter, say energy industry sources. The rise is 7% higher than the predicted prices on which the government's recently announced cost of living support package was based. The government said it didn't recognise the figures, but added it and Ofgem ""keep a close watch on energy prices"". National Energy Action said there were ""few signs of energy prices becoming affordable this winter"". The bleak prediction comes as households are already struggling with rising food and fuel prices. Every UK household is to get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this October, whilst poorest households will also get a payment of Â£650. When will households get the Â£400 energy grant? But adding to the uncertainty are the resignations of the chancellor and health secretary which are drawing ministers' attention inward and away from any economic rescue plan. The Â£3,000 household bill figure, seen by the BBC, is Â£200 higher than predicted by energy watchdog Ofgem in May. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April, with a further squeeze on incomes from the rising cost of living, as inflation hit 9.1% -the highest in 40 years. While the official figure for the energy price cap, which applies in England, Wales and Scotland, is due to be announced next month by Ofgem, the period over which it is assessed is now almost complete. In recent weeks, the price paid for gas to be delivered this winter has increased even more sharply. In recent days, the price paid per therm of gas has reached above Â£4, compared with an average so far of Â£2.60. This has been driven by volumes of Russian gas exports going down, the closure of a key gas export facility in the USA, and a weaker value of the pound sterling. The industry now anticipates that these price levels will sustain for most of the rest of the period, amid strike disruption to Norwegian supplies of gas. The figures seen by the BBC have been calculated using the same methodology announced by Ofgem. It means that on average, dual fuel users paying by direct debit face a bill of Â£3,018 per year. A household using the same amount of energy but paying by prepayment meter would be charged Â£3,048 per year. And for those paying the entire bill on receipt, the bill for average energy use would be Â£3,147. The last, most expensive way of paying a bill is assuming more importance, say industry sources: some customers are reducing or cancelling their direct debit payments now, building up huge sums to repay in winter. The price cap, in its early days, was ignored by millions of billpayers who used price comparison sites to find a cheaper gas and electricity tariff. Now every twist and turn is watched closely, because it directly affects the energy bill of 23 million homes. The option to shop around has been absent. Although we might be getting used to the reality of that bill going up every six months - a typical Â£1,000 a year increase would be the biggest shock of all, especially as it would start in the colder, darker winter months. Even the extra financial support from government which was widely welcomed by charities and campaigners was based on the expectation of a lower bill rise than that. All of which leads to unanswerable questions about how long this energy upheaval will last, and how deep the long-term impact will be. While the government has put in significant levels of support, especially for poorer households, the former Chancellor's package was based on an Ofgem estimate for household dual fuel bills of Â£2,800 a year, already over double the price a year before. Industry sources were sceptical that the government's plan to decouple electricity prices from gas prices, would have any impact on these numbers. National Energy Action chief executive Adam Scorer said: ""The government's package of support will lessen, but not avoid the pain. ""Millions will simply not be able to heat their homes. We will see serious ill health and early deaths for those most susceptible to the cold. ""This crisis will not just be measured in the cost of living. It will have a tragic cost in lives. We need to prepare for a winter unlike any other."" Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said she thought the government did the right thing by targeting more financial support towards those who need it most. ""But there are still things they could be doing to get money in the pockets of people who desperately need it in the cost-of-living crisis,"" she said. A government spokesperson said: ""We understand that global inflationary pressures are squeezing household finances which is why the government has introduced an extraordinary Â£37 bn package to help households, including Â£1,200 each for eight million of the most vulnerable households.""

"Gary Curley is working more hours, in multiple roles, to fill shortfalls in his staffing After surviving the Covid lockdowns, hospitality businesses are now being faced with a cost of living crisis, soaring inflation and staffing shortages. Gary Curley runs the Sligachan Hotel on Skye. In 2019 his business would have 45 to 50 staff at this time of the year, but it currently has just 33. He and his wife have to fill most of the gaps caused by staff shortages. ""My wife and I are pretty hands-on but this year we have been working in every department,"" he says. ""My wife's been on breakfast, I've been in the kitchen, she's been doing housekeeping, I've been out in the bar. ""Every day we are having to jump in to help out and the days are getting longer."" He says the staffing situation means long hours and compromises he does not want to make. ""This is a business known for being open seven days a week, delivering good food and drink and having a friendly Scottish hospitality welcome, but we can't do that now. ""There are weeks when we can only open five days. We also close between 3pm and 5pm to give staff a break and get organised for dinner service. ""There are days we are having to turn people away and we don't want to do that."" Mr Curley said this was the most difficult year he had experienced in the industry, and blamed Brexit for the biggest issues. ""In 2019, a third of our staff were from the European Union. Now we are just not getting applications from there. ""Unless the government step in and take the issue seriously what you will see is a pretty apocalyptic future for hospitality."" Kelly Fairweather says she feels like she is taking hits in a boxing ring with the challenges she faces Kelly Fairweather has three businesses that she is struggling to keep going. She owns The Selkie cafe bar in Dundee, a bakery, and a housekeeping business called At Your Service. She saw her number of staff in the cleaning business drop from 11 to just three when European staff disappeared after Brexit. Pub numbers fall to lowest on record Rail strikes are a catastrophe - hospitality bosses She said: ""We now have customers who used us weekly, now we can only see them once a month. ""We also have a bakery which has been closed for three months because we have no staff. Across the three businesses we have 18 vacancies. ""It's like being in a boxing ring and constantly taking punches."" She saw the monthly electricity bill for her 28-seat cafe rise to Â£3,000 last month.

"The PM has fired Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove, who earlier called for him to resign A No 10 source calls Gove a ""snake"" and insists the PM will ""fight on"" It comes after a group of cabinet ministers - Home Secretary Priti Patel among them - visited the PM to tell him to quit Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart was also said to be in that delegation and has now become the third cabinet minister to resign Attorney General Suella Braverman and ex-minister Matt Hancock have also called for Johnson to go, with Braverman saying she would stand for leader Another group - including Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg - are thought to have been at No 10 to show support for Johnson At least 44 ministers and aides have quit since yesterday when Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak said they were resigning MPs are angry at Johnson's handling of sexual misconduct claims against former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher Edited by Francesca Gillett We're ending our live coverage for today, thanks for following. For our latest story on the government resignations and Boris Johnson's leadership,head here. We'll be back with more live updates on the UK political situation later today. It's been an eventful 24 hours. Given recent developments - from sackings to resignations - we're all in need of a quick round-up of where we're up to on this political saga. Nadhim Zahawi, who was only appointed as chancellor on Tuesday, is ""solidly behind"" the prime minister, Boris Johnson's parliamentary private secretary has told Sky News. Zahawi was earlier reported to have been in No 10 Downing Street as part of a group of cabinet ministers telling Boris Johnson that he should resign. But James Duddridge told Sky News earlier that those reports are ""wrong"" and Zahawi will be announcing a new economic strategy ""some time next week"". Duddridge was emphatic that the PM would ""go on and deliver"". Conservative MP Gareth Davies has quit as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Health and Social Care. The Grantham and Stamford MP tweeted: ""It is with great regret that I have informed the whips office of my resignation as a PPS at the Department of Health and Social Care. ""It has been a privilege to serve in the role and not a decision I have taken lightly."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With a third of the government gone following the stream of resignations, can it still be described as functioning? Not according to Camilla Cavendish, the former director of the Number 10 Policy Unit. ""The key point here is exactly this - we don't have a functioning government,"" she tells the BBC. ""As of tonight there aren't enough people to keep the business of the government going. Members of Parliament have already been told there aren't even enough people on the bill committees to actually get the legislation through - that is the fundamental business of government."" Cavendish adds: ""He can try in the next few days to bring new people in and there's always bound to be somebody but he is going to run out of road."" Conservative backbencher Bob Seely has been speaking to BBC Radio 4
about Boris Johnsonâs refusal to resign. Speaking to the World Tonight, he said it's not a case of the
calm before the storm, but rather ""the storm before the calm"". He added the political crisis was ""a bit like the end of a
bad relationship - it's just emotionally exhausting"". ""You think well I've tried, it hasnât worked, we've given
it a few years and we need to move on."" Seely has withdrawn his support for Johnson after backing him in
last monthâs vote of confidence. He's now hoping there will be a second vote. Speaking to the BBC, former Conservative minister Margot James criticised Boris Johnson's decision to sack Michael Gove. After losing more than 40 ministers in 24 hours, she said it was ""grossly irresponsible"" to sack ""probably the most competent minister in the whole cabinet"". James added she suspected it was ""active vengeance for what happened three years ago"". In 2016, when David Cameron stepped down, Johnson dropped out of the race for the Conservative leadership bid when Gove - who had previously backed Johnson - announced his own bid. Theresa May went on to win, becoming PM. And in 2019, Gove took Johnson on again, after having previously backed him to replace May when she resigned. Matt Hancock - the former health secretary - says ""it's clear"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to resign. In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, Hancock says it's a sad end for Johnson. He adds: ""It's clear whether it's tomorrow or next Tuesday, there's going to be a new prime minister"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This brings the total number of resignations from ministers and aides up to 44. Simon Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, had been a part of Boris Johnson's cabinet since 2019. In his resignation letter he said PM will be remembered with ""energy, vision, determination and humour"", Hart said he had never been a ""massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing change"". But, he adds, it's now past the point where utmost support to help the PM ""turn the ship around"" is enough. Hart was thought to be among a group of cabinet ministers who reportedly went
into No 10 earlier today to tell Johnson it was time to go. Yesterday, Hart made it made it clear to No 10 that it was ""game over"" but it shouldnât have to come by ministerial resignations. Simon Hart, former secretary of state for Wales, has just resigned, bringing the number of cabinet members who have resigned up to three - alongside Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak. In his resignation letter to Boris Johnson, Hart says: ""I had desperately hoped that I could avoid writing this letter, but alas there seems no other option left but to step down from my role as secretary of state for Wales"". He adds: ""Colleagues have done their upmost [sic] in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible"". So far 43 ministers and aides have resigned from Johnson's government. Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart has resigned from Boris Johnson's government Allow Twitter content?

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent As a rule of thumb, you can define the significance of
the occasion by the number of cameras in Downing Street. In the summer sunshine, the street was as busy as it was
in the cold of Christmas Eve 2019 when the Brexit deal was about to be struck. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps strode towards No 10, making very public his role as a messenger telling the prime minister what he didn't want to hear. Equally publicly, staunch supporter Nadine Dorries arrived at No 10 to express her loyalty. It's a great British tradition for the massed ranks of the media to shout questions at ministers, rarely expecting a reply. But when she left not only did she say that she supported Johnson but when asked if any of her colleagues still did she emphatically declared ""yes, definitely"" - suggesting the PM wasn't ready to throw in the towel. Anne Marie Trevelyan followed in her wake but was tight-lipped on whether she was still in support. And the Home Secretary Priti Patel avoided the glare of the cameras entirely - delivering her blow to the PM in private. All this has taken place against a soundtrack of an anti-Boris Johnson demonstrator blaring out 'bye bye Boris' to the tune of the similarly titled Bay City Rollers hit, occasionally drowned out by the strains of a marching band practicing in nearby Horse Guards Parade and a helicopter overhead. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, has a novel take on Boris Johnson's firing of Michael Gove. He tells Sky News that Michael Gove offered Johnson the ""metaphorical bottle of whisky and the revolver"". ""Well clearly Boris has downed the whisky and turned the revolver on Michael Gove. ""Who would have believed it?"" The Tories have a ""patriotic duty"" to conclude the
chaos that has engulfed government,says Conservative MP Tobias Elwood.,external Elwood represents Bournemouth East and is Chair of the House of
Commons Defence Select Committee. He quizzed Johnson earlier at the Liaison Committee meeting. ""We have a patriotic duty to conclude this,"" he
tweeted. ""It's not just damaging the Conservative brand and
diminishing our own electoral prospects it is also undermining the nationâs
standing internationally. ""Britain is better than this."" Meanwhile, there have been three more resignations from Johnson's government. Taking the number of ministers and aides that have resigned - or been sacked - up to at least 41. Danny Krugerhas now resigned as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities - Michael Gove's former department. Kruger says he's ""very sorry indeed to hear Michael Gove has been fired"". James Daly, parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Work and Pensions, resigned from his role ""with great regret"". In aletter,externalDaly says Johnson is ""sadly unable to lead our government"". David Mundellalso resigned from his role as trade envoy to New Zealand. In atweet,externalMundell says he has no confidence in the PM and is ""very disappointed"". We've been hearing from a No 10 source who has been talking about why the PM is staying on. ""There is no lectern outside No 10 tonight... the PM fights on,"" the source says. Any suggestion there's a procession of cabinet ministers telling Johnson to go ""is not true"", the source claims, adding: ""He's called their bluff."" ""He has been spelling out to them [cabinet ministers] that 14 million people voted for him,"" the source says, adding that if the Conservative Party ""want to deprive him [Johnson] doing that job, they have take to take that mandate off them"". The source adds that Johnson explained to cabinet ministers tonight that the options are not ""Boris or no Boris"". Rather, it's about giving Johnson either a ""fresh chancellor and new programme, that Rishi was not prepared to do"" or ""spend months ripping each other apart to elect a leader without a mandate - coalition of chaos and Labour who will break up Britain"". Michael Gove and Boris Johnson worked together on the Vote Leave campaign Michael Gove is a senior and long-standing figure in the Conservative Party and has served in a strong of high-level posts, from his 2010 appointment as Education Secretary onwards. He has been Chief Whip, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Justice Secretary and Environment Secretary, as well as the role he was just sacked from, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Gove worked closely with Johnson on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. He has remained loyal to Johnson since he became prime minister. However, during the 2016 Conservative leadership race he initially backed Boris Johnson but later dramatically withdrew his backing, announcing he would run himself. That contest was ultimately won by Theresa May. Gove also ran
against Johnson in the 2019 Tory leadership race. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.999534
"Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid - who quit the cabinet within minutes of each other in protest at Boris Johnson's leadership - look like political allies right now, but they are also friends. They both rose from relatively modest beginnings to make a fortune in investment banking, before entering politics. There is also a shared love of Star Wars - and they haven't been afraid to hide it. When Mr Javid resigned as chancellor in February 2020, after losing a power struggle with Mr Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings, he tweeted about his successor: ""The Force is strong in young Sunak."" Just over a year earlier, when he was still number two to Mr Javid at the Treasury, Mr Sunak tweeted a picture of the pair of them at the cinema, where they had just been to see The Rise of Skywalker.

Despite the tax burden rising to record peacetime levels on his watch, Mr Sunak took the unusual step ofpromising to cut income tax before the next general election. In his resignation letter, the 42-year-old former chancellor says Boris Johnson's approach is ""fundamentally too different"" to his, suggesting the PM is unwilling to take the ""difficult decisions"" needed to fix the economy. Mr Javid, 52, also sees himself as a fiscal conservative, who repeatedly warned about the dangers of rising inflation and the size of the national debt before becoming health secretary last year. Like Mr Sunak, he was tipped for the top almost from the moment he entered Parliament, in 2009 - and the two men were once talked about as the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown of the Conservative Party. Born in Rochdale, to a first generation immigrant family, Mr Javid's bus conductor father is said to have arrived in Britain from a Pakistani village in 1961, with Â£5 to his name. Mr Sunak's background was more comfortable. His father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy, and he attended fee-paying Winchester School, before a highly lucrative career in banking and hedge funds. Elected to Parliament in 2015, he was briefly seen as the frontrunner to succeed Boris Johnson as Conservative leader. But his fine for attending Mr Johnson's birthday party during lockdown - andrevelations about his wife's tax affairs- have put paid to that ambition for now. In his resignation letter, he says: ""I recognise this may be my last ministerial job."" The coming days will reveal whether this is false modesty on the part of the now ex-chancellor, or whether he and his fellow Star Wars fan are a spent Force.

"Boris Johnson is battling to stay in office, amid a growing wave of resignations from his government in protest at his leadership. New chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has urged unity after his predecessor, the health secretary, and several junior ministers walked out. But the prime minister has been hit by six further resignations, taking the total to 16 in the past day. It comes as he prepares for PMQs later and a grilling by senior MPs. Mr Johnson's premiership has been plunged into crisis following the dramatic resignations of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. They quit within minutes of each other on Tuesday following a row over Mr Johnson's decision to appoint Chris Pincher deputy chief whip earlier this year. Their departures triggered a wave of resignations from more junior roles that has continued on Wednesday. In six further departures ahead of PMQs, education ministers Will Quince and Robin Walker, Justice Minister Victoria Atkins, Treasury minister John Glen, and ministerial aides Laura Trott and Felicity Buchan have all walked out. Follow live updates Sunak and Javid resignation letters in full Who has quit, who is staying? Mr Johnson has admitted it was a ""bad mistake"" to appoint Mr Pincher, despite being aware of misconduct allegations against him. It followed days of changing responses from No 10 over what exactly the PM knew about Mr Pincher's past conduct when he gave him the job. Mr Quince, who was sent out to defend the PM in media interviews two days ago, said Downing Street had given him ""inaccurate"" information. In a resignation letter, he added he had ""no choice"" to resign - adding that he had repeated No 10's assurances ""in good faith"". The row over Mr Pincher's appointment comes after the PM's relations with his backbenchers have been damaged by the Partygate scandal and unhappiness over tax rises. He survived a no-confidence vote among Tory MPs last month, meaning under current party rules he is immune from another challenge for a year. Several key cabinet ministers, including foreign secretary and potential leadership challenger Liz Truss, have rallied round the prime minister. However, rebel Tories want to use an upcoming vote to the backbench 1922 committee to scrap the year-long gap between contests, making it possible he could face another challenge later this summer. Boris Johnson is braced for more resignations, perhaps not from the cabinet but the next rung down the ministerial ladder. For a little while, after two cabinet resignations, Westminster wondered what might happen next - and so did the PM. Not in control of events, he was ringing around the rest of his cabinet to work out if they were still with him. They were, and the moment of greatest jeopardy for him has passed - for now at least. A smattering of more junior resignations did follow, but there's a defiance from his team; they point out their mandate from the electorate at the last election, in contrast with the anger and anguish among many Conservative MPs. You can read more analysis by Chris Mason here Mr Zahawi, who becomes the fourth chancellor in three years, was appointed alongside the prime minister's chief of staff, Steve Barclay, who became health secretary. A No 10 source said the new chancellor was ""more dynamic and more aligned"" with Mr Johnson, and described the new health secretary as a ""massive upgrade"". Mr Javid had warned the leadership was not ""acting in the national interest"", while Mr Sunak said the public expected government to be conducted ""properly, competently and seriously"". Mr Sunakalso referenced tensions over the economy in his resignation letter,telling the PM their approaches had become ""fundamentally too different"". Mr Javid, who has now resigned from Mr Johnson's cabinet for the second time, will make a resignation statement to Parliament later. The departures triggered a wave of resignations, including Solicitor General Alex Chalk, five ministerial aides, two trade envoys, and Bim Afolami as vice-chair of the Tory party. Ashfield MP Lee Anderson, a previously loyal supporter of Mr Johnson, also withdrew his support, saying in a Facebook post he could not ""look myself in the mirror"" and accept the PM's handling of Chris Pincher's appointment. If party bosses change the one-year rule on leadership challenges, rebel Tory MPs could try again to oust him later this summer, or in the autumn If Mr Johnson lost a vote of no confidence in Parliament, he would have to resign or call an election Otherwise, he would have to resign himself - possibly in the face of cabinet pressure, like Margaret Thatcher - or after a fresh wave of ministerial resignations Read more This video can not be played Watch: Johnson on appointing Pincher: I apologise for it Pressure on the prime minister was also elevated last month by the loss of by-elections inTiverton and HonitonandWakefieldand the resignation of Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen told the BBC the prime minister should resign and if he does not do so ""the party will have to force him out"". ""The 1922 committee will deal with this turbulent prime minister, it's what it was created for,"" he said. Bob Blackman, a member of the 1922 executive committee, said elections to replace the executive team - an event rebel Tories want to use to force a leadership rule change - will take place before Parliament's summer recess two weeks' time. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir said he would welcome a snap election and the country needed a change of government. He said: ""After all the sleaze, all the failure, it's clear that this Tory government is now collapsing."" The next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson used his powers to call one. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey told the BBC that Conservatives must do their ""patriotic duty"" and ""get rid of Boris Johnson today"". Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""the whole rotten lot"" in Mr Johnson's government should go, accusing ministers of ""lying to the public"".

"Officials say seven people died and another 30 were injured in the attack in Highland Park, just north of Chicago The mother and the father of a two-year-old boy found wandering alone were among the seven victims of a mass shooting near Chicago. Irina McCarthy, 35, andKevin McCarthy, 37, were shot dead after a gunman on a rooftop opened fire on spectators at a 4 July parade in Highland Park. Their son Aiden was unhurt. He is being looked after by his grandparents. Relatives and friends have been paying tributes to the McCarthy couple and the other victims of the attack. Aiden was separated from his parents during the shooting, said a couple who were at the scene of the attack. Dana and Greg Ring told CBS they found the toddler with a stranger, who was ""physically shaking, her whole body"". ""We took the little boy. I put him in my arms,"" Mr Ring said. He described the scene of the attack as ""carnage"". A GoFundMe page has been created to raise money for Aiden, with the account raising almost $2m (Â£1.67m) in little more than 12 hours. The fund, which says it is run by a friend of the family, says any money raised will be used to help ""the caregivers who will be tasked with raising, caring for, and supporting Aiden"". His father, Kevin, was remembered as a ""star employee"" by his boss at Jaguar Gene Therapy, Joe Nolan. ""Outside of work he was a very proud dad and devoted husband who adored his family. We will miss him tremendously,"" Mr Nolan told NBC. Aiden's mother, Irina, was born in Russia and settled in Chicago with her family. Her father Michael Levberg told the Chicago Sun that she attended DePaul University in the city before working in the pharmaceutical industry. An only child, Mr Levberg called her ""the love of my life"". He added that the McCarthys ""were crazy about"" their son and had been planning on having a second child in the near future. Nicolas Toledo loved fishing, painting and going on walks in parks, his family said Another of those killed, 78-year-oldNicolas Toledo, was described as a ""loving"" and ""adventurous"" man by his granddaughter. He was watching the parade in his wheelchair when he was shot. ""What was supposed to be a fun family day turned into a horrific nightmare for us all,"" granddaughter Xochil Toledo wrote on the GoFundMe website. ""As a family we are broken, and numb. Our condolences go out to all the other families who lost a loved one today."" Mr Toledo was a father of eight and said to enjoy fishing, painting and going on walks in parks. Two other family members were also hit but were not seriously injured, the family added. Also killed wasJacki Sundheim, who worked at a local synagogue, North Shore Congregation Israel. ""There are no words sufficient to express the depth of our grief for Jacki's death and sympathy for her family and loved ones,""a statement by the synagogue said.,external ""Jacki's work, kindness and warmth touched us all, from her teaching at the Gates of Learning Preschool to guiding innumerable among us through life's moments of joy and sorrow... all of this with tireless dedication,"" it added. The synagogue said Ms Sundheim was survived by her husband and daughter. And family members described another victimStephen Straus, 88, as an ""honourable man"" who worked his whole life. Mr Straus was a financial adviser and father-of-two who took the train every day to his office at a brokerage firm in Chicago. In a statement, his sons described him as a man ""curious about the world"" and ""a product of Chicago"", while his niece, Cynthia, told local media that he had ""unquenchable thirst for life"". One other victim has also been identified.Katherine Goldstein, 64. Her husband, Dr Craig Goldstein,told the New York Times,externalthat she was the mother of two daughters in their 20s. He said she had taken her elder daughter, Cassie, to the Highland Park parade so she could reunite with some school friends. He added that she loved playing games with her daughters and had devoted her life to being a mother after leaving work in the 1990s. ""The amazing thing about Katie is that she never thought about her own death,"" Dr Goldstein said. ""For me it's almost a preoccupation. She never thought about it."" Six people were initially reported to have died in Monday's attack, but a seventh person died of their injuries on Tuesday.

"Most Lloyds Bank customers have less than Â£500 of savings in their accounts, its chief executive said. Charlie Nunn said Lloyds had seen customers seeking debt advice jump up by a third in just the first six months of this year. Credit card spending on travel was up 300% on last year, but the majority of Lloyd's customers were worried about the cost of living, he said. It was possible for the UK to avoid the recession many are predicting, he said. It comes as UK households struggle with the soaring cost of food, energy bills and fuel asinflation rises at the fastest rate in 40 years. The head of the UK's biggest high street bank told the BBC: ""80% of individuals and UK customers and families have less than Â£500 pounds worth of savings in their current account and their savings account. ""They might have money elsewhere. But what we can see is less than Â£500. So it's a very important starting point for looking at financial resilience."" But he said half of these customers had increased their balances in the last few years and were in a healthier position than they were before the Covid pandemic. He said credit card spending was up - the fastest in 17 years according to most recent figures - with travel being the biggest driver. ""Travel which is a particularly big part of credit card spending has bounced back up almost 300% year on year, coming from Covid and the constraints around travel back to where people are now,"" he said. But he said 75% of Lloyd's 26m customers were worried about the cost of living. And 20% of them were cutting discretionary spending to afford essentials. ""Customers are concerned - and they should be. We've seen some areas where there's real points of challenge,"" he said. Although there was a sharp increase in people with problem debts, only 1% of customers were unable to pay their day to day bills, he said. Lloyds Bank chief executive Charlie Nunn said he thought the UK could avoid a recession Mr Nunn said he was concerned the UK was talking itself into a recession. ""We are concerned that I think we collectively are talking ourselves into the risk of too negative an outlook. There are pockets of strength in the economy. ""There are significant parts of the consumers in the UK who have strength and really want to spend and create that demand and we can continue to see opportunities to invest in growth. ""But yes, sentiment is challenging."" Lloyds Banking Group is the biggest lender to households and small business in the UK and it is often seen as a bellwether for the entire UK economy. So its chief executive has an important and influential perspective on household and business prospects. Mr Nunn predicted the economy and house prices would both be roughly flat for the rest of the year but predicted interest rates would rise to around 2% in the next year from the current 1.25%. This is much lower than the 3.5% others are predicting as high energy prices do a similar job as rising interest rates in forcing people to spend less, dampening inflationary pressure. ""We're saying no, we're saying we can see that it's going to be a difficult few quarters flat growth,"" he said. ""It could be plus or minus a bit but it will be flat growth in the next few quarters and really what we're focused on is making sure we're providing support to those customers who are going to struggle to make ends meet and the businesses as well because there are some sectors and some businesses that also have that stress."" Lloyds staff to get Â£1,000 cost of living payment Lloyds also employs over 65,000 people. The Bank of England governor has urged employers, workers and unions to exercise restraint when asking and offering pay rise to prevent an inflationary wage spiral. A call that drew fury from unions. Some employers like Lloyds have tried an interesting approach. Lloyds gave 99% of its workers a 3.6% pay rise plus a one-off autumn lump sum of at least Â£1,000. A more generous package at Rolls Royce - a 4% pay rise plus Â£2,000 lump sum - was rejected by unions as essentially being a below-inflation pay rise in disguise. Mr Nunn said: ""We very much want to support making sure that we don't build in inflation in a way that isn't needed. It felt like the right thing for this year. And it was the appropriate action in the context of this unprecedented inflation spike."" He said the bank would consider doing the same next year depending on the inflation picture. As a major lender to businesses big and small, Lloyds is exposed to the risk of firms going bust as their input costs soar at the same time as their customers incomes dwindle. But Mr Nunn said he was not preparing for a wave of companies unable to pay their debts. ""We don't see a significant increase in bad loan charges, that's not the scenario we have. We are seeing low growth, higher inflation and we're seeing slight increase in but stable unemployment. And that's how we think about the next four, six quarters.""

Nadhim Zahawi, who was only appointed as chancellor on Tuesday, is ""solidly behind"" the prime minister, Boris Johnson's parliamentary private secretary has told Sky News. Zahawi was earlier reported to have been in No 10 Downing Street as part of a group of cabinet ministers telling Boris Johnson that he should resign. But James Duddridge told Sky News earlier that those reports are ""wrong"" and Zahawi will be announcing a new economic strategy ""some time next week"". Duddridge was emphatic that the PM would ""go on and deliver"". Conservative MP Gareth Davies has quit as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Health and Social Care. The Grantham and Stamford MP tweeted: ""It is with great regret that I have informed the whips office of my resignation as a PPS at the Department of Health and Social Care. ""It has been a privilege to serve in the role and not a decision I have taken lightly."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With a third of the government gone following the stream of resignations, can it still be described as functioning? Not according to Camilla Cavendish, the former director of the Number 10 Policy Unit. ""The key point here is exactly this - we don't have a functioning government,"" she tells the BBC. ""As of tonight there aren't enough people to keep the business of the government going. Members of Parliament have already been told there aren't even enough people on the bill committees to actually get the legislation through - that is the fundamental business of government."" Cavendish adds: ""He can try in the next few days to bring new people in and there's always bound to be somebody but he is going to run out of road."" Conservative backbencher Bob Seely has been speaking to BBC Radio 4
about Boris Johnsonâs refusal to resign. Speaking to the World Tonight, he said it's not a case of the
calm before the storm, but rather ""the storm before the calm"". He added the political crisis was ""a bit like the end of a
bad relationship - it's just emotionally exhausting"". ""You think well I've tried, it hasnât worked, we've given
it a few years and we need to move on."" Seely has withdrawn his support for Johnson after backing him in
last monthâs vote of confidence. He's now hoping there will be a second vote. Speaking to the BBC, former Conservative minister Margot James criticised Boris Johnson's decision to sack Michael Gove. After losing more than 40 ministers in 24 hours, she said it was ""grossly irresponsible"" to sack ""probably the most competent minister in the whole cabinet"". James added she suspected it was ""active vengeance for what happened three years ago"". In 2016, when David Cameron stepped down, Johnson dropped out of the race for the Conservative leadership bid when Gove - who had previously backed Johnson - announced his own bid. Theresa May went on to win, becoming PM. And in 2019, Gove took Johnson on again, after having previously backed him to replace May when she resigned. Matt Hancock - the former health secretary - says ""it's clear"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to resign. In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, Hancock says it's a sad end for Johnson. He adds: ""It's clear whether it's tomorrow or next Tuesday, there's going to be a new prime minister"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This brings the total number of resignations from ministers and aides up to 44. Simon Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, had been a part of Boris Johnson's cabinet since 2019. In his resignation letter he said PM will be remembered with ""energy, vision, determination and humour"", Hart said he had never been a ""massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing change"". But, he adds, it's now past the point where utmost support to help the PM ""turn the ship around"" is enough. Hart was thought to be among a group of cabinet ministers who reportedly went
into No 10 earlier today to tell Johnson it was time to go. Yesterday, Hart made it made it clear to No 10 that it was ""game over"" but it shouldnât have to come by ministerial resignations. Simon Hart, former secretary of state for Wales, has just resigned, bringing the number of cabinet members who have resigned up to three - alongside Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak. In his resignation letter to Boris Johnson, Hart says: ""I had desperately hoped that I could avoid writing this letter, but alas there seems no other option left but to step down from my role as secretary of state for Wales"". He adds: ""Colleagues have done their upmost [sic] in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible"". So far 43 ministers and aides have resigned from Johnson's government. Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart has resigned from Boris Johnson's government Allow Twitter content?

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent As a rule of thumb, you can define the significance of
the occasion by the number of cameras in Downing Street. In the summer sunshine, the street was as busy as it was
in the cold of Christmas Eve 2019 when the Brexit deal was about to be struck. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps strode towards No 10, making very public his role as a messenger telling the prime minister what he didn't want to hear. Equally publicly, staunch supporter Nadine Dorries arrived at No 10 to express her loyalty. It's a great British tradition for the massed ranks of the media to shout questions at ministers, rarely expecting a reply. But when she left not only did she say that she supported Johnson but when asked if any of her colleagues still did she emphatically declared ""yes, definitely"" - suggesting the PM wasn't ready to throw in the towel. Anne Marie Trevelyan followed in her wake but was tight-lipped on whether she was still in support. And the Home Secretary Priti Patel avoided the glare of the cameras entirely - delivering her blow to the PM in private. All this has taken place against a soundtrack of an anti-Boris Johnson demonstrator blaring out 'bye bye Boris' to the tune of the similarly titled Bay City Rollers hit, occasionally drowned out by the strains of a marching band practicing in nearby Horse Guards Parade and a helicopter overhead. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, has a novel take on Boris Johnson's firing of Michael Gove. He tells Sky News that Michael Gove offered Johnson the ""metaphorical bottle of whisky and the revolver"". ""Well clearly Boris has downed the whisky and turned the revolver on Michael Gove. ""Who would have believed it?"" The Tories have a ""patriotic duty"" to conclude the
chaos that has engulfed government,says Conservative MP Tobias Elwood.,external Elwood represents Bournemouth East and is Chair of the House of
Commons Defence Select Committee. He quizzed Johnson earlier at the Liaison Committee meeting. ""We have a patriotic duty to conclude this,"" he
tweeted. ""It's not just damaging the Conservative brand and
diminishing our own electoral prospects it is also undermining the nationâs
standing internationally. ""Britain is better than this."" Meanwhile, there have been three more resignations from Johnson's government. Taking the number of ministers and aides that have resigned - or been sacked - up to at least 41. Danny Krugerhas now resigned as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities - Michael Gove's former department. Kruger says he's ""very sorry indeed to hear Michael Gove has been fired"". James Daly, parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Work and Pensions, resigned from his role ""with great regret"". In aletter,externalDaly says Johnson is ""sadly unable to lead our government"". David Mundellalso resigned from his role as trade envoy to New Zealand. In atweet,externalMundell says he has no confidence in the PM and is ""very disappointed"". We've been hearing from a No 10 source who has been talking about why the PM is staying on. ""There is no lectern outside No 10 tonight... the PM fights on,"" the source says. Any suggestion there's a procession of cabinet ministers telling Johnson to go ""is not true"", the source claims, adding: ""He's called their bluff."" ""He has been spelling out to them [cabinet ministers] that 14 million people voted for him,"" the source says, adding that if the Conservative Party ""want to deprive him [Johnson] doing that job, they have take to take that mandate off them"". The source adds that Johnson explained to cabinet ministers tonight that the options are not ""Boris or no Boris"". Rather, it's about giving Johnson either a ""fresh chancellor and new programme, that Rishi was not prepared to do"" or ""spend months ripping each other apart to elect a leader without a mandate - coalition of chaos and Labour who will break up Britain"". Michael Gove and Boris Johnson worked together on the Vote Leave campaign Michael Gove is a senior and long-standing figure in the Conservative Party and has served in a strong of high-level posts, from his 2010 appointment as Education Secretary onwards. He has been Chief Whip, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Justice Secretary and Environment Secretary, as well as the role he was just sacked from, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Gove worked closely with Johnson on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. He has remained loyal to Johnson since he became prime minister. However, during the 2016 Conservative leadership race he initially backed Boris Johnson but later dramatically withdrew his backing, announcing he would run himself. That contest was ultimately won by Theresa May. Gove also ran
against Johnson in the 2019 Tory leadership race. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
