"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have not invited Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn to their wedding. The decision not to have an ""official list"" of political leaders in attendance also means that US President Donald Trump will not be invited. The decision was made based on the church's size and the fact Prince Harry is only fifth in line to the throne. It has also been confirmed that Barack and Michelle Obama, who are friends of the prince, have not been invited. Royal wedding: What we know so far Harry and Meghan choose wedding flowers Royal wedding invite heading to cafe Among the 1,200 members of the public who will be allowed into the grounds of Windsor Castle on 19 May will be a 12-year-old girl injured in the Manchester Arena attack. Amelia Thompson, from Dronfield Woodhouse, near Sheffield, was left traumatised after witnessing the bomb blow up after the Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. She also damaged her vocal cords from screaming in horror. Amelia wants to take along a grandmother bereaved in the Manchester Arena bombing As her plus one, the schoolgirl will take grandmother Sharon Goodman, whose grand-daughter Olivia Campbell-Hardy died in the bombing. The decision to invite those with a close relationship to the couple but not ""an official list of political leaders"" was taken in consultation with the government, Kensington Palace said. By contrast the invitation list for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 - reflecting the groom's position as a future monarch - included foreign royals, Commonwealth governors-general, ambassadors, senior religious figures and many politicians from around the world. The then-Prime Minister David Cameron, deputy PM Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband were among those who attended. US President Barack Obama was not a guest, but Australian PM Julia Gillard and New Zealand PM John Key were among the leaders from Commonwealth countries invited. Prince Harry's wedding will be a very different occasion, as well as being considerably smaller, and an early decision was taken to invite members of the public into the castle grounds on the day. Individuals were chosen by the regional Lord Lieutenant offices after the couple asked for people with a range of backgrounds and ages. Reuben Litherland's mother Jacinta said her son deserved the invitation as he does all the work for deaf-friendly cinema screenings himself Those who have received an invitation to the outside area include Reuben Litherland, 14, from Derby, in recognition of his work for the deaf community. Reuben, who campaigns for deaf-friendly screenings at cinemas, said: ""I opened the letter and I couldn't believe it... we danced around."" Also invited is Pamela Anomneze, 52, from Haringey in north London, who works at an organisation which helps people with mental illness through art and crafts. The mother-of-three said she initially thought the invite was an ""April Fool's prank"", adding it is ""truly unbelievable"". Ms Anomneze said she will take her son Jude, 15, as her plus one because he ""was down on his knees begging to go"" and saying: ""Oh mum, just to get a glimpse of Meghan Markle!""' Pamela Anomneze was invited because of her work at an arts organisation helping people with mental health issues Meanwhile, primary school teacher David Gregory from Blyth, Northumberland, who has started a recycling initiative and STEM club at his school, also received an invite. He will go to the castle in the suit he wore at his own wedding last May, as the next day marks his and his wife Hannah's first anniversary. Members of the public who are on the guest-list are invited to bring their own picnic to the castle grounds. Rosie Grinday, the founder of the Birmingham-based social enterprise Miss Macaroon, was invited because of the training her business provides to disadvantaged young people. She said she will be taking some of her macaroons to the royal wedding as part of her picnic. Royal duo seek donations instead of gifts Are you the ultimate Royal Wedding fan?

"More shops closed than opened in the UK last year New stores are opening on UK High Streets at their lowest rate in seven years, research suggests. The Local Data Company, which studied the top 500 British town centres, found there were 4,083 new store openings in 2017, the lowest since 2010. But with 5,855 outlets closing in 2017, a total of 1,772 shops disappeared. Clothing and shoe shops closed at the fastest rate, while the number of beauty salons, coffee shops, ice-cream parlours and bookshops increased. Lisa Hooker at PwC, which commissioned the research, said 2017 had been ""tough for the British retail industry, especially the second half of the year"". She said many retailers were increasingly feeling the impact of online shopping, with the fashion business, banking, travel agents and estate agents all losing a significant number of outlets as a result. The failure of wage growth to keep pace with inflation had also forced many shoppers to think more carefully about their spending habits. However, Ms Hooker added: ""It's important to remember the British High Street still plays a vital role in society and there are elements of growth amongst the headline numbers of decline. ""For example, almost 400 new clothes shops opened last year, even though over 700 closed. And, while four pubs a week closed, at the same time three a week opened."" Six reasons behind High Street crisis Five ways to fix ailing High Streets Would you sleep in your favourite shop? Store closures were unevenly spread across the country. Greater London fared worst, with a net loss of 336 shops, while south-eastern England lost 185 and eastern England lost 184. Scotland suffered a net loss of 148 shops, while Wales ended the year with 53 fewer shops. No region of the country saw a net gain. Lucy Stainton, a senior relationship manager at the Local Data Company, said 2018 would be a year when new entrants and younger brands took advantage of the ""shake-out"" in retail, seeing it as an opportunity to pick up available property. She added: ""Businesses with a relevant proposition and a strong understanding of their customer can absolutely still thrive in the right locations. Equally, more established brands who continue to tweak their offer and innovate on the way through will no doubt see positive results and retain their valued place on our High Streets."" You might be thinking that retail's on its knees given the grim headlines these last few months. The high street isn't dead but it is changing. And these figures reveal the shift. Once again, beauty salons, nail bars and coffee shops are filling the gaps. Ice cream parlours are also flavour of the month, for now at least. But the number of clothing stores continues to shrink. The big fashion chains don't need as many stores as they once did as shoppers buy more online. Retailers are facing an array of challenges including rising costs and consumers with less money to spend. What disposable income they do have, less of it is going into retail. And businesses are having to adapt. 2018 is shaping up to be just as tough, judging by the first quarter of this year.

"This video can not be played The magnetic signal from the tides is extremely small This is the European Space Agency's spectacular new view of ocean tides as they sweep around the Earth. The movie shows not the bulging movement of water directly, but rather its magnetic signature. As the Moon pulls the salty seas through our planet's global magnetic field, electric currents are generated. And these currents then induce their own magnetic signals, which have now been mapped in exquisite detail by a trio of Esa satellites known as Swarm. It is a remarkable achievement because the effect is actually very small. ""It's a really tiny magnetic field. It's about 2-2.5 nanotesla at satellite altitude, which is about 20,000 times weaker than the Earth's global magnetic field,"" Nils Olsen, from the Technical University of Denmark, told BBC News. The professor was speaking at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly (EGU) in Vienna, Austria, where a clutch of new Swarm results have been released. When we discovered how the Earth really works Iron 'jet stream' sensed in Earth's core Design call for 'solar sentinel' mission This video can not be played Nils Olsen: Ocean tidal magnetism also tells us about electrical properties below the seafloor The mission was sent into orbit in 2013 to bring fresh insight on Earth's magnetic behaviour. Most of the global field is produced by convection of molten iron in the planet's outer core. But there are secondary components that contribute to the overall signal - such as that coming from the oceans. Other satellites will sense the tides as a change in sea-surface height. What is different about the Swarm trio's magnetic view is that it reveals the movement of the entire water column, right down to the seabed. This is important for climate studies. The oceans store and transport vast amounts of heat energy, and getting the more integrated perspective from Swarm enables scientists to build better models of the Earth system. Artwork: The Swarm satellites fly a few hundred km above the Earth's surface There were hopes before Swarm launched that it might even be possible to tease out the magnetism related to specific currents as well, such as the famous Gulf Stream that shifts warm waters across the North Atlantic. The desire is still there, but Prof Olsen is a little pessimistic. It is the well-known periodicity of the Moon's orbit around the Earth that helps betray the tidal signature. The Gulf Stream, on the other hand, is a steady flow, and this consistency helps to keep its individual magnetism hidden amongst the much stronger components of the global field. This video can not be played Crustal magnetic map: The addition of aeroplane and ship data resolves the field still further One of these bigger signatures is the magnetism retained in the planet's surface rocks. And Swarm's most detailed map yet of this aspect was also released at the EGU meeting. It incorporates four years of Swarm measurements, data from a previous German spacecraft called Champ, and information gathered by aeroplanes and ships. Regional features as small as 50km across can be discerned. Easy to spot are the famous ""zebra stripes"" at mid-ocean ridges where upwelling magma creates new seafloor and locks the prevailing magnetic field into cooling rock minerals. The discovery of the stripes in the 1960s was a major proof in the theory of plate tectonics. ""Magnetic fields are one of the keys to understand the sub-surface of the planet, in combination with other pieces of information such as gravity and seismic measurements,"" said Rune Floberghagen, Esa's Swarm mission manager. ""In the end this will allow us to determine the best ever model of the upper layers of the planet. This is the very clear, sworn ambition of the Swarm mission."" The EGU General Assembly has been treated to a bounty of Swarm results to fascinate the specialists. But there is one observation that will certainly have more general interest - that of the position of the north magnetic pole. Most people know that it is not aligned with the geographic north pole and instead drifts around. Recent decades have seen it shift in a direction that is taking it away from Canada towards Russia. Swarm is watching this movement closely. ""This year we are in a rather special situation because in 2018 the magnetic pole will be at its closest to the geographic pole. There is a separation of only 390km. The magnetic pole moves at a speed of about 55km per year,"" said Prof Olsen. The expectation is that the gap between the two versions of the pole will widen again from next year. The drift of the magnetic north pole is towards Russia Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Actor Damian Lewis British actor Damian Lewis will be playing Toronto's controversial former mayor Rob Ford in an upcoming film. The Hollywood Reporter,externalsays the actor has been cast to play the mayor, who died in 2016, in a drama called Run This Town. The 47-year-old Eton-educated actor is best known for his Emmy-winning role in television drama Homeland. Lewis told  Kit Magazine,externalhe has been fitted with a prosthetic to play the former mayor. The fictionalised drama is being filmed in Ford's hometown of Toronto, Canada's most populous city. Ford died at 46 after a fight with a rare cancer. He made global headlines for a drug scandal and a series of controversial comments during his time as Toronto mayor between 2010 and 2014. He faced heavy pressure to resign from both political opposition and former allies on the city council after admitting in 2013 he smoked crack cocaine while severely inebriated. US actor charged over fake bomb threat Bryce Dallas Howard was 'scared to ask for more pay' Obituary: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford He instead mounted a re-election campaign. Aside from Ford. all the other characters in the film will be fictitious. According to The Hollywood Reporter, American actor Ben Platt will play a  low-level reporter at a fictional newspaper ""who attempts to expose a scandal involving a politician who doesn't play by the rules"".

"The inquest is looking at whether Alexander Perepilichnyy died of natural causes or was unlawfully killed No plant toxins were found in a Russian businessman who it was claimed may have been poisoned, a coroner has heard. Alexander Perepilichnyy's inquest also heard conflicting reports about whether he ""feared for his life"" before his sudden death in November 2012. The businessman, who was a whistleblower in a $230m (Â£150m) money-laundering case, was found near his home in Weybridge, Surrey. The inquest resumed at the Old Bailey after being paused in June 2017. Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC previously heard two post-mortem examinations failed to find a cause of death but it was possible a poison derived from a plant may have been in his system. But Professor Monique Symmonds, a botanist at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, told the inquest she had not been able to identify any plant toxins in the specimens she tested. Suspicion had been raised by a high level of iron in a sample from his stomach but no traces of a toxin which might have caused it were found, the inquest was told. Mr Hilliard also heard from a corporate lawyer who represented Mr Perepilichnyy in several ""very complicated"" debt cases in Russia. A camera phone photo taken at the scene shows a covered body in the road Dimitry Lipkin said his client missed a court case in Russia in March 2011 because he was ""fearful for his life"" if he returned to his homeland. The Russian court did not ask for any further evidence about the threats and Mr Lipkin said he had no further information on who Mr Perepilichnyy was fearful of or why. Mr Perepilichnny won the case against loans recovery company Dzhirsa, Mr Lipkin said, and died a month after the firm lost its appeal. Dzhirsa has previously been linked with Dmitry Kovtun, one of the alleged killers of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, the inquest heard. Extractsfrom an article in the Daily Telegraph in 2012,external, in which Mr Kovtun said he was the firm's founder, were read out in court. The inquest also heard from two of Mr Perepilichnyy's brothers-in-law and a Swiss lawyer all of whom said they did not believe he was fearful. Ruslan Gursky, a brother-in-law who lives in Ukraine, said speculation about the deceased was ""highly dubious"" while Rishat Ismagilov, whose sister was married to Mr Perepilichnyy, said claims the family had fled to the UK were ""false"". In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Ismagilov said the coroner should confine himself to finding a cause of death with any further investigation into claims about Mr Perepilichnyy's life being a ""logical nonsense and legal absurdity"". Both men said Mr Perepilichnyy was jogging more to lose weight. The Swiss lawyer Francois Roger Micheli, who had met with the Russian as part of the money-laundering investigation,  also told the inquest ""at no moment did [Mr Perepilichnyy] indicate he felt threatened or unsafe"".

"This video can not be played Call for full 'child sexual exploitation inquiry' for Telford An immediate inquiry is to be held into current and historical child sexual abuse in Telford. A Sunday Mirror article last month claimed 1,000 children may have been abused,externalin the town since the 1980s. Until Saturday, senior councillors had called for the government to take the lead on any investigation. But now Labour councillors have backed a motion by the opposition Conservative group in a unanimous decision to set up an independent, council-led inquiry. Midlands Live: Two-year-old boy in fatal crash named; suspected shooting at petrol station About 250 campaigners gathered outside the meeting to call for an inquiry At the weekend, council leader Shaun Davies said he had come to the conclusion a ""council inquiry is better than none"", however a council inquiry would only go ahead if the national inquiry into child sexual exploitation (CSE), the Jay Inquiry, decided not to investigate Telford. Conservative opposition councillors said they were ""extremely concerned"" about any delay to an investigation. Calling for an immediate inquiry, Conservative councillor Andrew Eade said: ""I do hope we have an opportunity to do the right thing and unite this divided council"". A statement on behalf of the victims, read by Conservative councillor Nicola Lowery, said: ""We deserve answers, our families deserve answers, answers the national inquiry will take years to deliver. ""The inquiry needs to start now. Things need to change. We want to be part of that change."" A review published in 2016 concluded there were ""far more"" victims of child sexual exploitation than those who had come forward Mr Davies and other senior councillors had previously said a government-led inquiry would have have greater powers to gather evidence and would be perceived as more independent. However, the proposal was swiftly rejected by the Home Office last month. Standing in for Mr Davies, who could not attend Tuesday's council meeting due to illness, Labour councillor Lee Carter said the council is ""going to move very quickly"". ""This town is hurting,"" he said. ""We've got to do everything we can to put this right."" The council said it is going to ""move quickly"" Conservative MP for Telford Lucy Allan said she was ""delighted"" there will be an inquiry and the authorities have ""a real opportunity to communicate to victims that they were not at fault, they have nothing to be ashamed of, and they can now come forward"". She said there had been a lot of ""wriggling"" and ""squirming"" from the Labour-run council in bringing an inquiry and suggested Mr Davies should stand aside as council leader. ""If I was him that's what I'd do,"" she said. The council last published a review into child sexual exploitation in the town in 2016 following the jailing of seven men in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police'sOperation Chalice. The report concluded,externalit was ""clear that CSE is still taking place in Telford and Wrekin, although the true scale of this crime is unknown"". The year before, Telford and Wrekin recorded more child sex offences per capita than anywhere else in England and Wales, according to Home Office figures. If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You canreport it online,externalto the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (CEOP). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support.

"This video can not be played CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn says British business does not want a bonfire of regulations after Brexit Diverging from European Union rules after Brexit will mean more costs than benefits for British business, a report by the CBI employers' group says. In a survey of 23 industry sectors, the vast majority preferred continued close alignment with EU regulations. Agriculture, shipping and tourism might benefit, but this was ""vastly outweighed"" by the impact on other sectors, the CBI said. However, critics said the report just promoted the interests of big business. The report, called Smooth Operations, suggests the UK could still exert influence over important regulatory decisions through continued membership of the many EU agencies - such as the ones governing aerospace and chemicals - in which other non-EU nations like Turkey currently participate. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was no appetite on the part of business for a bonfire of regulations, and called on the government to prioritise evidence over ideology in the negotiations over a future trade deal. ondon's financial centre has big concerns about diverging from EU regulations She said: ""It's vitally important that negotiators understand the complexity of rules and the effects that even the smallest of changes can have. ""Deviation from rules in one sector will have a knock-on effect on businesses in others, and divergence from rules in one part of a production process will have consequences for market access throughout entire supply chains. ""Put simply, for the majority of businesses, diverging from EU rules and regulations will make them less globally competitive, and so should only be done where the evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the costs."" But pro-Brexit groups dismissed the report for ignoring the benefits to vast sections of Britain's economy.

However, worries among some businesses about post-Brexit trade rules were underlined in interviews for the BBC's Today programme being broadcast on Wednesday. One of Europe's most senior bankers has warned the City of London that it needs to be ready for a ""cliff edge"" exit from the EU next year. Andreas Dombret, director of the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said a transition deal, though positive, was not 100% certain and it was correct for a cautious regulator to ensure there was a plan in place should it fail to happen. Meanwhile, Ian Robertson, special adviser to BMW's board, told the BBC that it was vital for carmakers across Europe that there was ""seamless flow"" of goods across borders. He said the car giant, whose brands include Mini, was already spending money on planning for new paperwork and technical requirements once Britain leaves the EU.

"Mr Bossert was behind the White House initiative on cyber security issues US Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert has resigned in the latest of a string of administration departures, the White House confirmed. President Donald Trump ""is grateful for Tom's commitment to the safety and security of our great country,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. His exit comes just a day after former UN Ambassador John Bolton took over as Mr Trump's national security adviser. Nearly 30 White House officials have resigned or been fired under Mr Trump. The White House statement on Tuesday did not include a reason why Mr Bossert was leaving. ""Tom led the White House's efforts to protect the homeland from terrorist threats, strengthen our cyber defences, and respond to an unprecedented series of natural disasters,"" Mrs Sander's statement continued. ""President Trump thanks him for his patriotic service and wishes him well."" The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face? Mr Bossert, who served as assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, was reportedly pushed out, according to CBS News. This video can not be played Who is Trump's new national security adviser John Bolton? His departure comes amid a staff shakeup, sparked by Mr Bolton taking over as a key counsellor to the president on national security and foreign policy issues. Mr Bolton, a Bush-era defence hawk, succeeded HR McMaster as Mr Trump's third national security chief in 14 months. Trump's National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton also resigned a day before Mr Bolton began his new role. Tara McKelvey, BBC News White House Reporter, Washington Bossert's departure matters - unlike some of those who've served in the administration, he knows his subject and was thoroughly prepared for his job. Like many of us in Washington, he was deeply affected by 9/11 and says: ""It is why I got into this business."" He served in the George W Bush administration as deputy homeland security adviser, and before going to work for Trump he spoke to all those who'd once held his job and asked for advice. Bossert had a friendly manner, assisting me and other reporters with questions while we were in the West Wing and on Air Force One (once he helped me get back to Washington when our flight got re-routed). Soon he'll be gone - along with a wealth of knowledge about an area that's become a key part of the Trump doctrine. On Sunday, Mr Bossert defended Mr Trump's policy priorities in an interview with ABC News. ""We've got a leaking boat on our border, and we're all quibbling with how much water's in the boat,"" he said, defending Mr Trump's decision to send the US national guard to the southern border. He also vowed that ""all options"" are on the table regarding a US response to a suspected chemical attack in Syria, and defended Mr Trump's comments that he hopes to soon withdraw US troops from that country. ""For too long and the United States of America has been taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the entire world.. American troops aren't going to fix the six or seven different ongoing conflicts and wars going on in the Middle East or in Syria at this stage"". The White House did not specify a reason for Mr Bossert's departure US Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement: ""Since the beginning of this Administration, Tom Bossert has provided wise counsel to the President on Homeland security issues. Over the last fifteen months I have enjoyed working with Tom on a range of current and emerging threats to our nation - particularly in cyber security and disaster response.

"Rupert Murdoch is executive chairman of 21st Century Fox Rupert Murdoch's film and media giant 21st Century Fox says it is cooperating with the European Commission after officials raided its Fox Network offices in London. EC competition authorities are reported to have seized documents relating to sport media rights earlier on Tuesday. Other companies involved in sports rights have also received what the EC called ""unannounced inspections"". It is unclear which other companies were raided and when. ""The commission has concerns that the companies involved may have violated EU anti-trust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices,""the European Commission said in a statement,external. ""Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step into suspected anti-competitive practices."" The statement said it ""does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour, nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself"". Sports broadcasting has become a huge business in Europe and the US, with networks spending billions of pounds to secure exclusive rights to show games in top-flight leagues to attract viewers. Fox Networks Group is an operating unit of Fox, which distributes TV and cable channels and content around the world. ""Fox Networks Group is cooperating fully with the EC inspection,"" a spokesman said. The move comes amida shake-up of Mr Murdoch's empire. 21st Century Fox has agreed to sell most of its entertainment assets, including its stake in Sky, to Disney for $52.4bn. But in February, US giant Comcast offered $31bn for Sky. As part of the shake-up and deal with Disney, 21st Century is trying to buy the 61% of Sky it does not own,a proposal that has run into problems with the UK competition authorities. The Commission said there was no legal deadline to complete inquiries into anti-competitive conduct and EC investigations can be lengthy.

"Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has told the US Senate that privacy lapses are his responsibility ""It's clear now that we didnât do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,"" he says Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy linked to the Trump campaign, scraped data from 87m Facebook users Zuckerberg, 33, is worth about $64bn, and is one of the world's youngest billionaires Max Matza and Taylor Kate Brown The hearing is still rolling on, and Zuckerberg has
barely broken a sweat after several hours of grilling. After a nervy start, he almost seems to be enjoying himself. To recap, he apologised to US senators
for allowing several other firms to misuse his platform's personal data for
political ends. He said it was his personal mistake. On the subject of fake news, a
contrite Zuckerberg said ""one of my greatest regrets in running
the company"" was its slowness at uncovering and acting against disinformation
campaigns by Russian trolls during the US election. He said Facebook will investigate
""tens of thousands"" of apps to discover if any other companies have
accessed data in a similar way to Cambridge Analytica. You can follow all the latesthere. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg testifies Zuckerberg is shrewd enough not to appear big headed. Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan tees one up for him about his achievement in creating the world's biggest social network. ""Guy in a dorm room... could only happen in America, right?"" Zuckerberg: ""There are some strong Chinese internet companies."" Sullivan interrupts, and tells him it's a softball question: ""The answer is yes,"" the senator laughs. ""Is Facebook too powerful?"" a senator asks. ""Are you too powerful? Do you think you're too powerful?"" Zuckerberg says that of the more than two billion Facebook users on Earth, many are outside the US. ""That's something that Americans should be proud of,"" the chief executive says. Senator Mazie Hirono asks Zuckerberg when Facebook goes to law enforcement. When there's immediate harm, he says. Zuckerberg says Facebook would decline to provide information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in deportation investigations. ""We're going to push back aggressively,"" he said. Some people on Twitter think Zuckerberg mentions Facebook's Harvard dorm origin story too much... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""You're a dad,"" one senator notes, before asking if social media is addictive for teenagers. ""This is certainly something that I think any parent thinks about, how much do you want your kids using technology,"" Zuckerberg says. ""I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like, but building services that are good for people and good for society as well."" ""Like any tool, there are good and bad uses of it,"" he adds. ""If you're interacting [with friends], that is associated with the long-term measures of well-being,"" he says. But he adds that those who ""passively view content"" may feel negative effects. The senator asks if Facebook studies ""dopamine feedback loops"" to keep people from leaving the platform.

Zuckerberg says he would support ""in principle"" US
legislation to require user permission before their data is used. He tells
Senator Ed Markey that details of the legislation would matter and he looks
forward to further talks. Delaware Senator Chris Coons says there's a tension between Zuckerberg's ""bold promises"" on privacy and the reality that Facebook is a ""for-profit"" entity that made $40bn last year. ""There's lots of examples"" where ad targeting becomes extremely effective in violating laws - including cases of discriminatory housing ads - and targeting people who would be most harmed, Coons says, like gambling ads for those with gambling addictions, liquor ads for alcoholics.

Zuckerberg is told âpeople have no earthly idea of what theyâre signing up forâ in Facebook's terms of service. Democratic Senator Brian Schatz: ""If I'm emailing within WhatsApp [which Facebook owns] about
Black Panther [the movie], do I get a Black Panther banner ad?"" Zuckerberg: ""Facebook systems do not see the
content of messages being transmitted over WhatsApp."" Senator: ""Yeah, I know. But thatâs not what Iâm
asking. Iâm asking whether these systems talk to each other without a human
being touching it?"" Zuckerberg
looks perturbed as he responds: ""Senator, I think the answer to your specific question is if you message someone about Black Panther on WhatsApp, it would not inform any
ads."" Zuckerberg has told the congressional panel that ""terms of service are what they are"", adding that users do not have the option to amend what they agree to. He also says it would be impossible for the company to know if foreign citizens or governments were creating shell companies to purchase adverts on Facebook without being publicly identified. On Twitter, several users have pointed out that it would be very easy for a person or government - or ""malicious actor"", as senators have called them - to create a shell corporation to hide their adverts' intent. US lawmakers are currently considering regulations that would require adverts to come with a label, saying who had payed for them. Senator Ted Cruz: ""Does Facebook consider itself to be a neutral public forum?"" Zuckerberg: ""We consider ourselves to be a platform for all ideas."" Allow Twitter content?

Here's that deliciously awkward moment from earlier in the hearing. This video can not be played Senator to Zuckerberg: 'Where did you stay last night?' Senator Richard Blumenthal says: ""Your business model is to monetise
user information to maximise profit over privacy. ""And unless there are specific rules
and requirements enforced by an outside agency I have no assurance that these
kinds of vague commitments are going to produce action.â The Connecticut Democrat says
companies ought to be required to provide users with clear and plain
information about how their data will be used. ""Senator, I do generally agree with
what you're saying,"" says Zuckerberg. ""Would you agree to an opt-in, as opposed
to an opt-out?"" Zuckerberg noncommitally responds: ""Senator,
I think that that certainly makes sense to discuss and I think the details around
this matter a lot."" In one of the more testy exchanges, Texas Republican Ted Cruz demands to know how many Facebook employees have backed Republican candidates in the past. ""Of those 15 to 20,000 people engaged in content review, how many - if any - have ever supported financially or politically a Republican candidate for office?"" ""Senator, I do not know that,"" Zuckerberg responds. Facebook has previously been accused of a pro-liberal bias. PS: Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign used Cambridge Analytica.

""We can do a few more,"" he suggests as the testimony passes its second hour. ""Maybe, 15 minutes. Does that work?"" he said to laughter in the room. The senators seem happy to keep the question and answer session going. ""There's a very common misconception about Facebook, that we sell data to advertisers,"" says Zuckerberg. ""And we we do not sell data to advertisers."" The senator interjects: ""Well, you clearly rent it."" ""Um, what we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach and then we do the placement.""

"A 100m buffer zone will be created to stop vigils being held outside the building A buffer zone will be created at a west London abortion clinic to stop vigils being held outside the building. Ealing councillors unanimously voted to implement a safe zone around the Marie Stopes clinic after women complained of intimidation by protesters. The Good Counsel Network, which holds daily vigils outside the centre in Mattock Lane, denies harassing women. The decision means both anti-abortion and pro-choice campaigners cannot stand within 100 metres of the clinic. Applause in broke out in the Ealing council cabinet room following the decision, but a protestor then interrupted the meeting and accused the council of taking away their rights. Richard Bentley, Marie Stopes UK managing director, said: ""This is a landmark decision for women. ""This was never about protest. It was about small groups of strangers choosing to gather by our entrance gates where they could harass and intimidate women and try to prevent them from accessing healthcare to which they are legally entitled."" The Good Counsel Network says women are not being offered enough alternatives Rival campaigners gathered outside the council building while the vote was taken. More than 300 people wrote to the council describing the pro-life protesters as ""intimidating and harassing"", while those against abortion have said women are not being offered enough alternatives. A report,externalpresented to the council cabinet concluded that, following unsuccessful attempts to negotiate an informal ""safe zone"" near the clinic entrance, a public spaces protection order was appropriate. The report also states the ""continued deployment of policing resources"" outside the clinic was an ""unusual and unnecessary use of local policing resources that could be deployed elsewhere"". The decision could pave the way for other councils to follow suit. Elizabeth Howard, a spokeswoman for Be Here for Me, said: ""It's what we expected, after really what can only be described as a sham consultation by the council. ""We're here to support women who maybe feel they don't have any other choice than abortion and don't want an abortion."" Council leader Julian Bell said he felt the cabinet had done ""absolutely"" the right thing. He said: ""I believe that this is something that's long been needed, so it feels good that we are actually breaking the ground with this and leading the way. ""I'm personally a practising Christian myself and so I think it's important to recognise that this is about protecting women from harassment and intimidation.""

Tara McKelvey, BBC News White House Reporter, Washington Bossert's departure matters - unlike some of those who've served in the administration, he knows his subject and was thoroughly prepared for his job. Like many of us in Washington, he was deeply affected by 9/11 and says: ""It is why I got into this business."" He served in the George W Bush administration as deputy homeland security adviser, and before going to work for Trump he spoke to all those who'd once held his job and asked for advice. Bossert had a friendly manner, assisting me and other reporters with questions while we were in the West Wing and on Air Force One (once he helped me get back to Washington when our flight got re-routed). Soon he'll be gone - along with a wealth of knowledge about an area that's become a key part of the Trump doctrine. On Sunday, Mr Bossert defended Mr Trump's policy priorities in an interview with ABC News. ""We've got a leaking boat on our border, and we're all quibbling with how much water's in the boat,"" he said, defending Mr Trump's decision to send the US national guard to the southern border. He also vowed that ""all options"" are on the table regarding a US response to a suspected chemical attack in Syria, and defended Mr Trump's comments that he hopes to soon withdraw US troops from that country. ""For too long and the United States of America has been taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the entire world.. American troops aren't going to fix the six or seven different ongoing conflicts and wars going on in the Middle East or in Syria at this stage"". The White House did not specify a reason for Mr Bossert's departure US Department of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement: ""Since the beginning of this Administration, Tom Bossert has provided wise counsel to the President on Homeland security issues. Over the last fifteen months I have enjoyed working with Tom on a range of current and emerging threats to our nation - particularly in cyber security and disaster response. We at DHS thank him for his partnership and service and wish him the best as he takes new steps in his career."" John Bolton: Who is man behind Trump-Xi allegations?

"This video can not be played Suspected chemical attack is 'barbaric' - May Theresa May looks ready to join military action against the Assad regime in Syria without first seeking parliamentary consent, well-placed sources have told the BBC. The prime minister is said by government insiders to see the need for a response as urgent. She wants to prevent a repeat of the apparent chemical attack near Damascus, which she described as ""abhorrent"". Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has warned that bombing could escalate the situation. Mrs May is understood to be reluctant to ask US President Donald Trump to hold off any action until she has the opportunity to consult MPs at Westminster. Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Trump says missiles 'will be coming' Corbyn warns against US-Russia 'hot war' Formally, she has yet to unequivocally point the finger of blame at the Assad government, the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar said. She has spoken of the need for action ""if"" the regime is found to bear responsibility, he added, but the strong assumption in Downing Street and Whitehall is the attack will be attributed to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Action is thought likely to follow within days. Mrs May earlier described the use of chemical weapons as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" that ""cannot go unchallenged"". She did not comment on Donald Trump's tweet warning Russia to ""get ready"" for missiles being fired at its ally Syria. By the BBC's Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar The prime minister's instinct is to chew carefully on the decision of whether and how Britain should support action in response to the apparent chemical attack in Syria. She still speaks of the need to act ""if"" not ""as"" the Assad regime is responsible. But the uncomfortable truth is the form of action is beyond her control. Read John's full blog Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC that Parliament ""should always be given a say on any military action"". ""We don't want bombardment which leads to escalation and a hot war between the US and Russia over the skies of Syria,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable did not rule out backing military but he said Parliament would have to give its approval and there would have to be ""some strong conditions around it"". Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Russia has described the reports of the chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention against the Syrian regime. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Military action risks escalating Syria crisis Mrs May described the alleged chemical attack as a ""shocking, barbaric act"" and said she was ""appalled but not surprised"" at Russia, which vetoed a US-drafted UN resolution proposing a new inquiry to establish who was to blame. She said investigations were continuing but that ""all the indications"" were that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible. The UK and its allies were looking at ways to ""prevent and deter"" the use of chemical weapons, she added. On Tuesday she spoke on the phone with US President Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, agreeing their three countries would work together to take action to ""uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons"". The SNP called for action against the Syria government, including blocking its ""purchasing and importing abilities"" and sanctions against key people and companies. The party's defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said that while the case for action was clear, air strikes ""will not provide the long term solutions needed to end the war"". The fallout from the attack has sparked a war of words on who was responsible and what the response should be. On Twitter, President Trump responded to a warning from Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,"" he wrote. Why is there a war in Syria? ""Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'"" On Tuesday President Macron said that if military action was taken, it would target ""the regime's chemical capabilities"", and not the forces of its allies, Russia or Iran. Speaking in Paris, he said he did ""not want an escalation"" and that a decision would be made in the coming days. The information that France had showed ""chemical weapons were indeed used and that the regime could clearly be held responsible"", Mr Macron added. On Tuesday the UN Security Council failed to approve moves to set up an inquiry into the alleged attack on Douma. As permanent members of the council, Russia and the US vetoed each other's proposals to set up independent investigations. The US-drafted resolution would have allowed investigators to apportion blame for the suspected attack, while Russia's version would have left that to the Security Council. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had said earlier that inspectors would travel to the town to investigate.

"Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has told the US Senate that privacy lapses are his responsibility ""It's clear now that we didnât do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,"" he says Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy linked to the Trump campaign, scraped data from 87m Facebook users Zuckerberg, 33, is worth about $64bn, and is one of the world's youngest billionaires Max Matza and Taylor Kate Brown The hearing is still rolling on, and Zuckerberg has
barely broken a sweat after several hours of grilling. After a nervy start, he almost seems to be enjoying himself. To recap, he apologised to US senators
for allowing several other firms to misuse his platform's personal data for
political ends. He said it was his personal mistake. On the subject of fake news, a
contrite Zuckerberg said ""one of my greatest regrets in running
the company"" was its slowness at uncovering and acting against disinformation
campaigns by Russian trolls during the US election. He said Facebook will investigate
""tens of thousands"" of apps to discover if any other companies have
accessed data in a similar way to Cambridge Analytica. You can follow all the latesthere. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg testifies Zuckerberg is shrewd enough not to appear big headed. Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan tees one up for him about his achievement in creating the world's biggest social network. ""Guy in a dorm room... could only happen in America, right?"" Zuckerberg: ""There are some strong Chinese internet companies."" Sullivan interrupts, and tells him it's a softball question: ""The answer is yes,"" the senator laughs. ""Is Facebook too powerful?"" a senator asks. ""Are you too powerful? Do you think you're too powerful?"" Zuckerberg says that of the more than two billion Facebook users on Earth, many are outside the US. ""That's something that Americans should be proud of,"" the chief executive says. Senator Mazie Hirono asks Zuckerberg when Facebook goes to law enforcement. When there's immediate harm, he says. Zuckerberg says Facebook would decline to provide information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in deportation investigations. ""We're going to push back aggressively,"" he said.

""You're a dad,"" one senator notes, before asking if social media is addictive for teenagers. ""This is certainly something that I think any parent thinks about, how much do you want your kids using technology,"" Zuckerberg says. ""I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like, but building services that are good for people and good for society as well."" ""Like any tool, there are good and bad uses of it,"" he adds. ""If you're interacting [with friends], that is associated with the long-term measures of well-being,"" he says. But he adds that those who ""passively view content"" may feel negative effects. The senator asks if Facebook studies ""dopamine feedback loops"" to keep people from leaving the platform.

legislation to require user permission before their data is used. He tells
Senator Ed Markey that details of the legislation would matter and he looks
forward to further talks. Delaware Senator Chris Coons says there's a tension between Zuckerberg's ""bold promises"" on privacy and the reality that Facebook is a ""for-profit"" entity that made $40bn last year. ""There's lots of examples"" where ad targeting becomes extremely effective in violating laws - including cases of discriminatory housing ads - and targeting people who would be most harmed, Coons says, like gambling ads for those with gambling addictions, liquor ads for alcoholics.

Zuckerberg is told âpeople have no earthly idea of what theyâre signing up forâ in Facebook's terms of service. Democratic Senator Brian Schatz: ""If I'm emailing within WhatsApp [which Facebook owns] about
Black Panther [the movie], do I get a Black Panther banner ad?"" Zuckerberg: ""Facebook systems do not see the
content of messages being transmitted over WhatsApp."" Senator: ""Yeah, I know. But thatâs not what Iâm
asking. Iâm asking whether these systems talk to each other without a human
being touching it?"" Zuckerberg
looks perturbed as he responds: ""Senator, I think the answer to your specific question is if you message someone about Black Panther on WhatsApp, it would not inform any
ads."" Zuckerberg has told the congressional panel that ""terms of service are what they are"", adding that users do not have the option to amend what they agree to. He also says it would be impossible for the company to know if foreign citizens or governments were creating shell companies to purchase adverts on Facebook without being publicly identified. On Twitter, several users have pointed out that it would be very easy for a person or government - or ""malicious actor"", as senators have called them - to create a shell corporation to hide their adverts' intent. US lawmakers are currently considering regulations that would require adverts to come with a label, saying who had payed for them. Senator Ted Cruz: ""Does Facebook consider itself to be a neutral public forum?"" Zuckerberg: ""We consider ourselves to be a platform for all ideas."" Allow Twitter content?

Here's that deliciously awkward moment from earlier in the hearing. This video can not be played Senator to Zuckerberg: 'Where did you stay last night?' Senator Richard Blumenthal says: ""Your business model is to monetise
user information to maximise profit over privacy. ""And unless there are specific rules
and requirements enforced by an outside agency I have no assurance that these
kinds of vague commitments are going to produce action.â The Connecticut Democrat says
companies ought to be required to provide users with clear and plain
information about how their data will be used. ""Senator, I do generally agree with
what you're saying,"" says Zuckerberg. ""Would you agree to an opt-in, as opposed
to an opt-out?"" Zuckerberg noncommitally responds: ""Senator,
I think that that certainly makes sense to discuss and I think the details around
this matter a lot."" In one of the more testy exchanges, Texas Republican Ted Cruz demands to know how many Facebook employees have backed Republican candidates in the past. ""Of those 15 to 20,000 people engaged in content review, how many - if any - have ever supported financially or politically a Republican candidate for office?"" ""Senator, I do not know that,"" Zuckerberg responds. Facebook has previously been accused of a pro-liberal bias. PS: Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign used Cambridge Analytica.

""We can do a few more,"" he suggests as the testimony passes its second hour. ""Maybe, 15 minutes. Does that work?"" he said to laughter in the room. The senators seem happy to keep the question and answer session going. ""There's a very common misconception about Facebook, that we sell data to advertisers,"" says Zuckerberg. ""And we we do not sell data to advertisers."" The senator interjects: ""Well, you clearly rent it."" ""Um, what we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach and then we do the placement."" Facebook, he says, just ""shows the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the adverstisers."" ""That's a very fundamental part of how our model works,"" he adds.

"This video can not be played The magnetic signal from the tides is extremely small This is the European Space Agency's spectacular new view of ocean tides as they sweep around the Earth. The movie shows not the bulging movement of water directly, but rather its magnetic signature. As the Moon pulls the salty seas through our planet's global magnetic field, electric currents are generated. And these currents then induce their own magnetic signals, which have now been mapped in exquisite detail by a trio of Esa satellites known as Swarm. It is a remarkable achievement because the effect is actually very small. ""It's a really tiny magnetic field. It's about 2-2.5 nanotesla at satellite altitude, which is about 20,000 times weaker than the Earth's global magnetic field,"" Nils Olsen, from the Technical University of Denmark, told BBC News. The professor was speaking at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly (EGU) in Vienna, Austria, where a clutch of new Swarm results have been released. When we discovered how the Earth really works Iron 'jet stream' sensed in Earth's core Design call for 'solar sentinel' mission This video can not be played Nils Olsen: Ocean tidal magnetism also tells us about electrical properties below the seafloor The mission was sent into orbit in 2013 to bring fresh insight on Earth's magnetic behaviour. Most of the global field is produced by convection of molten iron in the planet's outer core. But there are secondary components that contribute to the overall signal - such as that coming from the oceans. Other satellites will sense the tides as a change in sea-surface height. What is different about the Swarm trio's magnetic view is that it reveals the movement of the entire water column, right down to the seabed. This is important for climate studies. The oceans store and transport vast amounts of heat energy, and getting the more integrated perspective from Swarm enables scientists to build better models of the Earth system. Artwork: The Swarm satellites fly a few hundred km above the Earth's surface There were hopes before Swarm launched that it might even be possible to tease out the magnetism related to specific currents as well, such as the famous Gulf Stream that shifts warm waters across the North Atlantic. The desire is still there, but Prof Olsen is a little pessimistic. It is the well-known periodicity of the Moon's orbit around the Earth that helps betray the tidal signature. The Gulf Stream, on the other hand, is a steady flow, and this consistency helps to keep its individual magnetism hidden amongst the much stronger components of the global field. This video can not be played Crustal magnetic map: The addition of aeroplane and ship data resolves the field still further One of these bigger signatures is the magnetism retained in the planet's surface rocks. And Swarm's most detailed map yet of this aspect was also released at the EGU meeting. It incorporates four years of Swarm measurements, data from a previous German spacecraft called Champ, and information gathered by aeroplanes and ships. Regional features as small as 50km across can be discerned. Easy to spot are the famous ""zebra stripes"" at mid-ocean ridges where upwelling magma creates new seafloor and locks the prevailing magnetic field into cooling rock minerals. The discovery of the stripes in the 1960s was a major proof in the theory of plate tectonics. ""Magnetic fields are one of the keys to understand the sub-surface of the planet, in combination with other pieces of information such as gravity and seismic measurements,"" said Rune Floberghagen, Esa's Swarm mission manager. ""In the end this will allow us to determine the best ever model of the upper layers of the planet. This is the very clear, sworn ambition of the Swarm mission."" The EGU General Assembly has been treated to a bounty of Swarm results to fascinate the specialists. But there is one observation that will certainly have more general interest - that of the position of the north magnetic pole. Most people know that it is not aligned with the geographic north pole and instead drifts around. Recent decades have seen it shift in a direction that is taking it away from Canada towards Russia. Swarm is watching this movement closely. ""This year we are in a rather special situation because in 2018 the magnetic pole will be at its closest to the geographic pole. There is a separation of only 390km. The magnetic pole moves at a speed of about 55km per year,"" said Prof Olsen. The expectation is that the gap between the two versions of the pole will widen again from next year. The drift of the magnetic north pole is towards Russia Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

""You're a dad,"" one senator notes, before asking if social media is addictive for teenagers. ""This is certainly something that I think any parent thinks about, how much do you want your kids using technology,"" Zuckerberg says. ""I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like, but building services that are good for people and good for society as well."" ""Like any tool, there are good and bad uses of it,"" he adds. ""If you're interacting [with friends], that is associated with the long-term measures of well-being,"" he says. But he adds that those who ""passively view content"" may feel negative effects. The senator asks if Facebook studies ""dopamine feedback loops"" to keep people from leaving the platform.

Zuckerberg says he would support ""in principle"" US
legislation to require user permission before their data is used. He tells
Senator Ed Markey that details of the legislation would matter and he looks
forward to further talks. Delaware Senator Chris Coons says there's a tension between Zuckerberg's ""bold promises"" on privacy and the reality that Facebook is a ""for-profit"" entity that made $40bn last year. ""There's lots of examples"" where ad targeting becomes extremely effective in violating laws - including cases of discriminatory housing ads - and targeting people who would be most harmed, Coons says, like gambling ads for those with gambling addictions, liquor ads for alcoholics.

Zuckerberg is told âpeople have no earthly idea of what theyâre signing up forâ in Facebook's terms of service. Democratic Senator Brian Schatz: ""If I'm emailing within WhatsApp [which Facebook owns] about
Black Panther [the movie], do I get a Black Panther banner ad?"" Zuckerberg: ""Facebook systems do not see the
content of messages being transmitted over WhatsApp."" Senator: ""Yeah, I know. But thatâs not what Iâm
asking. Iâm asking whether these systems talk to each other without a human
being touching it?"" Zuckerberg
looks perturbed as he responds: ""Senator, I think the answer to your specific question is if you message someone about Black Panther on WhatsApp, it would not inform any
ads."" Zuckerberg has told the congressional panel that ""terms of service are what they are"", adding that users do not have the option to amend what they agree to. He also says it would be impossible for the company to know if foreign citizens or governments were creating shell companies to purchase adverts on Facebook without being publicly identified. On Twitter, several users have pointed out that it would be very easy for a person or government - or ""malicious actor"", as senators have called them - to create a shell corporation to hide their adverts' intent. US lawmakers are currently considering regulations that would require adverts to come with a label, saying who had payed for them. Senator Ted Cruz: ""Does Facebook consider itself to be a neutral public forum?"" Zuckerberg: ""We consider ourselves to be a platform for all ideas."" Allow Twitter content?

Here's that deliciously awkward moment from earlier in the hearing. This video can not be played Senator to Zuckerberg: 'Where did you stay last night?' Senator Richard Blumenthal says: ""Your business model is to monetise
user information to maximise profit over privacy. ""And unless there are specific rules
and requirements enforced by an outside agency I have no assurance that these
kinds of vague commitments are going to produce action.â The Connecticut Democrat says
companies ought to be required to provide users with clear and plain
information about how their data will be used. ""Senator, I do generally agree with
what you're saying,"" says Zuckerberg. ""Would you agree to an opt-in, as opposed
to an opt-out?"" Zuckerberg noncommitally responds: ""Senator,
I think that that certainly makes sense to discuss and I think the details around
this matter a lot."" In one of the more testy exchanges, Texas Republican Ted Cruz demands to know how many Facebook employees have backed Republican candidates in the past. ""Of those 15 to 20,000 people engaged in content review, how many - if any - have ever supported financially or politically a Republican candidate for office?"" ""Senator, I do not know that,"" Zuckerberg responds. Facebook has previously been accused of a pro-liberal bias. PS: Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign used Cambridge Analytica.

""We can do a few more,"" he suggests as the testimony passes its second hour. ""Maybe, 15 minutes. Does that work?"" he said to laughter in the room. The senators seem happy to keep the question and answer session going. ""There's a very common misconception about Facebook, that we sell data to advertisers,"" says Zuckerberg. ""And we we do not sell data to advertisers."" The senator interjects: ""Well, you clearly rent it."" ""Um, what we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach and then we do the placement.""

"This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? US President Donald Trump has cancelled his first official trip to Latin America to focus on the issue of a suspected chemical attack in Syria. He will remain in Washington to ""oversee the American response to Syria"", the White House said. Meanwhile, the global chemical weapons watchdog has said it will send a fact-finding team to the site in Douma. Medical sources say dozens were killed in the alleged attack there, but exact numbers are impossible to verify. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),externalsaid a team would deploy to Syria ""shortly"". It comes after Syria and its military backer, Russia, both said they wanted to facilitate a visit by inspectors. Syria denies being behind any chemical attack. At the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, Russia, as expected, vetoed a US proposal for a new panel to investigate and apportion blame for chemical attacks in Syria. A previous panel ended in November after Russia used its veto to stop it being renewed. US Vice-President Mike Pence will travel in President Trump's place for the Latin America trip, which begins in Peru for the Summit of the Americas. Mr Trump has promised a ""forceful"" response, and has spoken of numerous military options. His Defence Secretary, James Mattis, has also cancelled travel plans this week. Last April, after a Sarin nerve agent attack killed more than 80 people in a Syrian opposition-held town, Mr Trump ordered the firing of dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian government air base from US Navy ships in the Mediterranean. Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Why is there a war in Syria? UK's May agrees Syria action with US and France It was the first direct US military action against forces commanded by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Since Saturday's incident, Washington has been in discussion with Britain and France, raising the prospect of co-ordinated Western military action. A US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean. Mr Trump's decision to cancel his Latin America trip suggests the US response may involve a larger military operation than a limited strike, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington. French President Emmanuel Macron said that if military action was taken, it would target ""the regime's chemical capabilities"", and not the forces of its allies Russia or Iran. Speaking in Paris, he said he did ""not want an escalation"" and that a decision would be made in the coming days. The information that France has shows ""that chemical weapons were indeed used and that the regime could clearly be held responsible"", Mr Macron added. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The US and France have not released evidence to support their assessments of the alleged attack. Neither the death toll nor what exactly occurred can be verified as the area is blocked off, with access denied. UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to President Trump and President Macron in separate calls on Tuesday. Mrs May and Mr Trump had condemned Mr Assad's ""vicious disregard for human life"" and ""agreed not to allow the use of chemical weapons to continue"", the White House said. Russia has warned at the UN Security Council that US military action could have ""grave repercussions"". Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics allege that bombs filled with toxic chemicals were dropped on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus, by Syrian government forces. The Syrian-American Medical Society said more than 500 people were brought to medical centres,externalwith symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent"". It said this included breathing difficulties, bluish skin, mouth foaming, corneal burns and ""the emission of chlorine-like odour"". Viewpoint: Chemical weapons âthreat to Westâ Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack The estimates of how many people died in the suspected chemical attack range from 42 to more than 60 people, but medical groups say numbers could rise as rescue workers gain access to basements where hundreds of families had sought refuge from bombing. The French representative at the UN Security Council said poison gas had deliberately been used as it could seep down to the basements. Trump pledges 'forceful' action on Syria UK agrees on need for action Russia and US in fierce row over Syria Russia: No evidence of chemical attack Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack Trump condemns Syria for 'chemical attack' 100 years of chemical weapons.

"This video can not be played Highlights from Mark Zuckerberg's day on Capitol Hill Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has told US senators his company is in a constant battle with Russian operators seeking to exploit the social network. ""This is an arms race. They're going to keep getting better,"" he said. Mr Zuckerberg was answering questions in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data collection scandal. He also revealed Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, had interviewed Facebook staff. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Zuckerberg said he has not been among those interviewed by Mr Mueller's office. But he added: ""Our work with the special counsel is confidential and I want to make sure that in an open session I'm not revealing something that's confidential."" In February,Mr Mueller's office charged 13 Russians with interference in the 2016 election, along with three Russian companies. One was the Internet Research Agency, sometimes referred to asa ""Russian troll farm"", which the indictment said had a ""strategic goal to sow discord in the US political system"". Mr Zuckerberg said the company was now developing new tools to identify fake accounts. This video can not be played What Facebook protesters want from Zuckerberg ""There are people in Russia whose job it is to try to exploit our systems and other internet systems and other systems as well. We need to invest in getting better at this too."" The Facebook chief fended off questions from senators about how the social network might be regulated more closely. Senator John Kennedy warned him: ""I don't want to have to vote to regulate Facebook. But by God, I will. That depends on you... Your user agreement sucks."" When pressed, the 33-year-old billionaire tech titan said he would welcome regulation, if it was the ""right regulation,"" though he avoided specifics. He was appearing in front of a joint session of several US senate committees, after it was revealed in recent weeks that about 87 million people had their profile information accessed by marketing firm Cambridge Analytica. Protesters angry at the Cambridge Analytica revelations attended the hearing During the hearing, Mr Zuckerberg also said: ""It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm"" ""In retrospect it was clearly a mistake"" to believe Cambridge Analytica deleted data, without further examination He does not ""feel like"" Facebook has a monopoly That there would always be a free version of Facebook, leaving open the possibility of a paid, ad-free version of the social network Dealing with hate speech automatically has ""a higher error rate than I am happy with"" He was personally concerned about the possibility of political bias at the company By the first break in proceedings, Facebook's share price had risen by almost 5%, as markets reacted favourably to Mr Zuckerberg's performance, increasing his net worth by an estimated $3bn. The company is best known for its association with Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, and has claimed it played ""an integral part"" in Mr Trump's victory. But it says none of the data involved in the recent scandal was used to help the Trump campaign. The news that a personality quiz developed by an academic, Aleksandr Kogan, had collected data not just from the people who used it but also from their Facebook friends was revealed by newspaper investigations. Mr Kogan then sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. Both companies lay the blame on Mr Kogan. Facebook says that although users gave permission to Mr Kogan's app to collect their information, selling it on was against the terms of service. Cambridge Analytica, meanwhile, claims it did not know the information had been obtained improperly. During Mr Zuckerberg's appearance, the firm tweeted it was ""advising"" news media - through its lawyers - about coverage. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and George Mitchell are in Belfast for the anniversary The Good Friday Agreement was a ""work of genius"" which helped to preserve the concept of democracy, former US president Bill Clinton has said. He was addressing a Belfast conference to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1998 deal, which helped to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Clinton was taking part in a panel discussion with former British PM Tony Blair and former Irish PM Bertie Ahern. Mr Blair said the 1998 deal took ""real courage"" by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for ""all its faults"", the Good Friday Agreement was ""worth doing and worth keeping"". LIVE - Good Friday Agreement anniversary events Peace deal remembered - 20 years on The children of the Good Friday Agreement The Good Friday Agreement in full,external BBC - History - The Good Friday Agreement The anniversary celebrations have been overshadowed by the absence of devolution due to serious problems between Stormont's two biggest parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in. The three former leaders urged Northern Ireland's current political parties to keeping working to restore power sharing. The three men were lauded for their role in the peace process Mr Ahern said: ""The art of politics is compromise, you can't make progress without compromise. ""Compromise is when people come together and say, 'listen, this is the dilemma, this is the difficulty, this is what is unsaleable to my people' and let us try and find a way out."" Reflecting on legacy of the 1998 deal, Mr Clinton said: ""The Good Friday Agreement is a work of genius that's applicable if you care at all about preserving democracy. Bill Clinton said the deal was a ""work of surpassing genius"" ""It called for real democracy - majority rule; minority rights; individual rights; the rule of law; the end of violence; shared political decision-making; shared economic benefits."" Mr Clinton added that the deal had ""maintained the relationship with the United Kingdom, expanded the relationship with the Irish Republic, and then, let the future take its course"". ""The most interesting thing was by creating a space for the identity and the interests and the values of all the people involved - in a framework which protected democracy and let future demographic, economic and political changes take Northern Ireland wherever it would go - it was a work of surpassing genius."" This video can not be played Gerry Adams describes how he knew the Good Friday Agreement would be embraced by most of people The anniversary conference took place at Queen's University, Belfast and the panel discussion was chaired by former US Senator George Mitchell, who also chaired the 1998 talks. Mr Mitchell told the audience the Northern Ireland of today was ""unrecognisable"" and a ""better place"" than the one he worked in 20 years ago. He acknowledged there were problems at the moment, but urged current political leaders to show the same ""vision and courage that the leaders of Northern Ireland in 1998 demonstrated"". ""History will look back on this day as a reflection of how far we have come in Northern Ireland and how much further we still have to travel,"" Mr Mitchell said. This video can not be played George Mitchell: Northern Ireland is a better place now He asked the audience to give a standing ovation to the former leaders who delivered the Good Friday Agreement, hailing them as ""heroes and peacemakers"". ""Today across the western world, it's considered fashionable to demean and insult political leaders, and certainly much is deserved, but we don't pay enough attention or tribute to those political leaders who do dare greatly and succeed,"" he added. ""In Northern Ireland, these were ordinary men and women but after 700 days of failure, they joined in one day of success and they changed the course of history."" Members of the 'Class of 1998' posed for photos outside Queen's University Several former party leaders were in the audience at Queen's University Later, in a ceremony at the Ulster Hall, President Clinton and Senator Mitchell received the freedom of Belfast - the 83rd and 84th recipients of the honour. Alongside the Lord Mayor, Nuala McAllister, and with a stage filled with city councillors, the two men received a warm ovation from an invited audience. President Clinton and Senator Mitchell holding their certificates granting them Freedom of the City of Belfast The former senator, whose father's parents were from Ireland, also said that his personal role in the peace process had reconnected him with his Irish heritage. ""Many of you have thanked me for my work here. My response is that it is I who should be grateful, and I am, for you have filled an inner void that I didn't even know existed. ""I am an American and very proud of it, but a large part of my heart and of my emotions will forever be with the people of Northern Ireland. ""May God bless them with peace, with prosperity and true reconciliation."" The scaffolding outside Queen's University said it all: This is still a work in progress. That was the message delivered inside by the architects of the Good Friday Agreement. This was not a day for back slapping but a moment to take stock. Yes, to share memories but also to deliver messages to the current crop of political leaders about the stalemate at Stormont. The call from the class of '98 was clear: Finish the job started 20 years ago. Mr Mitchell played a key role in broking the agreement that was then ratified in a referendum on both sides of the Irish border in May 1998. It set up a power-sharing assembly to govern Northern Ireland by cross-community consent. However, the deal proved difficult to implement and was amended by the St Andrew's Agreement in 2006. A bitter dispute between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in led to the collapse of their power-sharing government in January 2017 and despite several rounds of talks to resolve the crisis, the executive has not met for 16 months. This video can not be played Seamus Mallon says he feels anger 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement ""The lesson with these things... is that once you've got a viable peace process you've got to just work at it and work at it and realise that the right comparison is with what things were like during the course of the Troubles,"" Mr Blair told the BBC's Today programme. ""We used to wake every day to death and destruction."" The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who was part of the Ulster Unionist negotiating team in the run-up to the agreement, said the party's then leader David Trimble was bullied into signing a flawed deal. This video can not be played Key architects of the agreement recall the days leading up to Good Friday 1998 ""It didn't see an end to paramilitarism, it didn't see the promised political stability that the agreement heralded and here we are 20 years on from the agreement without a government,"" he said. ""Northern Ireland is in a better place today than it was 20 years ago, that's for sure, but we still have a long way to go and the flaws in the agreement that were not addressed at the time still need to be addressed.""

"Yulia Skripal was treated in Salisbury District Hospital for more than a month after being exposed to a nerve agent Yulia Skripal, the poisoned daughter of Russian ex-spy Sergei, has been discharged from hospital. The 33-year-old left Salisbury District Hospital on Monday and has been taken to a secure location. The hospital said: ""This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone."" Her 66-year-old father remains in hospital and is ""recovering more slowly than Yulia"". Doctors hope he will be discharged ""in due course"". The pair were taken to hospital on 4 March after being exposed to the toxic nerve agent Novichok. The father and daughter were found slumped on a park bench in the centre of Salisbury. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Politicians in 'idiot' row over poisoning Who is Sergei Skripal? Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who attended the scene, was also treated in hospital after being exposed to the nerve agent, but has since been discharged. Astatement from Ms Skripalreleased through the Metropolitan Police last week said her ""strength is growing daily"". Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital but is no longer in a critical condition. Medical director Dr Christine Blanshard said he has made ""good progress"", adding: ""Although he's recovering more slowly than Yulia we hope he too will be able to leave hospital in due course."" This video can not be played Hospital boss says release ""significant milestone"" for ex-spy's daughter The government says Russia was behind the poisoning, and Prime Minister Theresa May said Moscow was ""culpable"" for the attack. But the Russian government denied any involvement and has accused the British of inventing a ""fake story"". According to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, Whitehall officials have compiled a list of 26 alternative explanations for the attack that have been put forward by Russia's government and media. So far they have attached blame to Ms Skripal's mother-in-law, Theresa May, and a drone, among others. Meanwhile, Mrs May welcomed the news of Ms Skripal's discharge from hospital and wished her the best for her recovery.

"Yulia Skripal was treated in Salisbury District Hospital for more than a month after being exposed to a nerve agent Yulia Skripal, the poisoned daughter of Russian ex-spy Sergei, has been discharged from hospital. The 33-year-old left Salisbury District Hospital on Monday and has been taken to a secure location. The hospital said: ""This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone."" Her 66-year-old father remains in hospital and is ""recovering more slowly than Yulia"". Doctors hope he will be discharged ""in due course"". The pair were taken to hospital on 4 March after being exposed to the toxic nerve agent Novichok. The father and daughter were found slumped on a park bench in the centre of Salisbury. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Politicians in 'idiot' row over poisoning Who is Sergei Skripal? Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who attended the scene, was also treated in hospital after being exposed to the nerve agent, but has since been discharged. Astatement from Ms Skripalreleased through the Metropolitan Police last week said her ""strength is growing daily"". Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital but is no longer in a critical condition. Medical director Dr Christine Blanshard said he has made ""good progress"", adding: ""Although he's recovering more slowly than Yulia we hope he too will be able to leave hospital in due course."" This video can not be played Hospital boss says release ""significant milestone"" for ex-spy's daughter The government says Russia was behind the poisoning, and Prime Minister Theresa May said Moscow was ""culpable"" for the attack. But the Russian government denied any involvement and has accused the British of inventing a ""fake story"". According to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, Whitehall officials have compiled a list of 26 alternative explanations for the attack that have been put forward by Russia's government and media. So far they have attached blame to Ms Skripal's mother-in-law, Theresa May, and a drone, among others. Meanwhile, Mrs May welcomed the news of Ms Skripal's discharge from hospital and wished her the best for her recovery.

"A 100m buffer zone will be created to stop vigils being held outside the building A buffer zone will be created at a west London abortion clinic to stop vigils being held outside the building. Ealing councillors unanimously voted to implement a safe zone around the Marie Stopes clinic after women complained of intimidation by protesters. The Good Counsel Network, which holds daily vigils outside the centre in Mattock Lane, denies harassing women. The decision means both anti-abortion and pro-choice campaigners cannot stand within 100 metres of the clinic. Applause in broke out in the Ealing council cabinet room following the decision, but a protestor then interrupted the meeting and accused the council of taking away their rights. Richard Bentley, Marie Stopes UK managing director, said: ""This is a landmark decision for women. ""This was never about protest. It was about small groups of strangers choosing to gather by our entrance gates where they could harass and intimidate women and try to prevent them from accessing healthcare to which they are legally entitled."" The Good Counsel Network says women are not being offered enough alternatives Rival campaigners gathered outside the council building while the vote was taken. More than 300 people wrote to the council describing the pro-life protesters as ""intimidating and harassing"", while those against abortion have said women are not being offered enough alternatives. A report,externalpresented to the council cabinet concluded that, following unsuccessful attempts to negotiate an informal ""safe zone"" near the clinic entrance, a public spaces protection order was appropriate. The report also states the ""continued deployment of policing resources"" outside the clinic was an ""unusual and unnecessary use of local policing resources that could be deployed elsewhere"". The decision could pave the way for other councils to follow suit. Elizabeth Howard, a spokeswoman for Be Here for Me, said: ""It's what we expected, after really what can only be described as a sham consultation by the council. ""We're here to support women who maybe feel they don't have any other choice than abortion and don't want an abortion."" Council leader Julian Bell said he felt the cabinet had done ""absolutely"" the right thing. He said: ""I believe that this is something that's long been needed, so it feels good that we are actually breaking the ground with this and leading the way. ""I'm personally a practising Christian myself and so I think it's important to recognise that this is about protecting women from harassment and intimidation.""

After a social media appeal, a bugler and two Royal British Legion standard-bearers led the hundreds of attendees at the funeral at Southend Crematorium. Mourner Michelle Turner-Everett said it showed ""community spirit at its best"".

Hundreds went to pay their respects to Leonard King at Southend Crematorium He never married, and mourners were told he used to joke he had had a ""lucky escape"", but became known in later life as ""Granddad"" to his carer Karen Tuck. Miss Turner-Everett, theSSAFA,externalcharity divisional secretary for the area, first heard of Mr King's funeral via social media and helped organise the bugler and standard-bearers. She said: ""Somebody tagged me in a post on Facebook and asked 'Michelle, can you help?'. ""Then I messaged Karen to see if there was anything we could do to help her.""

"Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and George Mitchell are in Belfast for the anniversary The Good Friday Agreement was a ""work of genius"" which helped to preserve the concept of democracy, former US president Bill Clinton has said. He was addressing a Belfast conference to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1998 deal, which helped to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Clinton was taking part in a panel discussion with former British PM Tony Blair and former Irish PM Bertie Ahern. Mr Blair said the 1998 deal took ""real courage"" by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for ""all its faults"", the Good Friday Agreement was ""worth doing and worth keeping"". LIVE - Good Friday Agreement anniversary events Peace deal remembered - 20 years on The children of the Good Friday Agreement The Good Friday Agreement in full,external BBC - History - The Good Friday Agreement The anniversary celebrations have been overshadowed by the absence of devolution due to serious problems between Stormont's two biggest parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in. The three former leaders urged Northern Ireland's current political parties to keeping working to restore power sharing. The three men were lauded for their role in the peace process Mr Ahern said: ""The art of politics is compromise, you can't make progress without compromise. ""Compromise is when people come together and say, 'listen, this is the dilemma, this is the difficulty, this is what is unsaleable to my people' and let us try and find a way out."" Reflecting on legacy of the 1998 deal, Mr Clinton said: ""The Good Friday Agreement is a work of genius that's applicable if you care at all about preserving democracy. Bill Clinton said the deal was a ""work of surpassing genius"" ""It called for real democracy - majority rule; minority rights; individual rights; the rule of law; the end of violence; shared political decision-making; shared economic benefits."" Mr Clinton added that the deal had ""maintained the relationship with the United Kingdom, expanded the relationship with the Irish Republic, and then, let the future take its course"". ""The most interesting thing was by creating a space for the identity and the interests and the values of all the people involved - in a framework which protected democracy and let future demographic, economic and political changes take Northern Ireland wherever it would go - it was a work of surpassing genius."" This video can not be played Gerry Adams describes how he knew the Good Friday Agreement would be embraced by most of people The anniversary conference took place at Queen's University, Belfast and the panel discussion was chaired by former US Senator George Mitchell, who also chaired the 1998 talks. Mr Mitchell told the audience the Northern Ireland of today was ""unrecognisable"" and a ""better place"" than the one he worked in 20 years ago. He acknowledged there were problems at the moment, but urged current political leaders to show the same ""vision and courage that the leaders of Northern Ireland in 1998 demonstrated"". ""History will look back on this day as a reflection of how far we have come in Northern Ireland and how much further we still have to travel,"" Mr Mitchell said. This video can not be played George Mitchell: Northern Ireland is a better place now He asked the audience to give a standing ovation to the former leaders who delivered the Good Friday Agreement, hailing them as ""heroes and peacemakers"". ""Today across the western world, it's considered fashionable to demean and insult political leaders, and certainly much is deserved, but we don't pay enough attention or tribute to those political leaders who do dare greatly and succeed,"" he added. ""In Northern Ireland, these were ordinary men and women but after 700 days of failure, they joined in one day of success and they changed the course of history."" Members of the 'Class of 1998' posed for photos outside Queen's University Several former party leaders were in the audience at Queen's University Later, in a ceremony at the Ulster Hall, President Clinton and Senator Mitchell received the freedom of Belfast - the 83rd and 84th recipients of the honour. Alongside the Lord Mayor, Nuala McAllister, and with a stage filled with city councillors, the two men received a warm ovation from an invited audience. President Clinton and Senator Mitchell holding their certificates granting them Freedom of the City of Belfast The former senator, whose father's parents were from Ireland, also said that his personal role in the peace process had reconnected him with his Irish heritage. ""Many of you have thanked me for my work here. My response is that it is I who should be grateful, and I am, for you have filled an inner void that I didn't even know existed. ""I am an American and very proud of it, but a large part of my heart and of my emotions will forever be with the people of Northern Ireland. ""May God bless them with peace, with prosperity and true reconciliation."" The scaffolding outside Queen's University said it all: This is still a work in progress. That was the message delivered inside by the architects of the Good Friday Agreement. This was not a day for back slapping but a moment to take stock. Yes, to share memories but also to deliver messages to the current crop of political leaders about the stalemate at Stormont. The call from the class of '98 was clear: Finish the job started 20 years ago. Mr Mitchell played a key role in broking the agreement that was then ratified in a referendum on both sides of the Irish border in May 1998. It set up a power-sharing assembly to govern Northern Ireland by cross-community consent. However, the deal proved difficult to implement and was amended by the St Andrew's Agreement in 2006. A bitter dispute between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in led to the collapse of their power-sharing government in January 2017 and despite several rounds of talks to resolve the crisis, the executive has not met for 16 months.

""We used to wake every day to death and destruction."" The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who was part of the Ulster Unionist negotiating team in the run-up to the agreement, said the party's then leader David Trimble was bullied into signing a flawed deal.

"This video can not be played Call for full 'child sexual exploitation inquiry' for Telford An immediate inquiry is to be held into current and historical child sexual abuse in Telford. A Sunday Mirror article last month claimed 1,000 children may have been abused,externalin the town since the 1980s. Until Saturday, senior councillors had called for the government to take the lead on any investigation. But now Labour councillors have backed a motion by the opposition Conservative group in a unanimous decision to set up an independent, council-led inquiry. Midlands Live: Two-year-old boy in fatal crash named; suspected shooting at petrol station About 250 campaigners gathered outside the meeting to call for an inquiry At the weekend, council leader Shaun Davies said he had come to the conclusion a ""council inquiry is better than none"", however a council inquiry would only go ahead if the national inquiry into child sexual exploitation (CSE), the Jay Inquiry, decided not to investigate Telford. Conservative opposition councillors said they were ""extremely concerned"" about any delay to an investigation. Calling for an immediate inquiry, Conservative councillor Andrew Eade said: ""I do hope we have an opportunity to do the right thing and unite this divided council"". A statement on behalf of the victims, read by Conservative councillor Nicola Lowery, said: ""We deserve answers, our families deserve answers, answers the national inquiry will take years to deliver. ""The inquiry needs to start now. Things need to change. We want to be part of that change."" A review published in 2016 concluded there were ""far more"" victims of child sexual exploitation than those who had come forward Mr Davies and other senior councillors had previously said a government-led inquiry would have have greater powers to gather evidence and would be perceived as more independent. However, the proposal was swiftly rejected by the Home Office last month. Standing in for Mr Davies, who could not attend Tuesday's council meeting due to illness, Labour councillor Lee Carter said the council is ""going to move very quickly"". ""This town is hurting,"" he said. ""We've got to do everything we can to put this right."" The council said it is going to ""move quickly"" Conservative MP for Telford Lucy Allan said she was ""delighted"" there will be an inquiry and the authorities have ""a real opportunity to communicate to victims that they were not at fault, they have nothing to be ashamed of, and they can now come forward"". She said there had been a lot of ""wriggling"" and ""squirming"" from the Labour-run council in bringing an inquiry and suggested Mr Davies should stand aside as council leader. ""If I was him that's what I'd do,"" she said. The council last published a review into child sexual exploitation in the town in 2016 following the jailing of seven men in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police'sOperation Chalice. The report concluded,externalit was ""clear that CSE is still taking place in Telford and Wrekin, although the true scale of this crime is unknown"". The year before, Telford and Wrekin recorded more child sex offences per capita than anywhere else in England and Wales, according to Home Office figures. If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You canreport it online,externalto the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (CEOP). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support.

"The inquest is looking at whether Alexander Perepilichnyy died of natural causes or was unlawfully killed No plant toxins were found in a Russian businessman who it was claimed may have been poisoned, a coroner has heard. Alexander Perepilichnyy's inquest also heard conflicting reports about whether he ""feared for his life"" before his sudden death in November 2012. The businessman, who was a whistleblower in a $230m (Â£150m) money-laundering case, was found near his home in Weybridge, Surrey. The inquest resumed at the Old Bailey after being paused in June 2017. Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC previously heard two post-mortem examinations failed to find a cause of death but it was possible a poison derived from a plant may have been in his system. But Professor Monique Symmonds, a botanist at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, told the inquest she had not been able to identify any plant toxins in the specimens she tested. Suspicion had been raised by a high level of iron in a sample from his stomach but no traces of a toxin which might have caused it were found, the inquest was told. Mr Hilliard also heard from a corporate lawyer who represented Mr Perepilichnyy in several ""very complicated"" debt cases in Russia. A camera phone photo taken at the scene shows a covered body in the road Dimitry Lipkin said his client missed a court case in Russia in March 2011 because he was ""fearful for his life"" if he returned to his homeland. The Russian court did not ask for any further evidence about the threats and Mr Lipkin said he had no further information on who Mr Perepilichnyy was fearful of or why. Mr Perepilichnny won the case against loans recovery company Dzhirsa, Mr Lipkin said, and died a month after the firm lost its appeal. Dzhirsa has previously been linked with Dmitry Kovtun, one of the alleged killers of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, the inquest heard. Extractsfrom an article in the Daily Telegraph in 2012,external, in which Mr Kovtun said he was the firm's founder, were read out in court. The inquest also heard from two of Mr Perepilichnyy's brothers-in-law and a Swiss lawyer all of whom said they did not believe he was fearful. Ruslan Gursky, a brother-in-law who lives in Ukraine, said speculation about the deceased was ""highly dubious"" while Rishat Ismagilov, whose sister was married to Mr Perepilichnyy, said claims the family had fled to the UK were ""false"". In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Ismagilov said the coroner should confine himself to finding a cause of death with any further investigation into claims about Mr Perepilichnyy's life being a ""logical nonsense and legal absurdity"". Both men said Mr Perepilichnyy was jogging more to lose weight. The Swiss lawyer Francois Roger Micheli, who had met with the Russian as part of the money-laundering investigation,  also told the inquest ""at no moment did [Mr Perepilichnyy] indicate he felt threatened or unsafe"". The inquest continues.

"The Department for Education is raising the prospect of a compulsory register for an estimated 45,500 home-educated children in England. Ministers have launched a ""call for evidence"" on ensuring children taught at home get a good quality education. There is also Â£3m to check against ""harmful practices"" in ""out-of-school settings"", such as clubs and societies. Education minister Lord Agnew said all children needed to have a ""suitable and safe education"". But the Education Otherwise home education group says there is ""no evidence"" that registration would be an improvement. At present, there is no mandatory registration system for families choosing to educate their children at home, although some local authorities run voluntary schemes. It means that numbers of home-schooled children remain uncertain, with the education department saying that surveys had suggested an increase of 20% in the past 18 months. Edwina Theunissen, of Education Otherwise, said the question should be about why parents were taking children out of school, rather than considering registration systems for home educators. She said that home educators feared that if registration were introduced, it would be the beginning of a process of greater monitoring and interference, with education authorities wanting to know what and how children were being taught. But the government's consultation document, published on Tuesday, says the current rules derived from the 1940s and were ""designed for a different age"". The Department for Education says other issues need to be addressed in regulating home education, such as ""the vulnerability of some children to radicalisation, and the spread of unregistered schools offering services to home-educating parents"". Ministers are asking for the views of the public on whether there should be a registration process and how it might operate. In a 12-week consultation, the department is canvassing opinion on how local authorities might monitor the progress of children being taught outside the school system. School Systems Minister Lord Agnew said there were ""thousands of dedicated parents who are doing an excellent job of educating their children at home"". But he said there needed to be a way of acting quickly ""in the rare instances when this is not the case"". ""The department believes that home education is often good, and that it is a valid way of realising these ambitions for children. However, there is no assurance that this is always the case,"" says the consultation document. There is also a Â£3m fund, to be used in more than a dozen local authorities, to check on ""safeguarding and welfare concerns"" in informal settings outside of school, such as clubs, societies or voluntary groups working with young people. Roy Perry, vice-chairman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said councils backed the right of parents to home educate and that most did a ""fantastic job"". ""But for the minority of children where this is not the case, councils need the powers and appropriate funding to enter homes or other premises to check a child's schooling, and make sure they aren't being taught in unsuitable or dangerous environments,"" he said. ""Placing a legal duty on parents to register home-schooled children with their local authority would also help councils to monitor how children are being educated and prevent them from disappearing from the oversight of services designed to keep them safe.""

"Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has told the US Senate that privacy lapses are his responsibility ""It's clear now that we didnât do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,"" he says Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy linked to the Trump campaign, scraped data from 87m Facebook users Zuckerberg, 33, is worth about $64bn, and is one of the world's youngest billionaires Max Matza and Taylor Kate Brown The hearing is still rolling on, and Zuckerberg has
barely broken a sweat after several hours of grilling. After a nervy start, he almost seems to be enjoying himself. To recap, he apologised to US senators
for allowing several other firms to misuse his platform's personal data for
political ends. He said it was his personal mistake. On the subject of fake news, a
contrite Zuckerberg said ""one of my greatest regrets in running
the company"" was its slowness at uncovering and acting against disinformation
campaigns by Russian trolls during the US election. He said Facebook will investigate
""tens of thousands"" of apps to discover if any other companies have
accessed data in a similar way to Cambridge Analytica. You can follow all the latesthere. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg testifies Zuckerberg is shrewd enough not to appear big headed. Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan tees one up for him about his achievement in creating the world's biggest social network. ""Guy in a dorm room... could only happen in America, right?"" Zuckerberg: ""There are some strong Chinese internet companies."" Sullivan interrupts, and tells him it's a softball question: ""The answer is yes,"" the senator laughs. ""Is Facebook too powerful?"" a senator asks. ""Are you too powerful? Do you think you're too powerful?"" Zuckerberg says that of the more than two billion Facebook users on Earth, many are outside the US. ""That's something that Americans should be proud of,"" the chief executive says. Senator Mazie Hirono asks Zuckerberg when Facebook goes to law enforcement. When there's immediate harm, he says. Zuckerberg says Facebook would decline to provide information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in deportation investigations. ""We're going to push back aggressively,"" he said. Some people on Twitter think Zuckerberg mentions Facebook's Harvard dorm origin story too much... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""You're a dad,"" one senator notes, before asking if social media is addictive for teenagers. ""This is certainly something that I think any parent thinks about, how much do you want your kids using technology,"" Zuckerberg says. ""I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like, but building services that are good for people and good for society as well."" ""Like any tool, there are good and bad uses of it,"" he adds. ""If you're interacting [with friends], that is associated with the long-term measures of well-being,"" he says. But he adds that those who ""passively view content"" may feel negative effects. The senator asks if Facebook studies ""dopamine feedback loops"" to keep people from leaving the platform.

Zuckerberg says he would support ""in principle"" US
legislation to require user permission before their data is used. He tells
Senator Ed Markey that details of the legislation would matter and he looks
forward to further talks. Delaware Senator Chris Coons says there's a tension between Zuckerberg's ""bold promises"" on privacy and the reality that Facebook is a ""for-profit"" entity that made $40bn last year. ""There's lots of examples"" where ad targeting becomes extremely effective in violating laws - including cases of discriminatory housing ads - and targeting people who would be most harmed, Coons says, like gambling ads for those with gambling addictions, liquor ads for alcoholics.

Zuckerberg is told âpeople have no earthly idea of what theyâre signing up forâ in Facebook's terms of service. Democratic Senator Brian Schatz: ""If I'm emailing within WhatsApp [which Facebook owns] about
Black Panther [the movie], do I get a Black Panther banner ad?"" Zuckerberg: ""Facebook systems do not see the
content of messages being transmitted over WhatsApp."" Senator: ""Yeah, I know. But thatâs not what Iâm
asking. Iâm asking whether these systems talk to each other without a human
being touching it?"" Zuckerberg
looks perturbed as he responds: ""Senator, I think the answer to your specific question is if you message someone about Black Panther on WhatsApp, it would not inform any
ads."" Zuckerberg has told the congressional panel that ""terms of service are what they are"", adding that users do not have the option to amend what they agree to. He also says it would be impossible for the company to know if foreign citizens or governments were creating shell companies to purchase adverts on Facebook without being publicly identified. On Twitter, several users have pointed out that it would be very easy for a person or government - or ""malicious actor"", as senators have called them - to create a shell corporation to hide their adverts' intent. US lawmakers are currently considering regulations that would require adverts to come with a label, saying who had payed for them. Senator Ted Cruz: ""Does Facebook consider itself to be a neutral public forum?"" Zuckerberg: ""We consider ourselves to be a platform for all ideas."" Allow Twitter content?

Here's that deliciously awkward moment from earlier in the hearing. This video can not be played Senator to Zuckerberg: 'Where did you stay last night?' Senator Richard Blumenthal says: ""Your business model is to monetise
user information to maximise profit over privacy. ""And unless there are specific rules
and requirements enforced by an outside agency I have no assurance that these
kinds of vague commitments are going to produce action.â The Connecticut Democrat says
companies ought to be required to provide users with clear and plain
information about how their data will be used. ""Senator, I do generally agree with
what you're saying,"" says Zuckerberg. ""Would you agree to an opt-in, as opposed
to an opt-out?"" Zuckerberg noncommitally responds: ""Senator,
I think that that certainly makes sense to discuss and I think the details around
this matter a lot."" In one of the more testy exchanges, Texas Republican Ted Cruz demands to know how many Facebook employees have backed Republican candidates in the past. ""Of those 15 to 20,000 people engaged in content review, how many - if any - have ever supported financially or politically a Republican candidate for office?"" ""Senator, I do not know that,"" Zuckerberg responds. Facebook has previously been accused of a pro-liberal bias. PS: Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign used Cambridge Analytica.

April 2016, according to Reuters news agency. However, the share price remains about 15% lower than the

""We can do a few more,"" he suggests as the testimony passes its second hour. ""Maybe, 15 minutes. Does that work?"" he said to laughter in the room. The senators seem happy to keep the question and answer session going. ""There's a very common misconception about Facebook, that we sell data to advertisers,"" says Zuckerberg. ""And we we do not sell data to advertisers."" The senator interjects: ""Well, you clearly rent it."" ""Um, what we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach and then we do the placement."" Facebook, he says, just ""shows the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the adverstisers."" ""That's a very fundamental part of how our model works,"" he adds.

"This video can not be played Barry Gardiner speaking about Brexit (contains strong language) A Labour frontbencher denounced one of the party's key Brexit policies in a questions session at a think-tank, a recording obtained by the BBC reveals. Barry Gardiner used colourful language to rubbish the party's pledge to secure the exact same benefits as the single market after Brexit. He said the party should have instead said they would hold the Tories to account over their pledge to do that. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Gardiner ""fully supports"" their Brexit policy. Good Friday deal 'played up in Brexit talks' Corbyn backs customs union membership Speaking after the audio recording emerged, Mr Corbyn said: ""Barry Gardiner does not denounce Brexit policies. We've had a conversation with him. It's quite clear he does support our strategy of holding the government to account on the tests that have been put forward. ""The conversations we've had with Barry more recently have been very productive and very positive."" In the recording of the event in Brussels last month, Mr Gardiner was asked about the ""six tests"" Labour set the government to decide whether to support the final Brexit deal in a Commons vote. He said: ""Well let's just take one test - the exact same benefits. Bollocks. ""Always has been bollocks and it remains it. ""We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits and actually it would have made sense - because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits - and our position should have been to say they have said they are going to secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard."" He said that should have been the Labour policy rather than saying ""we think we can secure the exact same benefits as well"". The shadow international trade secretary made the comments after a speech at a think-tank  in Brussels last month. Responding to Mr Gardiner's comments, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""Labour has set six tests for the final Brexit deal. Those include holding the government to its own commitment to deliver the same benefits as the single market and customs union. ""We have been clear that, if those tests are not met, Labour will not back it in Parliament. Barry Gardiner fully supports that position."" The six tests were set outby shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer in March last year. The second test was: ""Does it deliver the exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and the customs union?"" In February, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced a shift in policy, committing the party to membership of a customs union after Brexit, but not the single market. He said: ""Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union... with no new impediments to trade and no reduction in rights, standards and protections."" Inan article for the Independent last month,external, Sir Keir said: ""Labour will not support a deal that fails to meet the six tests I set out last year."" Fair migration system for UK business and communities Retaining strong, collaborative relationship with EU Protecting national security and tackling cross-border crime Delivering for all nations and regions of the UK Protecting workers' rights and employment protections Ensuring same benefits currently enjoyed within single market Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the cross-party Open Britain group, which campaigns against a ""hard Brexit"", said: ""Barry Gardiner's increasingly maverick behaviour must be embarrassing for his frontbench colleagues."" He added: ""Labour's policy, agreed by the party conference, is very clear: without the exact same benefits being on offer in any final Brexit deal, Labour would keep the option of staying in the EU on the table. ""It is time members of the shadow cabinet started speaking out for that and ended the sort of eccentric self-indulgence of the type shown by Barry Gardiner."" In remarks made at the same Brussels event, Mr Gardiner appeared to play down the risks of failing to resolve the border issue post-Brexit, and suggested both the Irish government and Sinn Fein may be exaggerating them. ""We must also recognise there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday Agreement,"" he said. Shibboleth means a long-standing custom, principle or way of speaking which identifies people as a member of a group - and in some modern uses it carries the implication of being outmoded or no longer important. Following criticism from Labour's former shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Smith and ex-leader Tony Blair, Mr Gardiner issued a statement insisting he ""absolutely"" does not believe the agreement was outdated. He said: ""I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding on that point - in particular, that my use of the word 'shibboleth' in its sense of 'password' or 'test of membership' gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday Agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant. I absolutely do not.""

"This video can not be played Suspected chemical attack is 'barbaric' - May Theresa May looks ready to join military action against the Assad regime in Syria without first seeking parliamentary consent, well-placed sources have told the BBC. The prime minister is said by government insiders to see the need for a response as urgent. She wants to prevent a repeat of the apparent chemical attack near Damascus, which she described as ""abhorrent"". Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has warned that bombing could escalate the situation. Mrs May is understood to be reluctant to ask US President Donald Trump to hold off any action until she has the opportunity to consult MPs at Westminster. Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Trump says missiles 'will be coming' Corbyn warns against US-Russia 'hot war' Formally, she has yet to unequivocally point the finger of blame at the Assad government, the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar said. She has spoken of the need for action ""if"" the regime is found to bear responsibility, he added, but the strong assumption in Downing Street and Whitehall is the attack will be attributed to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. Action is thought likely to follow within days. Mrs May earlier described the use of chemical weapons as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" that ""cannot go unchallenged"". She did not comment on Donald Trump's tweet warning Russia to ""get ready"" for missiles being fired at its ally Syria. By the BBC's Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar The prime minister's instinct is to chew carefully on the decision of whether and how Britain should support action in response to the apparent chemical attack in Syria. She still speaks of the need to act ""if"" not ""as"" the Assad regime is responsible. But the uncomfortable truth is the form of action is beyond her control. Read John's full blog Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC that Parliament ""should always be given a say on any military action"". ""We don't want bombardment which leads to escalation and a hot war between the US and Russia over the skies of Syria,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable did not rule out backing military but he said Parliament would have to give its approval and there would have to be ""some strong conditions around it"". Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Russia has described the reports of the chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention against the Syrian regime. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Military action risks escalating Syria crisis Mrs May described the alleged chemical attack as a ""shocking, barbaric act"" and said she was ""appalled but not surprised"" at Russia, which vetoed a US-drafted UN resolution proposing a new inquiry to establish who was to blame. She said investigations were continuing but that ""all the indications"" were that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible. The UK and its allies were looking at ways to ""prevent and deter"" the use of chemical weapons, she added. On Tuesday she spoke on the phone with US President Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, agreeing their three countries would work together to take action to ""uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons"". The SNP called for action against the Syria government, including blocking its ""purchasing and importing abilities"" and sanctions against key people and companies. The party's defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said that while the case for action was clear, air strikes ""will not provide the long term solutions needed to end the war"". The fallout from the attack has sparked a war of words on who was responsible and what the response should be. On Twitter, President Trump responded to a warning from Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,"" he wrote. Why is there a war in Syria? ""Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'"" On Tuesday President Macron said that if military action was taken, it would target ""the regime's chemical capabilities"", and not the forces of its allies, Russia or Iran. Speaking in Paris, he said he did ""not want an escalation"" and that a decision would be made in the coming days. The information that France had showed ""chemical weapons were indeed used and that the regime could clearly be held responsible"", Mr Macron added. On Tuesday the UN Security Council failed to approve moves to set up an inquiry into the alleged attack on Douma. As permanent members of the council, Russia and the US vetoed each other's proposals to set up independent investigations. The US-drafted resolution would have allowed investigators to apportion blame for the suspected attack, while Russia's version would have left that to the Security Council. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons had said earlier that inspectors would travel to the town to investigate.

"Marie Colvin lost the sight in her left eye when covering the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2001, but went back to work as a journalist A journalist who was killed at the start of the war in Syria was ""assassinated"" by the government, family members have claimed in newly released court documents. Marie Colvin died in February 2012 in Homs, Syria, alongside French photographer Remi Ochlik, when the building they were in was shelled. Military memos and testimonies from defectors appear to chart how she was targeted. Ms Colvin worked for the Sunday Times. The sister of the highly respected correspondent, Cathleen Colvin, has brought a claim to a federal district court in the US stating her death was ""an extrajudicial killing"" and asking for compensation from the Syrian government. Several defectors claim indocuments submitted for the case,externalthat the government tracked journalists' satellite phone signals to find out their whereabouts. The Colvin family's lawyer, Scott Gilmore, said the documents included evidence that the government of Bashar al-Assad had ""identified media workers as targets from very early on in the conflict"". One anonymous defector names senior military personnel who he says drank and celebrated,externalthe day after the journalists died. He states that a military intelligence officer said: ""Marie Colvin was a dog and now she's dead. Let the Americans help her now."" Those involved in the attack later received rewards, he said - a general was promoted, and a militia leader was given a new car. Paul Conroy, a British photographer who was wounded in the same attack, said he had previously been warned of Syrian government orders ""to kill any Western journalists found in Homs"" but that he and Ms Colvin decided to keep working ""to expose the truth of what was happening inside Syria"". He says in testimony that the attack was targeted using a technique called ""bracketing"", which was ""very different from the indiscriminate, systematic waves of shelling usually employed daily by the Syrian forces"". Bracketing involves an artillery gunner receiving information from an observer or drone on how close their fire has fallen to the intended target, so that they can adjust and try again. Mr Conroy said the building he and the others were in - a makeshift media centre - ""could not possibly have been a legitimate military target"" as he never saw any activists there bearing arms. The wrongful-death lawsuit, filed last year, could be decided upon within the next few months. More than 200 journalists have died in Syria in its seven-year war. The government has denied targeting them, and President Assad has previously said of Ms Colvin that she had entered the country illegally, had ""worked with the terrorists"", and was ""responsible for everything that befell her"".

"Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and George Mitchell are in Belfast for the anniversary The Good Friday Agreement was a ""work of genius"" which helped to preserve the concept of democracy, former US president Bill Clinton has said. He was addressing a Belfast conference to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1998 deal, which helped to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Clinton was taking part in a panel discussion with former British PM Tony Blair and former Irish PM Bertie Ahern. Mr Blair said the 1998 deal took ""real courage"" by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for ""all its faults"", the Good Friday Agreement was ""worth doing and worth keeping"". LIVE - Good Friday Agreement anniversary events Peace deal remembered - 20 years on The children of the Good Friday Agreement The Good Friday Agreement in full,external BBC - History - The Good Friday Agreement The anniversary celebrations have been overshadowed by the absence of devolution due to serious problems between Stormont's two biggest parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in. The three former leaders urged Northern Ireland's current political parties to keeping working to restore power sharing. The three men were lauded for their role in the peace process Mr Ahern said: ""The art of politics is compromise, you can't make progress without compromise. ""Compromise is when people come together and say, 'listen, this is the dilemma, this is the difficulty, this is what is unsaleable to my people' and let us try and find a way out."" Reflecting on legacy of the 1998 deal, Mr Clinton said: ""The Good Friday Agreement is a work of genius that's applicable if you care at all about preserving democracy. Bill Clinton said the deal was a ""work of surpassing genius"" ""It called for real democracy - majority rule; minority rights; individual rights; the rule of law; the end of violence; shared political decision-making; shared economic benefits."" Mr Clinton added that the deal had ""maintained the relationship with the United Kingdom, expanded the relationship with the Irish Republic, and then, let the future take its course"". ""The most interesting thing was by creating a space for the identity and the interests and the values of all the people involved - in a framework which protected democracy and let future demographic, economic and political changes take Northern Ireland wherever it would go - it was a work of surpassing genius."" This video can not be played Gerry Adams describes how he knew the Good Friday Agreement would be embraced by most of people The anniversary conference took place at Queen's University, Belfast and the panel discussion was chaired by former US Senator George Mitchell, who also chaired the 1998 talks. Mr Mitchell told the audience the Northern Ireland of today was ""unrecognisable"" and a ""better place"" than the one he worked in 20 years ago. He acknowledged there were problems at the moment, but urged current political leaders to show the same ""vision and courage that the leaders of Northern Ireland in 1998 demonstrated"". ""History will look back on this day as a reflection of how far we have come in Northern Ireland and how much further we still have to travel,"" Mr Mitchell said. This video can not be played George Mitchell: Northern Ireland is a better place now He asked the audience to give a standing ovation to the former leaders who delivered the Good Friday Agreement, hailing them as ""heroes and peacemakers"". ""Today across the western world, it's considered fashionable to demean and insult political leaders, and certainly much is deserved, but we don't pay enough attention or tribute to those political leaders who do dare greatly and succeed,"" he added. ""In Northern Ireland, these were ordinary men and women but after 700 days of failure, they joined in one day of success and they changed the course of history."" Members of the 'Class of 1998' posed for photos outside Queen's University Several former party leaders were in the audience at Queen's University Later, in a ceremony at the Ulster Hall, President Clinton and Senator Mitchell received the freedom of Belfast - the 83rd and 84th recipients of the honour. Alongside the Lord Mayor, Nuala McAllister, and with a stage filled with city councillors, the two men received a warm ovation from an invited audience. President Clinton and Senator Mitchell holding their certificates granting them Freedom of the City of Belfast The former senator, whose father's parents were from Ireland, also said that his personal role in the peace process had reconnected him with his Irish heritage. ""Many of you have thanked me for my work here. My response is that it is I who should be grateful, and I am, for you have filled an inner void that I didn't even know existed. ""I am an American and very proud of it, but a large part of my heart and of my emotions will forever be with the people of Northern Ireland. ""May God bless them with peace, with prosperity and true reconciliation."" The scaffolding outside Queen's University said it all: This is still a work in progress. That was the message delivered inside by the architects of the Good Friday Agreement. This was not a day for back slapping but a moment to take stock. Yes, to share memories but also to deliver messages to the current crop of political leaders about the stalemate at Stormont. The call from the class of '98 was clear: Finish the job started 20 years ago. Mr Mitchell played a key role in broking the agreement that was then ratified in a referendum on both sides of the Irish border in May 1998. It set up a power-sharing assembly to govern Northern Ireland by cross-community consent. However, the deal proved difficult to implement and was amended by the St Andrew's Agreement in 2006. A bitter dispute between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in led to the collapse of their power-sharing government in January 2017 and despite several rounds of talks to resolve the crisis, the executive has not met for 16 months. This video can not be played Seamus Mallon says he feels anger 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement ""The lesson with these things... is that once you've got a viable peace process you've got to just work at it and work at it and realise that the right comparison is with what things were like during the course of the Troubles,"" Mr Blair told the BBC's Today programme. ""We used to wake every day to death and destruction."" The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who was part of the Ulster Unionist negotiating team in the run-up to the agreement, said the party's then leader David Trimble was bullied into signing a flawed deal.

"This video can not be played Jordi DÃ­az: ""We get information every time Barcelona scores a goal"" When Lionel Messi scores another wonder strike, the city of Barcelona literally shakes. Scientists have a seismometer installed close to the Camp Nou stadium and it picks up the telltale vibrations every time the crowd celebrates a goal. There is a clear spike in the data as fans jump up and down. And the seismogram that perhaps best captures this isBarÃ§a's ""miracle comeback""against Paris Saint-Germain in last season's Champions League. Four-nil down from the Round 16 first-leg, the team scored a last-minute goal to claim a famous 6-5 aggregate victory at home. The wild delight of supporters is writ large. 'Ringing' rock arches recorded The stadium goes into rapture as the ball hits the net for a sixth time This soccer seismology has been discussed here atthe European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly,externalin Vienna, Austria. It is the work of Jordi DÃ­az and colleagues at the Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera in Catalonia's capital. What Dr DÃ­az finds fascinating is the contrast in crowd signal between the movements of sports fans and those of music fans. The concert goers are jumping in rhythm - they're dancing The Camp Nou also hosts rock concerts. Bruce ""The Boss"" Springsteen played the venue in 2016. ""The spectrogram shows time versus frequency; the colours are for energy,"" Dr DÃ­az explained. ""You can see that every song has a particular pattern, and you can identify from the seismic data when [Springsteen] moves from one song to another. ""But notice how in goal celebrations, the energy is distributed across the 1-10Hz band while in the rock concert you have what we call harmonic structures; energy is localised into precise amplitudes. ""This is because people are not jumping; they are dancing. It's rhythm."" Dr DÃ­az's broadband seismometer is positioned 500m from the stadium in the institute's basement. At first, it was just an outreach project - something to help get the public enthused about his branch of science. But then his research group started to notice some interesting features that prompted genuine inquiry. As well as following those BarÃ§a home games, the scientists are looking at the seismic patterns of traffic. A major avenue runs past the institute and it is possible to track the daily flow of vehicles, even detect the constant stop-start as the traffic lights run through their cycle. The same is true for the subway and the timetable of train services. ""It may have started out as fun but we are now exploring the scientific aspects,"" Dr DÃ­az told BBC News. ""One is to do with engineering, knowing things about how structures and buildings vibrate due to different movements of people. We're now contacting the engineering schools to see if there is some potential in this.""

"Yulia Skripal was treated in Salisbury District Hospital for more than a month after being exposed to a nerve agent Yulia Skripal, the poisoned daughter of Russian ex-spy Sergei, has been discharged from hospital. The 33-year-old left Salisbury District Hospital on Monday and has been taken to a secure location. The hospital said: ""This is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone."" Her 66-year-old father remains in hospital and is ""recovering more slowly than Yulia"". Doctors hope he will be discharged ""in due course"". The pair were taken to hospital on 4 March after being exposed to the toxic nerve agent Novichok. The father and daughter were found slumped on a park bench in the centre of Salisbury. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Politicians in 'idiot' row over poisoning Who is Sergei Skripal? Wiltshire Police Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who attended the scene, was also treated in hospital after being exposed to the nerve agent, but has since been discharged. Astatement from Ms Skripalreleased through the Metropolitan Police last week said her ""strength is growing daily"". Mr Skripal remains at Salisbury District Hospital but is no longer in a critical condition. Medical director Dr Christine Blanshard said he has made ""good progress"", adding: ""Although he's recovering more slowly than Yulia we hope he too will be able to leave hospital in due course."" This video can not be played Hospital boss says release ""significant milestone"" for ex-spy's daughter The government says Russia was behind the poisoning, and Prime Minister Theresa May said Moscow was ""culpable"" for the attack. But the Russian government denied any involvement and has accused the British of inventing a ""fake story"". According to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, Whitehall officials have compiled a list of 26 alternative explanations for the attack that have been put forward by Russia's government and media. So far they have attached blame to Ms Skripal's mother-in-law, Theresa May, and a drone, among others. Meanwhile, Mrs May welcomed the news of Ms Skripal's discharge from hospital and wished her the best for her recovery. The Russian Embassy congratulated Ms Skripal but said: ""We need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will."" Allow Twitter content?

Responding to a Sunday Times report,externalthat the Skripals could relocate and be offered new identities,the embassy said,externalit would view any possible resettlement as an ""abduction"". On Sunday the Anglican Bishop of Salisbury will host a ""service of cleansing and celebration"" for the attack victims at St Thomas' Church, less than 200m from where the Skripals were found. It will be followed by a procession near to the bench where they became ill. Police said the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent at their home. Specialist officers in protective suits have retrieved samples from multiple sites in Salisbury The BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher said Novichok prevents enzymes called acetylcholinesterase from functioning normally at nerve junctions, including those required to keep the heart beating. He said: ""But over time, the nerve agent is metabolised and excreted by the body and new acetylcholinesterase is made. ""The question is whether doctors can keep patients alive long enough for that to happen."" BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the highest concentration was found on the Skripals' front door handle. Traces of Novichokwere also found at the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurantin Salisbury, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Zizzi, the Mill, the Maltings shopping centre and the Skripals' home remain cordoned off, Wiltshire Police said. Investigators identified 131 people who had potentially been in contact with the nerve agent, and up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant were told to wash their clothes and possessions. By BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner Unseen by the public, Yulia Skripal was discreetly discharged from hospital in Salisbury last night, hours ahead of this morning's announcement. She is understood to have been taken to a secure location somewhere in Britain while discussions take place over her future safety and protection. For the UK government this could prove to be a delicate diplomatic problem. She is a Russian citizen and Moscow has been pressing for consular access. But it is by no means clear where she will want to settle given her narrow escape from death in this failed assassination attempt on her and her father, Sergei. Whitehall officials say reports that the Skripals are to be given a new identity in the US are premature. Samples of the nerve agent have been tested by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire, in an attempt to verify its source. Its head said the precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". A diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West has followed, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Russia's request for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Yulia and Sergei Skripal were taken to Salisbury District Hospital after being found slumped on a bench in Salisbury Mr Skripal is a retired military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006, but was released in 2010 as part of an exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. Ms Skripal regularly travelled between the UK and Moscow, and had returned from Russia the day before the pair were poisoned. This video can not be played BBC Rewind looks back at cases of high-profile Russians targeted on foreign soil After Ms Skripal was discharged, her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, told Russian news agency Interfax that Ms Skripal planned to ask for political asylum during a press conference - although she does not know in which country. Viktoria Skripal has been refused a UK visa to visit her relatives. The Home Office said the application did not comply with immigration rules, but a government source told the BBC it appears Russia is ""trying to use Viktoria as a pawn"". Viktoria later told the BBC she did not have enough money in her bank account to satisfy the visa requirements. What happened to the Skripals?

"Medical and rescue organisations say most of the victims were children and women Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed on 7 April in a suspected chemical attack on Douma, which was the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says initial tests on samples from two sites detected ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"", along with explosive residues. However, no nerve agents were detected. The Syrian government denies ever using chemical weapons, and its ally Russia says it has evidence that the incident was staged with the help of the UK. In February, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad launched an assault on the Eastern Ghouta that reportedly left more than 1,700 civilians dead. In March, troops split the region into three pockets - the largest of which was around Douma, home to between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Facing defeat, rebel groups in the other two pockets agreed to be evacuated to northern Syria. But the group controlling Douma, Jaysh al-Islam, continued to hold out. On 6 April, after negotiations with the government stalled, air strikes resumed. The bombardment continued for a second day, with dozens of people reportedly killed or injured by conventional munitions before the suspected chemical attack. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force,external. The first occurred at approximately 16:00 (13:00 GMT) and saw the Saada bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. Activists say Douma came under intense aerial bombardment on Saturday It cited a member of the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets, as saying he smelt chlorine in the air after the strike, but that he could not determine its source. The VDC said the second incident took place not far to the east, near Martyrs' Square, at approximately 19:30. At 19:45, more than 500 patients - most of them women and children - were brought to medical facilities with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external, according to the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The patients showed signs of ""respiratory distress, central cyanosis [blue skin or lips], excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour"", a joint statement issued on Sunday said. One woman who died had convulsions and pinpoint pupils. Rescue workers searching homes in the affected area also found the bodies of people with oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns, the statement added. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, also saidit received reports of two incidents,external. Patients were hosed down with water to remove any chemicals on their skin People were treated for breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes following the first, the UOSSM said. After the second, patients were brought to hospital smelling strongly of a chlorine-like substance and presenting symptoms that included cyanosis, foaming of the mouth, and cornea irritation, it added. A medical student working at a hospital told the BBC he had treated a man who died,external. ""His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow. Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well,"" he said. Two videos circulated by the opposition activist group Douma Revolution showed what it said werethe bodies of children, women and men found in one block of flats,external, which is believed to be located south-west of Martyrs' Square. Some had foam coming out of their mouths and noses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Activists also posted avideo which they said showed a yellow industrial gas cylinder on the balcony of the same block of flats,external. One end of the cylinder was lying in a crater-like opening in the reinforced concrete floor. A second gas cylinder was filmed on the bed of a top-floor flat,externalto the south-west, below a crater-like opening in the concrete roof. The World Health Organization said on 11 April that it had received reports from its local ""health cluster partners"" of43 deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals"",external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said rescue workers found 42 people dead in their homes. One person was declared dead on arrival at a hospital, and another six died while receiving treatment, they added. An earlier, now deleted tweet by the Syria Civil Defence put the number dead at more than 150. The UOSSM initially reported that 70 people were confirmed dead. On 9 April,it revised down the figure to at least 42,external. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on 6 and 7 April killed almost 100 people. It said they included 21 who died as a result of suffocation, but that it was unable to identify the cause. The British investigative journalism website, Bellingcat, said it had counted at least 34 bodies,externalin the two videos circulated by Douma Revolution. Bellingcat also assessed that the block of flats near Martyrs' Square where the bodies were filmed wasvisited by Russian military personnel on 9 April,external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said the day after the incident that they believed those who died suffocated as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, most likely an organophosphate - a compound grouping associated with pesticides and nerve agents, such as Sarin. The UOSSM also concluded that the symptoms of the casualties were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, possibly one mixed with chlorine. On 13 April, the US said itassessed ""with confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons"",external. The conclusion was ""based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources, the reported symptoms experienced by victims, videos and images showing two assessed barrel bombs from the attack, and reliable information indicating co-ordination between Syrian military officials before the attack"". It added: ""A significant body of information points to the regime using chlorine in its bombardment of Douma, while some additional information points to the regime also using the nerve agent Sarin."" A fact-finding team from the OPCW has travelled to Damascus to investigate the allegations The OPCW, which oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention, dispatched experts from its Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) to Damascus five days after the attack. But they were unable to visit any of the sites of interest until 21 April because of an attack on a UN security team conducting a reconnaissance mission. The FFM team interviewed witnesses and collected environmental samples and data from three locations:the hospital where victims were allegedly treated for chemical exposure,external;the block of flats with the cylinder on the balcony,external(referred to as ""Location 2"");the flat with the cylinder on the bed,external(""Location 4""). The team also gathered or received samples and interviewed witnesses, including alleged casualties, in a neighbouring country. On 6 July, a preliminary report issued by the OPCW said ""no organophosphorus nerve agents or their degradation products were detected,external, either in the environmental samples or in plasma samples from the alleged casualties"".  However, it added, ""various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from Locations 2 and 4, along with residues of explosive"". The OPCW said the FFM team was now working to establish the significance of the results. It is also assessing the association of the two gas cylinders with the incident, the relative damage to the cylinders and the roofs, and how the cylinders arrived at their respective locations. The chlorinated compounds included those used to treat drinking water, as a disinfectant, a wood preservative, or a flame retardant. However, the same compounds were detected at other sites in Syria where the OPCW has concluded that chlorine was likely used as a weapon, includingSaraqeb,externalandLatamina,external. President Assad has accused the US, UK and France of ""staging"" the incident in Douma,externalwith the help of the Syria Civil Defence, which receives funding from Western governments. ""It was a lie. After we liberated that area our information confirmed the attack did not take place,"" he told the Daily Mail on 9 June. ""The British government should prove with evidence that the attack happened, and then they should prove who is responsible. This did not happen."" Syrian government ground forces advanced towards Douma on Saturday Russian permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on 9 April thatRussian military specialists had visited Douma and taken soil samples that showed no presence of nerve agents or substances containing chlorine,external. He also said no-one with symptoms of exposure to sarin or chlorine had been admitted to Douma's hospital, nor any bodies found. Four days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had ""irrefutable evidence that this was yet another attack, staged with the participation of special services of one state that is striving to be at the forefront of the Russophobic campaign"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media A British diplomat called the allegation ""bizarre"" and a ""blatant lie"". On 26 April, Russian and Syrian diplomats presented to a briefing at the OPCW's headquarters in The Hague more than a dozen people from Douma who said they had not seen any evidence of chemical weapons being used there. They included Hasan Diab,an 11-year-old boy who was seen being doused in water,externalin a video widely circulated online after the alleged attack. ""We heard cries on the street that we should go to the hospital. We got scared. We went to the hospital through the tunnel,""he told reporters,external. ""They started pouring water on me at the hospital. I don't know why."" Hasan Diab, 11, appeared at a briefing organised by Russian and Syrian diplomats in The Hague Western nations dismissed the event as ""nothing more than a crude propaganda exercise"",externaland an ""obscene masquerade"". The US said it had no information to suggest Jaysh al-Islam had ever used chemical weapons,external, and that it was unlikely that the opposition could have fabricated the number of reports that came from Douma on 7 April and ""deceived multiple media outlets while evading our detection"". United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was outraged by the reports from Douma,externaland warned that ""any confirmed use of chemical weapons, by any party to the conflict and under any circumstances, is abhorrent and a clear violation of international law"". Hours before the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission team arrived in Damascus on 14 April, the US, UK and France carried out missile strikes on three sites they said were ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The US military said warships and jets launched 105 missiles,externalthat hit a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) in the capital's Barzeh district, the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs, and a nearby chemical weapons bunker. US President Donald Trump said he wanted ""to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons"",external. The Syrian foreign ministry denounced ""the barbaric aggression"". In August 2013, rockets containing Sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs in the Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people.UN experts confirmed that Sarin was used in the attack,external, but they were not asked to ascribe any blame. Western powers said only Syrian government forces could have carried out the attack. President Assad denied the allegation, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission also said they were confident that government forces used Sarin in an attack in April 2017 on the rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun,external, which reportedly killed more than 80 people. President Assad dismissed the attack as a fabrication, but the US carried a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation. The UN-OPCW mission also found that government forces used chlorine as a weapon on at least three occasions during the civil war.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital Russian former spy Sergei Skripal is no longer in a critical condition after being poisoned by a nerve agent, doctors have said. Salisbury District Hospital said Mr Skripal is responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital for more than a month after being found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned with a toxic nerve agent called Novichok. Ms Skripal is conscious and talking in hospital. The UK government claims Russia is behind the attack but Moscow has denied all involvement, calling the accusations ""horrific and unsubstantiated"". Russia says UK is 'playing with fire' Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Meanwhile, the UK has refused to grant a visa to Yulia's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, the BBC has learned. The Home Office said the application did not comply with immigration rules. A government source told the BBC it appears Russia is ""trying to use Viktoria as a pawn"". The Russian Embassy said Sergei and Yulia Skripal ""remain hidden from the public"" as a result of the visa decision and the ""only relative"" who could reasonably expect to see them is ""kept out of the UK"". ""The stubborn refusal to cooperate, to provide transparency and to answer the numerous questions means Britain has something to hide,"" an embassy spokesman said. Viktoria later told the BBC she did not have enough money in her bank account to satisfy the visa requirements. It comes after Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Viktoria and Yulia on Thursday. Doubts were raised over its authenticity but Viktoriahas told Newsnight she was 100% certain it was Yulia. In a statement from the hospital, medical director Christine Blanshard urged people to respect Ms Skripal's privacy ""while she continues to get better"". ""As Yulia herself says, her strength is growing daily and she can look forward to the day when she is well enough to leave the hospital,"" Dr Blanshard said. ""Any speculation on when that date will be is just that - speculation."" Viktoria Skripal gave the BBC this picture of Sergei Skripal (centre) with his daughter Yulia and late son Alexander The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Skripal's recovery meant ""we now have two individuals at the heart of this incident in Salisbury who can now speak"". He said: ""They can speak to investigators about their last movements, were there any threats, were there any other circumstances?"" Following the update on Mr Skripal's condition, the Russian Embassy tweeted: ""Good news!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The embassy later issued a statement wishing the Skripals ""get well soon"" and expressed hope that their recovery will ""contribute to the investigation"". ""We are confident that the objective probe will ultimately establish that the claims against Russia by [the] UK government are null and void,"" it added. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also called Mr Skripal's condition ""great news"" and a testament to the emergency services and NHS staff. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""very pleased"" that the Skripals were improving. ""The NHS will continue to provide ongoing care for the Skripals, both of whom are likely to have ongoing medical needs,"" the FCO said. ""Let us be clear, this was attempted murder using an illegal chemical weapon that we know Russia possesses."" By BBC Health and Science Correspondent James Gallagher Recovery from a nerve agent attack is not guaranteed, but it is not always a surprise either. Nerve agents including sarin, VX and novichok all prevent nerves functioning normally. This includes those that are necessary to breathe and keep the heart beating. They work by disrupting an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase at the junction between nerves. But over time, the nerve agent is metabolised and excreted by the body and new acetylcholinesterase is made. The question is whether doctors can keep patients alive long enough for that to happen. This would have been the focus of Sergei and Yulia Skripal's care at Salisbury District Hospital. It could have included heart and lung support, the drug atropine to counteract the effect of nerve agents and sedation to prevent brain seizures. There is still a question about the Skripals' long term recovery and whether there will be any impact on memory and brain function. Former double agent Mr Skripal, who was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain's intelligence service but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010, was being visited by his daughter Yulia when the attack happened on 4 March. The pair became ill in the centre of Salisbury after visiting The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant. The incident sparked an escalating diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Emergency service workers in biohazard suits fix a tent over the bench where pair were found On Thursday, Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia,told the UN Security Council that Britain was ""playing with fire""and had invented a ""fake story"". Mr Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia and accused the government of waging a ""propaganda war"". Ina statement released to police on Thursday,Ms Skripal said she was grateful for the many messages of goodwill she had received and the people of Salisbury who came to her aid. She said: ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" Britain's UN ambassador, Karen Pierce, said Russia's request for consular access to Ms Skripal has been passed on.

"This video can not be played Neal Gray describes the final time he and his wife saw Ellie alive Failings by agencies over the care of a six-year-old girl who was murdered by her father did not contribute to her death, a coroner has ruled. Ellie Butler was battered to death by her father Ben Butler in October 2013, 11 months after being returned to his care at the family's south London home. Butler, who was accused of shaking Ellie as baby, was jailed for life with a minimum of 23 years for her murder. The coroner, Dame Linda Dobbs, ruled that Ellie was unlawfully killed. Reacting to the ruling, Ellie's grandfather Neal Gray said Ellie had been ""let down by fundamental failings in the system"" and he was disappointed that the agencies ""have not had to account for the role they played"". He said he and his late wife Linda had been ""ignored"" whenever they had tried to give any input about her care. ""I still believe that, had the childcare agencies worked together and shared information, and had the parents not been so readily believed, Ellie would still be alive today."" Mr Gray also told the BBC he believes Ellie's parents used face paint to hide bruising on her face when he saw her. Ben Butler and Jennie Gray were jailed in June 2016 Concluding the inquest at South London Coroner's Court, Dame Linda said: ""On the evidence I am unable to conclude that any acts or omissions by the relevant agencies possibly or probably contributed to the death of Ellie."" She added it was ""unclear"" if all recommendations from aSerious Case Review into Ellie's death,external""have been implemented and audited"". The review found Sutton Children Services felt ""powerless to act"" following the High Court's ruling which led to Ellie returning to her parents. The exonerated father who went on to kill Killer father was a 'brutal maniac' 'Good judge' returned girl to killer father Butler was convicted of Ellie's murder after a trial in June 2016. Ellie's mother Jennie Gray was also jailed for three and a half years for child cruelty and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Ellie had been placed into the care of her grandparents Neal and Linda Gray when she was a baby after Butler was accused of shaking her. He successfully appealed and Mrs Justice Hogg in the family division of the High Court ruled that Ellie's parents had been ""exonerated"" of causing her injuries and she was returned to their home in Sutton in November 2012. Ellie Butler was murdered by her father 11 months after returning to his care During his evidence at the inquest, Mr Gray said his granddaughter's murder at the hands of a ""brutal maniac"" had been ""avoidable"". ""[Ellie] was placed at fatal risk by being returned to her parents. The circumstances surrounding it must be avoided so that lessons may be learned and other children protected in the future"", he said. Social workers from Services for Children (S4C), who worked to return Ellie to her parents, also agreed with Mr Gray that they had ""failed"" the girl. Butler and Gray both gave evidence to the inquest by video link from prison and repeatedly denied they caused their daughter any injuries. Butler, who also accused the coroner of being ""corrupt"", said: ""I don't accept I caused harm to Ellie and will fight in a different court to prove it."" Ellie was cared for by her grandparents for five years after Butler was accused of shaking her as a baby Gray told the inquest her partner's ""bark was worse than his bite"". The inquest covered the period between the ruling to return Ellie to her parents and her death, but did not look at how Mrs Justice Hogg's decision was made. Following her ruling the coroner stressed that those who were worried about any court judgment should be able to raise those concerns. ""Lawyers are only advisers, they are not decision makers. That responsibility lies with the agencies themselves,"" she said. After the inquest, Christine Davies, independent chairwoman of the Sutton Local Safeguarding Children Board, said measures had been subsequently been put in place ""to ensure, as far as possible, such a tragedy never occurs again"". In a statement, S4C said it hoped the inquest would ""help to ensure that the most efficient system possible is in place to protect children in future."" Neal Gray said he believes Ellie's parents used face paint to hide bruising on her face February 2007: At six weeks old and in the sole care of her father, Ellie was found to be ""suddenly soft and limp"". Scans showed she had serious injuries June 2007: Ellie was placed in the care of her grandparents January 2008: The Family Court found that, on the balance of probability, Butler caused Ellie's injuries and Gray failed to protect her March 2009: Butler was convicted of grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He had a history of offending and violence June 2010: His criminal conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal on the basis of new medical evidence July 2012: The Family Court overturned an order which protected Ellie from her parents. It exonerated Butler and said that any injury caused to Ellie was ""purely accidental"" An independent social work agency was appointed to replace Sutton Council's social workers to oversee the children being returned to their parents The children were not subject to any court orders which had an effect of preventing agencies (social workers, child protection, schools etc) from having any further involvement November 2012: Ellie was returned to her parents' care October 2013: Ellie was murdered by her father Killer father was a 'brutal maniac' Ellie Butler 'not in pain' after injury 'Good judge' returned girl to killer father Killed girl's granddad disowns daughter Child murderer calls coroner 'corrupt' Custody battle father murdered daughter South London Coroner South London's Christmas Lane Community pays tribute to 14-year-old with âpure heartâ stabbed to death on bus The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Michelle Sadio: Arrest after woman killed in drive-by shooting outside London church Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Supply Teaching Assistant - Kingston Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? US President Donald Trump has promised a ""forceful"" response to the alleged chemical attack in Syria, as Western leaders consider what action to take. ""We have a lot of options militarily,"" he told reporters. He added that a response would be decided ""shortly"". Mr Trump said the US was getting some ""good clarity"" on who was responsible for the incident in Douma on Saturday. Medical sources say dozens were killed in the alleged attack but exact numbers are impossible to verify. Mr Trump also discussed the incident with French President Emmanuel Macron late on Monday, and both leaders expressed a desire for a ""firm response"", the Elysee Palace said. The AFP news agency quoted French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux as saying on Tuesday that ""if a red line had been crossed, there will be a response"", adding that intelligence shared by the two leaders ""in theory confirms the use of chemical weapons"". In FebruaryMr Macron threatened to strike Syria if proof emerged of the use of chemical weapons. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she had spoken to Mr Macron on Tuesday morning and would be speaking to Mr Trump later in the day. Mrs May did not answer directly when asked if Britain would join the US if it decided to take a military response, saying instead: ""We believe that those responsible should be held to account."" Suspected Syria chemical attack kills scores Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Why is there a war in Syria? Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack The condemnation from Western leaders followsa tense meeting at the UN Security Councilin which the US and Russia traded harsh words over the incident. US envoy Nikki Haley has called for a vote on Tuesday on a draft resolution to set up a new inquiry into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. But Russia says it cannot support the proposal because it contains ""unacceptable elements"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would submit its own draft resolution proposing that inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) visit Douma. Russia wanted independent experts to be convinced that nothing had happened and would do everything to allow such a visit to take place, he added. Russian officials said on Monday that Russian military specialists and staff from Syria's Red Crescent had found no evidence of an attack. Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics allege that bombs filled with toxic chemicals were dropped on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus, by Syrian government forces. The Syrian-American Medical Society said more than 500 people were brought to medical centres,externalwith symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent"". It said this included breathing difficulties, bluish skin, mouth foaming, corneal burns and ""the emission of chlorine-like odour"". Neither the death toll nor what exactly occurred can be verified as the area is blocked off with access denied. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The estimates of how many people died in the suspected chemical attack range from 42 to more than 60 people, but medical groups say numbers could rise as rescue workers gain access to basements where hundreds of families had sought refuge from bombing. UK PM condemns 'barbaric attack' in Syria The French representative at the UN Security Council said poison gas had deliberately been used as it could seep down to the basements. The US, France and UK have led international condemnation of the alleged attack, with the Syrian government and its Russian backers denying any responsibility. Ms Haley said Russia - a Syrian military backer - had the ""blood of Syrian children"" on its hands and branded President Assad a ""monster"". But Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, presenting Russia's case that rebels in Douma had staged the event for their own ends, painted the incident and its fallout as part of a US-led effort to hurt Russia with a ""broad arsenal of methods"", including slander, insults and ""hawkish rhetoric"". In an angry statement, he invited the OPCW to fly to Syria as soon as Tuesday, saying that Russian troops would escort them to the site of the alleged attack. Tensions between Russia and the West have plunged to their worst level in decades, following the poisoning in March of an ex-spy in England that the UK blamed on Moscow, and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election.

"This video can not be played Palm oil can be found in everyday items ranging from peanut butter and chocolate to instant noodles Iceland is to stop using palm oil in own-brand products by the end of 2018. The Deeside-based chain - the first major UK supermarket to ban palm oil - said it was used in more than half of its products, from biscuits to soap. Iceland said growing demand for the oil was devastating tropical rainforests across southeast Asia. The frozen food specialist said it was alerted to the environmental challenges that palm oil presented by campaigners at Greenpeace. The ban only applies to Iceland-brand products, meaning other products sold by the retailer may still contain palm oil. This video can not be played How do you make a palm oil-free mince pie? Iceland chef Neil Nugent explains Iceland managing director Richard Walker said there was ""no such thing"" as properly sustainable palm oil. ""Certified sustainable palm oil does not currently limit deforestation and it does not currently limit the growth of palm oil plantations,"" he told the BBC. ""So until such a time as there is genuinely sustainable palm oil that contains zero deforestation, we are saying no to palm oil."" Mr Walker said the move would increase costs but they would not be passed on to customers: ""There will be an extra cost but we think it's the right thing to do."" Palm oil: What are the issues? Can palm oil be produced sustainably? Palm oil linked to child labour in Indonesia Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008 Burning large areas of forests to clear areas where oil palms can be grown has also been blamed forhigh levels of air pollution in South East Asia Palm oil is used in almost half the products stocked by UK supermarkets and can be found in everything from shampoos to biscuits, as well as biofuels Some experts say eating palm oil is unhealthy because it is high in saturated fat EU labelling laws were changed in 2014 so products must now state specifically if they contain palm oil One species affected by palm oil production is the orangutan population. In some regions, oil palm cultivation has resulted in deforestation, leaving species that lived in virgin forest without a home. Some palm plantations have been developed without consulting local communities over the use of their land, or even caused them to be forcibly displaced. Palm oil cultivation can destroy habitats for orangutans There are organisations dedicated,externalto finding ways of producing palm oil more ethically and sustainably and a growing number of players in the palm oil industry have committed to adopting more sustainable practices. Despite the high level of concern over the effect palm oil has on the environment in countries where it is grown, a survey of more than 5,000 UK consumers found about a third were not sure what palm oil is. However, once they were told about effects on the environment, 85% said they did not think it should be used in food products. Iceland says it has already found alternative recipes for 50% of its own-label range. The store chain has a history of acting to remove controversial products from its shelves. It was the first supermarket to ban GM-grown crops in its own-brand goods, and earlier this year said it would eliminate or drastically reduce plastic packaging of all its own-label products by the end of 2023. Last year, the Bank of England considered the use of palm oil in its future banknote production, following complaints over the use of animal-derived tallow in its polymer notes. The Bank launched a public consultation, receiving responses from 3,554 people. Of those who expressed a preference, 88% were against the use of animal-derived products and 48% objected to the use of palm oil-derived additives. However, any switch to palm oil was ruled out as the Bank said its suppliers were ""unable to commit to sourcing the highest level of sustainable palm oil"". How do you make palm oil-free mince pies?

"The firm announced a closing down sale on its website The Ultimo underwear firm set up by Michelle Mone is to cease trading in the UK. The Conservative peer, now known as Baroness Mone of Mayfair, established the lingerie brand in 1996. The firm achieved international success after actress Julia Roberts reportedly wore an Ultimo bra in the hit film Erin Brockovich. Lady Mone left the company three years ago, after it was taken over by a large Sri Lankan apparel firm. The firm announced that, following an extensive review of the business, the operation in the UK will cease trading. Staff at the Ultimo headquarters in East Kilbride have been informed, with a formal redundancy consultation now under way with the 11 employees at the site. Retail partners and suppliers have also been told of the decision. Ultimo was set up by Michelle Mone and her husband in 1996 An Ultimo spokesman said: ""The last few years have been extremely challenging for Ultimo, driven by increasing competition in the market and more cautious consumer spending due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK economy over the last 18 months. ""Having reviewed the business' performance over the last three years as well as future prospects and considering the retail environment within which the business is operating, the board has, with regret, decided to cease operations of the Ultimo business in the UK."" The spokesman added the company ""would like to thank all staff, customers and suppliers for their commitment, support and loyalty to the Ultimo brand over the years"". Ultimo's UK operations will be wound up at the end of June, with the company pledging to honour financial commitments with suppliers and partners.

"Marie Colvin lost the sight in her left eye when covering the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2001, but went back to work as a journalist A journalist who was killed at the start of the war in Syria was ""assassinated"" by the government, family members have claimed in newly released court documents. Marie Colvin died in February 2012 in Homs, Syria, alongside French photographer Remi Ochlik, when the building they were in was shelled. Military memos and testimonies from defectors appear to chart how she was targeted. Ms Colvin worked for the Sunday Times. The sister of the highly respected correspondent, Cathleen Colvin, has brought a claim to a federal district court in the US stating her death was ""an extrajudicial killing"" and asking for compensation from the Syrian government. Several defectors claim indocuments submitted for the case,externalthat the government tracked journalists' satellite phone signals to find out their whereabouts. The Colvin family's lawyer, Scott Gilmore, said the documents included evidence that the government of Bashar al-Assad had ""identified media workers as targets from very early on in the conflict"". One anonymous defector names senior military personnel who he says drank and celebrated,externalthe day after the journalists died. He states that a military intelligence officer said: ""Marie Colvin was a dog and now she's dead. Let the Americans help her now."" Those involved in the attack later received rewards, he said - a general was promoted, and a militia leader was given a new car. Paul Conroy, a British photographer who was wounded in the same attack, said he had previously been warned of Syrian government orders ""to kill any Western journalists found in Homs"" but that he and Ms Colvin decided to keep working ""to expose the truth of what was happening inside Syria"". He says in testimony that the attack was targeted using a technique called ""bracketing"", which was ""very different from the indiscriminate, systematic waves of shelling usually employed daily by the Syrian forces"". Bracketing involves an artillery gunner receiving information from an observer or drone on how close their fire has fallen to the intended target, so that they can adjust and try again. Mr Conroy said the building he and the others were in - a makeshift media centre - ""could not possibly have been a legitimate military target"" as he never saw any activists there bearing arms. The wrongful-death lawsuit, filed last year, could be decided upon within the next few months. More than 200 journalists have died in Syria in its seven-year war. The government has denied targeting them, and President Assad has previously said of Ms Colvin that she had entered the country illegally, had ""worked with the terrorists"", and was ""responsible for everything that befell her"".

"A man who ate the world's hottest chilli pepper in a chilli-eating contest ended up in hospital after experiencing ""thunderclap"" headaches. The 34-year-old man had eaten one Carolina Reaper chilli in the contest in New York State. The ""crushingly painful"" headaches came on in the next few days. His experience has been published in theBMJ Case Reports,externalas it is the first case to be associated with eating chilli peppers. The doctor who reviewed his case has warned anyone eating hot chilli peppers to seek medical attention immediately if they experience sudden onset headaches. ""Thunderclap"" headaches are caused by the sudden tightening of the vessels that supply blood to the brain, a condition known as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCSV). Why hot chillies might be good for us Is the chilli pepper friend or foe? Immediately after eating at the contest, the man experienced dry heaves. Severe neck pain developed over the next few days along with debilitating severe headaches, lasting just a few seconds at a time. The pain was so bad he went to the emergency room and was tested for various neurological conditions, but the results were negative. A CT scan showed that several arteries in his brain had constricted, leading doctors to diagnose him with RCVS. The Carolina Reaper delivers an average of 1,569,300 Scoville Heat Units (SHU) As a comparison jalapeno peppers score between 2,500 to 8,000 SHU It was named the world's hottest chilli pepper by theGuinness World Records,externalin 2013 It was created by Ed Currie from the Pucker Butt Pepper Company in South Carolina over ten years He started growing chillies after learning that capsaicin found in chillies had potential as a cancer-fighting drug and he donates half of his harvest to cancer research RCVS does not always have an obvious cause, but can occur as a reaction to some prescription medication, or after taking illegal drugs. This is the first case to be associated with eating chilli peppers. Previously eating cayenne pepper has been linked to sudden constriction of the coronary artery and heart attacks. The man's symptoms cleared up by themselves. And a CT scan five weeks later showed that his arteries had returned to their normal size. Generally RCVS resolves within days to weeks and often has a favourable long-term prognosis, but in some cases severe vasoconstriction resulting in a stroke have been reported - but they are very rare. Dr Kulothungan Gunasekaran, at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, who wrote the report, said people need to be aware of these risks, if eating the chilli. ""We would not advise against eating Carolina Reaper at this time, but we would recommend the general public be cautious about these adverse effects and we advise that they should seek medical attention immediately if they develop sudden onset headache after eating hot peppers.""

"A 5.5%, or Â£60 a year, rise in energy prices for British Gas customers on default deals has been branded as ""unjustified"" by the government. The company, the UK's largest energy supplier, said that 4.1 million of its customers would be affected. The increase will take effect from 29 May and follows its 12.5% rise in electricity prices last September. British Gas argued that it was raising prices owing to factors beyond its control, such as wholesale costs. The 5.5% increase, which applies to both gas and electricity, will see the average annual standard variable dual-fuel bill for British Gas customers go up to Â£1,161. Energy minister Claire Perry said: ""We are disappointed by British Gas's announcement of an unjustified price rise in its default tariff when customers are already paying more than they need to."" Energy regulator Ofgem described the increase as ""unwelcome"" and encouraged householders to shop around. Those who pay their bill by cash or cheque will see an average annual price rise of nearly Â£85. Customers in different areas of the country face different price rises. Those in the West Midlands and southern Scotland face the biggest increase. British Gas customer Mike Gibson, from Newcastle, said: ""I am a loyal British Gas customer. I've been with them as long as I can remember, over 20 years. ""I am leaving British Gas. This price rise is the final straw. This increase will have a real impact on me financially so I will look for a cheaper option. ""I am one of those people who always thinks that I should switch provider, but I never do. I get a bill and decide I am going to switch, but I forget about it in a few days. ""This is a big enough hike that I am definitely going to switch this time. I think I will be able to find a provider that is about Â£200 a year cheaper, so for me it is really worth it."" British Gas said it had to lift prices following a rise in the cost of producing energy - including wholesale costs. The company pointed to a similar decision by energy regulator Ofgem, which recently blamed wholesale costs for the rise in thedefault tariff for those with prepayment meters. Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, of which British Gas is a part, said: ""We fully understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers' household bills. This increase we are announcing today is reflective of the costs we are seeing which are beyond our control."" He also blamed the extra charges it faced as part of government policy, such as the introduction of smart meters and emissions targets. ""Government policies, intended to transform the energy system, are important but they are putting pressure on customers' bills. We believe government should level the playing field so the customers of all suppliers pay a fair share of energy policy costs,"" Mr Hodges said. ""We continue to encourage government to consider moving these costs out of energy bills altogether and into general taxation."" Price comparison websites, which make money from customers switching suppliers, are predicting that other energy companies will follow the British Gas price rise. Stephen Murray, from Moneysupermarket, said: ""No doubt we will see speculation on which supplier might follow and how consumers need protection from rip-off prices."" Ed Molyneux, head of research for switching service Look After My Bills, said: ""The data is clear, there is simply no justification for price hikes now, especially when British Gas put their prices up last year. Costs are still under the peak that triggered the first round price rises last year."" A spokesman for regulator Ofgem said: ""Ofgem is working with the government to protect all consumers on poor value default tariffs, including standard variable tariffs, from being overcharged by suppliers by introducing a default tariff price cap. ""In the meantime, we encourage British Gas customers affected by the price rise announced today to see if they can save money by switching to a better deal as savings of up to almost Â£300 are available."" Energy firms have faced pressure from politicians over pricing, and the use of standard variable tariffs which have been deemed poor value for consumers. British Gas hasscrapped standard variable tariffsfor new customers - following similar moves by E.On and Scottish Power. Those British Gas customers already on fixed-term contracts who fail to opt for a replacement when the deal ends are now put on a separate default tariff. This so-called Temporary Tariff will also rise by Â£60 on 29 May. At an average of Â£1,136 a year, it is slightly cheaper than the standard variable tariff used by existing customers. Centrica's Mr Hodges said: ""We also continue to call on Ofgem to end the standard variable tariff across the market which would encourage customers to proactively seek the best energy deal for them."" Although it is not specifically raising energy prices, E.On recently announced changes to how it bills customers which will see the average standard variable tariff rate rise by Â£22 a year from 19 April.

"This video can not be played Barry Gardiner speaking about Brexit (contains strong language) A Labour frontbencher denounced one of the party's key Brexit policies in a questions session at a think-tank, a recording obtained by the BBC reveals. Barry Gardiner used colourful language to rubbish the party's pledge to secure the exact same benefits as the single market after Brexit. He said the party should have instead said they would hold the Tories to account over their pledge to do that. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Gardiner ""fully supports"" their Brexit policy. Good Friday deal 'played up in Brexit talks' Corbyn backs customs union membership Speaking after the audio recording emerged, Mr Corbyn said: ""Barry Gardiner does not denounce Brexit policies. We've had a conversation with him. It's quite clear he does support our strategy of holding the government to account on the tests that have been put forward. ""The conversations we've had with Barry more recently have been very productive and very positive."" In the recording of the event in Brussels last month, Mr Gardiner was asked about the ""six tests"" Labour set the government to decide whether to support the final Brexit deal in a Commons vote. He said: ""Well let's just take one test - the exact same benefits. Bollocks. ""Always has been bollocks and it remains it. ""We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits and actually it would have made sense - because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits - and our position should have been to say they have said they are going to secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard."" He said that should have been the Labour policy rather than saying ""we think we can secure the exact same benefits as well"". The shadow international trade secretary made the comments after a speech at a think-tank  in Brussels last month. Responding to Mr Gardiner's comments, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""Labour has set six tests for the final Brexit deal. Those include holding the government to its own commitment to deliver the same benefits as the single market and customs union. ""We have been clear that, if those tests are not met, Labour will not back it in Parliament. Barry Gardiner fully supports that position."" The six tests were set outby shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer in March last year. The second test was: ""Does it deliver the exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and the customs union?"" In February, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced a shift in policy, committing the party to membership of a customs union after Brexit, but not the single market. He said: ""Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union... with no new impediments to trade and no reduction in rights, standards and protections."" Inan article for the Independent last month,external, Sir Keir said: ""Labour will not support a deal that fails to meet the six tests I set out last year."" Fair migration system for UK business and communities Retaining strong, collaborative relationship with EU Protecting national security and tackling cross-border crime Delivering for all nations and regions of the UK Protecting workers' rights and employment protections Ensuring same benefits currently enjoyed within single market Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the cross-party Open Britain group, which campaigns against a ""hard Brexit"", said: ""Barry Gardiner's increasingly maverick behaviour must be embarrassing for his frontbench colleagues."" He added: ""Labour's policy, agreed by the party conference, is very clear: without the exact same benefits being on offer in any final Brexit deal, Labour would keep the option of staying in the EU on the table. ""It is time members of the shadow cabinet started speaking out for that and ended the sort of eccentric self-indulgence of the type shown by Barry Gardiner."" In remarks made at the same Brussels event, Mr Gardiner appeared to play down the risks of failing to resolve the border issue post-Brexit, and suggested both the Irish government and Sinn Fein may be exaggerating them. ""We must also recognise there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday Agreement,"" he said. Shibboleth means a long-standing custom, principle or way of speaking which identifies people as a member of a group - and in some modern uses it carries the implication of being outmoded or no longer important. Following criticism from Labour's former shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Smith and ex-leader Tony Blair, Mr Gardiner issued a statement insisting he ""absolutely"" does not believe the agreement was outdated. He said: ""I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding on that point - in particular, that my use of the word 'shibboleth' in its sense of 'password' or 'test of membership' gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday Agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant. I absolutely do not.""

"Loneliness is more likely to affect younger people and women, say researchers Young adults are more likely to feel lonely than older age groups, says a study from the Office for National Statistics. The research found that almost 10% of people aged 16 to 24 were ""always or often"" lonely - the highest proportion of any age group. This was more than three times higher than people aged 65 and over. Researchers suggest that older people might become more ""resilient"" to worries about loneliness. There has been growing political interest in loneliness as a significant social problem. The prime minister earlier this year set out plans to alleviate loneliness and ""social isolation"" - with a warning that millions of people were suffering from a lack of regular contact with others. The research from the ONS, based on a survey of more than 10,000 adults, found that about one in 20 people always or often felt lonely. Although there has been much focus on the isolation of elderly people, this study found that younger adults were the most likely to report feelings of loneliness and that such feelings ""tend to decrease with age"". Older people might be more resilient to loneliness, says study Across all the measures and categories, the researchers say that people aged over 75 are ""63 times less likely to report loneliness than those aged 16 to 24 years"". ""It's possible that people become more resilient to loneliness as they get older, possibly through the experience of significant life events and life transitions,"" says the study. Cal Strode, of the Mental Health Foundation, said that loneliness among young people could be driven by social media and the ""digital world"". ""Teens can have thousands of friends online and yet feel unsupported and isolated. Technology, including social media, could be exacerbating social isolation,"" he said. Women were consistently more likely than men to report feelings of loneliness. But the researchers suggested this could also be influenced by a reluctance among some men to admit to the extent of their loneliness. Social media may be making isolation worse, says a mental health charity The study highlighted particular groups at greater risk of loneliness. Older women who had been widowed and were living alone were particularly likely to be lonely, especially if this was exacerbated by illness. Radio 4's All in the Mind: The Loneliness Experiment. Is Britain really 'the loneliness capital of Europe'? Take part in the BBC's Loneliness Experiment survey Is loneliness damaging your health? How do we tackle the loneliness epidemic? Automated checkouts making loneliness worse Loneliness: The last taboo? People who were single, middle-aged, living alone and with poor health, were identified as another peak of loneliness. Loneliness was linked to a lack of permanence or sense of belonging - such as young renters who felt few connections to their local community. There were other themes that emerged - illness and unemployment made loneliness much more likely. Carers were more vulnerable to loneliness and to be cut off from friends. The study also profiled the least likely to be lonely. They were likely to be older, male, living with a partner, working, homeowners, well-connected with their local area and in good health. Laura Alcock-Ferguson of the Campaign to End Loneliness said the findings showed that loneliness was not about someone's ""personality"", but was likely to be driven by factors such as their ""health and economic status"". Izzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's committee on well-being, said: ""The harm loneliness can cause, both physically and mentally, can be devastating to people of all ages - it is a serious public health concern which studies suggest can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. ""We all need to be on the lookout for each other, which could be as simple as a quick visit to check on a neighbour, who could be a young mum without any family nearby, or an older person living alone,"" said Ms Seccombe, leader of Warwickshire County Council.

"This video can not be played A man was seen stamping on flowers and balloons left in tribute of Henry Vincent Flowers left near the site where a burglar was stabbed to death have been branded an ""insult"". Floral tributes and balloons for Henry Vincent, 37, have been repeatedly attached and then removed from a fence opposite a home in Hither Green, south-east London, where he was killed. Richard Osborn-Brooks, 78, was initially held on suspicion of murder, but released with no further action. Mr Vincent's family said the fence was ""the best place"" for a tribute. One resident fears the actions to tear down the tributes could ""cause a rumpus"" The bouquets have been repeatedly taken down by a man who called it an ""insult"" to Mr Osborn-Brooks. A man indentifying himself as Cecil Coley said he first removed the flowers overnight on Monday after becoming ""infuriated"" by the tributes. He said: ""It was a residential area they were placing flowers on. It was inappropriate, and the guy deserves no tribute."" Cecil Coley is also the name of a72-year-old florist who was arrested on suspicion of murderafter he stabbed an armed intruder to death in 2011. He was later released without charge. Friends and family of Henry Vincent returned to tie floral tributes to the fence on Tuesday Elvina Lee, who said she was Mr Vincent's first cousin, said: ""I don't know what's wrong with these people [who took them down]. ""He wasn't a murderer, he wasn't a rapist, they're putting him as a monster."" She was one of three women who arrived and re-fastened 20 bouquets and balloons to the fence on Tuesday afternoon.

Hither Green 'burglary death' suspect to face no action Saverimuthu Augustine, 78, said some of the tributes had been attached to his property. He said: ""I am annoyed they put them on my fence. I do not appreciate it. ""If it is a normal person it is different - it could have been my house [that was burgled]."" Henry Vincent was under investigation over a separate burglary involving an elderly victim Mr Vincent's cousin Phoebe Smith, 34, said whoever had torn down the flowers ""should be ashamed of themselves"". ""It's terrible - they don't understand that it's somebody's child. They're a memory of a son and a friend,"" she said. A coroner returned Mr Vincent's body to his family during an inquest opening at Southwark Coroner's Court on Tuesday. Assistant coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe told two of his female relatives: ""I know you are having a dreadful time."" Floral tributes to Henry Vincent have been repeatedly removed from a fence A 33-year-old neighbour, who did not want to be named, told the BBC he felt ""intimidated"". ""I think that it's really sad that someone's died and I think it's not their fault that he's died and it's up to them to grieve for him however they want to do it. ""It is quite stark and you can't help but feel it looks a bit confrontational. ""It's a massive, massive display right in front of the house. If the family want to lay flowers that's fine but it feels weird. ""It feels a bit aggressive to be honest."" The tributes are on a fence opposite Richard Osborn-Brooks's home which has been partially boarded up Many residents in Hither Green have interpreted the large tribute to Mr Vincent as an aggressive act. One neighbour said they saw a car circling the block while the tribute was being erected, which they believe was an attempt to intimidate locals. If intimidation was the aim, it appears to have worked. Most neighbours are reluctant to talk publicly for fear of being drawn into a dispute that may not be over. While those living on South Park Crescent have all been quick to offer condolences to Mr Vincent, they argue his is not the only life that has been ruined. Mr Osborn-Brooks and his family have not returned to their house since the burglary and their windows have now been boarded up for fear of reprisals. Another neighbour, Theresa Webb, described the tributes as ""inappropriate"" and of ""poor taste"". Speaking about Mr Osborn-Brooks, she added: ""One minute he is in his house and the next his life is turned upside down. ""Everyone around here sends their best wishes to him."" Richard Osborn-Brooks was held on suspicion of murder, but released with no further action Police had been called to Mr Osborn-Brooks's property at about 00:45 BST on 4 April over reports of a burglary when they found Mr Vincent collapsed in nearby Further Green Road. A witness said an accomplice dragged Mr Vincent toward a van before leaving him for dead. On Monday, the Met Police said 28-year-old Billy Jeeves was wanted in connection with the burglary. Emotional messages from Henry Vincent's children were part of the tributes Mr Jeeves's white Vauxhall Astra van was found burnt out and destroyed in Star Lane in Orpington, Bromley, on Saturday evening. Detectives want to hear from anybody who may have seen the van - with the registration GU52 AXT - in the days and hours before and after the burglary.

"This video can not be played Palm oil can be found in everyday items ranging from peanut butter and chocolate to instant noodles Iceland is to stop using palm oil in own-brand products by the end of 2018. The Deeside-based chain - the first major UK supermarket to ban palm oil - said it was used in more than half of its products, from biscuits to soap. Iceland said growing demand for the oil was devastating tropical rainforests across southeast Asia. The frozen food specialist said it was alerted to the environmental challenges that palm oil presented by campaigners at Greenpeace. The ban only applies to Iceland-brand products, meaning other products sold by the retailer may still contain palm oil. This video can not be played How do you make a palm oil-free mince pie? Iceland chef Neil Nugent explains Iceland managing director Richard Walker said there was ""no such thing"" as properly sustainable palm oil. ""Certified sustainable palm oil does not currently limit deforestation and it does not currently limit the growth of palm oil plantations,"" he told the BBC. ""So until such a time as there is genuinely sustainable palm oil that contains zero deforestation, we are saying no to palm oil."" Mr Walker said the move would increase costs but they would not be passed on to customers: ""There will be an extra cost but we think it's the right thing to do."" Palm oil: What are the issues? Can palm oil be produced sustainably? Palm oil linked to child labour in Indonesia Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008 Burning large areas of forests to clear areas where oil palms can be grown has also been blamed forhigh levels of air pollution in South East Asia Palm oil is used in almost half the products stocked by UK supermarkets and can be found in everything from shampoos to biscuits, as well as biofuels Some experts say eating palm oil is unhealthy because it is high in saturated fat EU labelling laws were changed in 2014 so products must now state specifically if they contain palm oil One species affected by palm oil production is the orangutan population. In some regions, oil palm cultivation has resulted in deforestation, leaving species that lived in virgin forest without a home. Some palm plantations have been developed without consulting local communities over the use of their land, or even caused them to be forcibly displaced. Palm oil cultivation can destroy habitats for orangutans There are organisations dedicated,externalto finding ways of producing palm oil more ethically and sustainably and a growing number of players in the palm oil industry have committed to adopting more sustainable practices. Despite the high level of concern over the effect palm oil has on the environment in countries where it is grown, a survey of more than 5,000 UK consumers found about a third were not sure what palm oil is. However, once they were told about effects on the environment, 85% said they did not think it should be used in food products. Iceland says it has already found alternative recipes for 50% of its own-label range. The store chain has a history of acting to remove controversial products from its shelves. It was the first supermarket to ban GM-grown crops in its own-brand goods, and earlier this year said it would eliminate or drastically reduce plastic packaging of all its own-label products by the end of 2023. Last year, the Bank of England considered the use of palm oil in its future banknote production, following complaints over the use of animal-derived tallow in its polymer notes. The Bank launched a public consultation, receiving responses from 3,554 people. Of those who expressed a preference, 88% were against the use of animal-derived products and 48% objected to the use of palm oil-derived additives. However, any switch to palm oil was ruled out as the Bank said its suppliers were ""unable to commit to sourcing the highest level of sustainable palm oil"". How do you make palm oil-free mince pies?

"This video can not be played Neal Gray describes the final time he and his wife saw Ellie alive Failings by agencies over the care of a six-year-old girl who was murdered by her father did not contribute to her death, a coroner has ruled. Ellie Butler was battered to death by her father Ben Butler in October 2013, 11 months after being returned to his care at the family's south London home. Butler, who was accused of shaking Ellie as baby, was jailed for life with a minimum of 23 years for her murder. The coroner, Dame Linda Dobbs, ruled that Ellie was unlawfully killed. Reacting to the ruling, Ellie's grandfather Neal Gray said Ellie had been ""let down by fundamental failings in the system"" and he was disappointed that the agencies ""have not had to account for the role they played"". He said he and his late wife Linda had been ""ignored"" whenever they had tried to give any input about her care. ""I still believe that, had the childcare agencies worked together and shared information, and had the parents not been so readily believed, Ellie would still be alive today."" Mr Gray also told the BBC he believes Ellie's parents used face paint to hide bruising on her face when he saw her. Ben Butler and Jennie Gray were jailed in June 2016 Concluding the inquest at South London Coroner's Court, Dame Linda said: ""On the evidence I am unable to conclude that any acts or omissions by the relevant agencies possibly or probably contributed to the death of Ellie."" She added it was ""unclear"" if all recommendations from aSerious Case Review into Ellie's death,external""have been implemented and audited"". The review found Sutton Children Services felt ""powerless to act"" following the High Court's ruling which led to Ellie returning to her parents. The exonerated father who went on to kill Killer father was a 'brutal maniac' 'Good judge' returned girl to killer father Butler was convicted of Ellie's murder after a trial in June 2016. Ellie's mother Jennie Gray was also jailed for three and a half years for child cruelty and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Ellie had been placed into the care of her grandparents Neal and Linda Gray when she was a baby after Butler was accused of shaking her. He successfully appealed and Mrs Justice Hogg in the family division of the High Court ruled that Ellie's parents had been ""exonerated"" of causing her injuries and she was returned to their home in Sutton in November 2012. Ellie Butler was murdered by her father 11 months after returning to his care During his evidence at the inquest, Mr Gray said his granddaughter's murder at the hands of a ""brutal maniac"" had been ""avoidable"". ""[Ellie] was placed at fatal risk by being returned to her parents. The circumstances surrounding it must be avoided so that lessons may be learned and other children protected in the future"", he said. Social workers from Services for Children (S4C), who worked to return Ellie to her parents, also agreed with Mr Gray that they had ""failed"" the girl. Butler and Gray both gave evidence to the inquest by video link from prison and repeatedly denied they caused their daughter any injuries. Butler, who also accused the coroner of being ""corrupt"", said: ""I don't accept I caused harm to Ellie and will fight in a different court to prove it."" Ellie was cared for by her grandparents for five years after Butler was accused of shaking her as a baby Gray told the inquest her partner's ""bark was worse than his bite"". The inquest covered the period between the ruling to return Ellie to her parents and her death, but did not look at how Mrs Justice Hogg's decision was made. Following her ruling the coroner stressed that those who were worried about any court judgment should be able to raise those concerns. ""Lawyers are only advisers, they are not decision makers. That responsibility lies with the agencies themselves,"" she said. After the inquest, Christine Davies, independent chairwoman of the Sutton Local Safeguarding Children Board, said measures had been subsequently been put in place ""to ensure, as far as possible, such a tragedy never occurs again"". In a statement, S4C said it hoped the inquest would ""help to ensure that the most efficient system possible is in place to protect children in future."" Neal Gray said he believes Ellie's parents used face paint to hide bruising on her face February 2007: At six weeks old and in the sole care of her father, Ellie was found to be ""suddenly soft and limp"". Scans showed she had serious injuries June 2007: Ellie was placed in the care of her grandparents January 2008: The Family Court found that, on the balance of probability, Butler caused Ellie's injuries and Gray failed to protect her March 2009: Butler was convicted of grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He had a history of offending and violence June 2010: His criminal conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal on the basis of new medical evidence July 2012: The Family Court overturned an order which protected Ellie from her parents. It exonerated Butler and said that any injury caused to Ellie was ""purely accidental"" An independent social work agency was appointed to replace Sutton Council's social workers to oversee the children being returned to their parents The children were not subject to any court orders which had an effect of preventing agencies (social workers, child protection, schools etc) from having any further involvement November 2012: Ellie was returned to her parents' care October 2013: Ellie was murdered by her father Killer father was a 'brutal maniac' Ellie Butler 'not in pain' after injury 'Good judge' returned girl to killer father Killed girl's granddad disowns daughter Child murderer calls coroner 'corrupt' Custody battle father murdered daughter South London Coroner South London's Christmas Lane Community pays tribute to 14-year-old with âpure heartâ stabbed to death on bus The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Michelle Sadio: Arrest after woman killed in drive-by shooting outside London church Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Supply Teaching Assistant - Kingston Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

But videos by more than a dozen other artists posted by the music hosting service Vevo - including Shakira, Selena Gomez, Drake and Taylor Swift - were also affected. The hackers, calling themselves Prosox and Kuroi'sh, had replaced some of the videos' titles with their own messages, including a call to ""free Palestine"" alongside their own nicknames. ""After seeing unusual upload activity on a handful of Vevo channels, we worked quickly with our partner to disable access while they investigate the issue,"" a spokeswoman for YouTube told the BBC. Vevo added: ""We are working to reinstate all videos affected and our catalogue to be restored to full working order. We are continuing to investigate the source of the breach."" Vevopreviously experienced a breach,externalin September 2017 when some of its files were stolen and leaked online.

"This video can not be played The BBC accompanied a ""paedophile hunter"" group based in West Yorkshire on two 'stings' Evidence from so-called paedophile hunter groups was used to charge suspects at least 150 times last year, a BBC investigation has found. A Freedom of Information request, sent to every police force in England and Wales, showed a seven-fold increase in the use of such evidence from 2015. Twenty-nine of the forty-three forces approached (67%) provided data. Despite this, the National Police Chiefs Council say the groups' tactics present ""significant risks"". The online groups use what they call ""decoys"" to pose as underage children and wait to be contacted by adults. They then converse privately with adults and identify those attempting to groom young people. Individuals are then tracked down, the confrontation is often streamed live on social media and police are called. ""They [the targets] are always made aware of the child's age at the start of the chat, so there's no misconception about how old the child is,"" Sarah said. ""We class ourselves as child protectors - if a potential predator is talking to my decoy, they aren't talking to a real child, that's the way I look at it."" Sarah told the BBC she spent hours replying to messages which often contain explicit language, photos and videos. ""I set a new decoy up one night, by the next morning I had had 180 friend requests, mostly from men,"" she said. ""We're only touching the tip of the iceberg, it's right across social media. Even if we just take 20 out, those 20 aren't going to be child rapists."" It is thought about 75 active ""paedophile hunter"" groups are operating across the UK. Police warn the groups' actions may interfere with surveillance operations and ""evidence"" they gather may be illegally obtained and therefore excluded from a prosecution. One group, Predator Exposure, was founded in Leeds in 2016 and claims to have supplied evidence leading to the conviction of more than 20 sex crime offenders in the past 12 months. A recruitment event was held in a pub in Bradford to find volunteer ""decoys"" Speaking at a volunteer recruitment day at a pub in Bradford, ex-convict Phil Hoban, who started the group, said: ""The police can say 'we don't like you doing this, we don't like you doing that', but we're going to continue."" Mr Hoban served 15 months in prison in 2005 for his part in a robbery where a cash machine was stolen in East Yorkshire. This video can not be played Phil Hoban is a paedophile hunter, he claims his group safeguards children. He said his group, which has seven members, staged the enrolment drive for new ""decoys"" in order to deal with the growing demand. Potential volunteers were told the role would take up a great deal of spare time and an interest in child protection was required. Each police force in England and Wales was asked by the BBC to say how many people had been charged after evidence was given by paedophile hunters, with 29 out of 43 able to give three years' worth of figures. The supplied data showed a greater than seven-fold rise in two years - from 20 in 2015 to 150 in 2017. Of the police forces that responded, almost half (47%) of the cases of the crime of meeting a child following sexual grooming used evidence from so-called paedophile hunting groups in 2017. The data only confirms that the evidence was used in some part. It does not suggest that the vigilantes' actions were solely responsible for charges being brought. Assistant Chief Constable Catherine Hankinson, of West Yorkshire Police, urged those who are involved in paedophile hunter groups to bring them evidence but to then ""let us deal with it"". ""It does present significant risks when these groups confront individuals, first of all for themselves - these are often very high-octane, emotional situations,"" she said. ""There's significant risk involved for the individuals that they are confronting, not least because it might sometimes be an innocent member of the public or it might actually disrupt a wider undercover policing investigation that we've got ongoing."" Chief Constable Simon Bailey, from the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""The increase in these groups is symptomatic of the increasing scale of child sexual abuse that police are dealing with. ""It reinforces the need for technology companies to do more to prevent offenders using their platforms to prey on children and for children to be educated about healthy relationships and staying safe online.""

"Waitrose is to stop using disposable coffee cups in a move the supermarket says will save 52 million cups a year. Some 2.5 billion coffee cups are thrown away annually in the UK, almost none of which are recycled because of their plastic lining. Disposable cups will be removed from all Waitrose stores by the autumn. Members of its loyalty scheme will still be able to get free tea or coffee from self-service machines but must use their own reusable cup. Waitrose said the decision underlined its commitment to plastic and packaging reduction. Tor Harris, its head of sustainability, said: ""We realise this is a major change, but we ... are confident the majority of customers will support the environmental benefits."" Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem MPs call for latte levy Initially, disposable cups will be removed from nine stores by the end of April: Banbury, Billericay, Ipswich, Newmarket, Norwich, Sudbury, Wymondham, Upminster, east London and Fitzroy Street, Cambridge. The scheme will then be rolled out to all its stores by the autumn. The supermarket, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, has more than 350 stores in the UK including its convenience shops. MyWaitrose members will not be able to claim a free hot drink in the chain's 180 in-store cafes. Those members who buy a tea or coffee in a cafe will be offered a choice of food options or with a significant discount. The Waitrose move comes as the government considers a ""latte levy"" that would impose a charge on disposable coffee cups after the CommonsEnvironmental Audit Committee called for a 25p taxto improve the UK's recycling and reprocessing facilities.

"Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and George Mitchell are in Belfast for the anniversary The Good Friday Agreement was a ""work of genius"" which helped to preserve the concept of democracy, former US president Bill Clinton has said. He was addressing a Belfast conference to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1998 deal, which helped to end 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr Clinton was taking part in a panel discussion with former British PM Tony Blair and former Irish PM Bertie Ahern. Mr Blair said the 1998 deal took ""real courage"" by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for ""all its faults"", the Good Friday Agreement was ""worth doing and worth keeping"". LIVE - Good Friday Agreement anniversary events Peace deal remembered - 20 years on The children of the Good Friday Agreement The Good Friday Agreement in full,external BBC - History - The Good Friday Agreement The anniversary celebrations have been overshadowed by the absence of devolution due to serious problems between Stormont's two biggest parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in. The three former leaders urged Northern Ireland's current political parties to keeping working to restore power sharing. The three men were lauded for their role in the peace process Mr Ahern said: ""The art of politics is compromise, you can't make progress without compromise. ""Compromise is when people come together and say, 'listen, this is the dilemma, this is the difficulty, this is what is unsaleable to my people' and let us try and find a way out."" Reflecting on legacy of the 1998 deal, Mr Clinton said: ""The Good Friday Agreement is a work of genius that's applicable if you care at all about preserving democracy. Bill Clinton said the deal was a ""work of surpassing genius"" ""It called for real democracy - majority rule; minority rights; individual rights; the rule of law; the end of violence; shared political decision-making; shared economic benefits."" Mr Clinton added that the deal had ""maintained the relationship with the United Kingdom, expanded the relationship with the Irish Republic, and then, let the future take its course"". ""The most interesting thing was by creating a space for the identity and the interests and the values of all the people involved - in a framework which protected democracy and let future demographic, economic and political changes take Northern Ireland wherever it would go - it was a work of surpassing genius."" This video can not be played Gerry Adams describes how he knew the Good Friday Agreement would be embraced by most of people The anniversary conference took place at Queen's University, Belfast and the panel discussion was chaired by former US Senator George Mitchell, who also chaired the 1998 talks. Mr Mitchell told the audience the Northern Ireland of today was ""unrecognisable"" and a ""better place"" than the one he worked in 20 years ago. He acknowledged there were problems at the moment, but urged current political leaders to show the same ""vision and courage that the leaders of Northern Ireland in 1998 demonstrated"". ""History will look back on this day as a reflection of how far we have come in Northern Ireland and how much further we still have to travel,"" Mr Mitchell said. This video can not be played George Mitchell: Northern Ireland is a better place now He asked the audience to give a standing ovation to the former leaders who delivered the Good Friday Agreement, hailing them as ""heroes and peacemakers"". ""Today across the western world, it's considered fashionable to demean and insult political leaders, and certainly much is deserved, but we don't pay enough attention or tribute to those political leaders who do dare greatly and succeed,"" he added. ""In Northern Ireland, these were ordinary men and women but after 700 days of failure, they joined in one day of success and they changed the course of history."" Members of the 'Class of 1998' posed for photos outside Queen's University Several former party leaders were in the audience at Queen's University Later, in a ceremony at the Ulster Hall, President Clinton and Senator Mitchell received the freedom of Belfast - the 83rd and 84th recipients of the honour. Alongside the Lord Mayor, Nuala McAllister, and with a stage filled with city councillors, the two men received a warm ovation from an invited audience. President Clinton and Senator Mitchell holding their certificates granting them Freedom of the City of Belfast The former senator, whose father's parents were from Ireland, also said that his personal role in the peace process had reconnected him with his Irish heritage. ""Many of you have thanked me for my work here. My response is that it is I who should be grateful, and I am, for you have filled an inner void that I didn't even know existed. ""I am an American and very proud of it, but a large part of my heart and of my emotions will forever be with the people of Northern Ireland. ""May God bless them with peace, with prosperity and true reconciliation."" The scaffolding outside Queen's University said it all: This is still a work in progress. That was the message delivered inside by the architects of the Good Friday Agreement. This was not a day for back slapping but a moment to take stock. Yes, to share memories but also to deliver messages to the current crop of political leaders about the stalemate at Stormont. The call from the class of '98 was clear: Finish the job started 20 years ago. Mr Mitchell played a key role in broking the agreement that was then ratified in a referendum on both sides of the Irish border in May 1998. It set up a power-sharing assembly to govern Northern Ireland by cross-community consent. However, the deal proved difficult to implement and was amended by the St Andrew's Agreement in 2006. A bitter dispute between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in led to the collapse of their power-sharing government in January 2017 and despite several rounds of talks to resolve the crisis, the executive has not met for 16 months. This video can not be played Seamus Mallon says he feels anger 20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement ""The lesson with these things... is that once you've got a viable peace process you've got to just work at it and work at it and realise that the right comparison is with what things were like during the course of the Troubles,"" Mr Blair told the BBC's Today programme. ""We used to wake every day to death and destruction."" The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who was part of the Ulster Unionist negotiating team in the run-up to the agreement, said the party's then leader David Trimble was bullied into signing a flawed deal. This video can not be played Key architects of the agreement recall the days leading up to Good Friday 1998 ""It didn't see an end to paramilitarism, it didn't see the promised political stability that the agreement heralded and here we are 20 years on from the agreement without a government,"" he said. ""Northern Ireland is in a better place today than it was 20 years ago, that's for sure, but we still have a long way to go and the flaws in the agreement that were not addressed at the time still need to be addressed.""

"This video can not be played Lisa Jones says the protesters' presence is ""cruel"" and ""unfair"" Anti-abortion campaigners have been accused of harassing women outside abortion clinics across the UK. With one council now deciding whether to ban them, some women say they are still haunted by protesters' behaviour. ""They said I was a murderer... that I was killing something with a heartbeat,"" Lisa Jones tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She says she was harassed a number of years ago by anti-abortion protesters surrounding the entrance to an abortion clinic in Ealing, west London, where she was being seen. ""The words still live with me today, still haunt me today."" The campaigners have been protesting there for 20 years. Armed with placards and prayer beads, their aim is to convince women not to have an abortion. Lisa had been advised by doctors to terminate her pregnancy after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and so never saw it as a choice. ""I was made to have an abortion,"" she says. ""I'd tried for a few years to fall pregnant and when I did fall pregnant it was the best thing ever, and to be told, 'You can't have that', it's absolutely heart-wrenching."" She says the protesters' comments almost made her risk her life, and not go through with the abortion. ""I was happy to come out of clinic, go home and risk my life because I didn't want to be branded a murderer,"" she explains. ""But I couldn't."" Seeing them still standing outside the clinic ""angers and frustrates me"", she says. ""I think it's cruel, unfair. I don't think it should be allowed."" Ealing is to decide whether to create a ""buffer zone"" to stop protesting in front of a clinic Following a consultation, Ealing Council in London will now vote on whether to ban campaigners from protesting outside the Marie Stopes clinic by introducing a ""buffer zone"" - which pro-choice groups want to cover an area of 100 metres from the clinic. Abortion charities hope it could pave the way for other councils to do the same. The government has also held its own consultation into harassment and intimidation near abortion clinics. The Home Office says it is now reviewing the responses, before deciding whether to take action. Anti-abortion groups say they are actually there to offer support to women who do not want an abortion, but who see no other way out. Watch Jean Mackenzie's filmon anti-abortion campaigners on the Victoria Derbyshire website. The vigils - in which they pray for the mothers and unborn children, and hand out leaflets - are sporadic. Some days there are dozens of people, other times just a couple. In Birmingham, Rachel Mackenzie has been attending local vigils for three years. She has had two abortions herself, but now regrets them. ""I stand outside the clinics because I don't want there to be another 'Rachel' who goes through those abortion facilities to one day regret it,"" she says. ""If somebody had been there to actually ground me and say, 'There are other options out there', maybe my children would be alive today."" Rachel Mackenzie says she ""very quietly prays"" outside the clinic Last year nearly 200,000 women had an abortion in England and Wales, and it is estimated that a third of women will have an abortion in their lifetime. But the British Pregnancy Advisory Service - one of the country's largest abortion providers - says approximately one in five of the women they see decide to continue with their pregnancy, after being supported by staff at clinics. Rachel says that when she stands outside her local clinic she will ""very quietly pray"". ""I'll say, 'Can I help you, here's a leaflet'... and I just show them love"". She says she has seen no evidence of women being abused or being called 'murderers', and that this ""would not be allowed"". But for some women, the protesters' presence alone is upsetting. Rebecca - whose surname we are not using - had an abortion 18 months ago at another clinic in the UK, and says she was left shaken by them being there. ""I remember just feeling so scared of [having the abortion]. ""I didn't expect to be faced with a group of people standing outside, casting shame on what was a really difficult thing for me"" she says. ""There is one man I will always remember. He looked at me as I got out of the car and just stared at me, and then just put his head down. I felt like a completely unacceptable human being. ""It was something I thought about all that day, the following days, weeks, months - and to this day, when I reflect back on that time, I think of that. ""It added a lot of pain to something that was already very painful."" Alina Dulgheriu says the pro-life campaigners' support allowed her to keep her child Rachel says she is sorry some women feel protesters are making their experience worse. When asked if she has led anyone to change their mind about having an abortion, she says she does not believe she personally has. But she does say the work of protesters on the whole has led ""hundreds of women"" to decide not to have an abortion. One group that organises vigils introduced us to a woman it says it supported through her pregnancy. Alina Dulgheriu - who became pregnant while working as a live-in au pair - said she was thankful for their help, after she originally ""gave in"" to the father's wish that she should not keep the child, as she did not see how she could otherwise live financially. She says the group gave her a room to stay, a cot and a buggy, and weekly money - which meant she did not have to have the abortion. But Rebecca says it is clear the protesters have a damaging effect on many women. ""I would like these individuals who continue to protest outside clinics to know that when they stand [there] for one or two hours, it's a small part of their day, but for the women experiencing this, they will remember this for the rest of their lives.""

"The case involves former basketball player Andrea Constand Bill Cosby paid the woman accusing him of sexual assault almost $3.4m (Â£2.4m) in a civil settlement in 2006. The figure was revealed during opening remarks at the actor and comedian's retrial in Pennsylvania on Monday. Mr Cosby, now 80, denies drugging and sexually assaulting former basketball player Andrea Constand 14 years ago. The actor, who starred in the 1980s TV series The Cosby Show, has faced allegations from dozens of other women but has denied them all. His first trial, in June 2017, ended when the jury failed to reach a verdict. The existence of the civil settlement between Mr Cosby and Ms Constand in 2006 was known about at the time of the first trial. The amount, however, was previously kept confidential. Last week, Judge Steven O'Neill ruled that it could be revealed to the jury in the course of the new trial. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The retrial takes place in the light ofthe #MeToo movement, which has raised awareness of alleged sexual misconduct by a number of powerful media figures. Protesters, waving placards reading ""justice for survivors"", gathered outside the courtroom ahead of the retrial. One topless protester was charged with disorderly conduct. She was later identified asNicolle Rochelle, who appeared on The Cosby Show,externalfour times between 1990 and 1992. Mr Cosby has been charged with aggravated indecent assault, which could carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years. His lawyers say he and Ms Constand shared a romantic relationship after they met at Mr Cosby's old university. Ms Constand, who is from Canada, had played basketball professionally in Italy and for Canada's national women's team. When the alleged attack took place, Ms Constand was working as director of operations for the women's basketball team at Temple University, Philadelphia. Cosby's diehard fans stick by fallen idol Judge declares mistrial in Bill Cosby case Around 60 women over five decades have publicly accused the Emmy award-winning actor of being a sexual predator. But statute of limitation laws mean that only one charge has been brought to trial. The retrial will be before the same judge and district attorney as the first trial - but the judge will this time allow five additional accusers to give evidence. Mr Cosby has long been considered a Hollywood trailblazer for African Americans. He rose to fame as the first black actor to star in a major drama series, I Spy, in 1965. The role earned him three of his four Emmy awards before he created several shows including the influential The Cosby Show in 1984. In January, the comedian performed his first stand-up gig since 2015, for which he was criticised by some on social media.

"A bitter row has broken out between Labour and the Conservatives over their language and response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Boris Johnson accused Jeremy Corbyn of refusing to ""unequivocally"" blame the Russian state, describing him as ""the Kremlin's useful idiot"". But Labour said Mr Johnson was the ""idiot"" having ""undermined his own government's position"" on the evidence. Moscow has denied the UK government's claim that it was behind the attack. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Ex-spy 'improving rapidly' after poisoning The UK says there is ""no other plausible explanation"" for the incident, while Russia has accused Britain of  waging a ""propaganda war"" against it over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, on 4 March. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said the Kremlin had made a ""cynical attempt to bury awkward facts beneath an avalanche of lies and disinformation"". He said the Russian government and state-owned media had invented 29 theories about the attack. ""There is only one thing that gives the Kremlin succour and lends false credibility to its propaganda onslaught. That is when politicians from the targeted countries join in,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Sadly, I am driven to the conclusion that Jeremy Corbyn has joined this effort ...Truly he is the Kremlin's useful idiot"". The health of Mr Skripal and his daughter are said to be improving Fellow Conservatives joined the attack on the Labour Leader. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC: ""There's no doubt when it comes up against this issue with Russia that we are having, this very serious issue, that Jeremy Corbyn has let the British people down."" And policing minister Nick Hurd said that while the phrase ""useful idiot"" was part of ""the lexicon of Johnson"", he added: ""I feel very strongly that Jeremy Corbyn has been insufficiently clear in his condemnation of Russia."" Labour has already called for an investigation into whether Mr Johnson misled the public about Russia's involvement, in his remarks about the findings of the UK's defence laboratory Porton Down. The party said that in an interview given to German TV last month, Mr Johnson said that ""people from Porton Down"" were ""absolutely categorical"", adding: ""I asked the guy myself. I said 'are you sure?', and he said 'there's no doubt'."" But last week, the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson is the government's useful idiot because what he's done is create a situation where he has contradicted the evidence and overstepped the mark. ""Porton Down have been absolutely clear that they didn't say what Boris Johnson said."" She said that Mr Johnson had ""driven a wedge for the Russians to say there are questions on the evidence."" ""I think that is really dangerous, that we have got a foreign secretary that undermines his own government's position."" The UK has refused to grant Viktoria Skripal a visa to visit Britain Labour says Mr Corbyn ""has repeatedly said the evidence points to Russia being responsible, directly or indirectly, and that the Russian authorities must be held to account on the basis of evidence"". On Saturday, the Foreign Office described a Russian request for a meeting with Mr Johnson on the Salisbury poisoning as a ""diversionary tactic"". Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy has also requested a meeting with Scotland Yard over its handling of the suspected murder of Russian businessman Nikolay Glushkov. Mr Glushkov was found dead in his home in New Malden, south London, on 12 March. Four days later the Met launched a murder investigation and an inquest heard the 68-year-old's cause of death was compression to the neck. ""For Russia this murder has a criminal as well as political dimension,"" an embassy spokesman said. ""Almost a month has passed since Mr Glushkov's death, and like ... with Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the British side provided no information."" Mr Glushkov was a close friend of outspoken President Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch found hanged at his Berkshire home in 2013. The Met made no comment. The requests followed Russian Embassy criticism of the UK government's refusal - on immigration rules - to grant a visa to Ms Skripal's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, to visit Britain. The embassy says the refusal to allow Viktoria Skripal to visit her cousin and uncle was ""disappointing"" and ""politically motivated"". Mr Skripal was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain, but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010. Yulia was visiting him in the UK when the attack happened on 4 March. She is now conscious and talking in hospital. Salisbury District Hospital has said Mr Skripal is responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"".

"A 5.5%, or Â£60 a year, rise in energy prices for British Gas customers on default deals has been branded as ""unjustified"" by the government. The company, the UK's largest energy supplier, said that 4.1 million of its customers would be affected. The increase will take effect from 29 May and follows its 12.5% rise in electricity prices last September. British Gas argued that it was raising prices owing to factors beyond its control, such as wholesale costs. The 5.5% increase, which applies to both gas and electricity, will see the average annual standard variable dual-fuel bill for British Gas customers go up to Â£1,161. Energy minister Claire Perry said: ""We are disappointed by British Gas's announcement of an unjustified price rise in its default tariff when customers are already paying more than they need to."" Energy regulator Ofgem described the increase as ""unwelcome"" and encouraged householders to shop around. Those who pay their bill by cash or cheque will see an average annual price rise of nearly Â£85. Customers in different areas of the country face different price rises. Those in the West Midlands and southern Scotland face the biggest increase. British Gas customer Mike Gibson, from Newcastle, said: ""I am a loyal British Gas customer. I've been with them as long as I can remember, over 20 years. ""I am leaving British Gas. This price rise is the final straw. This increase will have a real impact on me financially so I will look for a cheaper option. ""I am one of those people who always thinks that I should switch provider, but I never do. I get a bill and decide I am going to switch, but I forget about it in a few days. ""This is a big enough hike that I am definitely going to switch this time. I think I will be able to find a provider that is about Â£200 a year cheaper, so for me it is really worth it."" British Gas said it had to lift prices following a rise in the cost of producing energy - including wholesale costs. The company pointed to a similar decision by energy regulator Ofgem, which recently blamed wholesale costs for the rise in thedefault tariff for those with prepayment meters. Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, of which British Gas is a part, said: ""We fully understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers' household bills. This increase we are announcing today is reflective of the costs we are seeing which are beyond our control."" He also blamed the extra charges it faced as part of government policy, such as the introduction of smart meters and emissions targets. ""Government policies, intended to transform the energy system, are important but they are putting pressure on customers' bills. We believe government should level the playing field so the customers of all suppliers pay a fair share of energy policy costs,"" Mr Hodges said. ""We continue to encourage government to consider moving these costs out of energy bills altogether and into general taxation."" Price comparison websites, which make money from customers switching suppliers, are predicting that other energy companies will follow the British Gas price rise. Stephen Murray, from Moneysupermarket, said: ""No doubt we will see speculation on which supplier might follow and how consumers need protection from rip-off prices."" Ed Molyneux, head of research for switching service Look After My Bills, said: ""The data is clear, there is simply no justification for price hikes now, especially when British Gas put their prices up last year. Costs are still under the peak that triggered the first round price rises last year."" A spokesman for regulator Ofgem said: ""Ofgem is working with the government to protect all consumers on poor value default tariffs, including standard variable tariffs, from being overcharged by suppliers by introducing a default tariff price cap. ""In the meantime, we encourage British Gas customers affected by the price rise announced today to see if they can save money by switching to a better deal as savings of up to almost Â£300 are available."" Energy firms have faced pressure from politicians over pricing, and the use of standard variable tariffs which have been deemed poor value for consumers. British Gas hasscrapped standard variable tariffsfor new customers - following similar moves by E.On and Scottish Power. Those British Gas customers already on fixed-term contracts who fail to opt for a replacement when the deal ends are now put on a separate default tariff. This so-called Temporary Tariff will also rise by Â£60 on 29 May. At an average of Â£1,136 a year, it is slightly cheaper than the standard variable tariff used by existing customers. Centrica's Mr Hodges said: ""We also continue to call on Ofgem to end the standard variable tariff across the market which would encourage customers to proactively seek the best energy deal for them."" Although it is not specifically raising energy prices, E.On recently announced changes to how it bills customers which will see the average standard variable tariff rate rise by Â£22 a year from 19 April.

"This video can not be played Trump: FBI raid of my lawyer's office is ""a whole new level of unfairness"" US President Donald Trump says the FBI's raid on the offices of his personal lawyer was a ""disgrace"" and an ""attack on our country"". ""I have this witch hunt constantly going on,"" he told White House reporters. Officials in New York seized ""privileged communications"" between Michael Cohen and his clients, his lawyer said after the raid on Monday. Documents regarding a payment to a porn actress were also seized, US media say. Law enforcement acted on a ""referral"" from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Mr Trump criticised the investigation and described Mr Mueller's team as ""the most biased group of people"". On Tuesday morning he repeated his criticism of the raid, tweeting it marked the end of attorney-client privilege, or confidential communications between lawyers and their clients.

The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? Mr Cohen has come under increasing public scrutiny since he admitted to making a $130,000 (Â£92,000) payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, just days before the 2016 presidential election. Ms Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Mr Trump shortly after his wife Melania gave birth to their son and says she was paid to keep quiet about the affair. ""Today the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients,"" Mr Cohen's lawyer Stephen M Ryan said in a statement. ""I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller."" This video can not be played Schumer to Trump: Attorney raid not an attack on US Mr Ryan called the raid ""completely inappropriate and unnecessary"". ""It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients. These government tactics are also wrong because Mr Cohen has co-operated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath,"" the statement said. Mr Trump, who has denied having an affair with Ms Daniels, said he was unaware of Mr Cohen's payment to her and referred questions to the lawyer. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington When a president's personal lawyer is the target of a federal law-enforcement raid, it is a Big Deal. How big a deal remains to be seen, but the fact that the move came at the request of the Justice Department's Southern District of New York - after a referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office - could be an indication that Donald Trump's affairs are now relevant to a second criminal probe. Trump-watchers may recall that the president had fired the former US attorney for the Southern District, Preet Bharara, and was reportedly personally interviewing his replacement. A year later, the office is still under the direction of an interim appointment. According to the New York Times, FBI agents sought information on payments made relating to Mr Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels and other tax and business dealings. What was once largely a political embarrassment could have metastasised into legal jeopardy. Mr Cohen's ties to Mr Trump run deep. He's more than just a personal lawyer, he's a friend and fixer. He was already on Mr Mueller's radar for his work for the Trump organisation in Russia. Now the scope of his legal concerns may have dramatically expanded. Mr Cohen is under investigation for finance violations relating to the 2016 presidential campaign, The Washington Post reports. Mr Mueller reportedly gave the information involving Mr Cohen to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who then referred the matter to the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, according to Bloomberg News. Justice Department protocol requires Mr Mueller to consult Mr Rosenstein on evidence and subject matter that are beyond his jurisdiction.

"This video can not be played A man was seen stamping on flowers and balloons left in tribute of Henry Vincent Flowers left near the site where a burglar was stabbed to death have been branded an ""insult"". Floral tributes and balloons for Henry Vincent, 37, have been repeatedly attached and then removed from a fence opposite a home in Hither Green, south-east London, where he was killed. Richard Osborn-Brooks, 78, was initially held on suspicion of murder, but released with no further action. Mr Vincent's family said the fence was ""the best place"" for a tribute. One resident fears the actions to tear down the tributes could ""cause a rumpus"" The bouquets have been repeatedly taken down by a man who called it an ""insult"" to Mr Osborn-Brooks. A man indentifying himself as Cecil Coley said he first removed the flowers overnight on Monday after becoming ""infuriated"" by the tributes. He said: ""It was a residential area they were placing flowers on. It was inappropriate, and the guy deserves no tribute."" Cecil Coley is also the name of a72-year-old florist who was arrested on suspicion of murderafter he stabbed an armed intruder to death in 2011. He was later released without charge. Friends and family of Henry Vincent returned to tie floral tributes to the fence on Tuesday Elvina Lee, who said she was Mr Vincent's first cousin, said: ""I don't know what's wrong with these people [who took them down]. ""He wasn't a murderer, he wasn't a rapist, they're putting him as a monster."" She was one of three women who arrived and re-fastened 20 bouquets and balloons to the fence on Tuesday afternoon.

I do not appreciate it. ""If it is a normal person it is different - it could have been my house [that was burgled]."" Henry Vincent was under investigation over a separate burglary involving an elderly victim Mr Vincent's cousin Phoebe Smith, 34, said whoever had torn down the flowers ""should be ashamed of themselves"". ""It's terrible - they don't understand that it's somebody's child. They're a memory of a son and a friend,"" she said. A coroner returned Mr Vincent's body to his family during an inquest opening at Southwark Coroner's Court on Tuesday. Assistant coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe told two of his female relatives: ""I know you are having a dreadful time."" Floral tributes to Henry Vincent have been repeatedly removed from a fence A 33-year-old neighbour, who did not want to be named, told the BBC he felt ""intimidated"". ""I think that it's really sad that someone's died and I think it's not their fault that he's died and it's up to them to grieve for him however they want to do it. ""It is quite stark and you can't help but feel it looks a bit confrontational. ""It's a massive, massive display right in front of the house. If the family want to lay flowers that's fine but it feels weird. ""It feels a bit aggressive to be honest."" The tributes are on a fence opposite Richard Osborn-Brooks's home which has been partially boarded up Many residents in Hither Green have interpreted the large tribute to Mr Vincent as an aggressive act. One neighbour said they saw a car circling the block while the tribute was being erected, which they believe was an attempt to intimidate locals. If intimidation was the aim, it appears to have worked. Most neighbours are reluctant to talk publicly for fear of being drawn into a dispute that may not be over. While those living on South Park Crescent have all been quick to offer condolences to Mr Vincent, they argue his is not the only life that has been ruined. Mr Osborn-Brooks and his family have not returned to their house since the burglary and their windows have now been boarded up for fear of reprisals. Another neighbour, Theresa Webb, described the tributes as ""inappropriate"" and of ""poor taste"". Speaking about Mr Osborn-Brooks, she added: ""One minute he is in his house and the next his life is turned upside down. ""Everyone around here sends their best wishes to him."" Richard Osborn-Brooks was held on suspicion of murder, but released with no further action Police had been called to Mr Osborn-Brooks's property at about 00:45 BST on 4 April over reports of a burglary when they found Mr Vincent collapsed in nearby Further Green Road. A witness said an accomplice dragged Mr Vincent toward a van before leaving him for dead. On Monday, the Met Police said 28-year-old Billy Jeeves was wanted in connection with the burglary. Emotional messages from Henry Vincent's children were part of the tributes Mr Jeeves's white Vauxhall Astra van was found burnt out and destroyed in Star Lane in Orpington, Bromley, on Saturday evening. Detectives want to hear from anybody who may have seen the van - with the registration GU52 AXT - in the days and hours before and after the burglary.

"This video can not be played The BBC accompanied a ""paedophile hunter"" group based in West Yorkshire on two 'stings' Evidence from so-called paedophile hunter groups was used to charge suspects at least 150 times last year, a BBC investigation has found. A Freedom of Information request, sent to every police force in England and Wales, showed a seven-fold increase in the use of such evidence from 2015. Twenty-nine of the forty-three forces approached (67%) provided data. Despite this, the National Police Chiefs Council say the groups' tactics present ""significant risks"". The online groups use what they call ""decoys"" to pose as underage children and wait to be contacted by adults. They then converse privately with adults and identify those attempting to groom young people. Individuals are then tracked down, the confrontation is often streamed live on social media and police are called. ""They [the targets] are always made aware of the child's age at the start of the chat, so there's no misconception about how old the child is,"" Sarah said. ""We class ourselves as child protectors - if a potential predator is talking to my decoy, they aren't talking to a real child, that's the way I look at it."" Sarah told the BBC she spent hours replying to messages which often contain explicit language, photos and videos. ""I set a new decoy up one night, by the next morning I had had 180 friend requests, mostly from men,"" she said. ""We're only touching the tip of the iceberg, it's right across social media. Even if we just take 20 out, those 20 aren't going to be child rapists."" It is thought about 75 active ""paedophile hunter"" groups are operating across the UK. Police warn the groups' actions may interfere with surveillance operations and ""evidence"" they gather may be illegally obtained and therefore excluded from a prosecution. One group, Predator Exposure, was founded in Leeds in 2016 and claims to have supplied evidence leading to the conviction of more than 20 sex crime offenders in the past 12 months. A recruitment event was held in a pub in Bradford to find volunteer ""decoys"" Speaking at a volunteer recruitment day at a pub in Bradford, ex-convict Phil Hoban, who started the group, said: ""The police can say 'we don't like you doing this, we don't like you doing that', but we're going to continue."" Mr Hoban served 15 months in prison in 2005 for his part in a robbery where a cash machine was stolen in East Yorkshire. This video can not be played Phil Hoban is a paedophile hunter, he claims his group safeguards children. He said his group, which has seven members, staged the enrolment drive for new ""decoys"" in order to deal with the growing demand. Potential volunteers were told the role would take up a great deal of spare time and an interest in child protection was required. Each police force in England and Wales was asked by the BBC to say how many people had been charged after evidence was given by paedophile hunters, with 29 out of 43 able to give three years' worth of figures. The supplied data showed a greater than seven-fold rise in two years - from 20 in 2015 to 150 in 2017. Of the police forces that responded, almost half (47%) of the cases of the crime of meeting a child following sexual grooming used evidence from so-called paedophile hunting groups in 2017. The data only confirms that the evidence was used in some part. It does not suggest that the vigilantes' actions were solely responsible for charges being brought. Assistant Chief Constable Catherine Hankinson, of West Yorkshire Police, urged those who are involved in paedophile hunter groups to bring them evidence but to then ""let us deal with it"". ""It does present significant risks when these groups confront individuals, first of all for themselves - these are often very high-octane, emotional situations,"" she said. ""There's significant risk involved for the individuals that they are confronting, not least because it might sometimes be an innocent member of the public or it might actually disrupt a wider undercover policing investigation that we've got ongoing."" Chief Constable Simon Bailey, from the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""The increase in these groups is symptomatic of the increasing scale of child sexual abuse that police are dealing with. ""It reinforces the need for technology companies to do more to prevent offenders using their platforms to prey on children and for children to be educated about healthy relationships and staying safe online.""

The Russian Embassy said Sergei and Yulia Skripal ""remain hidden from the public"" as a result of the visa decision and the ""only relative"" who could reasonably expect to see them is ""kept out of the UK"". ""The stubborn refusal to cooperate, to provide transparency and to answer the numerous questions means Britain has something to hide,"" an embassy spokesman said. Viktoria later told the BBC she did not have enough money in her bank account to satisfy the visa requirements. It comes after Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Viktoria and Yulia on Thursday. Doubts were raised over its authenticity but Viktoriahas told Newsnight she was 100% certain it was Yulia. In a statement from the hospital, medical director Christine Blanshard urged people to respect Ms Skripal's privacy ""while she continues to get better"". ""As Yulia herself says, her strength is growing daily and she can look forward to the day when she is well enough to leave the hospital,"" Dr Blanshard said. ""Any speculation on when that date will be is just that - speculation."" Viktoria Skripal gave the BBC this picture of Sergei Skripal (centre) with his daughter Yulia and late son Alexander The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Skripal's recovery meant ""we now have two individuals at the heart of this incident in Salisbury who can now speak"". He said: ""They can speak to investigators about their last movements, were there any threats, were there any other circumstances?"" Following the update on Mr Skripal's condition, the Russian Embassy tweeted: ""Good news!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The embassy later issued a statement wishing the Skripals ""get well soon"" and expressed hope that their recovery will ""contribute to the investigation"". ""We are confident that the objective probe will ultimately establish that the claims against Russia by [the] UK government are null and void,"" it added. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also called Mr Skripal's condition ""great news"" and a testament to the emergency services and NHS staff. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""very pleased"" that the Skripals were improving. ""The NHS will continue to provide ongoing care for the Skripals, both of whom are likely to have ongoing medical needs,"" the FCO said. ""Let us be clear, this was attempted murder using an illegal chemical weapon that we know Russia possesses."" By BBC Health and Science Correspondent James Gallagher Recovery from a nerve agent attack is not guaranteed, but it is not always a surprise either. Nerve agents including sarin, VX and novichok all prevent nerves functioning normally. This includes those that are necessary to breathe and keep the heart beating. They work by disrupting an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase at the junction between nerves. But over time, the nerve agent is metabolised and excreted by the body and new acetylcholinesterase is made. The question is whether doctors can keep patients alive long enough for that to happen. This would have been the focus of Sergei and Yulia Skripal's care at Salisbury District Hospital. It could have included heart and lung support, the drug atropine to counteract the effect of nerve agents and sedation to prevent brain seizures. There is still a question about the Skripals' long term recovery and whether there will be any impact on memory and brain function. Former double agent Mr Skripal, who was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain's intelligence service but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010, was being visited by his daughter Yulia when the attack happened on 4 March. The pair became ill in the centre of Salisbury after visiting The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant. The incident sparked an escalating diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Emergency service workers in biohazard suits fix a tent over the bench where pair were found On Thursday, Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia,told the UN Security Council that Britain was ""playing with fire""and had invented a ""fake story"". Mr Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia and accused the government of waging a ""propaganda war"". Ina statement released to police on Thursday,Ms Skripal said she was grateful for the many messages of goodwill she had received and the people of Salisbury who came to her aid. She said: ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" Britain's UN ambassador, Karen Pierce, said Russia's request for consular access to Ms Skripal has been passed on.

"This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? US President Donald Trump has promised a ""forceful"" response to the alleged chemical attack in Syria, as Western leaders consider what action to take. ""We have a lot of options militarily,"" he told reporters. He added that a response would be decided ""shortly"". Mr Trump said the US was getting some ""good clarity"" on who was responsible for the incident in Douma on Saturday. Medical sources say dozens were killed in the alleged attack but exact numbers are impossible to verify. Mr Trump also discussed the incident with French President Emmanuel Macron late on Monday, and both leaders expressed a desire for a ""firm response"", the Elysee Palace said. The AFP news agency quoted French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux as saying on Tuesday that ""if a red line had been crossed, there will be a response"", adding that intelligence shared by the two leaders ""in theory confirms the use of chemical weapons"". In FebruaryMr Macron threatened to strike Syria if proof emerged of the use of chemical weapons. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said she had spoken to Mr Macron on Tuesday morning and would be speaking to Mr Trump later in the day. Mrs May did not answer directly when asked if Britain would join the US if it decided to take a military response, saying instead: ""We believe that those responsible should be held to account."" Suspected Syria chemical attack kills scores Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Why is there a war in Syria? Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack The condemnation from Western leaders followsa tense meeting at the UN Security Councilin which the US and Russia traded harsh words over the incident. US envoy Nikki Haley has called for a vote on Tuesday on a draft resolution to set up a new inquiry into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. But Russia says it cannot support the proposal because it contains ""unacceptable elements"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would submit its own draft resolution proposing that inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) visit Douma. Russia wanted independent experts to be convinced that nothing had happened and would do everything to allow such a visit to take place, he added. Russian officials said on Monday that Russian military specialists and staff from Syria's Red Crescent had found no evidence of an attack. Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics allege that bombs filled with toxic chemicals were dropped on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus, by Syrian government forces. The Syrian-American Medical Society said more than 500 people were brought to medical centres,externalwith symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent"". It said this included breathing difficulties, bluish skin, mouth foaming, corneal burns and ""the emission of chlorine-like odour"". Neither the death toll nor what exactly occurred can be verified as the area is blocked off with access denied. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The estimates of how many people died in the suspected chemical attack range from 42 to more than 60 people, but medical groups say numbers could rise as rescue workers gain access to basements where hundreds of families had sought refuge from bombing. UK PM condemns 'barbaric attack' in Syria The French representative at the UN Security Council said poison gas had deliberately been used as it could seep down to the basements. The US, France and UK have led international condemnation of the alleged attack, with the Syrian government and its Russian backers denying any responsibility. Ms Haley said Russia - a Syrian military backer - had the ""blood of Syrian children"" on its hands and branded President Assad a ""monster"". But Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, presenting Russia's case that rebels in Douma had staged the event for their own ends, painted the incident and its fallout as part of a US-led effort to hurt Russia with a ""broad arsenal of methods"", including slander, insults and ""hawkish rhetoric"". In an angry statement, he invited the OPCW to fly to Syria as soon as Tuesday, saying that Russian troops would escort them to the site of the alleged attack. Tensions between Russia and the West have plunged to their worst level in decades, following the poisoning in March of an ex-spy in England that the UK blamed on Moscow, and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election.

The Cold War explained Viewpoint: Chemical weapons âthreat to Westâ The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with what the British government says was a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia led to the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats by Western allies, to which Moscow responded in kind.

"This video can not be played Trump: FBI raid of my lawyer's office is ""a whole new level of unfairness"" US President Donald Trump says the FBI's raid on the offices of his personal lawyer was a ""disgrace"" and an ""attack on our country"". ""I have this witch hunt constantly going on,"" he told White House reporters. Officials in New York seized ""privileged communications"" between Michael Cohen and his clients, his lawyer said after the raid on Monday. Documents regarding a payment to a porn actress were also seized, US media say. Law enforcement acted on a ""referral"" from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Mr Trump criticised the investigation and described Mr Mueller's team as ""the most biased group of people"". On Tuesday morning he repeated his criticism of the raid, tweeting it marked the end of attorney-client privilege, or confidential communications between lawyers and their clients.

The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? Mr Cohen has come under increasing public scrutiny since he admitted to making a $130,000 (Â£92,000) payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, just days before the 2016 presidential election. Ms Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Mr Trump shortly after his wife Melania gave birth to their son and says she was paid to keep quiet about the affair. ""Today the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients,"" Mr Cohen's lawyer Stephen M Ryan said in a statement. ""I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller."" This video can not be played Schumer to Trump: Attorney raid not an attack on US Mr Ryan called the raid ""completely inappropriate and unnecessary"". ""It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients. These government tactics are also wrong because Mr Cohen has co-operated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath,"" the statement said. Mr Trump, who has denied having an affair with Ms Daniels, said he was unaware of Mr Cohen's payment to her and referred questions to the lawyer. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington When a president's personal lawyer is the target of a federal law-enforcement raid, it is a Big Deal. How big a deal remains to be seen, but the fact that the move came at the request of the Justice Department's Southern District of New York - after a referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office - could be an indication that Donald Trump's affairs are now relevant to a second criminal probe. Trump-watchers may recall that the president had fired the former US attorney for the Southern District, Preet Bharara, and was reportedly personally interviewing his replacement. A year later, the office is still under the direction of an interim appointment. According to the New York Times, FBI agents sought information on payments made relating to Mr Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels and other tax and business dealings. What was once largely a political embarrassment could have metastasised into legal jeopardy. Mr Cohen's ties to Mr Trump run deep. He's more than just a personal lawyer, he's a friend and fixer. He was already on Mr Mueller's radar for his work for the Trump organisation in Russia. Now the scope of his legal concerns may have dramatically expanded. Mr Cohen is under investigation for finance violations relating to the 2016 presidential campaign, The Washington Post reports. Mr Mueller reportedly gave the information involving Mr Cohen to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who then referred the matter to the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, according to Bloomberg News. Justice Department protocol requires Mr Mueller to consult Mr Rosenstein on evidence and subject matter that are beyond his jurisdiction. That she met Mr Trump in July 2006 at a charity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe He later invited her to dinner and she went to meet him in his hotel room When she arrived, he was ""sprawled out on the couch... wearing pyjama pants"" The pair then had sex in the hotel Mr Trump, she alleges, continues to try to keep the affair quiet She accepted $130,000 (Â£92,000) in ""hush money"" from Mr Cohen prior to the 2016 election The 2016 non-disclosure agreement is invalid as Mr Trump did not sign it The president ""vehemently denies"" Ms Daniels's allegations of an affair Mr Trump's lawyers are suing her for $20m (Â£14m), arguing that she has broken the non-disclosure deal on numerous occasions Mr Cohen has acknowledged paying Ms Daniels privately, but has said neither Mr Trump nor his company were a party to the transaction Mr Trump has also obtained a restraining order against Ms Daniels to try to prevent her sharing ""confidential information"" about the alleged affair Trump 'unaware of porn star payment' Russia inquiry expands to Trump lawyer Trump lawyer branded 'Mr Creepypants' Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg faces tough questions on data privacy and Facebook's future Mark Zuckerberg has been preparing for his biggest test yet as Facebook chief executive - facing not one, but two congressional hearings. Some view these sessions as little more than political theatre, a chance for politicians to be seen on TV berating the rich and powerful. There might be some truth in that. But never have we had such unfiltered access to a man who is typically wrapped in cotton wool by his PR team and deputies. Hisopening prepared statements have already been released. But the marathon sessions scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday will throw up far more. Mr Zuckerberg will inevitably be grilled on data privacy -with particular focus on the Cambridge Analytica scandal- and why it took a newspaper to discover the breach of its systems. And he'll be expecting some hard questions on election interference as well as his own and Facebook's future. So here's what to look out for as Mr Zuckerberg heads to the Hill this week. Community, community, community. It's a word you'll be hearing a lot from Mr Zuckerberg who will open his statements by stressing the good Facebook brings to the world. And he's right. Organising our real world lives, whether a birthday party or protest march, has become much easier thanks to Facebook. As has sharing pictures and video with families and friends. He'll speak about how Facebook is used by small businesses the world over to reach customers quickly, efficiently and cheaply. Between the lines he's saying don't clamp down too harshly on its business, as it could affect millions of others too. For the 33-year-old, being up-to-speed on how his company works will not be a problem. He's not a chief executive who hides in the boardroom. He can code as well as the best of his engineers. Instead, his challenge will be to appear human and to come across as genuinely remorseful - even if deep down he still believes, as the company said originally, that users willingly gave up their data. A skit from this week's Saturday Night Live portrayed it best - a jumpy ""Mark Zuckerberg"" told bad rehearsed jokes and counted the seconds he needed to maintain eye contact in order to be seen as normal. The real Mr Zuckerberg has always struggled with appearing compassionate. Indeed,even a home video of him as a teenager shows early signs of the roboticism that might stifle him in these hearings. An anecdote or two about his children might help with this. In a recent CNN interview, a flicker of genuine emotion entered the room as Mr Zuckerberg talked about the influence his two young children have had on his life. Being fatherly-Zuckerberg might help leave behind college-Zuckerberg,who famously had unfortunate views about user privacy.,external This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica claims its research gave President Trump his winning edge It's important to remember that while Facebook has admitted mistakes around its data policy and how thorough it was (or wasn't) in cleaning up the original mess, the company maintains that it was Aleksandr Kogan, the University of Cambridge researcher, who is most at fault here. It was Mr Kogan who created the personality app that hoovered up data then allegedly used by Cambridge Analytica. And it was CA that said it had deleted the data when it apparently hadn't. Mr Zuckerberg will tread a fine line between making sure the politicians know Facebook's systems were abused, while also not looking as if he is trying to abdicate responsibility. How to protect your Facebook data Facebook alerts users after data scandal At one point before these hearings, lawmakers had wanted bosses at Google and Twitter to appear alongside Mr Zuckerberg -  an acknowledgement that many of the issues faced are shared. There was plenty of Russian propaganda on Twitter, for example, and YouTube's woes are very well documented. That won't be happening now. Facebook is all alone. But that won't stop Mr Zuckerberg trying to pull in other technology companies to this debate, even if not explicitly by name. Facebook wasn't the first company to make billions from gathering personal data and it won't be the last. ""It's a simple yes or no question,"" is a phrase beloved by politicians at these kinds of hearings. It's most effective, of course, when asking a question that is anything but at simple yes or no. Expect the more camera-keen representatives to go for this gotcha moment from the word go. They will want to be the soundbite in the evening news, or the clip that's shared by millions on, ironically enough, Facebook. Giving both barrels to one of Silicon Valley's most influential figures makes great tape for any campaign ads ahead of this year's midterm vote. But this approach often leads to bad, sometimes misleading questions. Watch out for moments that may seem like major concessions by Mr Zuckerberg but are actually anything but. I'd put good money on at least one representative asking ""can you swear here today that Facebook will never sell user data?"" - to which the answer is ""of course"". Facebook hasn't ever sold user data, it merely grants access to it. Mark Zuckerberg will ditch his trademark grey t-shirt for the hearings Mr Zuckerberg will bring up the Honest Ads Act, a proposed law that would increase transparency around political advertising on the internet. It would bring the legislation more in line with what happens on television, where it's made clear who has paid for the ad. Backing this act is a shrewd PR move by Facebook. It gives Mr Zuckerberg the chance to say he is open to government regulation, while also avoiding any major impact on the way Facebook is run. The changes Mr Zuckerberg has already put in place around campaign and ""issue"" ads means they are probably already in compliance with the measures the Honest Ads Act wants to introduce - or are not far off. Don't expect much progress when it comes to any other type of regulation debate. Instead, we may get a few baby steps in the direction of what other kinds of regulation might look like, but Mr Zuckerberg will no doubt emphasise the work his company is already doing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)is investigating whether Facebook violated a consent decree signed in 2011.,external It's a document that details an agreement to look after data in certain ways, and was drawn up after the FTC gave Facebook a telling off about content that people thought and assumed was just being shared among friends, but was in fact made public. In short, Facebook agreed not to ""misrepresent in any manner, expressly or by implication"" how data collected would be used. The company also promised to be absolutely frank with users about how they can proactively and reactively control how their private data is being used. Given what we know now, lawmakers might be minded to ask Mr Zuckerberg if his company lived up to both of those important pledges.

"The fossil is of a finger bone believed to belong to Homo sapiens New research suggests that modern humans were living in Saudi Arabia about 85,000 years ago. A recently discovered finger bone believed to beHomo sapienswas dated using radio isotope techniques. This adds to mounting evidence fromIsrael,external,China,externalandAustralia,external, of a widespread dispersal beyond Africa as early as 180,000 years ago. Previously, it was theorised thatHomo sapiensdid not live continuously outside Africa until 60,000 years ago. The study is published inNature Ecology and Evolution,external. Modern humans left Africa much earlier 'First of our kind' found in Morocco Changing environment influenced human evolution Previous digs in the Arabian interior have uncovered tools which could have been used by earlyHomo sapiens. But skeletal evidence of their presence has been lacking. The Al Wusta site is in modern day Saudi Arabia Researchers working at the Al Wusta site in Saudi Arabia came across a single intermediate phalanx (the middle of the three bones that make up a finger) in a preserved lake bed. No other remains of its owner were found. ""It's normal,"" explained Dr Huw Groucutt, the study's lead author. ""Almost all humans and animals that ever lived will disappear without trace. ""We got very lucky. Generally if you found one piece of an individual you wouldn't be able to tell. But it turns out that bone is quite distinct,"" the University of Oxford researcher added. The team used CT scanning to build a 3D model of the bone, and compared it to other human and Neanderthal remains from this time period. It was found to most closely resembleHomo sapiens, as Neanderthal bones are shorter and squatter. Other material from the site was dated using two separate dating techniques. The climate in Saudi Arabia 85,000 years ago was very different to the modern day. Monsoon rains created lush lakes, inhabited by animals much like hippos. Wild cattle and antelope also appear to have migrated from Africa at this time. The fossil record at Al Wusta shows a rich variety of animal life, alongside stone tools that closely resemble those used byHomo sapiens. Dr Groucutt believes humans may have chosen to move in to this inviting environment. ""The interesting thing,"" he told BBC News, ""is that in the past some people have said we couldn't really spread into Asia until we had complex tools. [Our findings] suggest that that kind of migration didn't really reflect a technological breakthrough, but reflects climate change."" Recent work in South Africa also points tothe influence of changing climateon human evolution. The prehistoric lake bed is visible amidst the golden sands of the Nefud desert Although it is hard to determine from the Saudi Arabian site, human occupation of the area seems to have been short-lived; restricted to a few hundred or a couple of thousand years. It is not known whether the population died out or simply chose to move on. ""The great mystery now is what happened to these people,"" added Dr Groucutt. Genetic evidence suggests all living non-Africans trace their ancestry to an exodus from the continent around 60,000 years ago. Researchers are now trying to reconcile this DNA data with the mounting archaeological evidence thatHomo sapienswas present outside Africa much earlier. One possibility is that these pioneer populations went extinct, to be replaced by a later wave that led to the rest of the world being permanently settled by our species.

"A man who ate the world's hottest chilli pepper in a chilli-eating contest ended up in hospital after experiencing ""thunderclap"" headaches. The 34-year-old man had eaten one Carolina Reaper chilli in the contest in New York State. The ""crushingly painful"" headaches came on in the next few days. His experience has been published in theBMJ Case Reports,externalas it is the first case to be associated with eating chilli peppers. The doctor who reviewed his case has warned anyone eating hot chilli peppers to seek medical attention immediately if they experience sudden onset headaches. ""Thunderclap"" headaches are caused by the sudden tightening of the vessels that supply blood to the brain, a condition known as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCSV). Why hot chillies might be good for us Is the chilli pepper friend or foe? Immediately after eating at the contest, the man experienced dry heaves. Severe neck pain developed over the next few days along with debilitating severe headaches, lasting just a few seconds at a time. The pain was so bad he went to the emergency room and was tested for various neurological conditions, but the results were negative. A CT scan showed that several arteries in his brain had constricted, leading doctors to diagnose him with RCVS. The Carolina Reaper delivers an average of 1,569,300 Scoville Heat Units (SHU) As a comparison jalapeno peppers score between 2,500 to 8,000 SHU It was named the world's hottest chilli pepper by theGuinness World Records,externalin 2013 It was created by Ed Currie from the Pucker Butt Pepper Company in South Carolina over ten years He started growing chillies after learning that capsaicin found in chillies had potential as a cancer-fighting drug and he donates half of his harvest to cancer research RCVS does not always have an obvious cause, but can occur as a reaction to some prescription medication, or after taking illegal drugs. This is the first case to be associated with eating chilli peppers. Previously eating cayenne pepper has been linked to sudden constriction of the coronary artery and heart attacks. The man's symptoms cleared up by themselves. And a CT scan five weeks later showed that his arteries had returned to their normal size. Generally RCVS resolves within days to weeks and often has a favourable long-term prognosis, but in some cases severe vasoconstriction resulting in a stroke have been reported - but they are very rare. Dr Kulothungan Gunasekaran, at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, who wrote the report, said people need to be aware of these risks, if eating the chilli. ""We would not advise against eating Carolina Reaper at this time, but we would recommend the general public be cautious about these adverse effects and we advise that they should seek medical attention immediately if they develop sudden onset headache after eating hot peppers.""

"Ben Glean, who died aged 18, helped make two sight-saving transplants happen A record number of people donated organs in the UK last year, with the highest increase in 28 years. There were 1,575 donors, an 11% increase on the previous year. Ben Glean from Grimsby, who died aged 18, was one of those donors. He suffered a cardiac arrest from undiagnosed type 1 diabetes. His mum Karen said: ""I knew what Ben wanted because we'd had the conversation, which made it easier for me. ""In my darkest time there was a light to be shone for someone else."" He'd told his mum he was in support of donation but had not yet got around to joining the NHS Organ Donor Register. His kidneys were transplanted into two men in their 30s and his liver into a man in his 50s. His corneas were also used for two sight-saving transplants. ""The intensive care unit was absolutely incredible,"" said Karen. ""They were completely honest with me and answered countless questions. There aren't words enough to thank those amazing nurses for the respect shown to my son, even after we knew there was no hope of him recovering. ""The tears of the nurses and doctors showed me how much they cared, and our goodbye to Ben was special because of them."" Karen and Ben Glean: ""I must have told him hundreds of times I loved him"" Describing his last moments Karen said: ""I'd crawl through the machinery and wires to play with his curly hair, to stroke his beautiful eyebrows and to whisper in his ear. ""I must have told him hundreds of times I loved him and I begged him to come back even though I knew he could not. ""Ben was kept comfortable and warm, his face cleaned, his hair brushed and he looked so peaceful and cared for. This is my last memory of my baby boy."" The record figures are being attributed to a proactive approach and the introduction of specialist nurses across the NHS, who are there to support donor families and ensure the donation is properly co-ordinated. This has helped ensure fewer missed opportunities because families block donations, or the necessary equipment is not available. Sally Johnson, NHS Blood and Transplant director of organ donation and transplantation, said the improvement had been magnificent. She said the figures ""would make any country in the world proud,"" but added that a ""deadly shortage of organ donors remains"". ""Around three people who could benefit from a donated organ still die each day."" Fewer than 5,000 people a year die in circumstances where organ donation is possible. Will change to organ donor rules mean more transplants? Hundreds of families block organ donation Organ donation: Three stories of hope The figures come at a time when the NHS is debating whether England should follow Wales and introduce an opt-out donation scheme. The NHS has yet to publish the results of a public consultation which ran for 12 weeks until 6 March, and the feedback is being analysed. Wales introduced an opt-out systemin December 2015. However,a study published two years into the scheme,showed that it had not increased the number of donors in the country. Scotland isbringing forward legislationto provide an opt-out system and the issue is also being debated in Northern Ireland. However,recently a leading transplant surgeonsaid the province was ""not ready"" for such a system to be introduced. Organ donations rising across the UK MPs back bid to change organ donation laws MPs back organ donation opt-out scheme 'Follow Wales' lead on organ donation' England to consider optout organ donation No rise in organ donors since law change Hundreds of families block organ donation The life-saving gift of organ donation Organ donor law 'revolution' begins Q&A: Organ Donation England to consider optout organ donation - BBC News Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played Prof Julian Dowdeswell: ""Sea-ice conditions mean we cannot guarantee to get where we want to"" A scientific expedition will next year try to find the Endurance, the ill-fated ship of Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. The vessel sank in 1915, crushed by sea-ice in the Weddell Sea and lost in 3,000m of water. Shackleton and his crew were forced into lifeboats to make an extraordinary and heroic escape across the Southern Ocean. UK researcher Prof Julian Dowdeswell will lead the international effort. He expects to have the cruise on station in January/February. Locating the shipwreck is not the primary goal of the expedition; the major objective is to visit and study the Larsen C Ice Shelf, which last July calvedone of the biggest icebergs ever recordedin Antarctica. But because Larsen is so close to the last known position of the Endurance, it makes sense to also have a go at finding the famous ship. ""It would be a shame not to,"" said Prof Dowdeswell, the director of theScott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge,external. ""In our study of Larsen, we will be operating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). But if we can get them in range of where Endurance is thought to be, we will send them under the ice to do a survey. ""They are fitted with downward-looking multi-beam echosounders, which can map out on a grid the shape of the seafloor. You look at that for any signs of the ship and then focus in with cameras if you find something interesting."" Big increase in Antarctic snowfall New map traces Shackleton's footsteps Wreck could be sunken Athenia from WW2 Endurance just before it sank: Crushed at the stern, it went down bow first It is a very tough challenge. The sea-ice in the Weddell Sea is notoriously thick and uncooperative, as Shackleton found to his cost. Even today's technology struggles in the region. An expedition led by the British Antarctic Survey tried to get close to Larsen C earlier this year and wasthwarted by the marine floes. Prof Dowdeswell is hoping for better luck and believes the range and capabilities of the AUVs, provided by the American companyOcean Infinity,external, give the expedition the best possible chance of success. The venture is formally called the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019. It is funded byThe Flotilla Foundation,external, a charitable trust in the Netherlands. Prof Dowdeswell's team brings together a wealth of expertise from the SPRI, the Nekton Foundation, the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, as well as the University of Cape Town and the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Ocean Infinity's technology is currently looking for missing airliner MH370 The 45-day expedition will operate from theSA Agulhas II, a modern polar research vessel,external. Larsen C is one of the largest ice shelves in Antarctica. It is the floating extension of glaciers that have flowed off the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula and joined together to form one giant buoyant platform. Its northern neighbours, Larsen A and Larsen B, suffered catastrophic break-ups in 1995 and 2002, respectively. These failures unbound the feeding glaciers behind, allowing them to move faster and dump yet more of their ice in the ocean, raising global sea-levels. The production of a near-6,000kmÂ² berg last year now has experts wondering whether Larsen C is also being set up for a collapse. This video can not be played Dr Christine Batchelor is interested in the past positions of glacier grounding lines The Weddell Sea Expedition will try to answer this question by getting in close and making a series of geophysical measurements. The AUVs will be sent into the cavity under the shelf to map the seafloor and the overhanging ice canopy. Drill cores will also be taken from just in front of the shelf. The aim is to establish the past history of ice advance and retreat, to look for old grounding lines - the locations where Larsen's feeding glaciers have previously rested on the seafloor. Have these lines moved back and forward on a fairly regular basis, or have they only ever retreated and at what rate? ""We want to try to put the recent changes that we've seen at the peninsula into their longer-term context,"" said Dr Christine Batchelor, a SPRI fellow who will be an expedition team-member. ""We only have satellite observations for the last few decades. We want to see how those changes fit in when we look over much longer timescales - over hundreds and thousands of years. ""Is what we've been seeing typical behaviour, or something more unusual,"" she told BBC News. Dr Batchelor was speaking here at theEuropean Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly,externalin Vienna, Austria. However, the Weddell Sea expedition will be formally announced in London at theRoyal Geographical Society,external. Endurance is acknowledged to be one of the great undiscovered shipwrecks For the SPRI to be connected with the discovery of the Endurance would be fitting. The institute is, in many ways, the keeper of records for Britain's ""heroic era"" of polar exploration. In its archives are documents related to Endurance skipper, Frank Worsley. It is he, with sextant and chronometer, who calculated the vessel's sinking position on 21 November 1915 as 68Â°39'30.0"" South and 52Â°26'30.0"" West. This is roughly 100-150 nautical miles east of Larsen C. If sea-ice conditions are favourable, the SA Agulhas II is likely to have company on its voyage. The German research ship Polarstern also plans to visit the region of the newly calved iceberg. Its cruise will be led by the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven.

"Michael Gove is considering a ban on the live export of animals after Brexit to help the UK become a world leader in animal welfare. The environment secretary has asked industry experts and campaigners to submit evidence on the process, with ""all options"" being considered. Labour called the announcement ""weak"" and it wants stronger action. The National Farmers' Union estimates up to 20,000 live sheep - but no cattle - were exported to Europe in 2017. The rules of the European Union's single market currently prevent the UK from banning exports of livestock, according to BBC rural affairs correspondent David Gregory-Kumar.

Ban on live animal exports considered Reality Check: Brexit and animal welfare UK law 'to recognise animal feelings' Launching the consultation, Mr Gove said the UK already had some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world, but the government wanted to keep to their manifesto promise and improve on them.

"The US and Russia have traded barbs at a UN Security Council meeting on the alleged chemical attack in Syria. Russian representative Vassily Nebenzia said the incident in Douma was staged and that US military action in response could have ""grave repercussions"". US envoy Nikki Haley said Russia - a Syrian military backer - had the ""blood of Syrian children"" on its hands. Earlier, the UN human rights chief said world powers were treating chemical weapons use with a ""collective shrug"". US President Donald Trump pledged later on Monday that the incident would ""be met forcefully"", adding that the US had a lot of military options and a decision on a response would be taken ""tonight"" or ""shortly"". Calling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a ""monster"", Ms Haley said that if the UN Security Council acts or not, ""either way, the United States will respond"". ""Meetings are ongoing, important decisions are being weighed even as we speak,"" she said. Suspected Syria chemical attack kills scores Why is there a war in Syria? Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack Washington has not ruled out military strikes. In April last year, the US fired cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase after a Sarin nerve agent attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun killed more than 80 people. International investigators held the Syrian government responsible. This video can not be played Trump: Suspected Syria chemical attack 'will be met forcefully' The Syrian-American Medical Society said more than 500 people were brought to medical centres,externalin Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus, with symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent"". It said this included breathing difficulties, bluish skin, mouth foaming, corneal burns and ""the emission of chlorine-like odour"". Neither the death toll nor what exactly occurred can be verified as the area is blocked off with access denied. The estimates of how many people died in the suspected chemical attack range from 42 to more than 60 people, but medical groups say numbers could rise as rescue workers gain access to basements where hundreds of families had sought refuge from bombing. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The French representative at the UN Security Council said poison gas had deliberately been used as it could seep down to the basements. The US, France and UK have led international condemnation of the alleged attack, with the Syrian government and its Russian backers denying any responsibility. Mr Nebenzia, presenting Russia's case that rebels in Douma staged the event for their own ends, painted the incident and its fallout as part of a US-led effort to hurt Russia with a ""broad arsenal of methods"", including slander, insults and ""hawkish rhetoric"". In an angry statement, he invited investigators from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to fly to Syria as soon as Tuesday, saying that Russian troops would escort them to the site of the alleged attack. UK PM condemns 'barbaric attack' in Syria Moscow has said its experts have not found ""any trace of chlorine or any other chemical substance used against civilians"". This video can not be played 'We will make a major decision in next 24-48 hours' Mr Nebenzia said the tone taken against Russia had gone beyond what was acceptable even during the Cold War and warned against a US military response. ""Armed force under mendacious pretext against Syria, where, at the request of the legitimate government of a country, Russian troops have been deployed, could lead to grave repercussions,"" he said. The escalation of tension comes as relations between Russia and the West have plunged to their worst level in decades, following the poisoning in March of an ex-spy in England that the UK blamed on Moscow, and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Russia v the West: Is this a new Cold War? The Cold War explained The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with what the British government says was a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia led to the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats by Western allies, to which Moscow responded in kind. Following the alleged attack, Syria and Russia reached an evacuation deal with the Jaish al-Islam rebels, who up until now have been holding Douma. Moscow said military operations there had been halted. Under the deal, 100 buses are said to be moving 8,000 fighters and 40,000 of their relatives out of the battered town. Hostages who had been held by the rebels are being set free. The development means pro-government forces have now taken full control of the Eastern Ghouta. Analysts say this is President Assad's biggest military success since the fall of Aleppo in 2016. It follows a weeks-long government offensive in which more than 1,600 people were killed. Separately on Monday, monitors said at least 13 civilians were killed and scores injured in the north-western city of Idlib, after an explosion that destroyed a large, multi-storey building. The cause of the blast was not clear. Idlib province is mainly controlled by the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance led by a former branch of al-Qaeda. The area has seen a big influx of civilians and fighters from other war-torn regions.

"Campaigners said schools should not be asking about pupils' nationality Privacy campaigners say the Department for Education is to drop the controversial requirement for schools in England to collect data about pupils' nationality. The Against Borders for Children protest group had warned the information could be used to check on the immigration status of pupils. Campaigners hailed it as a ""victory"" after a boycott and legal challenges. The Department for Education would not confirm reports of the policy change. A report inSchools Week,externalsays schools will be told in the next few weeks they no longer have to collect the data. But the Department for Education has declined to deny or confirm that it is about to shift its position. Privacy campaigners, civil liberties groups and teachers' unions had criticised the introduction in 2016 of a requirement for schools to gather data about pupils' nationality and country of birth. There had been a crowdfunded legal challenge and campaigners claimed that up to 200,000 people had refused to give information as part of a boycott, supported by the human rights pressure group, Liberty. Opponents had warned that theinformation gathered by schools would be shared by other government departmentsand used in immigration cases. The Department for Education had rejected this - arguing that theinformation would only be used for educational purposes, such as tracking the progress of pupils from different backgrounds. But campaigners claim they have succeeded in reversing the requirement for schools to gather such data. Alan Munroe, a primary school teacher and spokesman for Against Borders for Children, said it was a ""massive victory"" and showed that ""schools should be a safe learning environment for every child"". Gracie Bradley, policy officer at Liberty, said it was a victory for ""teachers, parents and campaigners who stood up and refused to comply with this poisonous attempt to build foreign children lists"".

"This video can not be played Theresa May said the ""reprehensible"" attack was being urgently investigated Theresa May has said she ""utterly condemns"" the ""barbaric"" alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria. The PM said if the attack was confirmed as another example of President Bashar al-Assad's regime's brutality, ""the regime and its backers including Russia, must be held to account"". Russia has said no evidence of a chemical weapons attack in formerly rebel-held Douma has been found. The US and France threatened a ""joint, strong response"" to the alleged attack. When asked whether she would recall Parliament over Syria, Mrs May said: ""We are working urgently with our allies to assess what has happened and we are also working with our allies on what action might be necessary."" Russia: No evidence of chemical attack Why is there a war in Syria? Trump condemns Syria for 'chemical attack' on Douma Medical sources say dozens were killed in Saturday's attack, but numbers are impossible to verify. Videos shot by rescue workers showed lifeless bodies of men, women and children with foam at their mouths. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had said no evidence of a chemical weapons attack had been found, saying Russian specialists and aid workers had visited the area. Russia - a key supporter of the Syrian government - has intervened militarily in the country. It launched an air campaign in support of Mr Assad in 2015 that was crucial in turning the war in the government's favour. The United Nations Security Council met on Monday to discuss the allegations, which sawthe US and Russia trade barbs. Russian representative Vassily Nebenzia said the incident in Douma was staged and that US military action in response could have ""grave repercussions"". But US envoy Nikki Haley said Russia - a Syrian military backer - had the ""blood of Syrian children"" on its hands. On a visit to Denmark and then Sweden, Mrs May said the events in Douma fit into ""a troubling wider pattern of acts of aggression and abuse of long-standing international norms on counter proliferation and the use of chemical weapons"". She said Russia's ""repeated vetoes"" at the UN ""have enabled these rules to be broken and removed mechanisms that allow us to investigate and hold to account chemical weapons attacks in Syria"". ""This must stop,"" she said. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke to acting US Secretary of State John Sullivan on Monday about the incident, agreeing that it ""bore hallmarks of previous chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime"", a statement from the Foreign Office said. US President Donald Trump has said that the situation was being assessed and ""major decisions"" would be made within 48 hours. Former Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for Mrs May to stand alongside the US,writing in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat chemical weapons will become ""legitimised"" and used in future wars if the West fails to take military action. By John Pienaar, BBC News deputy political editor Theresa May's flying Scandinavian tour - Denmark and Sweden in less than 24 hours - was supposed to be routine. As if...! The prime minister's meetings with her counterparts in Copenhagen and Stockholm were wholly overshadowed by the alleged chemical attack in Syria: a challenge and a test not only for the Western powers and their allies, but for British global influence and for Mrs May herself. As she met the Danish leader, Lars Rasmussen, in Copenhagen, it was clear she was keen to keep in step with key allies like America. Read more from John Tom Tugendhat, Tory chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, told the BBC that the ""UK should explore all options"" and that is ""absolutely right that we respond"" to the attack in Syria. He said the evidence ""points squarely to the Assad regime"" and that the ""UK government has the legal authority"" to respond. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also condemned the use of chemical or biological weapons ""in any scenario, anywhere in the world"". ""The tragedy and the terror of people's lives in Syria can only end by a political solution,"" he said. ""That means every country in the region - every country in the region - as well as Russia and the United States coming together to ensure there is a meaningful ceasefire and there is a political process to bring about a political solution to the terror and tragedy and conflict that has wasted so many lives in Syria."" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said: ""What has happened in Douma clearly looks to be just the latest abhorrent attack in Syria using chemical weapons, a war crime for which the Assad regime has been found responsible in the past and which we utterly condemn."" Comparing the attack in Douma to the ""similar recklessness"" seen last month with the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, the prime minister added that together with the international community, the UK would not tolerate Russia's ""increasingly hostile behaviour"".

"This video can not be played The BBC accompanied a ""paedophile hunter"" group based in West Yorkshire on two 'stings' Evidence from so-called paedophile hunter groups was used to charge suspects at least 150 times last year, a BBC investigation has found. A Freedom of Information request, sent to every police force in England and Wales, showed a seven-fold increase in the use of such evidence from 2015. Twenty-nine of the forty-three forces approached (67%) provided data. Despite this, the National Police Chiefs Council say the groups' tactics present ""significant risks"". The online groups use what they call ""decoys"" to pose as underage children and wait to be contacted by adults. They then converse privately with adults and identify those attempting to groom young people. Individuals are then tracked down, the confrontation is often streamed live on social media and police are called. ""They [the targets] are always made aware of the child's age at the start of the chat, so there's no misconception about how old the child is,"" Sarah said. ""We class ourselves as child protectors - if a potential predator is talking to my decoy, they aren't talking to a real child, that's the way I look at it."" Sarah told the BBC she spent hours replying to messages which often contain explicit language, photos and videos. ""I set a new decoy up one night, by the next morning I had had 180 friend requests, mostly from men,"" she said. ""We're only touching the tip of the iceberg, it's right across social media. Even if we just take 20 out, those 20 aren't going to be child rapists."" It is thought about 75 active ""paedophile hunter"" groups are operating across the UK. Police warn the groups' actions may interfere with surveillance operations and ""evidence"" they gather may be illegally obtained and therefore excluded from a prosecution. One group, Predator Exposure, was founded in Leeds in 2016 and claims to have supplied evidence leading to the conviction of more than 20 sex crime offenders in the past 12 months. A recruitment event was held in a pub in Bradford to find volunteer ""decoys"" Speaking at a volunteer recruitment day at a pub in Bradford, ex-convict Phil Hoban, who started the group, said: ""The police can say 'we don't like you doing this, we don't like you doing that', but we're going to continue."" Mr Hoban served 15 months in prison in 2005 for his part in a robbery where a cash machine was stolen in East Yorkshire. This video can not be played Phil Hoban is a paedophile hunter, he claims his group safeguards children. He said his group, which has seven members, staged the enrolment drive for new ""decoys"" in order to deal with the growing demand. Potential volunteers were told the role would take up a great deal of spare time and an interest in child protection was required. Each police force in England and Wales was asked by the BBC to say how many people had been charged after evidence was given by paedophile hunters, with 29 out of 43 able to give three years' worth of figures. The supplied data showed a greater than seven-fold rise in two years - from 20 in 2015 to 150 in 2017. Of the police forces that responded, almost half (47%) of the cases of the crime of meeting a child following sexual grooming used evidence from so-called paedophile hunting groups in 2017. The data only confirms that the evidence was used in some part. It does not suggest that the vigilantes' actions were solely responsible for charges being brought. Assistant Chief Constable Catherine Hankinson, of West Yorkshire Police, urged those who are involved in paedophile hunter groups to bring them evidence but to then ""let us deal with it"". ""It does present significant risks when these groups confront individuals, first of all for themselves - these are often very high-octane, emotional situations,"" she said. ""There's significant risk involved for the individuals that they are confronting, not least because it might sometimes be an innocent member of the public or it might actually disrupt a wider undercover policing investigation that we've got ongoing."" Chief Constable Simon Bailey, from the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""The increase in these groups is symptomatic of the increasing scale of child sexual abuse that police are dealing with. ""It reinforces the need for technology companies to do more to prevent offenders using their platforms to prey on children and for children to be educated about healthy relationships and staying safe online.""
