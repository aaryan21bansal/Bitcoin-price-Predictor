"A soldier cleared of rape has been ordered to pay his alleged victim more than Â£100,000 in a civil case. Sean Diamond, 24, had stood trial for allegedly raping a woman while she slept in a Dundee flat in July 2015. A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found the case not proven in October. A civil action for damages was granted by a Dundee sheriff after the claim was not defended by Mr Diamond, who has since said this was due to an oversight and that he plans to defend the action. Lawyers acting for Mr Diamond said that he had failed to lodge defences in time. He continues to deny the rape allegations and has now instructed Balfour and Manson to make an application to the court to recall the decree. Mr Diamond was based in Leuchars at the time of the alleged crime. He is now serving with the Queen's Dragoon Guards based at Robertson Barracks in Dereham, Norfolk. The woman was granted Â£100,000 with interest. She told BBC Scotland: ""For me, it was absolutely heartbreaking, gut wrenching, the worst thing I could ever have imagined. ""I felt like the worst thing had already happened and then to hear the not proven verdict just multiplied what had already happened to an even more extreme level. ""I'm somebody that's normally very upbeat - a bubbly, happy person and I became almost a prisoner in my own head. ""Over time I've been able to repair myself and move forward. However, it has been a very turbulent journey."" She added: ""For me it's not about the money, nothing's ever going to make that situation go away.""

"Didsbury Mosque said the BBC investigation was ""misleading"" A mosque where the Manchester Arena bomber worshipped denies encouraging people to ""fight in any military struggle"" following a BBC report. A sermon by Imam Mustafa Graf at Didsbury Mosque in 2016called for the support of fighters in Syria, according to two Muslim scholars. It was delivered six months before Salman Abedi killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert. Mr Graf declined to be interviewed but denied preaching Islamic extremism. Didsbury Mosque said it had ""launched an investigation into the sermon to identify any issues raised by the BBC report"" as part of its regulations. Imam Mustafa Graf has denied ever preaching Islamic extremism The sermon was held in December 2016 when the Syrian city of Aleppo had beencaught in a brutal four-year deadlock. Prayers were said for the mujahideen - a term often used to describe Islamist fighters. Mr Graf is heard saying: ""We ask Allah to grant them mujahideen - our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq - to grant them victory."" Elsewhere, he says: ""Lots of brothers stayed behind unfortunately. They love Islam and Muslims but they do nothing for the support of their brothers and sisters."" He also remarks: ""Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation."" At one point Mr Graf is heard saying: ""The whole world, including Europe, America - what is the so-called civilised world - is watching what is happening in Aleppo and Syria. ""They know that Iran, Russia and the militias are killing humans in Syria and they do nothing. ""Well in fact they helped the Russians and the Iranians and others, the militias, to kill Muslims over there."" The word ""jihad"" is widely used, though often inaccurately In Arabic, the word means ""effort"" or ""struggle"" In Islam, it could be an individual's internal struggle against baser instincts, the struggle to build a good Muslim society, or a war for the faith against unbelievers or oppressors A mujahideen is a term usually used for someone who engages in the latter form of jihad Muslim jurists agree there are conditions for armed jihad, says Dr Emman El-Badawy, a counter-extremism expert, including that it can only be declared by a Muslim leader, not an individual, and only enemy combatants are legitimate targets, not innocent civilians Abedi and his family regularly attended Didsbury Mosque and his father sometimes led the call to prayer. The recording the BBC obtained is of Friday prayers six months before the attack, although the family's whereabouts on the day of the sermon are unknown. The BBC has been told Abedi bought a ticket for the concert he bombed 10 days after the sermon took place. In a Facebook post,,externalDidsbury Mosque said it believed the BBC investigation was ""a misleading report, out of context, which appears to create an association between the criminal act of Salman Abedi and a dated sermon at the mosque."" ""The Friday sermon in question took place shortly after chemical weapons were used by the Syrian regime against innocent men, women and children of Aleppo."" It said the sermon was encouraging people ""to pray to God to help those victims of oppression"". Shaykh Rehan Ahmed Raza, who is a Muslim scholar, said there were ""no ifs and no buts"" that Mr Graf was referring to ""being on the battlefield"". Usama Hasan, head of Islamic studies at the Quilliam think tank that focuses on counter-extremism, said the sermon was ""clearly referring to military jihad, to armed jihad"". Suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people Didsbury Mosque said: ""The term jihad was used in its wider meaning; 'to strive and struggle' and in this case aid to those being oppressed. There was no call for any military Jihad (qital). ""Nor was there any comment which could in anyway be construed to suggest that Britain or British people should be targeted or attacked. The focus was on the behaviour of the Syrian regime and its victims. ""Didsbury Mosque does not encourage anyone to go and fight in any military struggle."" Mr Graf denied he had called for armed jihad. A spokesman from the BBC press office said: ""We stand by our journalism."" Greater Manchester Police said: ""We have been handed the material from the BBC following their broadcast and will now review it to establish if any criminal offences have been committed."" The region's deputy mayor Bev Hughes said: ""The mayor and I are clear: we will always act on any evidence of the incitement of hate and violence whenever it happens and from wherever it comes. She said she would ""expect all communities in Greater Manchester to do the same"".

"If found guilty, Paul Manafort could be jailed for life The judge in the trial of ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort says he will not release the names of jurors because of fears for their safety. Judge TS Ellis also said he had received threats himself over the case. Mr Manafort denies charges of bank and tax fraud, in the first trial stemming from the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling into the 2016 US elections. The court in Alexandria, Virginia, has heard closing arguments and the jury has retired to consider a verdict. Prosecutors say the 69-year-old dodged taxes on millions of dollars he made lobbying for Ukrainian politicians. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said Mr Manafort was a ""very good person"", describing the trial as ""very sad"". Manafort lawyer attacks deputy's 'lies' Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Speaking in court while jurors deliberated for a second day, Judge Ellis said: ""I had no idea this case would excite these emotions... I don't feel right if I release their names, ""I've received criticism and threats. I imagine they would, too."" This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? The judge added that he was being protected by US marshals. A number of media outlets had earlier requested the names of jurors. Jury lists are considered to be public unless a judge bans any access to them. The judge later allowed the jurors - six men and six women - to finish their work for the day because one of them had a social engagement. If found guilty on the fraud charges, Mr Manafort could spend the rest of his life in jail. Who's who in Russia drama? How Trump-Russia scandal has unfolded What is the special counsel? Mr Manafort managed Mr Trump's campaign for several months in 2016 - and he was in charge when Mr Trump won the Republican party's nomination. Last October, he was charged by special counsel Robert Mueller as a part of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The allegations against him, however, are not linked to Mr Trump and instead centre on his consultancy work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government found ledgers pledging more than $12m (Â£9.2m) in cash to Mr Manafort for his advisory work with former President Viktor Yanukovych while he was in office, the New York Times reported. It has also been alleged that he secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to assist President Putin's political goals in other parts of the former USSR. Mr Manafort denied the allegation.

"Big brands such as Mulberry, Giorgio Armani, Gucci and Prada face losses from the collapse of House of Fraser. Administrators EY released documents showing suppliers owed Â£484m of total debt estimated late on Friday at Â£884m. Among those listed is the warehouse operator at the centre of a dispute with the new owner which has led to the cancellation of all on-line orders. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct boughtthe chain just hours after it went into administration a week ago. Sports Direct is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its Â£90m buyout as their debts were part of the administration. Warehouse operator XPO Logistics is owed Â£30m and stopped processing orders last week because of a payment dispute. After an outcry from customers who had not received goods orders on line, House of Fraser said it would refund customers and also cancel all online orders. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. On Wednesday, House of Fraser took its website offline as deliveries began to back up. XPO operates two warehouses, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, that handle House of Fraser's deliveries to stores as well as customers. The distributor said it had no comment to make when contacted by the BBC. It is among a number of suppliers to have taken action as negotiations over payment continue with the department store chain. The administrators said the total owed was ""subject to change"". Fashion brand Jigsaw has removed stock from its 20 House of Fraser concessions, and Karen Millen - which is owed more than Â£950,000 - is understood to have followed suit. Others are owed even more: Mulberry is out of pocket by Â£2.4m, while All Saints is owed close to Â£1.8m and Giorgio Armani almost Â£1.6m. Sports Direct has said it wants to ""restore the right level of ongoing relationships"" with its brands. Mr Ashley has also vowed to keep most of House of Fraser's 59 stores open. But some customers are angry about the treatment of their orders. One said on Twitter: ""Absolutely disgraceful. Ordered a Â£90 purse last Thursday. Yes a week ago for my daughters birthday. Not 1 email concerning delivery or info and now order cancelled and you say email in a few days!!! Get my money back ASAP."" Another said two-thirds of their husband's suit would not now be delivered. They tweeted: ""This was for our holidays! I don't have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!"" House of Fraser's website has been taken offline Richard Lim of Retail Economics said there were ""kinks to be ironed out"" when big companies change hands, but warned that ""trust and loyalty are hard-won in retail"". He added: ""You would have thought that delivering a great service to customers would have been a priority for the company. ""Delivering goods into the hands of customers now has to be the top priority."" Rob Brice's wife and grandmother on their wedding day Kent-based Rob Brice and his wife were given Â£500 of House of Fraser gift vouchers by his grandmother for their wedding. Last week he placed an online order worth about Â£380. After hearing nothing for five days, he sent an email and was told they were no longer accepting gift cards, meaning ""my leftover value on the card was lost"". Another email said his order was cancelled and the sum would be refunded to the gift card - one he says is now no longer useable. Mr Brice has called House of Fraser but only gets an automated message. Neither has he had a response to emails and tweets. ""I'm going to look to call Trading Standards today to understand my customer rights in the matter, as it is a lot of money to us and would have been to my nan,"" he says. Meanwhile, EY has said there were six bidders for House of Fraser, with four - offering between Â£40m and Â£49m - being dismissed for various reasons. This left two potential names in the frame, with one of the remaining pair offering Â£1 to acquire the group on a solvent basis. This party then later proposed to acquire the business and assets following any insolvency for Â£100m - Â£10m more than what Sports Direct ultimately paid - before withdrawing. Also, EY said there will be Â£600,000, at best, left to pay unsecured creditors but the prospect of any payout is minimal. Q: What will happen to my House of Fraser online order? If items are in stock, shoppers may still receive them. However, customers are being emailed over the next two days to formally cancel pending orders and be refunded in full. Q: Can I return an unwanted item bought online for a refund? Yes. Anyone wanting to return existing purchases will have their statutory rights honoured. Q: What happens to gift vouchers? Customers with a store card should write to Gift Cards, 27 Baker Street, London, W1U 8AH and it will be replaced by one of equivalent value for use in future House of Fraser (but not Sports Direct) stores.

"This video can not be played The confrontation and escape were filmed onlookers A police officer has condemned people who cheered a man escaping police after a confrontation which left two officers requiring hospital treatment. The incident on Romford Road, Newham, east London, was filmed and shared on social media with laughter and shouts of encouragement clearly audible. But Supt Roy Smith described it as a ""sad state of affairs"". Two men have been arrested on suspicion of assault on police and possession of a firearm. The fight broke out after two officers stopped a ""suspicious"" car and carried out a search on Thursday afternoon. The men got out of the car and ""a struggle ensued"", the Met said. A female officer suffered a broken bone in her right hand and a male officer sustained ligament damage that needed surgery. Supt Smithtweeted,externalit was ""disappointing to see members of the public filming this and laughing at the officers"". Det Supt Sean Yates said: ""Acting on instinct when approaching a suspicious car, [the officers] were confronted with two aggressive men who have intimated that they were armed. ""The officers put themselves in harm's way to protect the public and I would urge anyone with any information to come forward."" One man, aged 25, was arrested at the scene on Romford Road, and a 23-year-old was arrested on Grantham Road following a search of nearby gardens.

"Tesla shares have plunged after founder Elon Musk revealed to the New York Times he works ""120 hour weeks"" and takes sedatives. In the interview, Mr Musk also said he was not ""on weed"" when he controversially tweeted about taking the company private. After the comments from Mr Musk, shares were down 8.8%. The share drop was encouraged by a UBS note predicting Tesla's Model 3 will lose $6,000 per vehicle, as costs soar. The ramping up of production of the electric car company's mass-market Model 3 was one of the reasons why Mr Musk admitted to being overworked and using the sedative Ambien to help sleep, he said in the interview. TheNew York Times,externalinterview also discussed his7 August tweetwhen the CEO said he wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Mr Musk said the price of $420 seemed like ""better karma"" than $419. ""But I was not on weed, to be clear,"" he said, as he also confirmed the tweet was not reviewed by anyone at the electric car company. 4/20 is an infamous term, more common in the US, that refers to the consumption of cannabis. The price of $419 would have represented a 20% premium over Tesla's share price at the time. Musk in the hot seat again Tesla founder playing a dangerous game ""It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419. But I was not on weed, to be clear. ""Weed is not helpful for productivity. There's a reason for the word 'stoned'. You just sit there like a stone on weed,"" Mr Musk, 47, said. He also told the paper that friends had expressed concern that he was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks. ""This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,"" he said. ""It was excruciating."" The paper reported that at times during the interview he stopped speaking, seemingly overcome by emotion - and that he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday on 28 June working. ""All night - no friends, nothing,"" Mr Musk said. Mr Musk also said that he took the sedative Ambien to help him sleep when he was not working: ""It is often a choice of no sleep, or Ambien."" According to the paper, his use of the drug has concerned some board members, who wonder if it affects his late-night tweets. In MayRoseanne Barr blamed Ambien for her tweetthat likened Valerie Jarrett, an African-American former aide to Barack Obama, to an ape. Elon Musk unveils the Tesla Roadster 2 in November His tweet about taking Tesla private sparked a sharp rally in Tesla's share price, but has also prompted scrutiny. London hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who is shorting Tesla stock, has joined a number of analysts disproving of Mr Musk's running of the company. According to Bloomberg, Mr Odey told investors: ""Tesla feels like it is entering the final stage of its life."" Fox Newshas reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)had sent subpoenas to the electric carmaker and was ""ramping up"" its investigation into the tweet. Tesla's directors said: ""There have been many false and irresponsible rumours in the press about the discussions of the Tesla board. ""We would like to make clear that Elon's commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious. ""Over the past 15 years, Elon's leadership of the Tesla team has caused Tesla to grow from a small start-up to having hundreds of thousands of cars on the road that customers love, employing tens of thousands of people around the world, and creating significant shareholder value in the process."" The statement was issued by the board members, excluding Mr Musk, who controls about a fifth of Tesla shares. The board hasset up a committee to evaluate any take-private proposal from Mr Musk, who has said thathe discussed funding a deal with the Saudi Arabiansovereign wealth fund. The New York Times reported that Mr Musk did not intend to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive, but that a search was underway to recruit a deputy. However, he said there was ""no active search"" underway. He added: ""If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job.

This video can not be played The funeral of Barry Chuckle in Rotherham Vicki Michelle, of 'Allo 'Allo! fame, said her favourite memory of Barry was a night out in Birmingham where they were appearing in panto together, and seeing Barry ""dancing in a Chuckle sandwich with a girl either side of him"". She said wherever he went people would call out, ""To me, to you"". ""It's going to be sad today. My heart goes out to his family, his brother Paul in particular and his children."" Vicki Michelle recalled working with Barry in pantomime About 400 fans gathered outside the ground to pay their respects. Lisa Scranage, 45, and her fiance Mark Kitchen, 37, got to the stadium with her 14-year-old son Ryan at 10:00 BST, having travelled from Featherstone. Ms Scranage said she first watched ChuckleVision as a child after school and her love of Barry and Paul grew from there. She went regularly to shows and often stayed behind to chat to the brothers, becoming friends with them. ""They have given us so much over the years as the Chuckle Brothers, so this is the last chance to give a little bit back to Barry, to say goodbye and pay our respects,"" she said. The couple had asked Barry Chuckle to come to their wedding. At the scene Oliver WrightBBC News Online The road up to the stadium was lined with hundreds of well wishers, keen to say goodbye to Barry. Some had arrived as early as 10:00 to find a spot, travelling from across Yorkshire and further afield. All the people I spoke to were delighted to share their happy memories of growing up watching him and his brother on TV or in pantomime. The famous faces he worked with through his career all painted a picture of a man who was a joy to work with and will be dearly missed. As the hearse approached a ripple of applause broke out among the crowd and a few shouts of ""To me, to you"" could be heard. There were at least a few people who shed a tear as his coffin was carried in to the stadium for the private service. The Chuckle Brothers' catchphrase was shouted by fans as the cortege arrived Fans gathered outside Rotherham United's stadium where the service took place Will Cowan, 18, from Doncaster, came wearing a Chuckle Brothers T-shirt. ""I can't remember when I started watching them to be honest - [probably] since I was born,"" he said. ""It's been a really nice send-off for Barry. He's such a legend. ""Even now you can still enjoy their sketches. It works if you're five or 95."" Alfie travelled form Birmingham to attend the service One young Chuckle Brothers fan travelled with his father 100 miles from Birmingham to pay his respects. Alfie, 10, said: ""I first went to see them at the pantomime in Wolverhampton around two years ago and I just became a megafan of them. ""I just love their episodes and every morning I'm watching their episodes of ChuckleVision."" Earlier this year, the brothers returnedto television with a new show, Chuckle Time, on Channel 5. Barry had been unwell towards the end of the new show's filming. The brothers' show ran for 22 years on the BBC Summer work was cancelled while he rested at his doctor's request, but not long after his health deteriorated.

"This video can not be played Ashwaq, a Yazidi teenager sold by Islamic State, came face to face with her former captor A Yazidi teenager sold into slavery by Islamic State has told the BBC of her horror after she escaped to Germany, only to come face-to-face with her captor in the street. Ashwaq was only 14 when Islamic State fighters stormed into northern Iraq, including the heartland of the Yazidi people. They took thousands of women as sex slaves, including Ashwaq - sold for $100 to a man named Abu Humam. Raped and beaten, she managed to escape three months later and then went to Germany with her mother and one brother. A few months ago, on the street outside a supermarket, she heard someone call out her name. Ashwaq told the BBC: ""On the way back to school a car pulled up next to me. He was sitting in the front seat. He talked to me in German and asked: 'Are you Ashwaq?' I was so scared I was shaking. I said: 'No, who are you?'"" She said he then replied: ""I know you are Ashwaq, and I am Abu Humam."" Ashwaq said he then started to talk to her in Arabic and told her not to lie to him. ""I know you, he said. And where you live and who you live with. He knew everything about my life in Germany."" Who are the Yazidis? Iraq's minorities fear for their future She added: ""I never in my life believed that I would see something like this in Germany. ""I left my family and my country and went to Germany to forget the beating and the pain. The last thing I expected was to meet my IS captor and that he would know everything about me."" Germany's federal prosecutor says Ashwaq reported the incident to the police five days after she said it took place. Ashwaq says she told investigators everything, including her harrowing experiences in Iraq. Officers made an e-fit of the suspect and told her to contact the police immediately if she saw Abu Humam again. She says she also told the police to check the supermarket's CCTV, but says this did not happen. ""I waited a whole month,"" she says, but received no news. Ashwaq's father told the BBC that dozens of their relatives were still missing Fearful that she would see her captor again and wishing to be reunited with four of her sisters who had since been rescued from IS, Ashwaq returned to northern Iraq, leaving behind the town of SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd where she had hoped to start a new life. ""If you haven't been through it, you won't know what it's like... it goes straight to your heart,"" she said. ""When a girl is raped by IS, you can't imagine what it's like when you see this guy again."" Frauke KÃ¶hler, a spokeswoman for Germany's top court, says police made every effort to locate Abu Humam using the e-fit image and Ashwaq's testimony, but were unable to find him. By the time they contacted her again in June this year as part of the investigation, Ashwaq had already left for Iraq. However, activists in Germany say her case may not be an isolated incident. DÃ¼zen Tekkal, an activist and the founder of Hawar.Help, a Berlin-based organisation which campaigns for Yazidi rights, says she has heard of several cases where female Yazidi refugees recognised IS fighters in Germany. Ashwaq herself says she heard similar accounts from other Yazidi girls who had escaped the jihadists. Not all cases are reported to the authorities, however. Back in Kurdistan now living in a Yazidi camp, Ashwaq still wants to continue her education but both she and her family also want to leave the country. ""We're scared of the people of IS,"" her father told the BBC. But her experience in Germany has had a profound impact on Ashwaq. ""If the world was destroyed, I would not go to Germany again,"" she said. Like many Yazidis, her family is now applying to live in Australia as part of a special programme for women abducted by IS. Dozens of Yazidis free from IS captivity Yazidis gather for New Year celebrations.

"Around 470,000 people are using e-cigarettes as an aid to stop smoking Rules around e-cigarettes should be relaxed so they can be more widely used and accepted in society, says a report by MPs. Vaping is much less harmful than normal cigarettes and e-cigarettes should be made available on prescription to help more people quit smoking, it said. The report also asks the government,externalto consider their use on buses and trains. There is no evidence e-cigarettes are a gateway into smoking for young people, Public Health England said. The report on e-cigarettes, by the science and technology MPs' committee, said they were too often overlooked by the NHS as a tool to help people stop smoking. For example, it said it was ""unacceptable"" that a third of the 50 NHS mental health trusts in England had a ban on e-cigarettes on their premises, when there was a ""negligible health risk"" from second hand e-cigarette vapour. In the report they call for: greater freedom for industry to advertise e-cigarettes relaxing of regulations and tax duties on e-cigarettes to reflect their relative health benefits an annual review of the health effects of e-cigarettes, as well as heat-not-burn products a debate on vaping in public spaces, such as on public transport and in offices e-cigarettes licensed as medical devices a rethink on limits on refill strengths and tank sizes an end to the ban on snus - an oral tobacco product which is illegal in the UK under EU rules This video can not be played ""Relief my son turned to vaping"" - Norman Lamb About 2.9 million people in the UK are currently using e-cigarettes. It is estimated that 470,000 people are using them as an aid to stop smoking and tens of thousands are successfully quitting smoking each year as a result. Vaping - good, bad or just not clear? Vaping - the rise in five charts E-cigarettes 'should be on prescription' How likely is your e-cigarette to explode? Vaping 'can damage vital immune system cells's Although the report recognised the long-term health effects of vaping were not yet known, it said e-cigarettes were substantially less harmful than conventional cigarettes because they contained no tar or carbon monoxide. Norman Lamb, chairman of the science and technology committee, said: ""Current policy and regulations do not sufficiently reflect this and businesses, transport providers and public places should stop viewing conventional and e-cigarettes as one and the same. ""There is no public health rationale for doing so,"" he said. ""Concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, have not materialised. ""If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS's stop-smoking arsenal."" Mr Lamb said medically licensed e-cigarettes ""would make it easier for doctors to discuss and recommend them as a stop-smoking tool to aid those quitting smoking"". MPs want greater freedom for industry to advertise e-cigarettes The report is the latest in a long-running debate about e-cigarettes and how they are used in society. A survey in Scotland found that young people who use e-cigarettescould be more likely to later smoketobacco. And in Wales,concerns have been raisedabout young people using e-cigarettes on a regular basis. But elsewhere, asix month trial at an Isle of Man jailfound allowing inmates to smoke e-cigarettes made them calmer and helped them quit smoking. More research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of e-cigarettes, afterearly research on lung cells in the labsuggested that the vapour may not be completely safe. But there is general agreement among public health experts, doctors and scientists that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than normal cigarettes containing tobacco. E-cigarettes are not covered by thesmoking legislation which bansthe use of cigarettes in all enclosed public and work places. In fact, to encourage smokers to switch to vaping,Public Health England recommends,externale-cigarettes should not be treated the same as regular cigarettes when it comes to workplaces devising smoking policies. ""Vaping,"" the authority said, ""should be made a more convenient as well as safer option"". But some places have banned vaping. For example, Transport for London forbids the use of e-cigarettes on all buses and the Underground, including at stations. Big cinema chains such as Cineworld, Odeon and Empire also ban smoking e-cigarettes anywhere on their premises while most theatres also forbid their use. Most airlines and airports ban vaping, apart from in designated smoking areas. Public Health England estimates that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than normal cigarettes. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE, said: ""E-cigarettes are not without harm but are way safer than the harms of tobacco. ""There is no evidence that they are acting as a gateway into smoking for young people. ""We want to see a tobacco-free generation within 10 years and this is within sight."" The charity Action on Smoking and Health welcomed the report but said it had some concerns over rule changes on advertising, which could mean tobacco companies being allowed to market their e-cigarettes in packs of cigarettes. George Butterworth, from Cancer Research UK, said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations ""should be aimed at helping smokers to quit whilst preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes"". Prof Linda Bauld, professor of health policy at the University of Stirling, said: ""This report is a welcome and evidence-based respite from all the scare stories we see about vaping. ""Its recommendations are not likely to be popular with all, and some of them may be difficult or complex to implement. But government, regulators and service providers should take note.""

"Adult film star Stormy Daniels pulled out of Celebrity Big Brother after a row with producers, her lawyer says. She had been expected to go intothe British reality TV house on Thursday. Her lawyer Michael Avenatti said producers ""insisted she conduct herself in a certain way"". Channel 5 said they couldn't agree ""any acceptable conditions"" for her to enter. Ms Daniels hit the headlines after alleging she had slept with President Donald Trump in 2006, which he denies. She was due to appear on Friday's Loose Women to explain her absence from Celebrity Big Brother, but didn't appear on that show either. Co-host Jane Moore spoke to her off camera and told viewers she had been told she couldn't do an interview because of ""a legal situation"". Allow Twitter content?

Asked why Ms Daniels didn't appear on Celebrity Big Brother, Mr Avenatti told the Press Association: ""It was over a row with producers. ""They insisted she conduct herself in a certain way - they attempted to control her and produce a certain result, which she did not feel comfortable with."" He also dismissed reports that she quit after demanding extra money. ""They are spreading a false rumour,"" he said. A statement from Channel 5 said: ""Stormy Daniels was booked to appear on the show several months ago and hours before the show was due to go live, informed the production team that she no longer wished to enter the house as previously agreed."" A spokeswoman added: ""Producers discussed a variety of options with her but were unable to agree any acceptable conditions for her entering the house."" Celebrity Big Brother: The line-up in full On ITV's Loose Women, Moore told viewers : ""There was a custody development with her daughter late last night. She suddenly thought, I can't commit because being a mother comes first."" Daniels' daughter is seven, and going into the Celebrity Big Brother could have isolated Daniels from the outside world for several weeks. Moore continued: ""She wanted to go on the [Celebrity Big Brother] live show and explain [what had happened] and that was all agreed, she says, and then suddenly they said, 'We don't want you to do any of it.'

"A soldier cleared of rape has been ordered to pay his alleged victim more than Â£100,000 in a civil case. Sean Diamond, 24, had stood trial for allegedly raping a woman while she slept in a Dundee flat in July 2015. A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found the case not proven in October. A civil action for damages was granted by a Dundee sheriff after the claim was not defended by Mr Diamond, who has since said this was due to an oversight and that he plans to defend the action. Lawyers acting for Mr Diamond said that he had failed to lodge defences in time. He continues to deny the rape allegations and has now instructed Balfour and Manson to make an application to the court to recall the decree. Mr Diamond was based in Leuchars at the time of the alleged crime. He is now serving with the Queen's Dragoon Guards based at Robertson Barracks in Dereham, Norfolk. The woman was granted Â£100,000 with interest. She told BBC Scotland: ""For me, it was absolutely heartbreaking, gut wrenching, the worst thing I could ever have imagined. ""I felt like the worst thing had already happened and then to hear the not proven verdict just multiplied what had already happened to an even more extreme level. ""I'm somebody that's normally very upbeat - a bubbly, happy person and I became almost a prisoner in my own head. ""Over time I've been able to repair myself and move forward. However, it has been a very turbulent journey."" She added: ""For me it's not about the money, nothing's ever going to make that situation go away.""

"Tesla shares have plunged after founder Elon Musk revealed to the New York Times he works ""120 hour weeks"" and takes sedatives. In the interview, Mr Musk also said he was not ""on weed"" when he controversially tweeted about taking the company private. After the comments from Mr Musk, shares were down 8.8%. The share drop was encouraged by a UBS note predicting Tesla's Model 3 will lose $6,000 per vehicle, as costs soar. The ramping up of production of the electric car company's mass-market Model 3 was one of the reasons why Mr Musk admitted to being overworked and using the sedative Ambien to help sleep, he said in the interview. TheNew York Times,externalinterview also discussed his7 August tweetwhen the CEO said he wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Mr Musk said the price of $420 seemed like ""better karma"" than $419. ""But I was not on weed, to be clear,"" he said, as he also confirmed the tweet was not reviewed by anyone at the electric car company. 4/20 is an infamous term, more common in the US, that refers to the consumption of cannabis. The price of $419 would have represented a 20% premium over Tesla's share price at the time. Musk in the hot seat again Tesla founder playing a dangerous game ""It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419. But I was not on weed, to be clear. ""Weed is not helpful for productivity. There's a reason for the word 'stoned'. You just sit there like a stone on weed,"" Mr Musk, 47, said. He also told the paper that friends had expressed concern that he was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks. ""This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,"" he said. ""It was excruciating."" The paper reported that at times during the interview he stopped speaking, seemingly overcome by emotion - and that he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday on 28 June working. ""All night - no friends, nothing,"" Mr Musk said. Mr Musk also said that he took the sedative Ambien to help him sleep when he was not working: ""It is often a choice of no sleep, or Ambien."" According to the paper, his use of the drug has concerned some board members, who wonder if it affects his late-night tweets. In MayRoseanne Barr blamed Ambien for her tweetthat likened Valerie Jarrett, an African-American former aide to Barack Obama, to an ape. Elon Musk unveils the Tesla Roadster 2 in November His tweet about taking Tesla private sparked a sharp rally in Tesla's share price, but has also prompted scrutiny. London hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who is shorting Tesla stock, has joined a number of analysts disproving of Mr Musk's running of the company. According to Bloomberg, Mr Odey told investors: ""Tesla feels like it is entering the final stage of its life."" Fox Newshas reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)had sent subpoenas to the electric carmaker and was ""ramping up"" its investigation into the tweet. Tesla's directors said: ""There have been many false and irresponsible rumours in the press about the discussions of the Tesla board. ""We would like to make clear that Elon's commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious. ""Over the past 15 years, Elon's leadership of the Tesla team has caused Tesla to grow from a small start-up to having hundreds of thousands of cars on the road that customers love, employing tens of thousands of people around the world, and creating significant shareholder value in the process."" The statement was issued by the board members, excluding Mr Musk, who controls about a fifth of Tesla shares. The board hasset up a committee to evaluate any take-private proposal from Mr Musk, who has said thathe discussed funding a deal with the Saudi Arabiansovereign wealth fund. The New York Times reported that Mr Musk did not intend to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive, but that a search was underway to recruit a deputy.

"This video can not be played Video caught the moment that Jordan Holgerson was pushed off the bridge A teenager who shoved her friend off a 60ft tall (18m) bridge causing serious injuries said in a televised interview that her friend had asked for the push. ""She wanted to jump and she was scared, and she had asked me to give her a push,"" said Taylor Smith, 18, on ABC. Jordan Holgerson, 16, was left with six broken ribs, punctured lungs, and other internal injuries after the fall in a Washington state regional park.

It is expected to announce a decision on Friday. Taylor Smith admitted on TV causing ""not only bodily harm but emotional trauma"" to Jordan The incident occurred earlier this month in the Moulton Falls Regional Park, about 40 miles (64km) north of Portland, Oregon.

"Fuad Ghalib was taken to hospital where he was treated for life-changing injuries, police said A ""cowardly"" hit-and-run driver who struck a grandfather and left him ""for dead"" has been jailed. Khalyl Mattis, 22, hit Fuad Ghalib in Moss Side, Manchester, on 1 October 2017 while being pursued by police. When the officers stopped to help Mr Ghalib, who is known by his family as ""Papa Smurf"", the car drove off. Mattis was found guilty of causing injury by dangerous driving at Manchester Crown Court and jailed for five years six months on Thursday. Mr Ghalib, 79, who was found lying in Caythorpe Street, was taken to hospital and treated for life-changing injuries, police said. Khalyl Mattis ""tried every dishonest trick in the book"" to avoid conviction, police said In the days following the collision, his family issued an emotional appeal for the driver to hand himself in. However, Greater Manchester Police said Mattis, of Lynton Drive, Manchester, ""continued to carry on about his life, knowing that he had left a man for dead"". He was also convicted of dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice and was banned from driving for five years. Sgt Lee Westhead said he ""showed no remorse as he tried every dishonest trick in the book in an attempt to avoid the consequences of his abhorrent behaviour"". ã ""He woefully underestimated the investigation that ultimately uncovered his lies and proved that he was the person responsible for Mr Ghalib's horrendous injuries,"" he added.ã ""Mattis is a cowardly individual who was clearly terrified of us catching up with him.""

"Lin Keitch noticed the ring while washing the home-grown carrots for dinner A gold ring that was lost in a vegetable garden 12 years ago has been found on a carrot dug up for dinner. Lin Keitch, 69, from Monkton Heathfield near Taunton, Somerset, noticed it while washing her home-grown vegetables. It had been a 40th birthday present from her husband Dave, and was lost by their daughter. The couple believe the carrot grew through the ring. Ms Keitch said it was a ""chance in a million"" discovery. ""Dave dug up the carrots and left them outside the back door,"" she said. ""I cut the greens off and scrubbed them, and I thought, 'What's that? Goodness, it's my ring'."" She said even though the ring, with an amethyst stone in the centre, was covered in earth she recognised it immediately. Dave Keitch gave the gold ring to his wife Lin for her 40th birthday ""Dave had bought it for me for my 40th birthday, but when it got too small for me I gave it to our daughter.

"China's military ""is likely training for strikes"" against US and allied targets in the Pacific, a Pentagon report warns. The annual report to Congress,externalsays China is increasing its ability to send bomber planes further afield. The report highlights its increasing military capability, including defence spending estimated at $190bn (Â£150bn) - a third that of the US. China has not yet commented on the report. The warning about air strikes is one part of a comprehensive assessment of China's military and economic ambitions. ""Over the last three years, the PLA [People's Liberation Army] has rapidly expanded its overwater bomber operating areas, gaining experience in critical maritime regions and likely training for strikes against US and allied targets,"" the report says. It goes on to say it is not clear what China is trying to prove by such flights. The PLA may demonstrate the ""capability to strike US and allied forces and military bases in the western Pacific Ocean, including Guam,"" the report adds. A Chinese navy fleet including the aircraft carrier Liaoning China, it says, is restructuring its ground forces to ""fight and win"". ""The purpose of these reforms is to create a more mobile, modular, lethal ground force capable of being the core of joint operations,"" the report says. China's military budget is expected to expand to $240bn over the next 10 years, according to the assessment. It also highlights China's growing space programme ""despite its public stance against the militarization of space"". In June, President Donald Trump announced his intentions to set up a sixth branch of the US armed forces - a ""space force"". Why is Trump creating a space force? The US is concerned about China's growing influence in the Pacific, where Washington still plays a major role. One of the most high-profile areas is the South China Sea, much of it claimed by China and other countries. This video can not be played In 2018, a BBC team flew over the disputed South China Sea islands in a US military plane The US military regularly seeks to demonstrate freedom of navigation by flying over the South China Sea. China has been expanding what appear to be military facilities on islands and reefs in the area, and it has landed bombers on the outposts during training exercises. Another flashpoint is Taiwan, which is seen by China as a breakaway province. The document warns that China ""is likely preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan with China by force"". ""Should the United States intervene, China would try to delay effective intervention and seek victory in a high-intensity, limited war of short duration,"" the report says. In a nod to China, the US cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 but continues to maintain close political and security ties, which irks Beijing. Trump lays out hike in military spending Why is the South China Sea contentious? The US also continues to maintain a substantial military presence in Japan, which has its own territorial disputes with China. Tensions also continue in the non-military sphere.The US and China have announced tariffson a range of each other's goods. By Jonathan Marcus, Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent While the bulk of the Pentagon's annual China report focuses on Beijing's rapidly developing military capabilities, the study also looks in some depth at China's little known Maritime Militia. This is an armed civilian reserve force, organised and recruited locally, but according to the Pentagon, the Militia plays a vital role in the South China Sea, spreading Beijing's political goals through operations short of outright war. A large number of Militia vessels support the Chinese Navy and Coast Guard in safeguarding maritime claims, protecting fisheries and so on. The Pentagon study says that the Militia has played a significant role in a number of high-profile incidents, where Chinese vessels have sought to coerce ships from countries with competing maritime claims. This is all part of China's effort to promote so-called ""grey operations"", designed to frustrate the response of other parties involved and secure its interests across a wide swathe of reefs and island chains. The Pentagon report is at pains to stress that the US ""seeks a constructive and results-oriented relationship with China"". There is regular contact between US and Chinese military officials.

"This video can not be played Taking out food groups not beneficial, says nutritionist A low-carb diet could shorten life expectancy by up to four years, a study suggests. Low-carb diets, such as Atkins, have become increasingly popular for weight loss and have shown promise for lowering the risk of some illnesses. But a US study over 25 years indicates that moderate carb consumption - or switching meat for plant-based protein and fats - is healthier. The study relied on people remembering the amount of carbohydrates they ate. In the study,published in The Lancet Public Health,external, 15,400 people from the US filled out questionnaires on the food and drink they consumed, along with portion sizes. From this, scientists estimated the proportion of calories they got from carbohydrates, fats, and protein. After following the group for an average of 25 years, researchers found that those who got 50-55% of their energy from carbohydrates (the moderate carb group and in line with UK dietary guidelines) had a slightly lower risk of death compared with the low and high-carb groups. Carbohydrates include vegetables, fruit and sugar but the main source of them is starchy foods, such as potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals. TheNHS Eatwell Guide,externalprovides details on how to achieve this kind of healthy, balanced diet and reduce the risk of serious illnesses in the long term. Researchers estimated that, from the age of 50, people in the moderate carb group were on average expected to live for another 33 years. This was: four years more than people who got 30% or less of their energy from carbs (extra-low-carb group) 2.3 years more than the 30%-40% (low-carb) group 1.1 years more than the 65% or more (high-carb) group The findings were similar to previous studies the authors compared their work with, which included more than 400,000 people from more than 20 countries. Exchanging carbohydrates for plant-based fats and proteins might promote healthy ageing, experts said The scientists then compared low-carb diets rich in animal proteins and fats with those that contained lots of plant-based protein and fat. They found that eating more beef, lamb, pork, chicken and cheese in place of carbs was linked with a slightly increased risk of death. But replacing carbohydrates with more plant-based proteins and fats, such as legumes and nuts, was actually found to slightly reduce the risk of mortality. Dr Sara Seidelmann, clinical and research fellow in cardiovascular medicine from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who led the research, said: ""Low-carb diets that replace carbohydrates with protein or fat are gaining widespread popularity as a health and weight-loss strategy. ""However, our data suggests that animal-based low carbohydrate diets, which are prevalent in North America and Europe, might be associated with shorter overall life span and should be discouraged. ""Instead, if one chooses to follow a low carbohydrate diet, then exchanging carbohydrates for more plant-based fats and proteins might actually promote healthy ageing in the long term."" The authors speculate that Western-type diets that restrict carbohydrates often result in lower intake of vegetables, fruit, and grains and lead to greater consumption of animal proteins and fats, which have been linked to inflammation and ageing in the body. Prof Nita Forouhi, from the MRC epidemiology unit at University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: ""A really important message from this study is that it is not enough to focus on the nutrients, but whether they are derived from animal or plant sources. ""When carbohydrate intake is reduced in the diet, there are benefits when this is replaced with plant-origin fat and protein food sources, but not when replaced with animal-origin sources such as meats."" However, there are limitations to the study. The findings show observational associations rather than cause-and-effect and what people ate was based on self-reported data, which might not be accurate. And the authors acknowledge that since diets were measured only at the start of the trial and six years later, dietary patterns could have changed over the subsequent 19 years. Prof Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, also pointed out that the use of a food questionnaire in the study led to people underestimating the calories and fat they had eaten. ""One explanation for the finding in this and the other US studies is that it may reflect the higher risk of death in the overweight/obese, who may fall into two popular diet camps - those favouring a high-meat/low-carbohydrate diet and those favouring a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet,"" he added. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: ""This provides further evidence that low-carb diets could be incredibly damaging to our long-term health. ""High-fibre starchy carbohydrates should provide about half of our energy, including fruit and vegetables, while reducing intake of higher fat meat and dairy."" Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"A scan showed the cyst above the woman's eye A woman has had a contact lens removed from her eyelid 28 years after it was thought to have fallen out. The discovery was made by doctors in Dundee after the patient, now aged 42, complained of swelling over her eye. The lens was found lodged in a cyst which had mysteriously flared up after more than a quarter of a century. The woman had been struck in the eye by a shuttlecock when she was 14, and it had been assumed the lens had been knocked out by the impact. The unusual case is reported in the medical journal The BMJ. Researchers at Ninewells hospital carried out an MRI scan after the woman was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology by her GP. The patient presented with left upper eyelid swelling and ptosis (a droopy eyelid), according to doctors Sirjhun Patel,  Lai-Ling Tan, and Helen Murgatroyd . Images revealed an ovoid-shaped cyst about 8mm long but there was no evidence of anything inside it. When surgeons removed the lump, the cyst ruptured revealing the lens. The contact lens was found lodged inside a cyst that was removed from the woman's eyelid Dr Patel and colleagues wrote: ""On further questioning, the patient's mother recalled that the patient had a history of blunt trauma to the upper left eyelid as a child. ""The patient was hit in the left eye with a shuttlecock while playing badminton at the age of 14. ""The patient was wearing an RGP (Rigid Gas Permeable) contact lens at the time, which was never found. ""It was assumed that the contact lens dislodged out of the eye and was lost."" The paper explains the woman, who is not named, suffered swelling to her eye after the incident but that inflammation was successfully treated by her GP. The patient had never worn RGP lenses again following the accident. The researchers said: ""We can infer that the RGP lens migrated into the patient's left upper eyelid at the time of trauma and had been in situ for the last 28 years."" The team added: ""The migration of a rigid gas permeable (RGP) lens into the eyelid is a rare cause of eyelid swelling. ""Spontaneous migration of a hard contact lens into the eyelid is a relatively known occurrence, but we were only able to find four reported cases of lens migration secondary to significant trauma. ""This case report exhibits the longest time between traumatic RGP lens migration into the eyelid and presentation of eyelid swelling.""

Generations of children watched the accident-prone pair, known for their catchphrase, ""To me, to you."" The service was held at Rotherham United football club, of which Barry was an honorary life president. Barry Chuckle funeral: As it happened The funeral cortege was greeted by applause and shouts of the brothers' catchphrase by hundreds of fans gathered outside the ground.

Paul had described Barry as his ""very best friend"", after his death on 5 August following a short illness. Famous faces including Roy Chubby Brown, Vicki Michelle, Linda Nolan, Bernie Clifton, Tommy Cannon and Billy Pearce were among those invited inside the stadium. Fans applauded as the funeral cortege arrived at the stadium Yorkshire comedian Billy Pearce said: ""I think Barry would be honoured and elated to see that so many people loved him so much. ""I think that's the main thing and we will all miss him.""

She said wherever he went people would call out, ""To me, to you"". ""It's going to be sad today. My heart goes out to his family, his brother Paul in particular and his children."" Vicki Michelle recalled working with Barry in pantomime About 400 fans gathered outside the ground to pay their respects. Lisa Scranage, 45, and her fiance Mark Kitchen, 37, got to the stadium with her 14-year-old son Ryan at 10:00 BST, having travelled from Featherstone. Ms Scranage said she first watched ChuckleVision as a child after school and her love of Barry and Paul grew from there. She went regularly to shows and often stayed behind to chat to the brothers, becoming friends with them. ""They have given us so much over the years as the Chuckle Brothers, so this is the last chance to give a little bit back to Barry, to say goodbye and pay our respects,"" she said. The couple had asked Barry Chuckle to come to their wedding. At the scene Oliver WrightBBC News Online The road up to the stadium was lined with hundreds of well wishers, keen to say goodbye to Barry. Some had arrived as early as 10:00 to find a spot, travelling from across Yorkshire and further afield. All the people I spoke to were delighted to share their happy memories of growing up watching him and his brother on TV or in pantomime. The famous faces he worked with through his career all painted a picture of a man who was a joy to work with and will be dearly missed. As the hearse approached a ripple of applause broke out among the crowd and a few shouts of ""To me, to you"" could be heard. There were at least a few people who shed a tear as his coffin was carried in to the stadium for the private service. The Chuckle Brothers' catchphrase was shouted by fans as the cortege arrived Fans gathered outside Rotherham United's stadium where the service took place Will Cowan, 18, from Doncaster, came wearing a Chuckle Brothers T-shirt. ""I can't remember when I started watching them to be honest - [probably] since I was born,"" he said. ""It's been a really nice send-off for Barry. He's such a legend. ""Even now you can still enjoy their sketches. It works if you're five or 95."" Alfie travelled form Birmingham to attend the service One young Chuckle Brothers fan travelled with his father 100 miles from Birmingham to pay his respects. Alfie, 10, said: ""I first went to see them at the pantomime in Wolverhampton around two years ago and I just became a megafan of them. ""I just love their episodes and every morning I'm watching their episodes of ChuckleVision."" Earlier this year, the brothers returnedto television with a new show, Chuckle Time, on Channel 5. Barry had been unwell towards the end of the new show's filming. The brothers' show ran for 22 years on the BBC Summer work was cancelled while he rested at his doctor's request, but not long after his health deteriorated.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of troops have been rescuing trapped residents in Kerala At least 324 people have been killed in flooding in the southern Indian state of Kerala in what local officials say is the worst flooding in 100 years. India's monsoon season started in June, but the death toll in Kerala has soared in the past 24 hours. Rescuers are battling torrential rains to save residents, with more than 200,000 people left homeless in camps. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in the state to see the devastation for himself. The Kerala government said many of those who died had been crushed under debris caused by landslides. With more rains predicted and a red alert in place, Kerala's main airport is expected to remain shut until 26 August. Hundreds of troops have been deployed to rescue those caught up in the flooding. Helicopters have been airlifting people marooned by the flooding to safety, with photographs and footage emerging from the area showing elderly people and children being rescued. India floods: 'I'll have nothing if I leave my house' Saving flood water to get through the droughts More than 300 boats are also involved in rescue attempts, AFP news agency reports. The government has urged people not to ignore evacuation orders, and is distributing food to tens of thousands of people who have fled to higher ground. The Indian home ministry says more than 930 people have now died across India since the country's monsoon season began. The region's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has described the flooding as the worst the state has seen in a century. This video can not be played Monsoon update 2018 ""We're witnessing something that has never happened before in the history of Kerala,"" he told reporters. Mr Vijayan said more than 223,000 people were now living in more than 1,500 emergency relief camps set up in the area. Parts of Kerala's commercial capital, Cochin, are underwater, snarling up roads and leaving railways across the state impassable. The Kerala chief minister has said the state has ""never seen anything like this before"" The state's airport is a hub for domestic and overseas tourists, so its closure is likely to cause major disruption. Some local plantations are reported to have been inundated by water, endangering the local rubber, tea, coffee and spice industries. Schools in all 14 districts of Kerala have been closed and some districts have banned tourists, citing safety concerns. Prime Minister Modi arrived in the region on Friday evening, Indian media reported, and is due to see the worst affected areas from the air on Saturday. The country's home minister has also offered his support. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, has said they are prepared to help victims and are setting arrangements in place to deal with the potential risks of water-borne diseases when the flooding recedes. It is normal for Kerala to get some of the country's highest rainfall during monsoon season, but the India Meteorological Department said it had been hit with 37% more than usual because of a spell of low pressure over the region. Further downpours are forecast for the weekend, leading many to fear the situation may get worse. Environmental scientists are also blaming deforestation,external, especially the failure to protect ecologically fragile mountain ranges in the area, local media report. Mr Vijayan, the region's chief minister, has said the situation in Kerala has been made worse by neighbouring governments. Volunteers in Kozhikode district in Kerala sort through flood relief supplies Earlier this week, he and his counterpart in Tamil Nadu entered a public spat over the release of water from a dam. Kerala has 41 rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea, and 80 of its dams are now said to be open after being overwhelmed. ""Almost all dams are now opened. Most of our water treatment plants are submerged. Motors are damaged,"" Mr Vjayan said. BBC Tamil's Pramila Krishnan spoke to several people who had escaped the flooding in Cochin. Krishna Jayan, 58, said she was at home sleeping when her friend woke her up. ""I opened the door and water gushed in,"" she said. ""When we stepped into the street, we were neck-deep in water."" She said locals had tied ropes along the streets to help people walk through the water, allowing her and her friend to reach a bus to escape. Another resident, 33-year-old Shabbir Saheel, said he had to carry his two-year-old daughter on his shoulders through the flooded streets to safety.

"Around 470,000 people are using e-cigarettes as an aid to stop smoking Rules around e-cigarettes should be relaxed so they can be more widely used and accepted in society, says a report by MPs. Vaping is much less harmful than normal cigarettes and e-cigarettes should be made available on prescription to help more people quit smoking, it said. The report also asks the government,externalto consider their use on buses and trains. There is no evidence e-cigarettes are a gateway into smoking for young people, Public Health England said. The report on e-cigarettes, by the science and technology MPs' committee, said they were too often overlooked by the NHS as a tool to help people stop smoking. For example, it said it was ""unacceptable"" that a third of the 50 NHS mental health trusts in England had a ban on e-cigarettes on their premises, when there was a ""negligible health risk"" from second hand e-cigarette vapour. In the report they call for: greater freedom for industry to advertise e-cigarettes relaxing of regulations and tax duties on e-cigarettes to reflect their relative health benefits an annual review of the health effects of e-cigarettes, as well as heat-not-burn products a debate on vaping in public spaces, such as on public transport and in offices e-cigarettes licensed as medical devices a rethink on limits on refill strengths and tank sizes an end to the ban on snus - an oral tobacco product which is illegal in the UK under EU rules This video can not be played ""Relief my son turned to vaping"" - Norman Lamb About 2.9 million people in the UK are currently using e-cigarettes. It is estimated that 470,000 people are using them as an aid to stop smoking and tens of thousands are successfully quitting smoking each year as a result. Vaping - good, bad or just not clear? Vaping - the rise in five charts E-cigarettes 'should be on prescription' How likely is your e-cigarette to explode? Vaping 'can damage vital immune system cells's Although the report recognised the long-term health effects of vaping were not yet known, it said e-cigarettes were substantially less harmful than conventional cigarettes because they contained no tar or carbon monoxide. Norman Lamb, chairman of the science and technology committee, said: ""Current policy and regulations do not sufficiently reflect this and businesses, transport providers and public places should stop viewing conventional and e-cigarettes as one and the same. ""There is no public health rationale for doing so,"" he said. ""Concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, have not materialised. ""If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS's stop-smoking arsenal."" Mr Lamb said medically licensed e-cigarettes ""would make it easier for doctors to discuss and recommend them as a stop-smoking tool to aid those quitting smoking"". MPs want greater freedom for industry to advertise e-cigarettes The report is the latest in a long-running debate about e-cigarettes and how they are used in society. A survey in Scotland found that young people who use e-cigarettescould be more likely to later smoketobacco. And in Wales,concerns have been raisedabout young people using e-cigarettes on a regular basis. But elsewhere, asix month trial at an Isle of Man jailfound allowing inmates to smoke e-cigarettes made them calmer and helped them quit smoking. More research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of e-cigarettes, afterearly research on lung cells in the labsuggested that the vapour may not be completely safe. But there is general agreement among public health experts, doctors and scientists that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than normal cigarettes containing tobacco. E-cigarettes are not covered by thesmoking legislation which bansthe use of cigarettes in all enclosed public and work places. In fact, to encourage smokers to switch to vaping,Public Health England recommends,externale-cigarettes should not be treated the same as regular cigarettes when it comes to workplaces devising smoking policies. ""Vaping,"" the authority said, ""should be made a more convenient as well as safer option"". But some places have banned vaping. For example, Transport for London forbids the use of e-cigarettes on all buses and the Underground, including at stations. Big cinema chains such as Cineworld, Odeon and Empire also ban smoking e-cigarettes anywhere on their premises while most theatres also forbid their use. Most airlines and airports ban vaping, apart from in designated smoking areas. Public Health England estimates that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than normal cigarettes. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE, said: ""E-cigarettes are not without harm but are way safer than the harms of tobacco. ""There is no evidence that they are acting as a gateway into smoking for young people. ""We want to see a tobacco-free generation within 10 years and this is within sight."" The charity Action on Smoking and Health welcomed the report but said it had some concerns over rule changes on advertising, which could mean tobacco companies being allowed to market their e-cigarettes in packs of cigarettes. George Butterworth, from Cancer Research UK, said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations ""should be aimed at helping smokers to quit whilst preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes"". Prof Linda Bauld, professor of health policy at the University of Stirling, said: ""This report is a welcome and evidence-based respite from all the scare stories we see about vaping. ""Its recommendations are not likely to be popular with all, and some of them may be difficult or complex to implement. But government, regulators and service providers should take note."" There are some strong opinions on Twitter in reaction to the idea of allowing vaping on public transport. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Lin Keitch noticed the ring while washing the home-grown carrots for dinner A gold ring that was lost in a vegetable garden 12 years ago has been found on a carrot dug up for dinner. Lin Keitch, 69, from Monkton Heathfield near Taunton, Somerset, noticed it while washing her home-grown vegetables. It had been a 40th birthday present from her husband Dave, and was lost by their daughter. The couple believe the carrot grew through the ring. Ms Keitch said it was a ""chance in a million"" discovery. ""Dave dug up the carrots and left them outside the back door,"" she said. ""I cut the greens off and scrubbed them, and I thought, 'What's that? Goodness, it's my ring'."" She said even though the ring, with an amethyst stone in the centre, was covered in earth she recognised it immediately. Dave Keitch gave the gold ring to his wife Lin for her 40th birthday ""Dave had bought it for me for my 40th birthday, but when it got too small for me I gave it to our daughter. ""She lost it up the garden - it must be at least 12 years ago. I thought I'd never see it again. ""I'm amazed the carrot grew through it."" Monkman and Seagull get TV show Wasp nests calls increase fivefold The drug that makes people jump off buildings Dave Keitch, 69, said he had looked for the ring regularly over the years ""every time I do the garden over"". He did not realise he had dug it up with the carrots last week. ""When Lin put it in the bowl to prepare them for dinner she noticed it on the end of the carrot. She was over the moon.

"This video can not be played Rory Stewart: Judge me on my record in 12 months time Prisons minister Rory Stewart says he will resign in a year if he hasn't managed to reduce drugs and violence levels in 10 target jails in England. He made the promise as the government announced Â£10m to improve security and conditions at the jails. New body scanners and sniffer dogs are to be introduced in the prisons, which are described as ""challenging"", in a clampdown on drugs and mobile phones. The dogs have been trained to detect psychoactive substances such as Spice. Ministers also want to raise standards of leadership by sending prison governors to military-style colleges. And there will be a programme of repairs and improvements to cell windows and perimeter security in the prisons. Spice 'causing huge problems' in prisons Allow boxing in prisons, expert says Speaking to the BBC, Mr Stewart said: ""I believe in the prison service, I believe in our prison offices, I believe this can be turned around."" ""I want you to judge me on those results and I will resign if I don't succeed."" He added that he expected to be judged on whether there had been a ""substantial"" reduction in the number of assaults. Asked how much of a reduction he would consider a success - 25% or 10% - Mr Stewart said it would be ""something of that sort"". BBC Reality Check Last year there were more than 3,500 assaults in the 10 prisons that the Ministry of Justice is targeting. That was an increase of 15% on the previous year and more than double the  number of assaults that took place in 2014. Based on the results of mandatory tests on prisoners, drug use in the 10 targeted prisons increased slightly last year. Despite the rise, drug use in these jails is very close to the average for all prisons in England and Wales - with just under 10% of random drug tests proving positive. The new measures are being targeted at 10 jails which the Ministry of Justice says have  ""acute problems"" with high drug use, violence and building issues. They are: Hull - Category B Humber, East Riding of Yorkshire - Category C Leeds - Category B Lindholme, near Doncaster - Category C/D Moorland, Hatfield Woodhouse, South Yorkshire - Category C Wealstun, near Wetherby, West Yorkshire - Category C Nottingham - Category B Ranby, Nottinghamshire - Category C Wormwood Scrubs, west London - Category B Isis, south-east London - Category C It comes after figurespublished by the Ministry of Justice last month,externalshowed incidents of self-harm and assaults in prisons were at record levels. Seizures of smuggled-in drugs and mobile phones also rose by 23% and 15% respectively in the year to March. This video can not be played Ben, who has served five years inside HMP Oakwood, has become a mentor to other prisoners Mr Stewart said the changes would pave the way for a ""new ethos and new direction"" for prisons, saying: ""It is vital we set challenging standards so prisons are places where offenders can turn their lives around. ""We need to make these prisons calmer, more orderly places and in the end that comes down to challenging and managing prisoners consistently, firmly and fairly."" By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent While much of Whitehall is on holiday, the Ministry of Justice has been busy - taking advantage of the sleepy summer news agenda with a series of press releases about prison reform. The announcements have included a report on sport in prison, a pilot scheme to promote community sentences and plans for in-cell telephones. The latest measures - Â£10m for the 10 most challenging prisons - will certainly make a difference. X-ray scanners, for example, are highly effective at detecting drugs - it's just a wonder it's taken so long for them to be introduced. The energetic prisons minister Rory Stewart, who has immersed himself in the brief since he was appointed, is right to point out that the key to a stable prison is leadership. But his idea to raise standards among governors, with a military-style training college, will take time to yield results. Of the Â£10m investment, Â£6m is being earmarked for security measures, Â£3m for the repairs and Â£1m for training. The Ministry of Defence has been contacted for help in setting up a training scheme for prison governors, similar to that for senior members of the armed forces. Wormwood Scrubs, Hull, Lindholme and Nottingham (Clockwise from top left) are among the 10 prisons to benefit However, the Prison Reform Trust said the problems in the jails were caused by a failure to match resources to demand. Its director, Peter Dawson, said: ""It was a catastrophic failure to provide that balance which caused the collapse of prison safety after 2012 - trying to tell governors how to run prisons is not going to put it right."" Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, welcomed the extra funding but said ""the devil will be in the detail"". Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said the government must go ""much further"" and set out an emergency plan across the prisons estate with substantial new funding to put an end to this crisis and make our prisons safe and humane for staff and inmates"". There are about 84,000 inmates in more than 100 prisons, across England and Wales.

"Big brands such as Mulberry, Giorgio Armani, Gucci and Prada face losses from the collapse of House of Fraser. Administrators EY released documents showing suppliers owed Â£484m of total debt estimated late on Friday at Â£884m. Among those listed is the warehouse operator at the centre of a dispute with the new owner which has led to the cancellation of all on-line orders. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct boughtthe chain just hours after it went into administration a week ago. Sports Direct is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its Â£90m buyout as their debts were part of the administration. Warehouse operator XPO Logistics is owed Â£30m and stopped processing orders last week because of a payment dispute. After an outcry from customers who had not received goods orders on line, House of Fraser said it would refund customers and also cancel all online orders. Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, House of Fraser took its website offline as deliveries began to back up. XPO operates two warehouses, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, that handle House of Fraser's deliveries to stores as well as customers. The distributor said it had no comment to make when contacted by the BBC. It is among a number of suppliers to have taken action as negotiations over payment continue with the department store chain. The administrators said the total owed was ""subject to change"". Fashion brand Jigsaw has removed stock from its 20 House of Fraser concessions, and Karen Millen - which is owed more than Â£950,000 - is understood to have followed suit. Others are owed even more: Mulberry is out of pocket by Â£2.4m, while All Saints is owed close to Â£1.8m and Giorgio Armani almost Â£1.6m. Sports Direct has said it wants to ""restore the right level of ongoing relationships"" with its brands. Mr Ashley has also vowed to keep most of House of Fraser's 59 stores open. But some customers are angry about the treatment of their orders. One said on Twitter: ""Absolutely disgraceful. Ordered a Â£90 purse last Thursday. Yes a week ago for my daughters birthday. Not 1 email concerning delivery or info and now order cancelled and you say email in a few days!!! Get my money back ASAP."" Another said two-thirds of their husband's suit would not now be delivered. They tweeted: ""This was for our holidays! I don't have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!"" House of Fraser's website has been taken offline Richard Lim of Retail Economics said there were ""kinks to be ironed out"" when big companies change hands, but warned that ""trust and loyalty are hard-won in retail"". He added: ""You would have thought that delivering a great service to customers would have been a priority for the company. ""Delivering goods into the hands of customers now has to be the top priority."" Rob Brice's wife and grandmother on their wedding day Kent-based Rob Brice and his wife were given Â£500 of House of Fraser gift vouchers by his grandmother for their wedding. Last week he placed an online order worth about Â£380. After hearing nothing for five days, he sent an email and was told they were no longer accepting gift cards, meaning ""my leftover value on the card was lost"". Another email said his order was cancelled and the sum would be refunded to the gift card - one he says is now no longer useable. Mr Brice has called House of Fraser but only gets an automated message. Neither has he had a response to emails and tweets. ""I'm going to look to call Trading Standards today to understand my customer rights in the matter, as it is a lot of money to us and would have been to my nan,"" he says. Meanwhile, EY has said there were six bidders for House of Fraser, with four - offering between Â£40m and Â£49m - being dismissed for various reasons. This left two potential names in the frame, with one of the remaining pair offering Â£1 to acquire the group on a solvent basis. This party then later proposed to acquire the business and assets following any insolvency for Â£100m - Â£10m more than what Sports Direct ultimately paid - before withdrawing. Also, EY said there will be Â£600,000, at best, left to pay unsecured creditors but the prospect of any payout is minimal. Q: What will happen to my House of Fraser online order? If items are in stock, shoppers may still receive them. However, customers are being emailed over the next two days to formally cancel pending orders and be refunded in full.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of troops have been rescuing trapped residents in Kerala At least 324 people have been killed in flooding in the southern Indian state of Kerala in what local officials say is the worst flooding in 100 years. India's monsoon season started in June, but the death toll in Kerala has soared in the past 24 hours. Rescuers are battling torrential rains to save residents, with more than 200,000 people left homeless in camps. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in the state to see the devastation for himself. The Kerala government said many of those who died had been crushed under debris caused by landslides. With more rains predicted and a red alert in place, Kerala's main airport is expected to remain shut until 26 August. Hundreds of troops have been deployed to rescue those caught up in the flooding. Helicopters have been airlifting people marooned by the flooding to safety, with photographs and footage emerging from the area showing elderly people and children being rescued. India floods: 'I'll have nothing if I leave my house' Saving flood water to get through the droughts More than 300 boats are also involved in rescue attempts, AFP news agency reports. The government has urged people not to ignore evacuation orders, and is distributing food to tens of thousands of people who have fled to higher ground. The Indian home ministry says more than 930 people have now died across India since the country's monsoon season began. The region's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has described the flooding as the worst the state has seen in a century. This video can not be played Monsoon update 2018 ""We're witnessing something that has never happened before in the history of Kerala,"" he told reporters. Mr Vijayan said more than 223,000 people were now living in more than 1,500 emergency relief camps set up in the area. Parts of Kerala's commercial capital, Cochin, are underwater, snarling up roads and leaving railways across the state impassable. The Kerala chief minister has said the state has ""never seen anything like this before"" The state's airport is a hub for domestic and overseas tourists, so its closure is likely to cause major disruption. Some local plantations are reported to have been inundated by water, endangering the local rubber, tea, coffee and spice industries. Schools in all 14 districts of Kerala have been closed and some districts have banned tourists, citing safety concerns. Prime Minister Modi arrived in the region on Friday evening, Indian media reported, and is due to see the worst affected areas from the air on Saturday. The country's home minister has also offered his support. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, has said they are prepared to help victims and are setting arrangements in place to deal with the potential risks of water-borne diseases when the flooding recedes. It is normal for Kerala to get some of the country's highest rainfall during monsoon season, but the India Meteorological Department said it had been hit with 37% more than usual because of a spell of low pressure over the region. Further downpours are forecast for the weekend, leading many to fear the situation may get worse. Environmental scientists are also blaming deforestation,external, especially the failure to protect ecologically fragile mountain ranges in the area, local media report. Mr Vijayan, the region's chief minister, has said the situation in Kerala has been made worse by neighbouring governments. Volunteers in Kozhikode district in Kerala sort through flood relief supplies Earlier this week, he and his counterpart in Tamil Nadu entered a public spat over the release of water from a dam. Kerala has 41 rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea, and 80 of its dams are now said to be open after being overwhelmed. ""Almost all dams are now opened. Most of our water treatment plants are submerged. Motors are damaged,"" Mr Vjayan said. BBC Tamil's Pramila Krishnan spoke to several people who had escaped the flooding in Cochin. Krishna Jayan, 58, said she was at home sleeping when her friend woke her up. ""I opened the door and water gushed in,"" she said. ""When we stepped into the street, we were neck-deep in water."" She said locals had tied ropes along the streets to help people walk through the water, allowing her and her friend to reach a bus to escape. Another resident, 33-year-old Shabbir Saheel, said he had to carry his two-year-old daughter on his shoulders through the flooded streets to safety.

"The Thruvision camera can detect concealed objects Body scanners will be used on the Los Angeles subway to screen passengers for explosives and weapons, the local transport authority has announced. It is the first mass transport system in the US to adopt the technology. Portable scanners will be used to screen passengers as they enter stations, without them having to pass through a security checkpoint. Authorities said the screening would be ""voluntary"", but those refusing a scan will not be allowed to travel. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) said it had ordered equipment from UK manufacturer Thruvision. The company's equipment is not currently used on UK public transport, but it has been trialled at the Farnborough Airshow. The scanners have a wide field of view and can screen passengers as they ride an escalator or enter through ticket barriers. The company says its scanners can detect suspicious items from up to 32ft (10m) away, and can scan more than 2,000 passengers an hour. However, it will be used on a pop-up basis rather than permanently installed at specific stations in LA. Thruvision's system uses sensitive cameras that can pick up a person's body heat through their clothing. The scanner does not emit any radiation. Since concealing an item under clothes blocks body heat from being emitted, the cameras can detect items that have been hidden. Human operators can inspect the captured images and decide whether further investigation is necessary. The company says no anatomical detail is revealed by the camera since it detects only body heat. David Pekoske, from the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), told theAssociated Press,externalthat the country faced ""persistent threats to our transportation systems"". ""Our job is to ensure security in the transportation systems so that a terrorist incident does not happen on our watch,"" he said. Alex Wiggins, from the LACMTA, said the authority was looking for weapons that could cause a ""mass-casualty event"" such as explosives and assault rifles, rather than smaller weapons. The authority hopes to buy additional scanners that can follow individual suspects. The TSA has previously tested body scanners in New York's Penn Station, which is described as the busiest rail hub in North America. In December, a27-year-old man was injuredwhen he set off a ""low-tech explosive device"" in a subway passage near Times Square, New York. Three other people suffered minor wounds when the device blew up in an underpass.

"Tesla shares have plunged after founder Elon Musk revealed to the New York Times he works ""120 hour weeks"" and takes sedatives. In the interview, Mr Musk also said he was not ""on weed"" when he controversially tweeted about taking the company private. After the comments from Mr Musk, shares were down 8.8%. The share drop was encouraged by a UBS note predicting Tesla's Model 3 will lose $6,000 per vehicle, as costs soar. The ramping up of production of the electric car company's mass-market Model 3 was one of the reasons why Mr Musk admitted to being overworked and using the sedative Ambien to help sleep, he said in the interview. TheNew York Times,externalinterview also discussed his7 August tweetwhen the CEO said he wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Mr Musk said the price of $420 seemed like ""better karma"" than $419. ""But I was not on weed, to be clear,"" he said, as he also confirmed the tweet was not reviewed by anyone at the electric car company. 4/20 is an infamous term, more common in the US, that refers to the consumption of cannabis. The price of $419 would have represented a 20% premium over Tesla's share price at the time. Musk in the hot seat again Tesla founder playing a dangerous game ""It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419. But I was not on weed, to be clear. ""Weed is not helpful for productivity. There's a reason for the word 'stoned'. You just sit there like a stone on weed,"" Mr Musk, 47, said. He also told the paper that friends had expressed concern that he was exhausted after working 120 hour weeks. ""This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,"" he said. ""It was excruciating."" The paper reported that at times during the interview he stopped speaking, seemingly overcome by emotion - and that he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday on 28 June working. ""All night - no friends, nothing,"" Mr Musk said. Mr Musk also said that he took the sedative Ambien to help him sleep when he was not working: ""It is often a choice of no sleep, or Ambien."" According to the paper, his use of the drug has concerned some board members, who wonder if it affects his late-night tweets. In MayRoseanne Barr blamed Ambien for her tweetthat likened Valerie Jarrett, an African-American former aide to Barack Obama, to an ape. Elon Musk unveils the Tesla Roadster 2 in November His tweet about taking Tesla private sparked a sharp rally in Tesla's share price, but has also prompted scrutiny. London hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who is shorting Tesla stock, has joined a number of analysts disproving of Mr Musk's running of the company. According to Bloomberg, Mr Odey told investors: ""Tesla feels like it is entering the final stage of its life."" Fox Newshas reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)had sent subpoenas to the electric carmaker and was ""ramping up"" its investigation into the tweet. Tesla's directors said: ""There have been many false and irresponsible rumours in the press about the discussions of the Tesla board. ""We would like to make clear that Elon's commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious. ""Over the past 15 years, Elon's leadership of the Tesla team has caused Tesla to grow from a small start-up to having hundreds of thousands of cars on the road that customers love, employing tens of thousands of people around the world, and creating significant shareholder value in the process."" The statement was issued by the board members, excluding Mr Musk, who controls about a fifth of Tesla shares. The board hasset up a committee to evaluate any take-private proposal from Mr Musk, who has said thathe discussed funding a deal with the Saudi Arabiansovereign wealth fund. The New York Times reported that Mr Musk did not intend to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive, but that a search was underway to recruit a deputy. However, he said there was ""no active search"" underway. He added: ""If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job. ""Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.""

"A council is to offer free sanitary products in all its public buildings in a bid to tackle ""period poverty"". North Ayrshire Council said it was the first UK local authority to extend free provision to all libraries, community centres and other public offices. Sanitary products will be offered via vending machines in toilets in up to 100  buildings. The council was already one of the first to introduce free sanitary products in secondary schools. 'Time is right' to end period poverty Ministers urged to lead the way on period poverty UK girls ""too poor"" to afford tampons Since launching that initiative last August, young woman have benefitted from over 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school. Council leader Joe Cullinane said: ""Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice. ""I wish for no women or girl here in North Ayrshire to find themselves in the embarrassing and often degrading situation of having to use improper sanitary protection simply because they cannot afford it. ""After all, periods are not exempt from poverty - they don't take account of what is in your pocket or purse. Therefore, it is absolutely right that we should look at ways in which to tackle this gendered inequality."" Shauna Gauntlett, from Dundee, had experience of period poverty when her son was born. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland radio programme: ""After I had my son I had to rely on friends and family to get me things like sanitary towels. ""We didn't have enough money at that point. We had a few extra bills and I had spent the money I had. ""I had come home from the hospital and my stitches had burst. ""It wasn't a lot of money (for sanitary products) but it was another added expense on to the fact that we didn't really have any groceries or anything at that time."" She added: ""I also remember having problems at school accessing these items because we weren't particularly well-off, and it wasn't a very nice experience."" Poverty campaigner Ewan Gurr said the expense often became a greater issue for women after childbirth. He said: ""We have met mothers who are sometimes paying up to Â£14 and Â£15 for maternity pads. ""It is an added expense. This is an essential item. It is not an added extra and we really need to get it into the hands of the people who need it."" He described the move by North Ayrshire Council to offer free sanitary products in all its public buildings as ""a massive step forward"" and he said it was ""something we need to see right across the 32 local authorities of Scotland"". A recent survey of more than 2,000 people by Young Scot found that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access sanitary products. From this start of this term, the Scottish government is now funding provision of sanitary items at schools and universities. Following a pilot scheme in Aberdeen, it is also funding free availability in some areas to women on low incomes. Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who is currently piloting a member's bill at Holyrood to create a statutory duty for free provision of sanitary products, praised the council for ""leading the way"" on the issue. She said: ""I hope other organisations will follow their lead. No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period."" A consultation on Ms Lennon's bill has attracted the support of 96% of respondents for the proposals to become law.

"The boy hacked Apple because he was a fan of the firm, reports from the court case say A teenage boy from Australia has pleaded guilty to hacking into Apple's network and downloading internal files, according to reports. The 16-year-old accessed 90 gigabytes worth of files, breaking into the system many times over the course of a year from his suburban home in Melbourne,reports The Age newspaper.,external It says he stored the documents in a folder called 'hacky hack hack'. Apple insists that no customer data was compromised. But The Age reports that the boy had accessed customer accounts. In a statement to the BBC, Apple said: ""We vigilantly protect our networks and have dedicated teams of information security professionals that work to detect and respond to threats. ""In this case, our teams discovered the unauthorised access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement. ""We regard the data security of our users as one of our greatest responsibilities and want to assure our customers that at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised."" According to statements made in court, the smartphone giant contacted the FBI when it became aware of the intrusion, and the matter was referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). An AFP raid on the boy's home revealed two laptops with serial numbers matching those of devices which had accessed the system. Police also seized a mobile phone and a hard drive. According to The Age, the teen had boasted about his activities in WhatsApp messages. It reports that he had hacked into the firm because he was a huge fan and dreamed of working there. His defence lawyer said that he had become very well-known in the international hacking community. The boy's name has not been made public for legal reasons.

"Big brands such as Mulberry, Giorgio Armani, Gucci and Prada face losses from the collapse of House of Fraser. Administrators EY released documents showing suppliers owed Â£484m of total debt estimated late on Friday at Â£884m. Among those listed is the warehouse operator at the centre of a dispute with the new owner which has led to the cancellation of all on-line orders. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct boughtthe chain just hours after it went into administration a week ago. Sports Direct is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its Â£90m buyout as their debts were part of the administration. Warehouse operator XPO Logistics is owed Â£30m and stopped processing orders last week because of a payment dispute. After an outcry from customers who had not received goods orders on line, House of Fraser said it would refund customers and also cancel all online orders. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. On Wednesday, House of Fraser took its website offline as deliveries began to back up. XPO operates two warehouses, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, that handle House of Fraser's deliveries to stores as well as customers. The distributor said it had no comment to make when contacted by the BBC. It is among a number of suppliers to have taken action as negotiations over payment continue with the department store chain. The administrators said the total owed was ""subject to change"". Fashion brand Jigsaw has removed stock from its 20 House of Fraser concessions, and Karen Millen - which is owed more than Â£950,000 - is understood to have followed suit. Others are owed even more: Mulberry is out of pocket by Â£2.4m, while All Saints is owed close to Â£1.8m and Giorgio Armani almost Â£1.6m. Sports Direct has said it wants to ""restore the right level of ongoing relationships"" with its brands. Mr Ashley has also vowed to keep most of House of Fraser's 59 stores open. But some customers are angry about the treatment of their orders. One said on Twitter: ""Absolutely disgraceful. Ordered a Â£90 purse last Thursday. Yes a week ago for my daughters birthday. Not 1 email concerning delivery or info and now order cancelled and you say email in a few days!!! Get my money back ASAP."" Another said two-thirds of their husband's suit would not now be delivered. They tweeted: ""This was for our holidays! I don't have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!"" House of Fraser's website has been taken offline Richard Lim of Retail Economics said there were ""kinks to be ironed out"" when big companies change hands, but warned that ""trust and loyalty are hard-won in retail"". He added: ""You would have thought that delivering a great service to customers would have been a priority for the company. ""Delivering goods into the hands of customers now has to be the top priority."" Rob Brice's wife and grandmother on their wedding day Kent-based Rob Brice and his wife were given Â£500 of House of Fraser gift vouchers by his grandmother for their wedding. Last week he placed an online order worth about Â£380. After hearing nothing for five days, he sent an email and was told they were no longer accepting gift cards, meaning ""my leftover value on the card was lost"". Another email said his order was cancelled and the sum would be refunded to the gift card - one he says is now no longer useable. Mr Brice has called House of Fraser but only gets an automated message. Neither has he had a response to emails and tweets. ""I'm going to look to call Trading Standards today to understand my customer rights in the matter, as it is a lot of money to us and would have been to my nan,"" he says. Meanwhile, EY has said there were six bidders for House of Fraser, with four - offering between Â£40m and Â£49m - being dismissed for various reasons. This left two potential names in the frame, with one of the remaining pair offering Â£1 to acquire the group on a solvent basis. This party then later proposed to acquire the business and assets following any insolvency for Â£100m - Â£10m more than what Sports Direct ultimately paid - before withdrawing. Also, EY said there will be Â£600,000, at best, left to pay unsecured creditors but the prospect of any payout is minimal. Q: What will happen to my House of Fraser online order? If items are in stock, shoppers may still receive them. However, customers are being emailed over the next two days to formally cancel pending orders and be refunded in full. Q: Can I return an unwanted item bought online for a refund? Yes. Anyone wanting to return existing purchases will have their statutory rights honoured. Q: What happens to gift vouchers? Customers with a store card should write to Gift Cards, 27 Baker Street, London, W1U 8AH and it will be replaced by one of equivalent value for use in future House of Fraser (but not Sports Direct) stores.

"The US put on a grand military spectacle back in 1991, when troops were celebrating victory in the first Gulf War President Trump's plans for a Veterans Day military parade through the streets of Washington DC have been delayed until at least 2019. Mr Trump was impressed by France's Bastille Day parade on a visit in 2017 and said the US could ""top it"". But figures released on Thursday suggested the event could cost about $90 million (Â£71m) - more than three times the original estimate. Critics had also made comparisons to parades in countries led by autocrats. The parade was originally conceived to mark the centenary of the end of World War One, on 11 November. No tanks, but Trump gets his parade Ex-US defence secretary rains on Trump's military parade A Pentagon spokesperson, Colonel Rob Manning, said in a statement that the Department of Defense and the White House ""have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019"". This video can not be played President Trump at Bastille Day parade The parade's budget director had offered an estimate of between $10m (Â£7.8m) and $30m (Â£23.6m) when the White House announced its request in February. But a US official gave a new estimate of $92m. A memo when the plan was first mooted said no tanks would be used so as not to damage the roads of the nation's capital.

"The US put on a grand military spectacle back in 1991, when troops were celebrating victory in the first Gulf War President Trump's plans for a Veterans Day military parade through the streets of Washington DC have been delayed until at least 2019. Mr Trump was impressed by France's Bastille Day parade on a visit in 2017 and said the US could ""top it"". But figures released on Thursday suggested the event could cost about $90 million (Â£71m) - more than three times the original estimate. Critics had also made comparisons to parades in countries led by autocrats. The parade was originally conceived to mark the centenary of the end of World War One, on 11 November. No tanks, but Trump gets his parade Ex-US defence secretary rains on Trump's military parade A Pentagon spokesperson, Colonel Rob Manning, said in a statement that the Department of Defense and the White House ""have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019"". This video can not be played President Trump at Bastille Day parade The parade's budget director had offered an estimate of between $10m (Â£7.8m) and $30m (Â£23.6m) when the White House announced its request in February. But a US official gave a new estimate of $92m. A memo when the plan was first mooted said no tanks would be used so as not to damage the roads of the nation's capital.

"This video can not be played ""It's your word against God's"" Pope Francis is on the side of victims of more than 300 ""predator"" priests in the US accused of abusing children in one state, the Vatican says. In a statement, it said the Church wanted to listen to the victims to ""root out this tragic horror"". This comes after US prosecutors found that more than 1,000 children had been molested by clergy in Pennsylvania. The US Conference of Catholic Bishop is now calling for an urgent investigation led by the Vatican. Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, the group's president, called the scandal a ""failure of episcopal leadership"". It comes days after the largest-ever probe of Catholic sex abuse in the US. US priests 'abused thousands of children' The report from a Pennsylvania grand jury found that 301 priests abused children in the state over the past 70 years. It also found that some abusers and those that covered up their crimes were later elevated to senior roles in the church. The pope hugs ex-Archbishop Theodore McCarrick during a visit to Washington DC in 2015 Cardinal DiNardo of Texas said in a statement on Thursday - two days after the report was issued - that the church is now ""faced with a spiritual crisis that requires not only spiritual conversion, but practical changes to avoid repeating the sins and failures that are so evident in this recent report"". He said the executive committee of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) had outlined three goals to prevent further abuse, and punish ""predators in the Church and anyone who would conceal them"". The USCCB said it would expand third-party reporting mechanisms that already exist in some dioceses for victims of abuse. It pledged to streamline the complaints process, to make it ""more prompt, fair, and transparent and to specify what constraints may be imposed on bishops at each stage of that process"". This video can not be played The moment a priest's headstone was destroyed in England after he was accused of abuse And the bishops called for a papal representative to investigate allegations of sexual abuse against former Washington DC Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, who resigned last month. He is alleged to have personally abused several boys, including one altar boy 47 years ago. Pope Francis immediately accepted his resignation and ordered him to pray as he awaits a church trial to consider further punishment. The 18-month investigation graphically detailed numerous instances of Catholic clergy members raping and molesting children in several Pennsylvania dioceses, which in total represent about 1.7 million Catholics. ""Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all,"" the 1,300-page report found. This video can not be played Catholic sex abuse in Australia: 'Guilty priest ignored my story for decades' The horrific allegations include: One priest forced a nine-year-old boy to rinse out his mouth with holy water after abusing him. A boy was made to confess his sins to the priest who had abused him. A priest who was accused of abuse by three boys was later hired by Disney World after receiving a positive job reference from the church. A priest raped a seven-year-girl when he visited her in hospital after she had her tonsils out. One child was made to pose naked, like Christ on the crucifix, as priests photographed him. Priests gave that boy a gold chain with a cross so that other predator priests would know he had been abused. Repeated abuse by a priest left one boy with lasting back injuries. He became addicted to painkillers and died of an overdose.

"The alleged ""Trojan Horse"" plot was to oust some Birmingham head teachers and make their schools adhere to more conservative Islamic principles Misconduct hearings - most of which collapsed - against teachers accused in the so-called ""Trojan Horse"" inquiry cost Â£884,055, the BBC can reveal. The case to ban from education the ex-chair of governors for three Birmingham schools that were investigated, Tahir Alam, also cost Â£387,444 in legal fees. Witness statements from a prior inquiry had been ""deliberately withheld"" before the hearings were dropped in May 2017. The government said it made ""no apology for working to protect young people"". The BBC has fought a Freedom of Information battle since April 2017 to reveal the costs, which succeeded when the independent data watchdog The Information Commissioner's Officeordered the Department for Education (DfE) to release the information,externalafter backing the corporation's public interest arguments. The only teacher who was sanctioned - out of 14 against whom the DfE pursued hearings - was the former acting head teacher of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath, Jahangir Akbar. Banned governor Mr Alam said the cases were a ""total waste of public money"" that achieved little. More stories from Midlands Live Tahir Alam was chairman of governors at Park View School in Birmingham from 1997-2014 Several schools in Birmingham were investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to control them, known as the Trojan Horse affair, which began in 2014. The teachers' hearings stemmed from that investigation but were dropped when the professional conduct panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) found its own organisation withheld 25 statements that had been used in anan earlier inquiry led by former counter-terror boss Peter Clarke. The DfE said it was ""looking carefully"" at the handling of the cases, which were ""led by an external law firm"". The teachers were not permitted to work while the hearings, which began in 2015, were ongoing. Lawyers for two of the accused teachers, Monzoor Hussain and Lindsey Clark, had issued separate statements when the hearings were dropped saying both parties were relieved. The inquiry has ""caused long-term damage"" and ""divided communities"" in Birmingham,according to the co-author of a play about it, Helen Monks. The alleged plot caused such outrage because the accusation centred on the claim children were being fed a one-sided education and view of the world. Ironically the hearings collapsed when the NCTL - which has since been replaced by the Teaching Regulation Agency - found it had not presented the whole picture of the accusations to the lawyers who were trying to defend the accused teachers' reputations and careers. Mr Alam said he was depicted as an ""anti-state enemy"" during the affair and questioned what the inquiry achieved. ""It was completely unnecessary. Why did they put a banning order on me? I was a volunteer while I was a governor. No school had to appoint me,"" Mr Alam added. He said GCSE marks at the schools where he was chair of governors had declined since the affair. Trojan Horse play aims to crack 'assumed truth' 'Trojan Horse school ruling hush 'exceptional' 'Christmas ban' teacher case not proven Mr Alam - who was a former Ofsted inspector, governance trainer for Birmingham City Council and school consultant - said the process had damaged his reputation, career and friendships. ""It was stressful. It's hit me economically. I can't do what I love doing. I spent 20 years building my skills. ""Within the Muslim community, people who've always known me, regard me as a hero overall. ""But from people within the education fraternity, I'm cut off. People don't want to associate with me because they think it will harm their careers."" The DfE said Mr Alam had been identified in Mr Clarke's report as the ""central figure in these cases"". It said: ""We have taken strong action and continue to act to prevent extremism from gaining a foothold in our schools - in Birmingham and across the country."" Nansen Primary School in Birmingham was one of 21 schools inspected by Ofsted following the ""Trojan Horse"" allegations The five former senior teachers who had been grouped together in one hearing before the process was halted were: Razwan Faraz, former deputy head teacher at Nansen Primary Arshad Hussain, assistant head teacher at Park View Hardeep Saini, former head teacher at Golden Hillock Lindsey Clark, executive head teacher at Park View Monzoor Hussain, former head teacher at Park View Those five had all worked for the former Park View Educational Trust, which oversaw the running of several schools in Birmingham implicated in the original allegations, including Park View, Golden Hillock and Nansen Primary. Arshad Malik said Park View went from ""underachieving"" to ""overachieving"" in the decade before the ""Trojan Horse"" affair Lifetime bans handed to two other Park View teachers, Inamulhaq Anwar and Akeel Ahmed,had earlier been quashed. Mr Alam had been chair of governors at that trustbut was banned from involvement in schools, which was upheld on appeal in April 2018. The tribunal then concluded ""the Appellant [Mr Alam]... took no adequate steps to ensure that children were kept safe from extremist views"". Arshad Malik, who decided not to move his then 14-year-old son Imran from Park View to a different school when the affair began, said the school's staff had ""been decimated"" after ""teachers left or were 'forced to leave' and new teachers had not wanted to come"". He said he had to ""supplement"" Imran's education by helping him at home himself and he believed there was a lot of ""mistrust"" in communities since. Former acting head teacher of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath, Mr Akbar, wasbanned from teaching in all schools indefinitelyafter being accused of trying to ""eliminate"" the celebration of Christmas in school and ""undermining tolerance"" of other beliefs. Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, head teacher of Anderton Park Primary School in Sparkhill, said some of the legacy of the inquiry was healthy in prompting schools to teach more about the equality of the sexes, British values and law. Park View was later renamed Rockwood Academy The saga centred onthe emergence of an anonymous letter in 2014giving details of an alleged plot to oust some Birmingham head teachers and make their schools adhere to more conservative Islamic principles. It stated parents could be encouraged to turn against the leadership team if they were told the school was ""corrupting their children with sex education, teaching about homosexuals, making their children pray Christian prayers and [carrying out] mixed swimming and sport"". There were five subsequent inquires. The Clarke report found no evidence of extremism but said ""there are a number of people in a position of influence who either espouse, or sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views"". The NCTL later pursued disciplinary hearings against 14 teachers, accusing them of professional misconduct. Park View was later renamed Rockwood Academy, while Golden Hillock became Ark Boulton Academy.

"One of the four boys injured remains in a serious condition in hospital Two men have been killed and four boys hurt in separate stabbings across London. The four boys, aged between 15 and 16, were attacked outside Landor House on the Elmington Estate in Camberwell on Thursday evening, police said. A 42-year-old man died after he was found with stab wounds at an address in Flaxen Road, Chingford, at about 04:40 BST on Friday. Hours later, a man in his 50s was found dead at a home in Walworth. One of the boys, who was in a critical condition after the Camberwell attack, is now said to be in a serious but stable condition. A 15-year-old boy was charged with possession of a bladed article and possession of cannabis following the incident on Thursday. He was bailed to appear at Camberwell Youth Court on 5 September. Five other boys, aged between 15 and 16 and held on suspicion of violent disorder and grievous bodily harm, were bailed to return to a south London police station in mid-September. An eyewitness described seeing one boy with severe wounds to his abdomen. He was seen running around the corner of the building before dropping to the ground. Witnesses said they heard a teenager shouting ""help, help"" before police arrived at about 17:30 BST. One local mother, who did not want to be named, said she saw a boy carrying a blade more than a foot long. ""I could see the knife in his hand, I could clearly see the blade, it was big and that was worrying me,"" she added. ""My little boy is growing up around here, it's terrifying."" Another woman said she saw ""lots of blood"" and a ""massive"" knife on the ground after the violence. One witness said she saw a lot of blood and a huge knife at the scene on the Elmington Estate A 16-year-old boy and a 35-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of murder over the death in Flaxen Road, Waltham Forest. The man found injured died at the scene 05:22. His next of kin have been informed, police said. A Met spokesman said officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murder investigation. The second fatal stabbing victim of the day was found at about 14:00 at a home in Madron Street, Walworth, about a mile from the Elmington Estate. A crime scene is in place and inquiries continue. Six people have been arrested in connection with the attack on the housing estate The Camberwell stabbing on Thursday was one of many violent attacks in the neighbourhood in less than four months. In July a 17-year-old girl wasknifed to death in Brisbane Street, a five-minute walk from Landor House. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Bartonwas found with fatal gunshot wounds on Warham Street in May, while his friendSidique Kamara was stabbed to death on the same street on 1 August. Harriet Harman, Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham, toldBBC Radio London: ""It's absolutely dismaying that this has happened again. ""Not only is this really a tragedy for the families, when young men, so young, are involved in this sort of crime... But it creates real shock in the local community.""

"A ban on the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes has been announced by US President Donald Trump, after a number of vaping-related deaths. So, how much is being spent on e-cigarettes, and how safe are they? According to theWorld Health Organization,external, there has been a small but steady decrease in the estimated number of smokers globally, to just over one billion. But it's a different matter when it comes to vaping. The number of vapers has been increasing rapidly - from about seven million in 2011 to 41 million in 2018. Market research group Euromonitor estimates that the number of adults who vape will reach almost 55 million by 2021. The e-cigarette market is expanding, as the number of vapers rises. The global market is now estimated to be worth $19.3bn (Â£15.5bn) - up from $6.9bn (Â£5.5bn) just five years ago. The United States, United Kingdom and France are the biggest markets. Vapers in the three countries spent more than $10bn (Â£8bn) on smokeless tobacco and vaping products in 2018. The White House recently announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would finalise aplan to stop the sale of all non-tobacco flavoursin the world's biggest vaping market. This follows six deaths and 450 reported cases of lung illness linked to vaping across 33 US states. There are two main types of e-cigarette - open and closed system, also known as open and closed tank. In an open system, the liquid that is vapourised can be refilled manually by the user. There is also a removable mouthpiece. Closed system e-cigarettes use ready-made refills, which screw directly on to the e-cigarette's battery. It is reckoned that this year, vapers will spend an estimated $10bn (Â£8bn) on closed system e-cigarettes, overtaking the spend on open system e-cigarettes for the first time. Most e-cigarette users buy their devices in specialist shops, according to a 2016report published by Ernst & Young,external. It's thought that consumers might make their first e-cigarette purchase in person, to build familiarity with a relatively new product, or to seek advice on which type of device might suit them best. Vaping shops have become more common in the UK, with69 new stores opening,externalon High Streets in the first half of 2019 alone. Another survey of 3,000 users by Kantar for Ernst & Young, suggested that 21% had bought their devices online. In the US, Michigan has become the first state to ban flavoured e-cigarettes, following the reports of deaths and lung illness. Those affected had an average age of 19. However,doctors, public health experts and cancer charitiesin the UK agree that, based on current evidence, e-cigarettes carry a fraction of the risk of cigarettes. One independent review concluded vaping was about 95% less harmful than smoking. Professor Ann McNeill, who wrote the review, said ""e-cigarettes could be a game changer in public health"". The UK has much tighter rules on the content of vape pens than other countries like the US. Nicotine content is capped, for example, whereas it isn't in the US. But, e-cigarettes can still contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, although at much lower levels.

"This video can not be played Rory Stewart: Judge me on my record in 12 months time Prisons minister Rory Stewart says he will resign in a year if he hasn't managed to reduce drugs and violence levels in 10 target jails in England. He made the promise as the government announced Â£10m to improve security and conditions at the jails. New body scanners and sniffer dogs are to be introduced in the prisons, which are described as ""challenging"", in a clampdown on drugs and mobile phones. The dogs have been trained to detect psychoactive substances such as Spice. Ministers also want to raise standards of leadership by sending prison governors to military-style colleges. And there will be a programme of repairs and improvements to cell windows and perimeter security in the prisons. Spice 'causing huge problems' in prisons Allow boxing in prisons, expert says Speaking to the BBC, Mr Stewart said: ""I believe in the prison service, I believe in our prison offices, I believe this can be turned around."" ""I want you to judge me on those results and I will resign if I don't succeed."" He added that he expected to be judged on whether there had been a ""substantial"" reduction in the number of assaults. Asked how much of a reduction he would consider a success - 25% or 10% - Mr Stewart said it would be ""something of that sort"". BBC Reality Check Last year there were more than 3,500 assaults in the 10 prisons that the Ministry of Justice is targeting. That was an increase of 15% on the previous year and more than double the  number of assaults that took place in 2014. Based on the results of mandatory tests on prisoners, drug use in the 10 targeted prisons increased slightly last year. Despite the rise, drug use in these jails is very close to the average for all prisons in England and Wales - with just under 10% of random drug tests proving positive. The new measures are being targeted at 10 jails which the Ministry of Justice says have  ""acute problems"" with high drug use, violence and building issues. They are: Hull - Category B Humber, East Riding of Yorkshire - Category C Leeds - Category B Lindholme, near Doncaster - Category C/D Moorland, Hatfield Woodhouse, South Yorkshire - Category C Wealstun, near Wetherby, West Yorkshire - Category C Nottingham - Category B Ranby, Nottinghamshire - Category C Wormwood Scrubs, west London - Category B Isis, south-east London - Category C It comes after figurespublished by the Ministry of Justice last month,externalshowed incidents of self-harm and assaults in prisons were at record levels. Seizures of smuggled-in drugs and mobile phones also rose by 23% and 15% respectively in the year to March. This video can not be played Ben, who has served five years inside HMP Oakwood, has become a mentor to other prisoners Mr Stewart said the changes would pave the way for a ""new ethos and new direction"" for prisons, saying: ""It is vital we set challenging standards so prisons are places where offenders can turn their lives around. ""We need to make these prisons calmer, more orderly places and in the end that comes down to challenging and managing prisoners consistently, firmly and fairly."" By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent While much of Whitehall is on holiday, the Ministry of Justice has been busy - taking advantage of the sleepy summer news agenda with a series of press releases about prison reform. The announcements have included a report on sport in prison, a pilot scheme to promote community sentences and plans for in-cell telephones. The latest measures - Â£10m for the 10 most challenging prisons - will certainly make a difference. X-ray scanners, for example, are highly effective at detecting drugs - it's just a wonder it's taken so long for them to be introduced. The energetic prisons minister Rory Stewart, who has immersed himself in the brief since he was appointed, is right to point out that the key to a stable prison is leadership. But his idea to raise standards among governors, with a military-style training college, will take time to yield results. Of the Â£10m investment, Â£6m is being earmarked for security measures, Â£3m for the repairs and Â£1m for training. The Ministry of Defence has been contacted for help in setting up a training scheme for prison governors, similar to that for senior members of the armed forces. Wormwood Scrubs, Hull, Lindholme and Nottingham (Clockwise from top left) are among the 10 prisons to benefit However, the Prison Reform Trust said the problems in the jails were caused by a failure to match resources to demand. Its director, Peter Dawson, said: ""It was a catastrophic failure to provide that balance which caused the collapse of prison safety after 2012 - trying to tell governors how to run prisons is not going to put it right."" Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, welcomed the extra funding but said ""the devil will be in the detail"". Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said the government must go ""much further"" and set out an emergency plan across the prisons estate with substantial new funding to put an end to this crisis and make our prisons safe and humane for staff and inmates"". There are about 84,000 inmates in more than 100 prisons, across England and Wales.

For Daniella Adeluwoye, from London, the news that she has attained a place at the University of Cambridge to study human, social and political science has brought both elation and trepidation. ""I am ecstatic. I'm really worried though,"" she told the BBC.

"Catherine Sezen (L), a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges and Helena Poole (R), editor of Which? University, are ready to answer your questions For those of you whose A-level results were not what you expected, we have experts ready to provide advice. There is still time to find a university place through clearing or perhaps opt for a completely different path into a career if your results were not what you needed - or maybe you have a decision to make if you managed to achieve better results than predicted. Cath Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, and Helena Poole, editor of Which? University, are on hand to offer personalised advice on what to do. Teenagers achieve rise in top A-level grades Why clearing is 'not the end of the world' What was new about this year's exams? I received a call from Leeds University medical school, who suggested that because my grades were higher than expected I should apply to them through clearing and drop my existing offer of a place to do biomedicine at Manchester. My teacher helped me verify that the call was genuine but when I rang Leeds they said my grades were not in fact high enough, which means I have now lost both places. What can I do? Oliver Hi Oliver, First of all well done on achieving such good grades. I would suggest that you contact Leeds University admissions and explain what you have explained here. Perhaps your teacher would be able to help you make the call. It would be helpful if you had the name of the caller and/or the time of the call. I would also suggest contacting Manchester and explaining what happened too. Don't panic, perhaps there has been a mix-up and it always pays to check again. I am sure you will find a place and will go on to do really well in your chosen career.Cath I'm sorry to hear this, especially since you've done better than expected and should be celebrating. This is very strange. You should get back in touch with Leeds, if necessary, someone higher up the pecking order, and explain the situation. It sounds like there has been a miscommunication somewhere and you've unfortunately caught the short end of the stick, especially since they contacted you and you have achieved their entry requirements. Verify what these are on Ucas or the uni's website. Do you have anything in writing, maybe an email, that illustrates what you were told on the phone, or the name, department or position of the person who spoke to you? This will be handy to have when you get in touch. With clearing calls, it's up to students to pick up the phone; but in this case, you may like to ask a parent or family member to phone on your behalf if you'd prefer, but stay close by if they want to speak to you. Also, get in touch with Manchester and explain the situation. Given that they originally accepted you, and the exceptional circumstances, we would hope they would understand the situation and offer your place back, although this may depend on numbers and places. For anyone achieving higher grades and contemplating choosing a different uni with higher entry grades, we would always recommend taking a step back and deciding if it's the best choice for you. Don't be swayed by a course just because it has higher entry grades, consider if it's ultimately right for you. We really hope this gets resolved and you can get back to celebrating soon.Helena My son was holding a place for Bristol on an offer of AAB. He achieved A*BB. Both amount to the same Ucas tariff points (136) but his offer to Bristol has been declined as he did not ""meet the exact terms of the offer"". So, does this mean if he'd got AAA, he would have been rejected? Of course not. The course is not in clearing but he was applying for a deferred place to 2019 in any event. Any suggestions? Robert First of all congratulations to your son.  A*BB is a good set of results.  I would suggest that you or your son contact Bristol again and explain he is looking for a deferred place for next year and find out what they would be able to offer for next year. Bristol is very competitive and they may require him to retake one of his A-levels. But if that is the course he wants, it might be the best solution.  On the other hand, there may well be another university that would have a course that would be right for your son. The results he has will stand him in good stead for success whether it is at Bristol or another university.Cath Sorry to hear that your son was not accepted to his first choice of uni. While it's frustrating because the Ucas points are the same, unfortunately some universities can get quite specific about achieving certain grades in certain subjects. That being said, if you haven't already, it might be worth him speaking to someone at Bristol to double check if there's any leeway. Since he's deferring his place, he can reapply to universities for 2019 with A*AB grades and could potentially secure a guaranteed offer because he already has his results. If he's dead set on this specific university and the grade requirements are the same in 2019, he has the option to resit some exams next year. It's also worth checking that the 2019 course grade requirements haven't changed from the 2018 ones.Helena I am currently abroad but according to Ucas Track I did not meet the grades for medicine or biomedical sciences at King's College London. I really want to study medicine and don't want to take a gap year, but maybe I should retake and reapply next year. Is it possibly to apply for medicine through clearing? Maham Hi Maham, You must be feeling a bit disappointed but there are options available to you. Clearing,externaldoesn't usually offer medicine courses but I'vehad a quick check of the live vacancies,externaland there are some medicine courses listed on there. If any of these interest you, you'll want to call up your school and check exactly what grades you got, to see if you meet the entry requirements for the clearing courses. Competitive courses can get snapped up quickly so try and move fast, but be sure to check the course is what you're looking for before jumping in and accepting an offer. If you go for this option you will need to phone the number on the clearing page and be ready to talk through why you want to study that course in particular. If you don't find anything you want, you may want to consider taking a Biomedical Science course through clearing and converting to medicine as a postgrad degree. If you decide Clearing is not for you, then retaking your exams may be an option but, because medicine is such a competitive degree, you should check with the universities you're interested in to see what their view is on retakes. We always recommend students are around when receiving their A-level results but, since you're abroad, you should definitely call up your school or college and chat through your options with them too.Helena I am sorry to hear you didn't get the grades you needed for your first choice course. If you are not sure of your results I would suggest the first step is to contact your school or college to confirm exactly what you got. There may be options through clearing, but take your time and make sure any places you are offered are what you really want. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the options available to you too, so I would suggest you start there.  I am sure you will find an option that's right for you.Cath My results are higher than expected. I had accepted a place at Teesside but now have the choice to go to a different university to do the same course. Would it be better to change? Melanie Hi Melanie, Well done on your results. Take a little time to think about your options.  You can have a look to see if there are any places available at other universitiesthrough the adjustment process.,externalLook through the opportunities available and talk it through with someone. Consider the pros and cons of your current option and any new options. Good luck! I am sure you will come to the best decision for you and your career plans.Cath Hi Melanie, Congratulations on achieving brilliant results. You have the option toapply for a new uni place through UCAS adjustment,externalbut whether you do this is entirely a personal decision. Just because you can, does not necessarily mean you should. Most likely you've already researched your confirmed choice of uni and visited it on an open day, so you have probably put a lot of thought into this course already. If you haven't gone into school, I would suggest going in and chatting through your options with a teacher or careers adviser.Research the new uni course,externalas much as you can and, if possible try to visit the university or city this weekend. Some unis will have open days the weekend after results day. Bear in mind you have five days from results day to use adjustment, so you have to act fairly quickly, but try not to panic and rush a decision where you're not fully informed. Best of luck!Helena All students in my son's class were projected As or Bs in music A-level but received Cs and Ds. Given that everyone failed to reach projected grades suggests that something is wrong somewhere. Is there a process available that would allow us to question the marking? Peter Hi Peter, I am sorry to hear that your son's result in music wasn't what he expected. Your son's school or college will be best placed to advise you on a review of marking. If all the results were not what they were expecting, they may already be looking at this. I hope that this result doesn't impact on your son's plans and wish him well for his future.Cath Your son should speak to his schoolabout appealing against his grade, based on the results he's achieved,externaland his future aspirations. Inquiries can take a few different forms, from a clerical recheck to access to scripts. The school will be able to pursue this further on his behalf, should appealing be deemed the best step forward.Helena Basically I have failed biology and chemistry. I heard I might be able to retake in November. Is this true? Umar, London Hello!  I am sorry to hear that your results didn't go the way you had planned.  I would suggest that you contact your school or college about retake opportunities. They will be best placed to advise on retaking your exams and on any other options available to you to help you achieve your career aims.Cath Sorry to hear you didn't get the results you were hoping for. If you haven't already, I would recommend going into your school or college and talking to your teachers or careers advisers. Under the new A-level system, retakes occur at the following May or June, but your school should be able to confirm this depending on their retakes policy. If you want to understand more about what options you have after failing an exam, take a look at our advice guide.Helena The exams were taken in May and June I have received my A-level results for biology, chemistry and maths and my grades are AAB instead of the A*A*A I had been predicted. I would really like to see my papers or order a review. What would you advise me to do? Abdi Sorry to hear you haven't got the results you wanted, but try not to panic. If you would like to appeal against any of your grades, you'll need to speak to your school about this. For example, a careers adviser or the head of your department or sixth form. They'll be able to discuss your options in light of your results to help you figure out the best next steps, and if necessary action an appeal for you. It's not something you can do on your own. Take a look at Which? University's full guide to appealing against an A-level grade,externalfor more information around this. In the meantime, see if there are any courses in clearing which meet the grades you have achieved. There may be a vacant spot at a uni for the same, or similar, course, that is right for you.Helena Hello! First of all well done! AAB are very good results. If you would like to see your papers or order a review I would suggest that you contact your school or college. They will be best placed to advise you on the next steps. In the meantime, good luck in your future plans.Cath I did not achieve my predicted A-level grades. I got BBC instead of ABB which I needed. So I didn't get into my first choice university. I have been accepted into my second choice for a foundation year but I am quite disappointed. I was wondering whether I could switch from foundation to a better university or if retaking one A-level, which is what I am most keen on, would be better. Tash Hi Tash, These are good results, so well done. Take time to consider your options. You might want to speak to a careers adviser at your school or college. They will be able to advise about the retake option. You can also look atopportunities through clearing.,externalGood luck and don't rush to make a decision.Cath The thing about making a university your first or insurance choice is that you're making a commitment to go there should you get the grades for it. However, that doesn't mean you'll be dragged, kicking and screaming, to take it. You'll need to contact your insurance choice and ask them to formally release you, so youcan enter clearing to find an alternative.,externalGet on the phone to them, with your Ucas ID, and have a cup of tea handy in case you need to wait on the line, and speak to them about it. Regarding retaking an A-level, it's best to discuss this with your school - for example, a careers adviser, or head of department or sixth form. They know you best and can properly advise you based on what grades you've achieved and what you're hoping to go on to do, plus they'll have been through this many times before and will have policies on resits in place.Helena A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades Why clearing 'is not the end of the world"" What was new about this year's A-levels?

"Thousands of teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their A and AS-level results. There have been some changes to A-level qualifications recently - the BBC News website sets them out. New AS and A-level syllabuses have been phased in across schools in England since September 2015. The change wasbrought in by the then education secretary Michael Govewith the intention of making the exams more ""fit for purpose"" - in other words, harder. Under the new system, students sit all A-level exams at the end of two years of study, instead of taking modular exams throughout the course, as they had done in previous years. AS-level results no longer count towards A-level grades and levels of coursework have been reduced, with  most courses assessed entirely through exams. Resits will still be available, but January exams have been scrapped, so students will have to wait until May/June of the following year for a chance to improve their grades. In a nutshell, they're on the way out - in England at least. The AS-level has been decoupled from the A-level, which means it operates as a stand-alone qualification and the results do not count towards A-level grades - although in Wales and Northern Ireland, they will still count towards an overall A-level mark. Since this decoupling, the number of entries for AS subjects has fallen dramatically. Provisional figures,externalfrom the Department for Education show that the number of entries for AS subjects fell by almost 60% from 659,880 in 2017 to 269,090 in 2018. This continues the trend which was seen in 2016 and 2017. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said the changes had ""sounded the death knell for AS-levels"". ""The great benefit of the old system was that it gave students a broader range of knowledge and allowed them to keep their options open for longer,"" he said. ""The decision to decouple these qualifications was an entirely unnecessary reform, which is narrowing the curriculum and reducing student choice."" A-level results 2018: Rise in top grades 'Clearing? It's not the end of the world' Yes, that's right. The changes are being phased in over a period of four years. In summer 2017,Year 13s took the new examsin: art and design biology business chemistry computer science economics English language English language and literature English literature history physics psychology sociology This summer, 2018, new A-level exams were taken in: ancient languages (classical Greek, Latin) dance drama and theatre geography modern foreign languages (French, German, Spanish) music physical education religious studies Next summer, 2019, candidates will sit the new A-level qualifications in the following subjects: accounting ancient history classical civilisation design and technology electronics environmental science film studies further mathematics geology government and politics history of art (A-level only) law mathematics media studies modern foreign languages (Chinese, Italian, Russian) music technology philosophy statistics And, in summer 2020, new exams will be taken in: ancient languages modern foreign languages (Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Greek, Japanese, modern Hebrew, Panjabi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Turkish, Urdu) There have been no major changes in the other nations. In Wales and Northern Ireland, AS-levels have remained an integral part of studying for A-levels. In Wales A-levels have also been updated. AS-levels contribute 40% of the total marks of the full A-level and can be taken at the end of the AS course or alongside A2. In Scotland, students do not sit A-levels and AS-levels. Instead, they take Highers and Advanced Highers. This year, there were 147,000 Higher passes, with a pass rate of 76.8% - down slightly from 77% last year.

"The alleged ""Trojan Horse"" plot was to oust some Birmingham head teachers and make their schools adhere to more conservative Islamic principles Misconduct hearings - most of which collapsed - against teachers accused in the so-called ""Trojan Horse"" inquiry cost Â£884,055, the BBC can reveal. The case to ban from education the ex-chair of governors for three Birmingham schools that were investigated, Tahir Alam, also cost Â£387,444 in legal fees. Witness statements from a prior inquiry had been ""deliberately withheld"" before the hearings were dropped in May 2017. The government said it made ""no apology for working to protect young people"". The BBC has fought a Freedom of Information battle since April 2017 to reveal the costs, which succeeded when the independent data watchdog The Information Commissioner's Officeordered the Department for Education (DfE) to release the information,externalafter backing the corporation's public interest arguments. The only teacher who was sanctioned - out of 14 against whom the DfE pursued hearings - was the former acting head teacher of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath, Jahangir Akbar. Banned governor Mr Alam said the cases were a ""total waste of public money"" that achieved little. More stories from Midlands Live Tahir Alam was chairman of governors at Park View School in Birmingham from 1997-2014 Several schools in Birmingham were investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to control them, known as the Trojan Horse affair, which began in 2014. The teachers' hearings stemmed from that investigation but were dropped when the professional conduct panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) found its own organisation withheld 25 statements that had been used in anan earlier inquiry led by former counter-terror boss Peter Clarke. The DfE said it was ""looking carefully"" at the handling of the cases, which were ""led by an external law firm"". The teachers were not permitted to work while the hearings, which began in 2015, were ongoing. Lawyers for two of the accused teachers, Monzoor Hussain and Lindsey Clark, had issued separate statements when the hearings were dropped saying both parties were relieved. The inquiry has ""caused long-term damage"" and ""divided communities"" in Birmingham,according to the co-author of a play about it, Helen Monks. The alleged plot caused such outrage because the accusation centred on the claim children were being fed a one-sided education and view of the world. Ironically the hearings collapsed when the NCTL - which has since been replaced by the Teaching Regulation Agency - found it had not presented the whole picture of the accusations to the lawyers who were trying to defend the accused teachers' reputations and careers. Mr Alam said he was depicted as an ""anti-state enemy"" during the affair and questioned what the inquiry achieved. ""It was completely unnecessary. Why did they put a banning order on me? I was a volunteer while I was a governor. No school had to appoint me,"" Mr Alam added. He said GCSE marks at the schools where he was chair of governors had declined since the affair. Trojan Horse play aims to crack 'assumed truth' 'Trojan Horse school ruling hush 'exceptional' 'Christmas ban' teacher case not proven Mr Alam - who was a former Ofsted inspector, governance trainer for Birmingham City Council and school consultant - said the process had damaged his reputation, career and friendships. ""It was stressful. It's hit me economically. I can't do what I love doing. I spent 20 years building my skills. ""Within the Muslim community, people who've always known me, regard me as a hero overall. ""But from people within the education fraternity, I'm cut off. People don't want to associate with me because they think it will harm their careers."" The DfE said Mr Alam had been identified in Mr Clarke's report as the ""central figure in these cases"". It said: ""We have taken strong action and continue to act to prevent extremism from gaining a foothold in our schools - in Birmingham and across the country."" Nansen Primary School in Birmingham was one of 21 schools inspected by Ofsted following the ""Trojan Horse"" allegations The five former senior teachers who had been grouped together in one hearing before the process was halted were: Razwan Faraz, former deputy head teacher at Nansen Primary Arshad Hussain, assistant head teacher at Park View Hardeep Saini, former head teacher at Golden Hillock Lindsey Clark, executive head teacher at Park View Monzoor Hussain, former head teacher at Park View Those five had all worked for the former Park View Educational Trust, which oversaw the running of several schools in Birmingham implicated in the original allegations, including Park View, Golden Hillock and Nansen Primary. Arshad Malik said Park View went from ""underachieving"" to ""overachieving"" in the decade before the ""Trojan Horse"" affair Lifetime bans handed to two other Park View teachers, Inamulhaq Anwar and Akeel Ahmed,had earlier been quashed. Mr Alam had been chair of governors at that trustbut was banned from involvement in schools, which was upheld on appeal in April 2018. The tribunal then concluded ""the Appellant [Mr Alam]... took no adequate steps to ensure that children were kept safe from extremist views"". Arshad Malik, who decided not to move his then 14-year-old son Imran from Park View to a different school when the affair began, said the school's staff had ""been decimated"" after ""teachers left or were 'forced to leave' and new teachers had not wanted to come"". He said he had to ""supplement"" Imran's education by helping him at home himself and he believed there was a lot of ""mistrust"" in communities since. Former acting head teacher of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath, Mr Akbar, wasbanned from teaching in all schools indefinitelyafter being accused of trying to ""eliminate"" the celebration of Christmas in school and ""undermining tolerance"" of other beliefs. Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, head teacher of Anderton Park Primary School in Sparkhill, said some of the legacy of the inquiry was healthy in prompting schools to teach more about the equality of the sexes, British values and law. Park View was later renamed Rockwood Academy The saga centred onthe emergence of an anonymous letter in 2014giving details of an alleged plot to oust some Birmingham head teachers and make their schools adhere to more conservative Islamic principles. It stated parents could be encouraged to turn against the leadership team if they were told the school was ""corrupting their children with sex education, teaching about homosexuals, making their children pray Christian prayers and [carrying out] mixed swimming and sport"". There were five subsequent inquires. The Clarke report found no evidence of extremism but said ""there are a number of people in a position of influence who either espouse, or sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views"". The NCTL later pursued disciplinary hearings against 14 teachers, accusing them of professional misconduct. Park View was later renamed Rockwood Academy, while Golden Hillock became Ark Boulton Academy.

"The US put on a grand military spectacle back in 1991, when troops were celebrating victory in the first Gulf War President Trump's plans for a Veterans Day military parade through the streets of Washington DC have been delayed until at least 2019. Mr Trump was impressed by France's Bastille Day parade on a visit in 2017 and said the US could ""top it"". But figures released on Thursday suggested the event could cost about $90 million (Â£71m) - more than three times the original estimate. Critics had also made comparisons to parades in countries led by autocrats. The parade was originally conceived to mark the centenary of the end of World War One, on 11 November. No tanks, but Trump gets his parade Ex-US defence secretary rains on Trump's military parade A Pentagon spokesperson, Colonel Rob Manning, said in a statement that the Department of Defense and the White House ""have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019"". This video can not be played President Trump at Bastille Day parade The parade's budget director had offered an estimate of between $10m (Â£7.8m) and $30m (Â£23.6m) when the White House announced its request in February. But a US official gave a new estimate of $92m. A memo when the plan was first mooted said no tanks would be used so as not to damage the roads of the nation's capital. The city's governing District of Columbia Council was critical of the plan when announced, voicing its displeasure on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The Pentagon said the military would march from the White House to the Capitol, and the parade would feature a ""heavy air component at the end"".

"This video can not be played Rory Stewart: Judge me on my record in 12 months time Prisons minister Rory Stewart says he will resign in a year if he hasn't managed to reduce drugs and violence levels in 10 target jails in England. He made the promise as the government announced Â£10m to improve security and conditions at the jails. New body scanners and sniffer dogs are to be introduced in the prisons, which are described as ""challenging"", in a clampdown on drugs and mobile phones. The dogs have been trained to detect psychoactive substances such as Spice. Ministers also want to raise standards of leadership by sending prison governors to military-style colleges. And there will be a programme of repairs and improvements to cell windows and perimeter security in the prisons. Spice 'causing huge problems' in prisons Allow boxing in prisons, expert says Speaking to the BBC, Mr Stewart said: ""I believe in the prison service, I believe in our prison offices, I believe this can be turned around."" ""I want you to judge me on those results and I will resign if I don't succeed."" He added that he expected to be judged on whether there had been a ""substantial"" reduction in the number of assaults. Asked how much of a reduction he would consider a success - 25% or 10% - Mr Stewart said it would be ""something of that sort"". BBC Reality Check Last year there were more than 3,500 assaults in the 10 prisons that the Ministry of Justice is targeting. That was an increase of 15% on the previous year and more than double the  number of assaults that took place in 2014. Based on the results of mandatory tests on prisoners, drug use in the 10 targeted prisons increased slightly last year. Despite the rise, drug use in these jails is very close to the average for all prisons in England and Wales - with just under 10% of random drug tests proving positive. The new measures are being targeted at 10 jails which the Ministry of Justice says have  ""acute problems"" with high drug use, violence and building issues. They are: Hull - Category B Humber, East Riding of Yorkshire - Category C Leeds - Category B Lindholme, near Doncaster - Category C/D Moorland, Hatfield Woodhouse, South Yorkshire - Category C Wealstun, near Wetherby, West Yorkshire - Category C Nottingham - Category B Ranby, Nottinghamshire - Category C Wormwood Scrubs, west London - Category B Isis, south-east London - Category C It comes after figurespublished by the Ministry of Justice last month,externalshowed incidents of self-harm and assaults in prisons were at record levels. Seizures of smuggled-in drugs and mobile phones also rose by 23% and 15% respectively in the year to March. This video can not be played Ben, who has served five years inside HMP Oakwood, has become a mentor to other prisoners Mr Stewart said the changes would pave the way for a ""new ethos and new direction"" for prisons, saying: ""It is vital we set challenging standards so prisons are places where offenders can turn their lives around. ""We need to make these prisons calmer, more orderly places and in the end that comes down to challenging and managing prisoners consistently, firmly and fairly."" By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent While much of Whitehall is on holiday, the Ministry of Justice has been busy - taking advantage of the sleepy summer news agenda with a series of press releases about prison reform. The announcements have included a report on sport in prison, a pilot scheme to promote community sentences and plans for in-cell telephones. The latest measures - Â£10m for the 10 most challenging prisons - will certainly make a difference. X-ray scanners, for example, are highly effective at detecting drugs - it's just a wonder it's taken so long for them to be introduced. The energetic prisons minister Rory Stewart, who has immersed himself in the brief since he was appointed, is right to point out that the key to a stable prison is leadership. But his idea to raise standards among governors, with a military-style training college, will take time to yield results. Of the Â£10m investment, Â£6m is being earmarked for security measures, Â£3m for the repairs and Â£1m for training. The Ministry of Defence has been contacted for help in setting up a training scheme for prison governors, similar to that for senior members of the armed forces. Wormwood Scrubs, Hull, Lindholme and Nottingham (Clockwise from top left) are among the 10 prisons to benefit However, the Prison Reform Trust said the problems in the jails were caused by a failure to match resources to demand. Its director, Peter Dawson, said: ""It was a catastrophic failure to provide that balance which caused the collapse of prison safety after 2012 - trying to tell governors how to run prisons is not going to put it right."" Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, welcomed the extra funding but said ""the devil will be in the detail"". Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said the government must go ""much further"" and set out an emergency plan across the prisons estate with substantial new funding to put an end to this crisis and make our prisons safe and humane for staff and inmates"". There are about 84,000 inmates in more than 100 prisons, across England and Wales.

"The new search app would block search terms like human rights and religion Hundreds of Google employees have written to the company to protest against plans to launch a ""censored search engine"" in China. They said the project raised ""urgent moral and ethical questions"" and urged the firm to be more transparent. ""Currently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work,"" they added. Google, which has never spoken publicly about the plans, declined to comment. Google 'plans censored China search engine' Google 'to end Pentagon AI project' The firm, which is owned by Alphabet, quit China eight years ago in protest at the country's censorship laws and alleged government hacks. However, reports last month claimed it had been secretively working on a new Chinese search service, referred to internally as Dragonfly. The platform, which still requires Chinese government approval, would block certain websites and search terms like human rights and religion. This has angered some employees who fear they have been unwittingly working on technology that will help China suppress free expression. In their letter, which was shared with various media organisations, they also argue it would violate the ""don't be evil"" clause in Google's code of conduct. ""We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we're building,"" the letter said. It is not the first time Google employees have spoken out against the company's decisions. In April, thousands of staff criticised its work on a US military programme developing artificial intelligence for drones. Google has since ended its AI contract with the Pentagon. China has the world's largest internet audience but US tech firms have struggled to take off in China due to content restrictions and blockages.

"Around 470,000 people are using e-cigarettes as an aid to stop smoking Rules around e-cigarettes should be relaxed so they can be more widely used and accepted in society, says a report by MPs. Vaping is much less harmful than normal cigarettes and e-cigarettes should be made available on prescription to help more people quit smoking, it said. The report also asks the government,externalto consider their use on buses and trains. There is no evidence e-cigarettes are a gateway into smoking for young people, Public Health England said. The report on e-cigarettes, by the science and technology MPs' committee, said they were too often overlooked by the NHS as a tool to help people stop smoking. For example, it said it was ""unacceptable"" that a third of the 50 NHS mental health trusts in England had a ban on e-cigarettes on their premises, when there was a ""negligible health risk"" from second hand e-cigarette vapour. In the report they call for: greater freedom for industry to advertise e-cigarettes relaxing of regulations and tax duties on e-cigarettes to reflect their relative health benefits an annual review of the health effects of e-cigarettes, as well as heat-not-burn products a debate on vaping in public spaces, such as on public transport and in offices e-cigarettes licensed as medical devices a rethink on limits on refill strengths and tank sizes an end to the ban on snus - an oral tobacco product which is illegal in the UK under EU rules This video can not be played ""Relief my son turned to vaping"" - Norman Lamb About 2.9 million people in the UK are currently using e-cigarettes. It is estimated that 470,000 people are using them as an aid to stop smoking and tens of thousands are successfully quitting smoking each year as a result. Vaping - good, bad or just not clear? Vaping - the rise in five charts E-cigarettes 'should be on prescription' How likely is your e-cigarette to explode? Vaping 'can damage vital immune system cells's Although the report recognised the long-term health effects of vaping were not yet known, it said e-cigarettes were substantially less harmful than conventional cigarettes because they contained no tar or carbon monoxide. Norman Lamb, chairman of the science and technology committee, said: ""Current policy and regulations do not sufficiently reflect this and businesses, transport providers and public places should stop viewing conventional and e-cigarettes as one and the same. ""There is no public health rationale for doing so,"" he said. ""Concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, have not materialised. ""If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS's stop-smoking arsenal."" Mr Lamb said medically licensed e-cigarettes ""would make it easier for doctors to discuss and recommend them as a stop-smoking tool to aid those quitting smoking"". MPs want greater freedom for industry to advertise e-cigarettes The report is the latest in a long-running debate about e-cigarettes and how they are used in society. A survey in Scotland found that young people who use e-cigarettescould be more likely to later smoketobacco. And in Wales,concerns have been raisedabout young people using e-cigarettes on a regular basis. But elsewhere, asix month trial at an Isle of Man jailfound allowing inmates to smoke e-cigarettes made them calmer and helped them quit smoking. More research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of e-cigarettes, afterearly research on lung cells in the labsuggested that the vapour may not be completely safe. But there is general agreement among public health experts, doctors and scientists that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than normal cigarettes containing tobacco. E-cigarettes are not covered by thesmoking legislation which bansthe use of cigarettes in all enclosed public and work places. In fact, to encourage smokers to switch to vaping,Public Health England recommends,externale-cigarettes should not be treated the same as regular cigarettes when it comes to workplaces devising smoking policies. ""Vaping,"" the authority said, ""should be made a more convenient as well as safer option"". But some places have banned vaping. For example, Transport for London forbids the use of e-cigarettes on all buses and the Underground, including at stations. Big cinema chains such as Cineworld, Odeon and Empire also ban smoking e-cigarettes anywhere on their premises while most theatres also forbid their use. Most airlines and airports ban vaping, apart from in designated smoking areas. Public Health England estimates that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than normal cigarettes. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE, said: ""E-cigarettes are not without harm but are way safer than the harms of tobacco. ""There is no evidence that they are acting as a gateway into smoking for young people. ""We want to see a tobacco-free generation within 10 years and this is within sight."" The charity Action on Smoking and Health welcomed the report but said it had some concerns over rule changes on advertising, which could mean tobacco companies being allowed to market their e-cigarettes in packs of cigarettes. George Butterworth, from Cancer Research UK, said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations ""should be aimed at helping smokers to quit whilst preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes"". Prof Linda Bauld, professor of health policy at the University of Stirling, said: ""This report is a welcome and evidence-based respite from all the scare stories we see about vaping. ""Its recommendations are not likely to be popular with all, and some of them may be difficult or complex to implement. But government, regulators and service providers should take note."" There are some strong opinions on Twitter in reaction to the idea of allowing vaping on public transport. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
