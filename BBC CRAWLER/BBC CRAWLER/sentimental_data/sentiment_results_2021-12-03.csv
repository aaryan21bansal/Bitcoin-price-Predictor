"Alex Bourne insisted Matt Hancock had no involvement in the awarding of any work to his company A businessman at the centre of cronyism claims over the awarding of an NHS contract has told the BBC proper procedures were followed. Alex Bourne denied allegations he had won work because of a WhatsApp message to then health secretary Matt Hancock. Claims first surfaced in November 2020 when The Guardianreported the exchange between Mr Bourne and Mr Hancock,external, which took place the previous March. Mr Bourne told the BBC: ""I know I've done nothing wrong."" Matt Hancock said claims Mr Bourne had got or applied for a contract from the NHS or the government were a ""load of rubbish"" In December 2020, a company called Alpha Laboratories was given a Â£40.4m contract to manufacture and supply swab sample collection tubes for the NHS Test and Trace programme. This work was then subcontracted to Hinpack, a Cambridgeshire manufacturing company run by Mr Bourne - but only, according to Mr Bourne, after he had contacted it himself to offer his services. He maintains this had no connection to Mr Hancock. On Tuesday, the matter was raised in the Commons by Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds. In response, Mr Hancock said claims that Mr Bourne had got or applied for a contract from the NHS or the government were a ""load of rubbish"". Alex Bourne said he had only met Mr Hancock ""a handful of times"" Speaking to the BBC, former army officer Mr Bourne said he was offering to help during a time of national crisis when the government was mobilising industry to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies. Asked about his contact with Mr Hancock, Mr Bourne said: ""I got his phone number from a former neighbour of his and simply sent a text message. ""I introduced myself in full because... I hadn't spoken to him by that stage in probably three years. And he simply kindly replied and said, 'Please send the details of this to my Parliamentary email address', which I did."" The BBC has seen this exchange and can confirm that Mr Hancock responded by providing his Parliamentary email address. Mr Bourne said one of Mr Hancock's assistants then replied and directed him to the government's procurement portal. Asked if he had been asking a government minister for a favour as a friend, he responded: ""No. Quite simply, I was saying 'I can do this if you if you require it.'"" He also denied he and Mr Hancock were friends, describing only meeting the MP, who lives in the same village, ""a handful of times"". One of those was, he said, when the MP opened a pub in Thurlow in his West Suffolk constituency when Mr Bourne ran it. Publicly available procurement documents,externalshow the order form in which a section naming the subcontractor has been redacted. Mr Bourne says he was unaware why civil servants had redacted this information. However, The Good Law Project this week published on Twitter an unredacted version showing Hinpack's name in the relevant section. Hinpack is now manufacturing tubes and other supplies for the private Covid testing market In her exchange with Mr Hancock on Tuesday, Ms Dodds drew attention to ""pub landlords"" and ""others who had had no prior experience in the field"" of supplying medical equipment and PPE. Asked about his change in career from publican to manufacturer, Mr Bourne replied: ""Well, it was also a bit of a leap going from soldier to pub landlord,"" and said he had previous involvement in manufacturing. He also stated that Hinpack, which made paper and plastic cups for use at festivals, had already switched to making medical supplies prior to its involvement with Alpha Laboratories. Mr Bourne said the company had invested millions in scaling up its operation and had imported precision specialist machinery, bringing in experts and obtaining the necessary accreditation to meet the required production standards. Hinpack had not in the end made any money from the Alpha deal, said Mr Bourne, owing to ""enormous difficulties"" that were outside its control, ""which led to us not being able to actually carry out these contracts and have led to various disputes"". He said adverse publicity surrounding his involvement had led to him fearing for his family's safety. ""From the moment this story broke in the press, we have had various unpleasant instances which resulted in, at one stage, my family moving out of the house, police panic alarms being put in and various threats,"" he said. His company is now supplying the private testing market, having had to drastically downscale its operation. ""What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,"" he said.

"An interest rate rise in December is hanging in the balance after a Bank of England policymaker said the Omicron coronavirus variant could slow the UK economy. Michael Saunders was one of only two policymakers who voted for a rate hike in November. But he said on Friday that he needed more information before making a decision at the meeting this month. The Bank shocked markets in November after voting to hold the interest rate. It had been widely expected to lift borrowing costs from a record low of 0.1% to combat rising inflation. The Bank did not rule out an increase at the next meeting in December. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last month: ""From now onwards."" However,Mr Saunders said in a speech on Friday,external: ""At present, given the new Omicron Covid variant has only been detected quite recently, there could be particular advantages in waiting to see more evidence on its possible effects on public health outcomes and hence on the economy."" Though he said there were also risks from delaying an interest rate rise for too long: ""Continued delay also could be costly."" Omicron pauses the return to economic normality Bank of England hints at future interest rate rise While Omicron might slow Britain's economy, Mr Saunders said it could also help push up the cost of living if it led to people spending less on going out and other in-person services and more on goods, when supply chains are already strained. A delay in raising rates could also lead to employers scrambling for staff. ""This could require a more abrupt and painful policy tightening later,"" Mr Saunders said. ""For me, the balance between these considerations is likely to be a key factor at the December meeting."" Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after Mr Saunders's comments. Investors were pricing in only a 33% chance of a December rate hike after his speech, down from about 75% last week before news broke of the new variant. The Bank will announce the interest rate decision on 16 December. The Bank of England confounded investor expectations of a rate rise in November when it said it wanted to wait for more data on whether the end of the furlough scheme in October had led to a jump in unemployment. Mr Saunders said the end of the government job support scheme did not appear to have hit to the labour market very hard. He said the rates were likely to rise over the next few quarters, assuming the economy performs as expected. In a question-and-answer session after his speech, the former Citi economist declined to give a steer on his likely decision at this month's meeting. ""I don't want to use code words today to indicate either way as to what my vote at the December meeting might be. There are potential costs and benefits to waiting for more data,"" he said. Mr Saunders and deputy governor Dave Ramsden were the two members of the Bank's nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee who cast votes in early November to raise Bank Rate to 0.25%. However, Mr Bailey said the decision had been a ""close call"".

"Boris Johnson hosted a Christmas market in Downing Street earlier this week The chair of the Conservatives says he has no plans to cancel staff Christmas parties over concerns about Covid. Oliver Dowden said the planned festivities were in line with rules, and he would ""urge people to keep calm and carry on with their plans"". But the government has been accused of sending mixed messages about appropriate festive behaviour. It followscontroversy over No 10 staff breaking Covid rules with a partylast December at the height of restrictions. Boris Johnson - who was not at the party - has insisted staff stuck to regulations, but Downing Street has refused to detail how party-goers complied. Don't kiss strangers under mistletoe - minister No need to cancel Christmas party plans - Javid Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Asked again on Friday about the gathering, where a source told the BBC that staff had food, drinks and played party games until gone midnight, Mr Johnson said ""it's not true"" that any rules were broken. Speaking during a campaign visit to North Shropshire, he said the guidance had been followed throughout and that the government would continue to follow it. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Lockdown Christmas parties ""followed the guidance at all times"" The emergence of the Omicron Covid variant earlier this month has prompted some health experts to question the safety of large gatherings this year. One Tory MP said unclear advice was spurring a ""cancel Christmas brigade"". Downing Street has said there will continue to be festive events this month, but would not specify whether or not that would include a No 10 staff party. Asked whether one would take place, Mr Johnson's deputy spokesman said they wouldn't set out details of private functions in No 10. Although the government has not brought in new laws or guidance restricting socialising, some big firms havedecided to downgrade Christmas events. No 10 has said it is not urging people to cancel events - but ministers have given conflicting advice about how people should behave during this year's festive party season. On Thursday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said whom people kiss had ""nothing to do with the government"" - a day after Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said people should not kiss strangers at Christmas events. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson had to insist government guidance had not been changed after public health official Dr Jenny Harries said people should not socialise ""when we don't particularly need to"". Business Minister George Freeman has said his government department would not be having a ""big"" gathering, telling Times Radio: ""Nobody would expect us to"". He added his own parliamentary team were planning to ""get together on Zoom"" instead of an in-person event. This video can not be played Oliver Dowden says he would urge people to ""carry on with their plans"" In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster to be broadcast on Saturday, Conservative MP Steve Brine said: ""The cancel Christmas brigade have been given legs by unclear messaging from government. ""You have ministers out on the airwaves, flattered that they're being asked their opinion, proffering their thoughts on kissing under the mistletoe or on Christmas parties, deviating from the government line. ""What we've got now is with some, the zero Covid tendency has gained new traction and encouragement. Basically, we gave them an inch, and they've taken a mile. ""We need to learn to live with Covid. We are millions of miles away from that right now."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast earlier, Mr Dowden said the Conservatives would be holding a ""normal Christmas gathering of staff that are in London"". But he added: ""Of course, if the situation changes and rules need to be updated, we will comply with the rules as they stand at that time."" ""It's not a children's party, so I wouldn't expect there will be games, etc. It will be a social gathering for the staff that are in our London office."" Some firms have scaled back their Christmas shindigs this year in response to Covid concerns On Thursday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party had been ""reviewing our Christmas get-togethers"" following the emergence of Omicron. ""The parliamentary Labour party was meant to meet and have a Christmas party - we've decided not to do that now,"" she said. However, she added: ""We've said quite clearly that we don't think people should cancel their Christmas gatherings. ""But we do think the government should make clear advice to people what they should be doing."" A Liberal Democrat spokeswoman said they had decided not to hold a party involving all staff this year. Teams will be having dinners, and they will be taking lateral flow tests beforehand, she added. On Thursday, Ms Rayner asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case whether he will investigate the use of government property for the Downing Street staff party on 18 December last year. On Friday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said her force is not investigating the event. ""As far as I'm aware, we have had no complaint, and therefore I really can't comment on what did or didn't happen there,"" she told LBC. After the interview, Labour MP Neil Coyle tweeted that he had written to Dame Cressida to ask the Met to open a formal investigation.

"Industry leaders argue oil and gas extraction cannot be scaled back too quickly Business leaders have warned that thousands of oil and gas jobs could be at risk in the UK after Shell pulled out of the Cambo oil field development. Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce said a ""premature"" end to domestic production could see some areas suffer the fate of mining communities in the 1980s. Environmentalists say new fossil fuel projects like Cambo are incompatible with action on climate change. Cambo's majority stakeholder said it still planned to take it forward. Siccar Point Energy is currently awaiting approval from the UK government to develop the field. Shell pulls out of Cambo oil field development Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Chief executive Jonathan Roger said other countries including Norway were investing in new oil and gas alongside renewables as part of a transition to sustainable energy. He added: ""The UK is at risk of damaging its economy and increasing imports with a higher carbon impact if new developments are not brought forward during this time."" Shell, which has faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo, said it now believed the economic case for investment was ""not strong enough"". Greenpeace welcomed the announcement, describing it as the ""death blow"" for the plans. But industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo were still needed. External relations director Jenny Stanning said: ""This is a commercial decision between partners but doesn't change the facts that the UK will continue to need new oil and gas projects if we are to protect security of supply, avoid increasing reliance on imports and support jobs."" It is too early to write the obituary of the North Sea oil and gas industry, despite claims by some environmental campaigners that Shell's decision marks the beginning of the end. That's because, whatever Shell says in public, this is about reputational cost not conventional economics. Battling environmentalists and the Scottish government for the right to drill for oil is not a good look for a company that claims to be transitioning away from fossil fuels. But the Cambo oilfield is reckoned to hold hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, each worth some $70 at current prices, and there are lots of less high-profile companies who would be willing to suffer some bad publicity for a cut of that prize. So, the real question Shell's decision raises is whether the UK government is willing to put its net-zero ambitions ahead of the huge tax revenues the project could deliver and deny a licence to develop the oilfield. The chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce called for a ""reasoned debate"" about oil and gas extraction, which he said supported thousands of UK jobs. Russell Borthwick said there was enormous potential for the renewable energy sector in the region but he warned against a ""knee jerk"" reaction to climate change. He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""If we get this wrong, all of those people and organisations demanding a premature end to domestic oil and gas production might want to be able to reflect back to their role in scripting a repeat of what happened to our mining communities in the 1980s."" The fallout from the 1984/85 miners strike and the long term decline of UK coal mining left many communities facing high unemployment and other problems thatwere still being felt decades later. Businessman Sir Ian Wood chairs Aberdeen's Energy Transition Zone, a not-for-profit company set up to support the shift to renewable energy. He said: ""We must not create an adverse investment environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey. ""The future prosperity of our region and the country's ability to meet net zero, depends on it."" Located in the North Atlantic, about 125km (75 miles) north west of the Shetland islands. Major stakeholder is Siccar Point Energy, with a 70% stake, backed by private equity firm investors. Siccar Point Energy says Cambo could deliver 170 million barrels of oil over 25 years, and 53.5 billion cubic feet of gas. The exploration licences dates back to 2001, but UK government must approve drilling - which could start as early as 2022. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie welcomed Shell's announcement and said it made it less likely Cambo would go ahead in the ""near term"". ""It's absurd to suggest that our transition to a zero carbon economy depends on drilling for ever more oil and gas,"" he said. He said Scotland had a quarter of Europe's wind energy potential, and that investment should be focused on renewables instead. ""We could be exporting renewable resources and make that the backbone of Scotland's economy,"" he told the BBC. He continued: ""The idea of keeping global warming below 2 degrees and 1.5 degrees if we possibly can - this is not optional. ""This is not a normal political choice. This is mission critical for our survival. ""It is humanity's only survival strategy and we need to invest now in the transition that has to be fair, but it has to be fast."" Activists at the COP26 summit called for the Cambo development to be blocked Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the Highlands on Friday for an announcement on plans fora major offshore wind turbine tower factory. She said Shell had made ""a commercial decision"" and that it was ""for others to determine what that means in terms of the economic viability"" of Cambo. ""I have made my views clear that it shouldn't be given the green light, it should be subjected to a very rigorous climate assessment. ""But it does illustrate the importance of accelerating that transition from fossil fuels to low carbon alternatives. ""Nobody is saying that we can shut oil and gas off overnight. We cannot do that and nobody is saying, least of all me, that we leave those currently working in oil and gas on the scrap heap."" The UK government, which makes the final decision on whether to allow drilling, insists an environmental impact assessment will be carried out but appears far more supportive. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has said the new field should""100%"" get the go-ahead. On Friday, Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK government ""continues to have a very strong commitment to the oil and gas sector and to the North Sea transition deal that we did a year ago. ""For some years to come we will be very dependent as a country on gas in particular, and we need to make sure that the gas continues to come from the UK continental shelf to the UK."" He also said that the government had a ""very strong"" net zero commitment.

"MicheÃ¡l Martin said the risks of going into the Christmas period without some further restrictions was ""just too high"" Irish nightclubs are to shut again and the hospitality sector faces tighter rules over Christmas as the government tries to curb the spread of Covid-19. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin announced a number of new restrictions in a televised address on Friday night. Indoor events such as concerts and sports fixtures must operate at 50% capacity and private home visits must involve no more than four households. The latest rules will be in place from 7 December until 9 January. The Irish government took the decisions at a cabinet meeting on Friday after advice from the chief medical officer and the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). Mr Martin said the ""risks associated with proceeding into the Christmas period without some restrictions to reduce the volume of personal contacts is just too high"". Nightclubs, which hadonly recently reopened for the first time since the pandemic began, will have to close again on Tuesday. Many of the restrictions which applied to pubs, hotels and restaurants prior a relaxation of Covid rules on 22 October will now be reimposed for the Christmas and New Year period. Those include: a table service only rule, which means customers cannot queue at a bar for drinks social distancing rules are being reintroduced with a minimum of 1m (3ft) between tables a maximum of six adults can sit together at a table there is a ban on multiple table bookings masks be worn when not at the table There had been speculation that closing time would be brought forward to 11:30 local time but the taoiseach confirmed that would remain at midnight. Restaurants and bars will return to table service only until the new year The Republic of Ireland isalready operating the EU Covid pass system for the hospitality industryin which people need proof of Covid status to enter certain venues. Mr Martin said the pass would also now be required for gyms and leisure centres as well as hotel bars and restaurants. New restrictions will apply to entertainment, cultural and sporting events - attendance numbers will be reduced to 50% capacity and the venues must be fully seated. Mr Martin acknowledged that many people in the hospitality and entertainment industries ""will be bitterly disappointed by this news"" and that ""many of them will be fearing for their livelihoods"". ""I want to reassure them that, just as we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, the government will stand by them and ensure that they have the financial supports necessary to weather this latest storm and to stay intact until we are out of it,"" he said. The taoiseach described the emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa as a ""cause for concern"" and disappointing twist in the pandemic. ""Just a few weeks ago South Africa was reporting approximately 300 cases per day. Yesterday it reported 11,500 new cases,"" he said. Mr Martin said experience had shown that while restrictions on travel were ""useful to delay the entry of new variants, it is impossible to stop them"". So farthe Republic of Ireland has only one confirmed Omicron casebut Mr Martin said there was ""potential for a very serious crisis"" if the new variant proved to be more transmissible. ""Further study and examination in the weeks ahead may discover that Omicron does not represent a more deadly threat,"" he said. ""If that is the case it will come as a great relief to us all, but we simply cannot take that risk with people's lives and health."" Mr Martin said the latest measures were precautionary and insisted they were not a return to lockdown. ""Large sections of our society and economy are open and thriving,"" he said. He described the Republic of Ireland as having the ""most vaccinated population in Europe"" and praised young people in particular for the sacrifices they had made to date. ""You are a very special generation,"" he told them. ""And you have done it not for yourselves but for your parents, your grandparents, your community and your country."" Earlier, the Irish government delayed by 48 hours a requirement for a negative Covid-19 test for passengers arriving at ports and airports in the Republic of Ireland. It was due to comeinto effect on Friday. From Monday, travellers must show results from a lateral flow test taken up to 48 hours before arrival or a PCR test taken up to 72 hours earlier. Passengers arriving into Irish airports and ports will need to show proof of a negative test from Monday There will be no exception for theCommon Travel Area,external, so the rule will apply to visitors from Great Britain. Children aged 11 and under will be be exemptas will some other categories,external. Airlines and ferry companies are in talks with the Department of Transport to discuss checks before people board Ireland-bound flights or boats. The new travel rules were criticised by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary as ""gobbledygook"". ""We note that neither the chief medical officer nor the government have defined what a 'professionally-done' antigen test means or look like,"" he said. ""How are airline or border control staff supposed to understand what a professionally done antigen test is, or looks like, when neither the chief medical officer nor the government have even defined it?"" he added. In his address to the nation on Friday night, the taoiseach acknowledged there had been problems with some Covid policies. ""We haven't always got it right, and there have been times of great frustration,"" he said. But, every time we have faced a new challenge we have pulled together as a nation and done what was needed. I'm asking us all to do that again."" Meanwhile,the Health Amendment Bill,external- which includes a return of mandatory hotel quarantine - passed all stages in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) on Thursday night. It will go before the Seanad (Irish senate) later and will be voted before being signed into law by President Michael D Higgins. There are no countries named in the legislation - that will be decided by the health minister.

"The father and stepmother of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes have been jailed after being convicted of killing the six-year-old. The circumstances leading to the boy's death will be the subject of a independent review. But it appears there were missed opportunities to save him. Arthur's stepmother Emma Tustin, 32, has been jailed for life for his murder, and will serve a minimum term of 29 years. Her partner - Arthur's father, 29-year-old Thomas Hughes - was sentenced to 21 years for manslaughter. Coventry Crown Court heard social workers visited Arthur's home in April 2020 after his paternal grandmother, a secondary school teacher, called an emergency number to report seeing bruises on his back. But two months before Arthur died from a head injury, Solihull Council workers concluded he was living in a ""happy household"". Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Couple who killed Arthur Labinjo-Hughes jailed Social services in England have to conduct an initial assessment within 45 days of a referral and decide whether a child is in need of further support. If they decide a child is suffering significant harm this should trigger an investigation or protective action, such as increased visits from a social worker. In the worst cases, a child can be removed from a household. The social workers in Arthur's case found there were ""no safeguarding concerns"". Solihull's Local Child Safeguarding Partnership is now carrying out an inquiry into Arthur's death. It said his death had a ""shocking impact on Arthur's family and across the whole community"" and ""it would be inappropriate for the partnership to comment ahead of the findings of that review"". Social services staff should have spoken to Arthur about his bruises, the Director of Association of Child Protection Professionals has said. Wendy Thorogood told Times Radio: ""I would have expected any assessment to really take account of the grandmother's photos. ""I would have expected joint conversations and real conversation with [Arthur], and that appears to have been missed,"" she said. ""Equally, it's a society responsibility, in relation to, his cries were so abnormal if we'd had an anonymous call from one of the neighbours that could have given them more power to do the investigation,"" she said. Lord Laming led the public inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbie, who was killed by her great-aunt and her partner in 2000, and reviewed the case of baby Peter Connelly, who died in 2007 at the hands of his mother, her boyfriend and their lodger. He said the quality of training for social work ""needs to be looked at again"". He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme frontline services had become more focused on crisis rather than prevention due to a reduction in the funding of local authorities over the past decade. He said: ""The whole organisation ought to focus on the front line, on what's happening to children and making sure they intervene earlier rather than later and when it is too late."" Arthur was six years old when he died The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) is also to publish a report into West Midlands Police's handling of the case. The trial was told one of Arthur's uncles sent the force photographs of the boy's bruises - but officers decided they had ""no further role"", as by that time social services had become involved. The IOPC said it ""found no indication any individual behaved in a manner that justified disciplinary proceedings"". There is also the possibility the impact of the Covid lockdown was a factor in Arthur's death. His abuse became worse at start of the first lockdown in spring 2020 - a time the NSPCC charity noted coincided with a 23% increase in calls to its helpline. Former Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield told Today: ""A lot of the services went on to the screens for children, and this child in particular, Arthur, wasn't in school. ""So there's a big lesson there, instantly about if there is a crisis, there are children who are going to slip from view and we have to make sure they have the protection, which does need face-to-face contact."" It is hard to comprehend the cruelty endured by Arthur in his final months. Tragically, his name now joins a list of children over the decades who have been subjected to the most appalling neglect and abuse. Cases where there have been warnings to the authorities but the opportunity to step in has been missed. I have reported on some of the most high profile -Victoria Climbie,externalandBaby Pin London,Khyra Ishaqin Birmingham andDaniel Pelkain Coventry. Names, faces and stories that stay with you. Each involved manipulative, deceitful parents or relatives - and a child who was all but invisible when checks were made. Arthur's stepmother and father certainly manipulated and deceived but what was different for him was lockdown. A pressure-cooker environment for families, when overstretched social workers were dealing with many calls. Now it will be for the independent inquiry to decide whether or not the authorities could have done more to find out what life was really like for Arthur. The number of children dying in England as a direct consequence of maltreatment has ""remained relatively steady"" at 28 per year -according to a government report published last year,externalinto 368 serious case reviews of youngsters, carried out between 2014 and 2017. That was despite a ""steady increase in child protection activity"", it said. Ms Longfield said: ""For anyone who looks at the serious case reviews, or hears about them, that come after a child's death, you will see the same things coming up time and time again. ""Missed opportunities. Lack of co-ordination. Lack of data sharing. The things that professionals need to have at hand to be able to protect these children, which still aren't in place."" She said sometimes there could be high caseloads or a lack of staff experience, adding: ""Certainly it is the case that the services are creaking under financial strain."" Ms Longfield questioned whether the ""thresholds"" for social workers to intervene remained ""too high"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Tough sentences are ""absolutely no consolation"" Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a former children's minister, told Today funding for children's social care had increased but demand had also risen and ""it may be that the social workers here just didn't have the time to get over the threshold"". A 2010 report by Prof Eileen Munro stressed the importance of early intervention before social workers get involved. But there is still no legal requirement on people working with children in England to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect, although there is guidance telling them to do so. Mr Loughton, who commissioned Prof Munro's review, told Today: ""We need to be doing much more. To be knocking on doors, to be snooping around where there are serious suspicions that something is going wrong. ""And for whatever reason in this case, clearly that hasn't happened.""

"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes died after being left alone with Emma Tustin last year Tuesday 16 June 2020 started the same as any other for six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: in misery and in pain. Barely able to stand, he folded away his bedding in the living room where his father and new stepmother had been making him sleep on the floor, all the while monitored by CCTV set up to catch him ""misbehaving"". For three months, his life was dictated by a cruel punishment regime enforced by Emma Tustin and Thomas Hughes. That day would be his last alive. Warning - this article contains distressing content. Arthur's short life had been difficult. He lived with his mother, Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow, after she and Hughes split not long before his second birthday. After she was arrested forkilling her abusive partner in 2019, Arthur was left in the sole care of his father. Despite the challenges, he was a happy and cheeky child who was adored by his extended family. He loved school, football and superheroes. Dad and partner guilty of killing six-year-old Not long after taking responsibility for Arthur, Hughes, 29, met Tustin on an online dating site. When the UK went into lockdown in March 2020, the new couple made the decision to merge their families at Tustin's home on Cranmore Road in Solihull, where she lived with her own children, aged four and five. It didn't take long for things to deteriorate for Arthur. By April, social services and police had paid a visit after referrals from his concerned grandmother, Joanne Hughes, and an anonymous tip off from Tustin's own parents. The 32-year-old was said to have ""bristled with hostility"" towards Arthur. Mrs Hughes spotted extensive bruising on her grandson's back and he'd told her Tustin had slammed him into the stairs, calling him an ""ugly, horrible brat"". Arthur's grandmother alerted social services to bruises on his body, but no action was taken The authorities found no cause for concern. Tustin and Hughes manipulated visitors, told them his bruises were down to play. Hughes would even call Arthur's school and tell teachers he'd been playing out in the garden. It was a lie. What they concealed was a campaign of violence, cruelty and abuse, designed to terrorise, debase and dehumanise the boy who depended on them. Prosecutors noted how the day Arthur was fatally injured, there was barely an indication that he even lived at number 39 Cranmore Road, such was his isolation from the rest of the family. This video can not be played Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: Grandmother pays tribute to boy, six He was monitored on CCTV set up around the home, cameras that would eventually capture Tustin callously trying to administer Calpol to the boy she had murdered just out of view in the hallway. The hallway where Arthur's heart stopped beating is where he had spent most of his time during lockdown. For up to 14 hours a day, he would stand facing the door, deprived of food, drink and affection. He would stand there alone while his father enjoyed chocolates and other treats in the kitchen with Tustin and her own children. Arthur was monitored on CCTV which in court would be used to prove how he suffered His treasured possessions, including a favourite blanket, teddy bear and his beloved Birmingham City football shirts, were torn up and destroyed before his eyes by an enraged Hughes as another twisted punishment. As he grew weaker and struggled to stand, Arthur would be punished further if he tried to move or sit down in the hallway. While alone, Arthur would often cry to himself. Tustin would record more than 200 clips of him in distress, including two particularly harrowing recordings where Arthur is heard begging in tears, ""I want you to feed me, no one's going to feed me"" and crying ""no one loves me"". Tustin sent these recordings to Hughes who would respond with violent threats, encouraging his partner to harm his son. ""Just end him,"" one message read. ""I'll sort him out when I'm home,"" said another. Tustin complied, and by the time he died experts said the extent of Arthur's injuries met the medical definition of child torture. His tiny body bore more than 130 bruises. Arthur Labinjo-Hughes suffered a fatal collapse while at Emma Tustin's home in Solihull All the while, Arthur was cut off from those who loved him and could help him. Tustin and Hughes simply kept him out of view. His maternal grandmother, Madeleine Halcrow, said Hughes had stopped her from seeing Arthur since 2019. She was not to see him again until he was fighting for his life in intensive care. Tustin's hairdresser Catherine Milhench, known as ""Affy"", and her husband Tobias Jarman were among the last people to see Arthur alive. Not long after he weakly put away his bedding on 16 June, Tustin took Arthur to her appointment at Ms Milhench's home. The couple were struck by the state of the boy they had last seen in February. Then, he was really quite healthy looking, they told the court. Just a few months later, he was gaunt, malnourished and too weak to hold a glass of water Mr Jarman had smuggled him. In his eyes was fear, they would say, and it soon became apparent why. Like at home, he was forced to stand in the hallway and when he failed to stand up straight, Hughes was heard bellowing at his son, threatening to put him six feet under and to rip his head off and use it as a football. Arthur was fatally assaulted by Tustin in the hallway at the house on Cramore Road Shortly after 13:00 that day, the family was back home. Hughes took Tustin's children to the supermarket, leaving his own son in mortal danger. It's thought as soon as they were alone in the house, Tustin forced him to drink a salt slurry in the upstairs bathroom. Poisoned, Arthur would have deteriorated within about 45 minutes. Tustin bombarded Hughes with messages complaining of the child's behaviour as his condition worsened. In a three-minute phone call, Hughes pretended they spoke about balloons for a birthday party but more likely, prosecutors suggest, he acted as he routinely did when Tustin reported Arthur's behaviour to him: in a rage, with threats, and encouraging violence. Minutes later, Arthur was unconscious. Tustin had inflicted a catastrophic brain injury by shaking him and repeatedly slamming his head into a hard surface. As he died, she did nothing save take a photo and send it to Hughes. The camera in the living room captured Arthur slumped on the floor. She carried him around the house, plotting how best to arrange him to fit her deception that she was blameless. Eventually, she would call an ambulance but it was too late, and Arthur died in hospital shortly after 01:00 the following morning. Since that moment, Tustin has sought to deflect blame. In differing accounts, she would variously blame Arthur for his own injuries. ""Whatever has happened, it has been done by his own actions,"" Tustin told jurors. Medical experts disagreed. There was no way the six-year-old boy could inflict these ""unsurvivable"" injuries on himself. She presented herself as a victim. She claimed it was in fact Arthur who was the aggressor in the house, that he had treated the couple badly, causing them ""daily stress"". During her trial, Emma Tustin sought to blame Arthur for his own injuries Tests after his death revealed something else sinister - salt poisoning had been routine for him. He had consumed at least six-and-a-half teaspoons of salt the day he was fatally injured. Tustin had been repeatedly lacing his food and drink with it. Severely underweight at the time of his murder, he was a hungry boy who would not eat because the food he was given was inedible. For police investigating the case, nothing short of evil suffices to describe Tustin. Arthur's grandmother, Mrs Halcrow, agrees. She branded the couple cold, calculating and wicked. Hughes was described as weak by the senior investigating officer, Det Insp Laura Harrison. Far from being a loving father, he completely let down his vulnerable son. Although he was not present for the final attack on Arthur, he was also found culpable for his death for the months of abuse he enforced himself and encouraged from Tustin. Serious questions are now being asked of authorities which could have intervened to save Arthur. A review by social services is currently under way and the Independent Office for Police Conduct is also examining whether opportunities were missed by police. Thomas Hughes completely let his son down, police said The Child Safeguarding Partnership said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment ahead of its findings, but said the ""terrible tragedy has had a shocking impact on Arthur's family and across the whole community"". Their report is likely to be published next year. While what happened to Arthur is rare, the NSPCC has raised concerns about the risks to children during lockdown. ""We know that the Department for Education reported more serious injuries and deaths of children during the last year with a higher percentage in the first six months - so we do know that lockdown had a significant impact on children and families,"" Helen Westerman, from the NSPCC, said. She said children were ""the hidden victims of this pandemic"" and that the charity had seen an increase of 23% in calls from adults concerned about a child's welfare. Arthur's case was ""horrendous, horrific and heart-breaking,"" the NSPCC said and the charity called for the serious case review to ""establish the lessons that need to be learned to prevent this awful case from happening again"". From prison, Arthur's mother said the memory of her young son she would treasure the most was his smile. Arthur wasn't just her only son, Labinjo-Halcrow said, but her best friend with a gentle and caring nature. She wants the world to remember her son, not for the harrowing end to his short life, but for his superpower - his smile.

"This video can not be played Covid: Paramedic says violent attacks ""getting worse"" There are eight attacks on emergency workers every day on average, according to new figures. The 1,400 in the first half of this year saw workers headbutted, kicked, punched and coughed at, while 21 involved weapons being brandished. Ambulance staff said they had seen people's tempers get worse during the pandemic, with one who was attacked, saying crews are ""struggling"". There are fears there will be an even bigger spike in assaults at Christmas. Paramedic Lisa O'Sullivan admitted being ""stunned"" after being spat at while treating a patient in Cardiff city centre. She believes there is a link between people being more abusive and the pandemic, adding: ""I wasn't sure whether he had Covid-19 or if he had any other blood-borne diseases for that matter, so it was quite frightening."" Attacks on 999 workers unacceptable Rise in ambulance staff attacks 'unacceptable' Assaults on medical workers rose by 35% from 428 in the year to June 2020 to 576 this year, however, statisticians at the Welsh emergency services said some of this increase was due to improvements in the data collection. Police officers experienced an 11% increase (1,672 to 1,853), firefighter attacks rose from 45 to 49 (9%), while in prisons, there was a drop from 98 assaults to 90. This video can not be played Paramedic Jon Johnston suffered a broken wrist while being assaulted by a man he was trying to help A man was jailed for an attack on paramedic Katie Stapleton after she responded to a call about an unconscious man at a Bridgend supermarket. As they tried to lift him, he started punching her to the chest and left her colleague with a ""thick lip"". She added: ""We tried to restrain him, and as we were trying to do this, his partner, who was seven months pregnant, tried to jump on my colleague's back. ""If we had let this gentleman go, there is no doubt he would have carried on attacking us."" Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Oliver Hides, Ms Stapleton said she believed the pandemic increased workloads so much, that crews are struggling. ""It is becoming an occupational hazard, and it shouldn't be,"" she said. ""We turn up to help and support them so to end up being assaulted by someone that has called you. ""It doesn't bear thinking about, it is really difficult to deal with."" Paramedic Darren Lloyd says assaults on paramedics are not just down to drink and drugs Meanwhile, Caernarfon paramedic Darren Lloyd described an ""ambush"" on one of his crews recently who were going to a call and were pelted with rocks and bricks. ""Unfortunately these incidents don't have to be down to drink and drugs,"" he said. ""It is sad and mind-boggling that individuals can behave in such a way."" Figures from the Joint Emergency Services Group in Wales shows the 1,365 attacks in the first six months of 2021 equate to eight a day. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has been a fraught time for all of us, but that's no excuse to assault an emergency worker, who are normal human beings just trying to do a job,"" said Welsh Ambulance Service chief executive Jason Killens. ""The run-up to Christmas means more people are out enjoying the revelry, and with alcohol consumption comes an increase in assaults, both physical and verbal."" Mr Killens said it was not just physical assaults - with 60 verbal attacks on ambulance control centre staff recorded in the first six months of 2021. He said abusing a call handler could potentially delay help and warned a crew may have to leave a scene if their safety is compromised. Almost half (47%) of the assaults in the first half of this year were in south-east Wales - the most were in Cardiff, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Bridgend. Just under a quarter of the attackers were aged 26 to 35, while a third of incidents involved people who had been drinking. May 2021,the month hospitality reopened in Walesafter the second lockdown, saw 281 assaults, the highest number. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 36 incidents where a worker has been deliberately coughed at. Police workers account for two-thirds of the assault victims, averaging 152 every month. This video can not be played Bodycam footage shows moment PC is bitten on the hand during an arrest ""Assault is a traumatic offence that causes great distress to anyone, and it is no different when the victim is an emergency worker,"" said temporary chief constable of Dyfed-Powys Police Claire Parmenter. In September, a man was handed a 26-week suspended prison sentence after attacking two officers who had offered him a lift home. Also that month, three officers suffered injuries in an unprovoked attack while trying to arrest a man, and he was sentenced to 12 months. Chief fire officer in south Wales, Huw Jakeway, said: ""Our blue light services come to work to serve and protect the public and the impact of such assaults can lead to life-changing consequences for those involved."" NHS Wales chief executive Judith Paget called for respect as workers prepare for a ""challenging Christmas period"".

"Emily Bleakley says Covid has made a difficult situation worse Emily Bleakley says the pressure of caring for her brother has been made worse by the pandemic. ""Being an unpaid carer doesn't stop. And the lack of respite opportunities during Covid has only worsened that,"" the 18-year-old from Powys said. Despite that, more families are being urged to carry out caring duties as the system struggles to meet ""the surge in demand for care"". Cardiff and Vale is the latest of four health boards to make similar calls. The health board said it had seen a 30% increase in people needing care at home, compared to pre-pandemic levels. A huge increase in demand, alongside a UK-wide shortage of care workers and health care staff, is leading to delays in care provision and preventing the timely discharge of patients from hospital, it said. What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Wales to get extra cash from new NHS and care tax What is social care and how does it work in Wales? Its warning follows others from Swansea Bay, Hywel Dda and Betsi Cadwaladr health boards and calls on relatives to consider providing care themselves to ""free up much-needed care for other vulnerable people who do not have any support"". Blaenau Gwent council described its situation as ""concerning"" and has also asked for families to consider arranging their own care, rather than using an agency, and for people to think about becoming a care worker or volunteer. Emily said her role could often be relentless and has been further exacerbated by the pandemic: ""I'm feeling quite worn out to be honest. ""We need to keep getting further support to adjust the challenges of caring during Covid because this has been much more than mental health - it's financial, it's social, it's been very hard for a lot of unpaid carers, and this does need to be recognised,"" she said. Emily said she felt frustrated by health boards asking more of already-struggling families. ""It does make me quite angry. Unpaid carers are being stretched to the point where that their mental health is suffering and they're being asked to do more."" Christine Jenkins says she cannot sleep properly because of her caring responsibilities Christine Jenkins, from Coelbren, Powys, cares for her husband, who has dementia. ""I've got to think of him all the time which I don't mind, obviously, but I go to bed at night, I can't sleep properly because I'm waiting for him to wake up - it's constant, all the time,"" she said. ""I consider myself a strong woman and I don't say it's depression, it's more the anxiety of, if you failed, what happens? ""But I am strong, I am, I will fight on to get things done if I can."" Beth Evans says there is a desperate situation in social care Carers have been ""pushed to the brink"" during the pandemic, according Beth Evans, a policy manager at Carers Wales. The charity's research in June showed 72% of carers had reported exhaustion from the additional care responsibilities they had taken on. ""It's really demoralising - services haven't fully reopened after the pandemic for carers with quite intense caring responsibilities,"" she said. ""To add additional responsibilities on to them, when they really are at breaking point, without adequate support, is really unfair."" Cardiff and Vale's plea for family support comes as no surprise to the charity. ""It's a desperate situation, I completely understand why they're asking. But they need to make sure that those families and those carers get the adequate support and equipment that they need to care safely and look after their own health. ""Otherwise, what will happen, is that the health and social care services will end up with two patients instead of one. Nobody wants that."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan said people in social care had done an ""incredible job"", but there was a shortage of social care workers, prompting health boards to ask relatives to fill in. ""We have put extra packages in place for unpaid carers and additional significant funding in place as we go into the winter months,"" she added. Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?

"Moxon (left) and Gale (right) were both criticised by Azeem Rafiq when the former Yorkshire player spoke to MPs Director of cricket Martyn Moxon, head coach Andrew Gale and all members of the coaching staff are among 16 people to have left Yorkshire amid the racism scandal. A report found former player Azeem Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at Yorkshire. Former captain Gale says he will begin a legal fight against the club's decision to sack him. ""The decision has come as a surprise to me,"" he told BBC Sport in a statement. ""The players knew about it before I did and I will be fighting the decision legally."" Gale had beensuspendedas part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010. Moxon had been Yorkshire's director of cricket since 2007. ""Significant change is required at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and we are committed to taking whatever action is necessary to regain trust,"" said Lord Patel, the club's new chair. ""The decisions announced today were difficult to make, but are in the best interests of the club. ""Without making important changes to how we are run, we cannot move on from the past to become a culture which is progressive and inclusive."" A Yorkshire statement said a new director of cricket will be appointed ""imminently"". What is English cricket's racism scandal all about? Yorkshire to undergo governance review Vaughan ""sorry"" for hurt Rafiq has suffered Moxon, a former Yorkshire and England batter, was scheduled to appear before MPs at the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee on 16 November but was absent from work because of a ""stress-related illness"". Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire in two spells between 2008 and 2018, told the committee that racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time at the club and described English cricket as""institutionally racist"". At the hearing, Rafiq said that the day after his son was still-born in 2017, Moxon ""ripped shreds"" off him in a manner he had never seen the director of cricket use when addressing anyone else at Yorkshire. Rafiq detailed his experiences at Yorkshire, which left him close to taking his own life, for the first time in September 2020. After thefindings of the report were releaseda year later, Yorkshire originally saidno-one at the club would be disciplined. Roger Hutton, Yorkshire's former chairman who resigned in November, said Moxon and former chief executive Mark Arthur ""failed to accept the gravity of the situation"". Arthurresigned last month. The Yorkshire-commissioned investigation was widely criticised after it reportedly found a racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him while at the club and concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". Gale has spent his entire career at Yorkshire, first as a player after making his debut in 2004, then as captain between 2009 and 2016 before he ended his playing career at the age of 32 in order to take up the head coach role. This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire Speaking at the DCMS committee hearing, Rafiq said Yorkshire became ""toxic"" after Gary Ballance took over as captain, shortly after Gale replaced previous coach Jason Gillespie. Ballance, a former England batter, admitted he was responsible for some of the offensive terms Rafiq was subjected to during his time at Headingley. Rafiq said Gale's attitude towards the death of Rafiq's son was that Rafiq was ""making it more than what it is"", and that ""hardly anyone"" asked after his and his wife's wellbeing. Gale was suspended by Yorkshire on 9 November after the Jewish News reported he sent a now-deleted tweet containing an anti-Semitic slur to former Leeds United head of media Paul Dews. ""We want to make Yorkshire County Cricket Club a place for everyone, from all backgrounds,"" Patel said. ""To do this, we need to rebuild our culture and instil positive values in everyone associated with Yorkshire. We are determined to learn from the mistakes of the past to become a club which people can trust."" In response to the way Yorkshire handled Rafiq's claims, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)suspended them from staging England matchesat their Headingley home. Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave also shared their experiences of racism at the club. Thirty-six people contacted Yorkshire's independent whistleblower hotline - set up to allow any other victims of discrimination at the club to come forward - in its first week of operation. On Thursday, it was confirmed Yorkshire will undergo an independent review into club governance. The ECB haspublished a five-point plandesigned to tackle racism and discrimination that includes a ""full review of dressing-room culture"".

"The father and stepmother of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes have been jailed after being convicted of killing the six-year-old. The circumstances leading to the boy's death will be the subject of a independent review. But it appears there were missed opportunities to save him. Arthur's stepmother Emma Tustin, 32, has been jailed for life for his murder, and will serve a minimum term of 29 years. Her partner - Arthur's father, 29-year-old Thomas Hughes - was sentenced to 21 years for manslaughter. Coventry Crown Court heard social workers visited Arthur's home in April 2020 after his paternal grandmother, a secondary school teacher, called an emergency number to report seeing bruises on his back. But two months before Arthur died from a head injury, Solihull Council workers concluded he was living in a ""happy household"". Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Couple who killed Arthur Labinjo-Hughes jailed Social services in England have to conduct an initial assessment within 45 days of a referral and decide whether a child is in need of further support. If they decide a child is suffering significant harm this should trigger an investigation or protective action, such as increased visits from a social worker. In the worst cases, a child can be removed from a household. The social workers in Arthur's case found there were ""no safeguarding concerns"". Solihull's Local Child Safeguarding Partnership is now carrying out an inquiry into Arthur's death. It said his death had a ""shocking impact on Arthur's family and across the whole community"" and ""it would be inappropriate for the partnership to comment ahead of the findings of that review"". Social services staff should have spoken to Arthur about his bruises, the Director of Association of Child Protection Professionals has said. Wendy Thorogood told Times Radio: ""I would have expected any assessment to really take account of the grandmother's photos. ""I would have expected joint conversations and real conversation with [Arthur], and that appears to have been missed,"" she said. ""Equally, it's a society responsibility, in relation to, his cries were so abnormal if we'd had an anonymous call from one of the neighbours that could have given them more power to do the investigation,"" she said. Lord Laming led the public inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbie, who was killed by her great-aunt and her partner in 2000, and reviewed the case of baby Peter Connelly, who died in 2007 at the hands of his mother, her boyfriend and their lodger. He said the quality of training for social work ""needs to be looked at again"". He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme frontline services had become more focused on crisis rather than prevention due to a reduction in the funding of local authorities over the past decade. He said: ""The whole organisation ought to focus on the front line, on what's happening to children and making sure they intervene earlier rather than later and when it is too late."" Arthur was six years old when he died The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) is also to publish a report into West Midlands Police's handling of the case. The trial was told one of Arthur's uncles sent the force photographs of the boy's bruises - but officers decided they had ""no further role"", as by that time social services had become involved. The IOPC said it ""found no indication any individual behaved in a manner that justified disciplinary proceedings"". There is also the possibility the impact of the Covid lockdown was a factor in Arthur's death. His abuse became worse at start of the first lockdown in spring 2020 - a time the NSPCC charity noted coincided with a 23% increase in calls to its helpline. Former Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield told Today: ""A lot of the services went on to the screens for children, and this child in particular, Arthur, wasn't in school. ""So there's a big lesson there, instantly about if there is a crisis, there are children who are going to slip from view and we have to make sure they have the protection, which does need face-to-face contact."" It is hard to comprehend the cruelty endured by Arthur in his final months. Tragically, his name now joins a list of children over the decades who have been subjected to the most appalling neglect and abuse. Cases where there have been warnings to the authorities but the opportunity to step in has been missed. I have reported on some of the most high profile -Victoria Climbie,externalandBaby Pin London,Khyra Ishaqin Birmingham andDaniel Pelkain Coventry. Names, faces and stories that stay with you. Each involved manipulative, deceitful parents or relatives - and a child who was all but invisible when checks were made. Arthur's stepmother and father certainly manipulated and deceived but what was different for him was lockdown. A pressure-cooker environment for families, when overstretched social workers were dealing with many calls. Now it will be for the independent inquiry to decide whether or not the authorities could have done more to find out what life was really like for Arthur. The number of children dying in England as a direct consequence of maltreatment has ""remained relatively steady"" at 28 per year -according to a government report published last year,externalinto 368 serious case reviews of youngsters, carried out between 2014 and 2017. That was despite a ""steady increase in child protection activity"", it said. Ms Longfield said: ""For anyone who looks at the serious case reviews, or hears about them, that come after a child's death, you will see the same things coming up time and time again. ""Missed opportunities. Lack of co-ordination. Lack of data sharing. The things that professionals need to have at hand to be able to protect these children, which still aren't in place."" She said sometimes there could be high caseloads or a lack of staff experience, adding: ""Certainly it is the case that the services are creaking under financial strain."" Ms Longfield questioned whether the ""thresholds"" for social workers to intervene remained ""too high"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Tough sentences are ""absolutely no consolation"" Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a former children's minister, told Today funding for children's social care had increased but demand had also risen and ""it may be that the social workers here just didn't have the time to get over the threshold"". A 2010 report by Prof Eileen Munro stressed the importance of early intervention before social workers get involved. But there is still no legal requirement on people working with children in England to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect, although there is guidance telling them to do so. Mr Loughton, who commissioned Prof Munro's review, told Today: ""We need to be doing much more. To be knocking on doors, to be snooping around where there are serious suspicions that something is going wrong. ""And for whatever reason in this case, clearly that hasn't happened.""

"Selfridges' Oxford Street store once had 100 departments, including a library and shooting range. Luxury department store group Selfridges is set to be sold to a Thai conglomerate for up to Â£4bn. The UK retailer owns 25 outlets, including a huge flagship store in London's Oxford Street, and branches in Dublin, the Netherlands and Canada. Selfridges' owner, the Weston family, agreed sale terms with Central Group in the last few days, according to the Times,which first reported the deal.,external Selfridges was founded in 1908 by US retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge. It has been owned by the billionaire Westons for 18 years. The Weston family put the chain up for sale in June, a few months after the death of Galen Weston, who oversaw the move to take the department store private in 2003. The family control Selfridges through Wittington Investments Ltd, in Canada, which is separate from the UK arm of the same name that owns a large stake in Primark-owner Associated British Foods. Central Group is a family-owned conglomerate that started in Bangkok but went global when the founder's son, Samrit Chirathivat, opened Thailand's first department store in 1956. It now has 3,700 shops around the world, from supermarkets to electronics outlets, and department stores in Europe. Central Group's non-executive director Vittorio Radice ran Selfridges between 1996 and 2003 and has been managing a department store in Italy since 2006. His role includes responsibility for expansion in Europe. A division of the group, Central Retail, sparked confusion about whether a Selfridges sale had fallen through when it issued a short stock exchange announcement that it was ""not currently involved"" with a deal. However, it is understood the Westons, one of Canada's richest families, are in talks with a different arm of the giant Central Group company. It is unclear why the family has decided to sell, although like many retailers the business has suffered during lockdown and the absence of high-end tourists in city centres. The business had sales of almost Â£2bn in the year to February 2020, but when more recent accounts are published they are likely to show a big fall. Selfridges declined to comment, and Central Group could not be reached.

"One in 60 people in the UK would test positive for Covid in the week ending 27 November - ONS estimates suggest So just over one million (1,087,000) would test positive - up slightly from 1,035,000 last week, the figures show Separately, a UK trial of seven different jabs finds Pfizer and Moderna vaccines give the best booster response And a review finds the risk of catching Covid remains higher for people belonging to certain ethnic groups Scientists in South Africa are meanwhile detecting a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times, as early data suggests Omicron may evade some immunity But experts say it's still too early to say if the new variant - which is driving a new wave there - causes more serious illness A further 50,584 coronavirus cases are reported in the UK, and 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now. Here's a
reminder of the day's main developments:  Today's live page posts were written by Alexandra
Fouche, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Joseph Lee. The live page was edited

the two is not straightforward. The virus
mutates as it jumps between people as well as within a sick person. So in a
population with a low vaccination rate, there will be more infected people
around, and a greater opportunity for the virus to change. But potentially harmful mutations
can take hold when the virus faces new challenges like vaccines â so a
population with some immunity but with the virus widely present is a perfect
environment for new mutations to emerge. It follows that a highly vaccinated
population where infection rates are low probably provides the best barrier
against potentially harmful mutations. The challenge is to get from a low
to a high-vaccination environment as quickly as possible. âA mix is the worst thing, but
unfortunately we all have to pass through having that mix to get to the other
side,â Prof Rowland Kao, a veterinary epidemiologist says. Another factor is how many
people in a population have suppressed immune systems and could be
ill with the virus for a long time, giving it more chance to mutate. One theory is that Omicron emerged in an immunosuppressed person or
population â possibly with untreated HIV which is a big problem in the southern
African region. But this is very difficult to prove without knowing exactly where it first emerged. There are no plans to increase the level of Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland before Christmas, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says. She says the existing restrictions are ""enough"" at this time. The Sinn FÃ©in vice-president also hit out at those responsible for a fake message on social media suggesting a return to lockdown. ""Those engaged in disinformation are shameful, it's causing confusion,"" she says. Read more It remains likely that the Omicron cases identified so far in England are a result of a number of ""separate introductions"" into the country, the UK Health Security Agency says. Its latest statement,externalsays available data is limited at this ""early stage"". Delta remains the predominant variant in England, it says, accounting for more than 99% of all Covid-19 cases. There were 22 confirmed cases of Omicron in England, as of 30 November. A total of 12 of these cases were more than 14 days after receiving at least two doses of vaccine; two were more than 28 days after a first jab; and six were unvaccinated. Two had no available information. None of these cases are known to have resulted in hospitalisation or death, the agency added. Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News Leading HIV and Covid
researcher, Prof Penny Moore, says that two pandemics colliding has
created aâperfect stormâ in South Africa. Prof Moore, from the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, is at the
scientific front line of the mission to understand the threat that the Omicron
variant poses to the world. âUnfortunately in
South Africa we have a massive HIV pandemic and many, many untreated people,â
she told BBC Radio 4âs Inside Science programme. âWhen these people have
a SARS CoV-2 infection, thereâs increased risk theyâll struggle to clear it.
The longer a person has an infection, the higher the odds that the virus will
pick up a mutation that somehow benefits it. âThis is one plausible
explanation for how Omicron - and other variants - emerged.â Prof Moore added that, wherever Omicron emerged, âit
has properties that make it a risk for all of us - whether we're HIV positive
or not. âIt was identified in
South Africa, but it's now across the world. We see community transmission and
transmissions that are not linked to sub-Saharan Africa. Blocking travel to our
country makes it more scientifically difficult to tackle this project.â Prof Moore added that
the techniques and platforms developed for HIV research have accelerated
scientistsâ ability to understand Covid. âWe now need to
transfer that sense of urgency back to HIV,â she told the BBC. You can listen to
Professor Mooreâs full interview with BBC science correspondent Victoria Gill
onInside Science on BBC Sounds. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has seen a rebound of Covid-19 cases over the last
week, particularly in cities that border other countries, and seaports. There
have been 80 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours, many of those close to the
Mongolian border. However, there is not yet any indication the new
variant has reached Chinaâs mainland. Chinaâs official Xinhua news agency said
on Wednesday thatno local cases of Omicron had been detected,external. Papers have stressed over the last week that Chinaâs
zero-Covid strategy â meaning that lockdowns are imposed the moment cases are
discovered - will prevent any variant from being transmitted widely. In the last week,six cases of the new variant have been confirmed in Hong Kong,external, however. Yet all these cases have been imports, meaning that arrivals were quarantined
on entry to the city, and there is no local transmission. If an outbreak were to occur in Hong Kong, it could
threaten imminent plans to make quarantine-free travel possible between
Hong Kong and mainland China. A âHong Kong Health Codeâ system has been launched today to
facilitate this, which will provisionally allow 1,000 people to travel daily
between the two regions - which have different Covid-19 procedures in place -
without needing to quarantine. Registration for this is set to begin on 10
December. As we mentioned earlier, Belgium was going to consider a recommendation to shut schools along with a limit on the number of spectators for indoor events in view of the rising number of cases. We've now heard that they've decided to bring school holidays forward by a week for nurseries and primary schools and masks will be made compulsory in schools from age six. Secondary schools will shift to a
hybrid system, with half of classes being done at home. Officials have also given the go ahead for a limit of 200 spectators to be imposed at indoor events. Bars and restaurants will still be able to open until 23:00. ""We cannot allow the train of infection that is thundering
through our country to continue at its current pace,"" Prime
Minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. With ministers and public health officials urging people toget their booster jabs when eligibleor to take the vaccine for the first time if they have not already, the BBC caught up with three members of a family in Bournemouth - each at different stages of vaccination. Mum Safaa Abdal Motalb was getting her booster while her 16-year-old son Yasin was getting his second dose. Her elder son, 22-year-old Omar, was getting the Covid jab for the first time. Omar said he was scared of needles but added: ""It didn't hurt. ""Itâs
a quick thing to do, you just do it, you donât think about it and you get past
it straight away. It just makes sure the world is a safer place,"" he said. He said he works as an outdoor activity instructor so he's often around children, so it was especially important for him to get protected. Yasin and Safaa said they were keen to get vaccinated because they needed to travel. ""To be
safe, we all need to be safe,"" said Safaa. ""Once
we all have it, it will be safer for the community. You can take it easy and
enjoy yourself,"" said Yasin. A further 50,584 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. There have also been another 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The acceleration of delivering booster jabs will start no later than 13 December, NHS England says. In a letter sent to health leaders, NHS England said the booking service for booster jabs would be updated to reflect the reduction of the time between doses to three months ""as soon as possible and no later than 13 December"". As we've reported before, it confirmed that booster doses would be delivered ""in descending age groups, with priority given to the vaccination of older adults and those in a Covid-19 at-risk group first"". There were ""no supply challenges"" with either Moderna or Pfizer booster stocks, the letter said, and it stressed there was a ""new national mission"" to up the delivery of the jabs. GP surgeries will be allowed to defer routine health checks for those aged 75 and over to free up capacity to deliver the jabs. If you'd like to find out more about the UK's booster rollout and when you'll get your next jab,you can read all about it here. The first case of the Omicron Covid variant has been confirmed in Wales. It was found in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area, and is linked to international travel. The Welsh government says it is prepared to ""respond rapidly"" to the emerging variant, and actions are being taken to slow the spread. The government adds there is no substantial evidence that the variant will lead to a more severe illness. Read more The BBC's Andrew Harding has travelled to the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa where the new Omicron variant is causing concern. ""The new variant? Yes, I'm worried,"" says Fana Dlamini, 43, loading a bucket with sea water for use in what he says is a religious ceremony. Danilia du Plessis, 29, walking by with her two children, agrees: ""I've already had Covid. But we don't know the symptoms of this new variant. So, I'm scared."" She is shocked that only a third of adults in KwaZulu-Natal have so far been vaccinated. Sanele Shabalala (right) and her sisters do not want to be vaccinated Twenty-five-year-old Sanele Shabalala is one of those who has not been jabbed. ""My problem is the government. We don't believe in them, or the system Sanele Shabalala, South African Beside her on a bench, her two sisters nod in agreement and confirm that none of them have been vaccinated. They cite false claims of allergic reactions to the jabs that they read about on social media. Read more here. Reality Check A pop-up vaccination centre in Soweto, South Africa The Omicron variant appears to be
driving a sharp increase in new infections in South Africa. Some 11,500 new coronavirus cases were registered on 2 December. That's a sharp rise on the 8,500
cases confirmed the previous day. ""From the numbers over the last seven days and the curve
depicting them, there is a much steeper upward curve than has ever been seen in
the last three waves,"" says Health Minister Joe Phaahla. Gauteng province accounts for the highest number of coronavirus
infections being reported in the country (about 70%). And last month, Omicron accounted for 74% of all samples sequenced in
South Africa. But most of the sequencing to confirm the variant was done in
Gauteng province, so itâs not yet clear just how prevalent the variant is in other areas. Gauteng is also among three provinces with the lowest vaccination
rates. It has 32% of the adult population fully vaccinated, compared with the
national average of 37%. But even some provinces with higher rates of vaccination have seen sharp rises in case numbers over the past week. Omicron cases in Scotland have jumped by 16 in the past 24 hours to 29. The Scottish government warns cases of the new variant could rise significantly over the coming days as it stresses those reported so far are no longer all linked to a single event. A statement says reported cases are now linked to several different sources - including a Steps concert at the Glasgow Hydro on 22 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says: ""This confirms our view that there is now community transmission of this variant within Scotland. ""Given the nature of transmission we would expect to see cases rise - perhaps significantly - in the days ahead."" Retailers are continuing to put up fuel prices when they should be reducing them in line with savings in wholesale oil prices, the RAC motoring services organisation has said. In response to concerns about the Omicron variant, oil prices fell by around $10 (Â£7.50) a barrel last week. But this reduced wholesale fuel price has not been reflected at the pumps. Retailers added on average another 3.1p to a litre of unleaded petrol and 2.7p to diesel in November. The RAC said this hike in petrol prices was ""completely unjustified"", with larger retailers making a ""shocking"" profit. ""Since Covid, they've been far more reluctant to pass on any savings, even though the frequency with which they buy means they are in a position to pass on any savings in the wholesale price to drivers far more quickly,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told the BBC. ""It would be much fairer if retailers mirrored wholesale prices more closely on a daily or weekly basis."" In particular, the RAC pointed the finger at supermarket chains who are major fuel retailers, such as Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons, saying they should have reduced prices, but had instead increased them ""unnecessarily"".

Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a sign of mounting concern over the Omicron strain of Covid-19, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to come up with a plan for combating it, and also to make more funds available for tackling coronavirus. According toPresident Putin's order published on the Kremlin website,external, the plan must include measures such as making vaccines more effective against Omicron and making more hospital beds available for new patients. The Russian government has four days to work out the plan. Putin gave Russia's regions until 15 December to come up with action plans of their own in consultation with the central health ministry in Moscow. Also today, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova sounded alarm over the continuing epidemic in Russia. ""The virus continues to spread and it is necessary to get vaccinated as soon as possible,"" she told a meeting in Moscow. On 3 December, Russia reported 32,930 new Covid-19 cases and 1,217  deaths. As we've been reporting, South Africa is facing a fourth wave of cases  driven by the newly emerged Omicron variant. Some 11,500 new Covid infections were registered in the latest daily figures. That is a sharp rise on the 8,500 cases confirmed the previous day. By contrast, daily infections were averaging between 200 and 300 in mid-November, as shown in this chart:  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The first real world data showing the coronavirus variant Omicron may evade some of our immunity has been reported by scientists in South Africa. Scientists have detected a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times. It is a rapid analysis and not definitive, but fits with concern about the mutations the variant possesses. It is also not clear what this means for the protection given by vaccines. Scientists have analysed nearly 36,000 suspected re-infections in South Africa to look for any changes to re-infection rates (catching it twice or more) throughout the pandemic. They showed there was no surge in the risk of re-infection during either the Beta or Delta waves. This is despite laboratory studies suggesting those variants had the potential to evade some immunity. However, they are now detecting a spike in re-infections. They have not tested each patient to prove it is Omicron, but they say the timing suggests the variant is the driving force. Read more from James here. Some may be accused of trying to dodge the system to get a vaccine certificate, but maybe none as resourceful at this Italian man. He presented health workers in Biella, north-west Italy, with a fake arm made of silicon. But despite its realistic colour, nobody was fooled by the limb. The man, in his 50s, was reported to local police on Thursday night, AFP news agency reports. ""The case borders on the ridiculous, if it were not for the fact we are talking about a gesture of enormous gravity,"" the head of the Piedmont regional government, Albert Cirio, said in a statement on Facebook. Such an act was ""unacceptable faced with the sacrifice that our entire community has paid during the pandemic, in terms of human lives, the social and economic cost"", he added. There will be significant increases to the UK's hotel quarantine capacity from Monday onwards, the Department of Health says. We have previously heard from from peopletrying to return to the UK from South Africa who could not find availability for quarantine hotels. The government advised travellers to keep checking back for availability and try to arrive on a different date if necessary. UK residents returning from countries on the red list must pay to quarantine in a government-approved facility for 10 days, at a cost of more than Â£2,000 per adult. âWe are rapidly expanding hotel capacity in light of 10 counties being added to the red list, and there will be significant increases to capacity from Monday onwards,"" the Department of Health statement says. Ten southern African countries are on the UK'stravel red list,external, because of fears about Omicron. Read more:What are the Covid rules for travelling to the UK? Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mice have been genetically altered to produce either male- or female-only offspring. Scientists have used gene editing technology to create female-only and male-only litters of mice. Their technique could prevent the destruction of hundreds of thousands of unwanted mice used in research. The team says it could also prevent the slaughter of millions of male chickens in the UK, which are culled because they don't lay eggs. The government is consideringallowing gene editing to be usedby the livestock industry in England. The  technique, which has been outlined in the academic journal Nature Communications, deactivates a gene involved with embryo development. The system can be programmed to kick in for either male or female embryos at a very early stage of development - of between 16 and 32 cells. The researchers believe that the technique could work on farm animals and they are in discussions to set up scientific pilot studies with the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, which is among the world leaders in gene editing of livestock. Dr Peter Ellis of Kent University told BBC News that if the results do translate from the lab to commercial use, they could have a ""far reaching"" impact on animal welfare. ""Between four and six billion chicks in the poultry industry are killed each year worldwide. In principle, we could set up a system so that instead of having chicks having to be killed after birth when they have a nervous system and potentially capable of suffering, those eggs are laid but simply never hatch,"" he said. Compassion in World Farming says millions of male chicks are killed in the UK each year In the first instance though, the new technique could reduce the number of lab mice that are killed because either males or females are required for certain medical experiments. Dr James Turner, from the Francis Crick Institute in London, has identified 25,000 research papers published in the past five years, around 25,000 papers that required male- or female-only mice. ""The numbers of mice used in each case obviously varies,"" he said, ""but the total mouse usage would easily be in the hundreds of thousands. This work could have immediate and valuable impact in scientific laboratories."" An independent report published earlier this week stated thatanimal welfare had to be at the heart of any relaxation of the rulesthat would allow gene editing on farm animals. One of the report authors, Peter Stevenson, who is the chief policy adviser for Compassion in World Farming, says, that he is ""wary"" of gene editing, generally, because it could be used to entrench the factory farming of livestock. but welcomed the possibility of its use to select the sex of chickens. ""We support its use to improve animal welfare, such as ensuring that hens only produce female chicks, as this would prevent the killing of millions of unwanted male chicks in the UK each year."" Barney Reed of the RSPCA said that the technology had to be regulated ""robustly"". ""This is especially pertinent when so many of the touted potential 'benefits' are for dealing with animal welfare or environmental problems created by humans ourselves."" Dr Ellis agrees. ""Any potential use in agriculture, there would need to be extensive public conversation and debate, as well as changes to legislation. ""On the scientific side, there is also much work to be done over a number of years. Further research is needed, first to develop the particular gene editing toolkits for different species, and then to check they are safe and effective."" Whether a mammal is male or female is determined by the sex chromosomes. Females have a pair of X chromosomes - one inherited from the mother and the other from the father. Males, however, have one X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. The researchers were able to prevent either XX or XY mouse embryos from developing by deactivating a gene, the result of which stopped embryos from progressing beyond a very early stage of around 16 to 32 cells. They were able to select for sex by embedding one half of the gene editing molecule, called Crispr-Cas9, which deactivates the gene, into the mother's DNA and the other into the father's X or Y chromosome, depending on what sex was required. The gene can only be deactivated if both parts of Crispr-Cas9 are brought together. If the father's half of the gene editing molecule was on his Y chromosome, once it combines with the mother's DNA containing the other half of the editing molecule, the resulting XY male embryo would have both parts of the molecule that deactivates the gene, preventing further development. But all the female embryos, which did not inherit the molecule from the father, would develop normally. For an all-male litter, half the Crispr-Cas9 is embedded into the father's X chromosome.

"Jonathan Fletcher has seen a surge in cancellations at The Grange Fears about the Omicron Covid variant have led to a raft of cancellations at hotels, with many customers changing their Christmas plans. Best Western GB, which runs 300 UK hotels, told the BBC that around three-quarters of its hotels had experienced event and room booking cancellations. Uncertainty over the Omicron variant has added to safety concerns over large gatherings of people. It has also led to the tightening of rules on travel. Jonathan Fletcher, who manages a Best Western hotel in Dorset called The Grange, says customers have been phoning all week cancelling meals and parties. ""This Saturday night, we were supposed to have 100 people eating in our restaurant. Now there'll only be 12,"" he says ""One local business cancelled because they'd been told by head office not to gather in groups larger than 20 people. Overall, 268 people were booked in for Christmas parties this week. Now we're down to 130."" What are the UK's new travel rules? How are Covid rules and booster jabs changing? Mr Fletcher says people are also cancelling overnight stays. ""We were full for four nights this week, but 35% of our rooms have now been cancelled and we're not receiving bookings to replace them. ""Corporate guests who were coming from abroad have also been cancelling"", he adds He says the cancellations will cost him, and his staff, a lot of money ""We've already placed orders from suppliers, we've spent a fortune on redecorating the hotel for the Christmas season"", he says. ""If this continues, financially, we'd almost be better off in lockdown and having furlough back,"" he adds Cancellations have also been reported by the Arora Group, which is the largest private owner and operator of hotels in the UK. ""It's been a rollercoaster ride,"" said Surinder Arora, the group's founder and chairman. ""Guests who are flying out of the country normally tend to spend a night with us, especially on early morning flights, now a lot of those are being cancelled."" Earlier this week, the government introducednew rules for travel, with every person entering the UK now required to take a PCR test. There are also signs that bookings beyond Christmas are being affected. The Arora Group said some business customers were considering pulling out of events in the new year. ""We had large corporates who had bookings in January, who are now saying: 'Actually we many want to push it back to later in the year',"" Mr Arora said. But trade body UKHospitality, which represents hotels and B&Bs, said that while members were reporting some cancellations, most bookings are robust. ""Anecdotally, some members are seeing cancellation rates of around 10%, so it seems most people are planning to go ahead."" Victoria Erasmus owns a rural hotel in Inverness, Scotland called Glen Mhor and her guests are predominantly from the UK. She remains optimistic about the festive period. ""We've haven't had cancellations yet but we've had a few say they are unsure. It's all been last minute bookings so people are waiting to see what's happening this Christmas,"" she said. ""Covid and all the latest variants make it really difficult to plan ahead."" Best Western's chief executive Tim Rumney has called for clarity on what people should be doing. ""We have had a week of mixed messages about whether people should socialise or not, cancel parties or not and small, independent businesses like our hotels are on the front line feeling the effects of that indecision,"" he said. ""My fear is the damage is already done, and this festive period will need to be written off like last Christmas."" How are travel rules being relaxed? What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?

"Industry leaders argue oil and gas extraction cannot be scaled back too quickly Business leaders have warned that thousands of oil and gas jobs could be at risk in the UK after Shell pulled out of the Cambo oil field development. Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce said a ""premature"" end to domestic production could see some areas suffer the fate of mining communities in the 1980s. Environmentalists say new fossil fuel projects like Cambo are incompatible with action on climate change. Cambo's majority stakeholder said it still planned to take it forward. Siccar Point Energy is currently awaiting approval from the UK government to develop the field. Shell pulls out of Cambo oil field development Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Chief executive Jonathan Roger said other countries including Norway were investing in new oil and gas alongside renewables as part of a transition to sustainable energy. He added: ""The UK is at risk of damaging its economy and increasing imports with a higher carbon impact if new developments are not brought forward during this time."" Shell, which has faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo, said it now believed the economic case for investment was ""not strong enough"". Greenpeace welcomed the announcement, describing it as the ""death blow"" for the plans. But industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo were still needed. External relations director Jenny Stanning said: ""This is a commercial decision between partners but doesn't change the facts that the UK will continue to need new oil and gas projects if we are to protect security of supply, avoid increasing reliance on imports and support jobs."" It is too early to write the obituary of the North Sea oil and gas industry, despite claims by some environmental campaigners that Shell's decision marks the beginning of the end. That's because, whatever Shell says in public, this is about reputational cost not conventional economics. Battling environmentalists and the Scottish government for the right to drill for oil is not a good look for a company that claims to be transitioning away from fossil fuels. But the Cambo oilfield is reckoned to hold hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, each worth some $70 at current prices, and there are lots of less high-profile companies who would be willing to suffer some bad publicity for a cut of that prize. So, the real question Shell's decision raises is whether the UK government is willing to put its net-zero ambitions ahead of the huge tax revenues the project could deliver and deny a licence to develop the oilfield. The chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce called for a ""reasoned debate"" about oil and gas extraction, which he said supported thousands of UK jobs. Russell Borthwick said there was enormous potential for the renewable energy sector in the region but he warned against a ""knee jerk"" reaction to climate change. He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""If we get this wrong, all of those people and organisations demanding a premature end to domestic oil and gas production might want to be able to reflect back to their role in scripting a repeat of what happened to our mining communities in the 1980s."" The fallout from the 1984/85 miners strike and the long term decline of UK coal mining left many communities facing high unemployment and other problems thatwere still being felt decades later. Businessman Sir Ian Wood chairs Aberdeen's Energy Transition Zone, a not-for-profit company set up to support the shift to renewable energy. He said: ""We must not create an adverse investment environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey. ""The future prosperity of our region and the country's ability to meet net zero, depends on it."" Located in the North Atlantic, about 125km (75 miles) north west of the Shetland islands. Major stakeholder is Siccar Point Energy, with a 70% stake, backed by private equity firm investors. Siccar Point Energy says Cambo could deliver 170 million barrels of oil over 25 years, and 53.5 billion cubic feet of gas. The exploration licences dates back to 2001, but UK government must approve drilling - which could start as early as 2022. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie welcomed Shell's announcement and said it made it less likely Cambo would go ahead in the ""near term"". ""It's absurd to suggest that our transition to a zero carbon economy depends on drilling for ever more oil and gas,"" he said. He said Scotland had a quarter of Europe's wind energy potential, and that investment should be focused on renewables instead. ""We could be exporting renewable resources and make that the backbone of Scotland's economy,"" he told the BBC. He continued: ""The idea of keeping global warming below 2 degrees and 1.5 degrees if we possibly can - this is not optional. ""This is not a normal political choice. This is mission critical for our survival. ""It is humanity's only survival strategy and we need to invest now in the transition that has to be fair, but it has to be fast."" Activists at the COP26 summit called for the Cambo development to be blocked Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the Highlands on Friday for an announcement on plans fora major offshore wind turbine tower factory. She said Shell had made ""a commercial decision"" and that it was ""for others to determine what that means in terms of the economic viability"" of Cambo. ""I have made my views clear that it shouldn't be given the green light, it should be subjected to a very rigorous climate assessment. ""But it does illustrate the importance of accelerating that transition from fossil fuels to low carbon alternatives. ""Nobody is saying that we can shut oil and gas off overnight. We cannot do that and nobody is saying, least of all me, that we leave those currently working in oil and gas on the scrap heap."" The UK government, which makes the final decision on whether to allow drilling, insists an environmental impact assessment will be carried out but appears far more supportive. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has said the new field should""100%"" get the go-ahead. On Friday, Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK government ""continues to have a very strong commitment to the oil and gas sector and to the North Sea transition deal that we did a year ago. ""For some years to come we will be very dependent as a country on gas in particular, and we need to make sure that the gas continues to come from the UK continental shelf to the UK."" He also said that the government had a ""very strong"" net zero commitment.

"An illustration of how the new factory would look The UK's largest factory for making steel towers for offshore wind turbines looks set to be built in the Highlands. The Â£110m facility has been proposed for Port of Nigg on the Cromarty Firth. Inverness-headquartered Global Energy Group, which owns the port, and Spanish company Haizea Wind Group are behind the plans. The investment needed would come from a syndicate which includes SSE Renewables, in addition to funding from the Scottish and UK governments. The Nigg Offshore Wind factory would employ 400 people and in a year could roll 135 steel plate for towers each weighing more than 1,000 tonnes. Construction of the facility could start next year, subject to the project successfully securing the finance package needed. The announcement follows recent closures of Scottish yards that manufactured wind farm components. A wind turbine factory in Campbeltown, Argyll,closed earlier this year. The Scottish government put more than Â£37m into three BiFab yards in Fife and Lewis for fabricating offshore platforms. The yards later went into administration, though the Lewis sitehas since secured work under new ownership. The factory could eventually export towers for use across Europe Nigg is a deepwater port with large dry dock facilities. It is used for storing offshore wind farm components and refurbishment work to oil industry rigs. The new facility would be designed to supply towers and other large tubular components suitable for both the fixed and floating offshore wind farms. The initial contracts for tower supply would be focused on UK domestic supply, but its backers suggest the factory would be in high demand for export of towers and other products to across Europe up until 2050. Tim Cornelius, of Global Energy, said that despite the struggles faced by other yards investment had to be consistently made into cutting edge technology to be competitive in a ""global landscape"". He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""What we look forward to is announcing some of the big contracts in the near future supplying some of the biggest wind projects in the UK."" Public agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be providing the Scottish government's support to the project. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the development represented the ""most significant industrial announcement for some time"". She said: ""We need bold, collective action to tackle the global climate emergency, and the growth of our renewables sector over the next 10 years will be truly transformative, helping to deliver a just transition to net zero and a greener, fairer future for us all. ""This significant investment in Scotland's energy sector is testament to the skills, expertise and innovation within our industry."" The UK government said the project would bring a jobs boost to Easter Ross and the surrounding area. Scotland Minister Malcolm Offord said: ""We have long been recognised for our expertise in the energy industry and now our skilled workforce is leading the way in our transition to a greener future. ""It's especially fitting that this area, synonymous with the oil boom in the 1970s, is leading the way as we embrace new cleaner sources of power."" SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: ""Today's announcement shows that SSE is willing to put its money where its mouth is to support development of the Scottish manufacturing capability for the offshore wind sector. ""We have worked with Global Energy Group and stakeholders for more than two years to get to this point."" Scottish Renewables and Highland Council have welcomed the venture. Earlier this week, separate plans were announced for a ""hub"" building concrete foundations for floating offshore wind farmsat Ardersier on the Moray Firth.

"New MP Louie French wore predecessor Mr Brokenshire's rosette on election night as a mark of respect The Conservatives have held the safe suburban London seat of Old Bexley and Sidcup in a by-election. Their candidate, local councillor Louie French, won more than half the votes, with Labour's Daniel Francis second. Mr French paid tribute to the area's former MP, James Brokenshire, whose death from cancer in October triggered the contest. The Tories' majority has been cut from nearly 19,000 to 4,478, with a 10% swing to Labour. In an email to supporters, the new Conservative MP said party members ""don't have time to rest on our laurels"" and urged them to donate funds to help with campaigning in the next by-election in two weeks' time. The North Shropshire seat was vacated by Owen Paterson,who resigned after breaking lobbying rules. Although votes at mid-term polls are usually lower than at general elections, the 34% turnout on Thursday was the lowest at a by-election since 2018. Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - came third with 6.6% of the vote, with the party's leader and candidate Richard Tice describing it as a ""massive result"". The Green Party and Liberal Democrats both lost their deposits. By-election: Tory wobbles in true blue Bexley? Tributes to MP Brokenshire, who has died aged 53 Bexley is a traditionally strong area for the Conservatives and the party has held the constituency in its current form since its creation in 1983. Labour's Ellie Reeves, MP for nearby Lewisham West and Penge, said she was ""pleased with the result"". ""This is a Conservative stronghold, somewhere that had a 19,000 majority at the last general election and what we've seen tonight is that majority being slashed,"" she added. But Tory Party chairman Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast the reduced majority for his party ""reflected a very low turnout"". He described the victory as a ""good solid result for us"", adding it was consistent with elections held in the middle of a Parliament. Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""This idea that Labour have made some surge ahead is really for the birds."" by Ione Wells, BBC political correspondent This Conservative hold hasn't taken anyone by surprise. It's a seat as ""true blue"" as they come. Expectation management from the opposition parties has been going on for weeks - with all of them privately admitting the Tories' 19,000-strong majority would be very difficult to overturn. Labour are encouraged by the 10% swing to them, claiming that as a positive sign for more marginal seats in future elections. But retaining more than half the votes is a good result for the Tories too. Senior MPs who have knocked doors here in recent weeks all pointed out that governing parties used to get a hammering in midterm by-elections - seen by some voters as a free hit to send the government a message, without significantly shifting the power balance in Westminster. The Lib Dems were not expecting a good result here at all, instead throwing all their resources at the North Shropshire by-election in two weeks' time. In that contest they hope to replicate their stunning victory in Chesham and Amersham, where they overturned a large Tory majority. Tory nerves have been more tangible about that by-election - where all sides feel there is a lot more to play for. The Bexley by-election was prompted by the death of former MP James Brokenshire, who died from lung cancer aged 53 in October. At the 2019 general election, he held the south-east London seat with a majority of almost 19,000, taking 64.5% of the vote. Wearing the rosette of his predecessor, Mr French paid an emotional tribute to him in his acceptance speech, adding that the contest had been tough but ""fought with dignity"". He vowed to ""work tirelessly to repay the trust that you've placed in me and I will not let you down"". ""My focus will now be delivering on those promises that I made during the campaign - get our fair share of London's police officers, securing more investment for local schools and hospitals, protecting our precious green spaces.""

"Frank Beddard of Cowshill, County Durham, said he could have done with a visit from the Army the day after the storm hit The electricity supplier for the North East has warned that some homes will still be without power on Wednesday - 12 days after Storm Arwen struck. Northern Powergrid (NP) said its ""best estimate"" was that all of its 6,600 customers still off would be connected by Thursday. Earlier, a major incident was declared in Northumberland and the Army was drafted in to County Durham for help. In Cumbria, 1,300 households were without electricity on Friday evening. Regulator Ofgem has launched an ""urgent"" review into the energy network companies' response to the widespread cuts. Army called in after a week without power Ofgem to review power networks' response Surviving seven days without electricity Jim Cardwell, head of policy development at NP, said it had restored connections to about 98% of its customers since the storm knocked out supplies to hundreds of thousands of homes across the north of England on 26 November. ""We've allocated 700 engineering projects to get people back on,"" he told BBC Look North. ""Two hundred of those projects will be taking place up until Sunday with the other 500 to come. ""Our best estimate is that will take until the end of Wednesday for those 500 projects."" In response to criticism of NP's communication, he vowed it would ""start publishing information on our website, sending text messages and, where we have a community presence, giving out information locally"". He added: ""We don't want any distractions from getting the lights back on, communicating with our customers and helping with the welfare support with the other agencies involved in the emergencies that have been declared in County Durham and Northumberland."" Army personnel have been handing out parcels with hot water bottles, hats, blankets, gloves and thermal socks Durham County Council called in troops, it said, because NP was ""unable to confirm when supplies will be restored"". On Friday, soldiers distributed hundreds of emergency aid parcels to people entering a second week without power. Frank Beddard, of Cowshill, was grateful for his but said it had come too late. ""I just wish they'd been here six days ago. Boris Johnson should have said 'there's a problem up north, get up there'."" Jessica Teasdale, from Stanley in County Durham, told the PA news agency: ""People are frustrated and angryâ¦ everyone is getting ill. ""I saw my elderly neighbour yesterday, the poor man looked like he was going to cry. He's a vulnerable person but no-one has checked on him and he lives alone."" Her partner, Christopher Bertram, added: ""I am sitting looking at Jessica now and she is a wreck. She hasn't slept or washed properly for a week. She's like a shell of a person. It is awful to watch."" Christopher Bertram and Jessica Teasdale eventually had their power restored on Friday Durhamdeclared a major incidenton Thursday with supplies to thousands of properties in areas including Teesdale and Weardale still off. Amanda Hopgood, leader of Durham County Council, said she understood people were frustrated with the time it took to ramp up their response. ""Once we've made certain everyone is all right we will be looking to see what lessons can be learned. ""It wasn't that we weren't doing anything last weekend, we were, but as well as the power cuts we had roads blocked with snow."" Candles are in high demand in parts of Northumberland, the county's high sheriff said Northumberland County Council cited ""ongoing concerns"" for affected communities when it announced its additional measures. But there are also people who have questioned the amount of time it took for the authority to respond. Joanne Riddell, the high sheriff of Northumberland, said: ""Many people have told me there should have been a major incident declared on Saturday. ""Right now there is an urgent need for candles, torches, batteries, gas cylinders, camping stoves, hot water bottles and dry, cut firewood."" Jonathan Strutt, 43, lives in the small village of Kirkheaton in Northumberland, with his severely disabled 72-year-old mother, his wife and five-year-old son. They lasted three nights in their home before it became too cold and friends in Hexham took them in. He told the BBC: ""We have had to move into a friend's living room with my mother sleeping on their sofa while we sleep on the floor with our child.

"Frank Beddard of Cowshill, County Durham, said he could have done with a visit from the Army the day after the storm hit The electricity supplier for the North East has warned that some homes will still be without power on Wednesday - 12 days after Storm Arwen struck. Northern Powergrid (NP) said its ""best estimate"" was that all of its 6,600 customers still off would be connected by Thursday. Earlier, a major incident was declared in Northumberland and the Army was drafted in to County Durham for help. In Cumbria, 1,300 households were without electricity on Friday evening. Regulator Ofgem has launched an ""urgent"" review into the energy network companies' response to the widespread cuts. Army called in after a week without power Ofgem to review power networks' response Surviving seven days without electricity Jim Cardwell, head of policy development at NP, said it had restored connections to about 98% of its customers since the storm knocked out supplies to hundreds of thousands of homes across the north of England on 26 November. ""We've allocated 700 engineering projects to get people back on,"" he told BBC Look North. ""Two hundred of those projects will be taking place up until Sunday with the other 500 to come. ""Our best estimate is that will take until the end of Wednesday for those 500 projects."" In response to criticism of NP's communication, he vowed it would ""start publishing information on our website, sending text messages and, where we have a community presence, giving out information locally"". He added: ""We don't want any distractions from getting the lights back on, communicating with our customers and helping with the welfare support with the other agencies involved in the emergencies that have been declared in County Durham and Northumberland."" Army personnel have been handing out parcels with hot water bottles, hats, blankets, gloves and thermal socks Durham County Council called in troops, it said, because NP was ""unable to confirm when supplies will be restored"". On Friday, soldiers distributed hundreds of emergency aid parcels to people entering a second week without power. Frank Beddard, of Cowshill, was grateful for his but said it had come too late. ""I just wish they'd been here six days ago. Boris Johnson should have said 'there's a problem up north, get up there'."" Jessica Teasdale, from Stanley in County Durham, told the PA news agency: ""People are frustrated and angryâ¦ everyone is getting ill. ""I saw my elderly neighbour yesterday, the poor man looked like he was going to cry. He's a vulnerable person but no-one has checked on him and he lives alone."" Her partner, Christopher Bertram, added: ""I am sitting looking at Jessica now and she is a wreck. She hasn't slept or washed properly for a week. She's like a shell of a person. It is awful to watch."" Christopher Bertram and Jessica Teasdale eventually had their power restored on Friday Durhamdeclared a major incidenton Thursday with supplies to thousands of properties in areas including Teesdale and Weardale still off.

""Once we've made certain everyone is all right we will be looking to see what lessons can be learned. ""It wasn't that we weren't doing anything last weekend, we were, but as well as the power cuts we had roads blocked with snow."" Candles are in high demand in parts of Northumberland, the county's high sheriff said Northumberland County Council cited ""ongoing concerns"" for affected communities when it announced its additional measures. But there are also people who have questioned the amount of time it took for the authority to respond. Joanne Riddell, the high sheriff of Northumberland, said: ""Many people have told me there should have been a major incident declared on Saturday.

"One in 60 people in the UK would test positive for Covid in the week ending 27 November - ONS estimates suggest So just over one million (1,087,000) would test positive - up slightly from 1,035,000 last week, the figures show Separately, a UK trial of seven different jabs finds Pfizer and Moderna vaccines give the best booster response And a review finds the risk of catching Covid remains higher for people belonging to certain ethnic groups Scientists in South Africa are meanwhile detecting a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times, as early data suggests Omicron may evade some immunity But experts say it's still too early to say if the new variant - which is driving a new wave there - causes more serious illness A further 50,584 coronavirus cases are reported in the UK, and 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now. Here's a
reminder of the day's main developments:  Today's live page posts were written by Alexandra
Fouche, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Joseph Lee. The live page was edited
by Holly Wallis and Lauren Turner. Thanks for joining us. Rachel SchraerBBC Reality Check Low vaccination rates might be one reason for variants The Omicron variant was first identified in South Africa, in a region with relatively low rates of vaccination. But making a link between
the two is not straightforward. The virus
mutates as it jumps between people as well as within a sick person. So in a
population with a low vaccination rate, there will be more infected people
around, and a greater opportunity for the virus to change. But potentially harmful mutations
can take hold when the virus faces new challenges like vaccines â so a
population with some immunity but with the virus widely present is a perfect
environment for new mutations to emerge. It follows that a highly vaccinated
population where infection rates are low probably provides the best barrier
against potentially harmful mutations. The challenge is to get from a low
to a high-vaccination environment as quickly as possible. âA mix is the worst thing, but
unfortunately we all have to pass through having that mix to get to the other
side,â Prof Rowland Kao, a veterinary epidemiologist says. Another factor is how many
people in a population have suppressed immune systems and could be
ill with the virus for a long time, giving it more chance to mutate. One theory is that Omicron emerged in an immunosuppressed person or
population â possibly with untreated HIV which is a big problem in the southern
African region. But this is very difficult to prove without knowing exactly where it first emerged. There are no plans to increase the level of Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland before Christmas, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says. She says the existing restrictions are ""enough"" at this time. The Sinn FÃ©in vice-president also hit out at those responsible for a fake message on social media suggesting a return to lockdown. ""Those engaged in disinformation are shameful, it's causing confusion,"" she says. Read more It remains likely that the Omicron cases identified so far in England are a result of a number of ""separate introductions"" into the country, the UK Health Security Agency says. Its latest statement,externalsays available data is limited at this ""early stage"". Delta remains the predominant variant in England, it says, accounting for more than 99% of all Covid-19 cases. There were 22 confirmed cases of Omicron in England, as of 30 November. A total of 12 of these cases were more than 14 days after receiving at least two doses of vaccine; two were more than 28 days after a first jab; and six were unvaccinated. Two had no available information. None of these cases are known to have resulted in hospitalisation or death, the agency added. Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News Leading HIV and Covid
researcher, Prof Penny Moore, says that two pandemics colliding has
created aâperfect stormâ in South Africa. Prof Moore, from the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, is at the
scientific front line of the mission to understand the threat that the Omicron
variant poses to the world. âUnfortunately in
South Africa we have a massive HIV pandemic and many, many untreated people,â
she told BBC Radio 4âs Inside Science programme. âWhen these people have
a SARS CoV-2 infection, thereâs increased risk theyâll struggle to clear it.
The longer a person has an infection, the higher the odds that the virus will
pick up a mutation that somehow benefits it. âThis is one plausible
explanation for how Omicron - and other variants - emerged.â Prof Moore added that, wherever Omicron emerged, âit
has properties that make it a risk for all of us - whether we're HIV positive
or not. âIt was identified in
South Africa, but it's now across the world. We see community transmission and
transmissions that are not linked to sub-Saharan Africa. Blocking travel to our
country makes it more scientifically difficult to tackle this project.â Prof Moore added that
the techniques and platforms developed for HIV research have accelerated
scientistsâ ability to understand Covid. âWe now need to
transfer that sense of urgency back to HIV,â she told the BBC. You can listen to
Professor Mooreâs full interview with BBC science correspondent Victoria Gill
onInside Science on BBC Sounds. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has seen a rebound of Covid-19 cases over the last
week, particularly in cities that border other countries, and seaports. There
have been 80 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours, many of those close to the
Mongolian border. However, there is not yet any indication the new
variant has reached Chinaâs mainland. Chinaâs official Xinhua news agency said
on Wednesday thatno local cases of Omicron had been detected,external. Papers have stressed over the last week that Chinaâs
zero-Covid strategy â meaning that lockdowns are imposed the moment cases are
discovered - will prevent any variant from being transmitted widely. In the last week,six cases of the new variant have been confirmed in Hong Kong,external, however. Yet all these cases have been imports, meaning that arrivals were quarantined
on entry to the city, and there is no local transmission. If an outbreak were to occur in Hong Kong, it could
threaten imminent plans to make quarantine-free travel possible between
Hong Kong and mainland China. A âHong Kong Health Codeâ system has been launched today to
facilitate this, which will provisionally allow 1,000 people to travel daily
between the two regions - which have different Covid-19 procedures in place -
without needing to quarantine. Registration for this is set to begin on 10
December. As we mentioned earlier, Belgium was going to consider a recommendation to shut schools along with a limit on the number of spectators for indoor events in view of the rising number of cases. We've now heard that they've decided to bring school holidays forward by a week for nurseries and primary schools and masks will be made compulsory in schools from age six. Secondary schools will shift to a
hybrid system, with half of classes being done at home. Officials have also given the go ahead for a limit of 200 spectators to be imposed at indoor events. Bars and restaurants will still be able to open until 23:00. ""We cannot allow the train of infection that is thundering
through our country to continue at its current pace,"" Prime
Minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. With ministers and public health officials urging people toget their booster jabs when eligibleor to take the vaccine for the first time if they have not already, the BBC caught up with three members of a family in Bournemouth - each at different stages of vaccination. Mum Safaa Abdal Motalb was getting her booster while her 16-year-old son Yasin was getting his second dose. Her elder son, 22-year-old Omar, was getting the Covid jab for the first time. Omar said he was scared of needles but added: ""It didn't hurt. ""Itâs
a quick thing to do, you just do it, you donât think about it and you get past
it straight away. It just makes sure the world is a safer place,"" he said. He said he works as an outdoor activity instructor so he's often around children, so it was especially important for him to get protected. Yasin and Safaa said they were keen to get vaccinated because they needed to travel. ""To be
safe, we all need to be safe,"" said Safaa. ""Once
we all have it, it will be safer for the community. You can take it easy and
enjoy yourself,"" said Yasin. A further 50,584 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. There have also been another 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The acceleration of delivering booster jabs will start no later than 13 December, NHS England says. In a letter sent to health leaders, NHS England said the booking service for booster jabs would be updated to reflect the reduction of the time between doses to three months ""as soon as possible and no later than 13 December"". As we've reported before, it confirmed that booster doses would be delivered ""in descending age groups, with priority given to the vaccination of older adults and those in a Covid-19 at-risk group first"". There were ""no supply challenges"" with either Moderna or Pfizer booster stocks, the letter said, and it stressed there was a ""new national mission"" to up the delivery of the jabs. GP surgeries will be allowed to defer routine health checks for those aged 75 and over to free up capacity to deliver the jabs.

The first case of the Omicron Covid variant has been confirmed in Wales. It was found in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area, and is linked to international travel. The Welsh government says it is prepared to ""respond rapidly"" to the emerging variant, and actions are being taken to slow the spread. The government adds there is no substantial evidence that the variant will lead to a more severe illness.

Yes, I'm worried,"" says Fana Dlamini, 43, loading a bucket with sea water for use in what he says is a religious ceremony. Danilia du Plessis, 29, walking by with her two children, agrees: ""I've already had Covid. But we don't know the symptoms of this new variant. So, I'm scared."" She is shocked that only a third of adults in KwaZulu-Natal have so far been vaccinated. Sanele Shabalala (right) and her sisters do not want to be vaccinated Twenty-five-year-old Sanele Shabalala is one of those who has not been jabbed. ""My problem is the government.

Reality Check A pop-up vaccination centre in Soweto, South Africa The Omicron variant appears to be
driving a sharp increase in new infections in South Africa. Some 11,500 new coronavirus cases were registered on 2 December. That's a sharp rise on the 8,500
cases confirmed the previous day. ""From the numbers over the last seven days and the curve
depicting them, there is a much steeper upward curve than has ever been seen in
the last three waves,"" says Health Minister Joe Phaahla. Gauteng province accounts for the highest number of coronavirus
infections being reported in the country (about 70%). And last month, Omicron accounted for 74% of all samples sequenced in
South Africa. But most of the sequencing to confirm the variant was done in
Gauteng province, so itâs not yet clear just how prevalent the variant is in other areas. Gauteng is also among three provinces with the lowest vaccination
rates. It has 32% of the adult population fully vaccinated, compared with the
national average of 37%. But even some provinces with higher rates of vaccination have seen sharp rises in case numbers over the past week. Omicron cases in Scotland have jumped by 16 in the past 24 hours to 29. The Scottish government warns cases of the new variant could rise significantly over the coming days as it stresses those reported so far are no longer all linked to a single event. A statement says reported cases are now linked to several different sources - including a Steps concert at the Glasgow Hydro on 22 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says: ""This confirms our view that there is now community transmission of this variant within Scotland. ""Given the nature of transmission we would expect to see cases rise - perhaps significantly - in the days ahead."" Retailers are continuing to put up fuel prices when they should be reducing them in line with savings in wholesale oil prices, the RAC motoring services organisation has said. In response to concerns about the Omicron variant, oil prices fell by around $10 (Â£7.50) a barrel last week. But this reduced wholesale fuel price has not been reflected at the pumps. Retailers added on average another 3.1p to a litre of unleaded petrol and 2.7p to diesel in November. The RAC said this hike in petrol prices was ""completely unjustified"", with larger retailers making a ""shocking"" profit. ""Since Covid, they've been far more reluctant to pass on any savings, even though the frequency with which they buy means they are in a position to pass on any savings in the wholesale price to drivers far more quickly,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told the BBC. ""It would be much fairer if retailers mirrored wholesale prices more closely on a daily or weekly basis."" In particular, the RAC pointed the finger at supermarket chains who are major fuel retailers, such as Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons, saying they should have reduced prices, but had instead increased them ""unnecessarily"".

Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a sign of mounting concern over the Omicron strain of Covid-19, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to come up with a plan for combating it, and also to make more funds available for tackling coronavirus. According toPresident Putin's order published on the Kremlin website,external, the plan must include measures such as making vaccines more effective against Omicron and making more hospital beds available for new patients. The Russian government has four days to work out the plan. Putin gave Russia's regions until 15 December to come up with action plans of their own in consultation with the central health ministry in Moscow. Also today, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova sounded alarm over the continuing epidemic in Russia. ""The virus continues to spread and it is necessary to get vaccinated as soon as possible,"" she told a meeting in Moscow. On 3 December, Russia reported 32,930 new Covid-19 cases and 1,217  deaths. As we've been reporting, South Africa is facing a fourth wave of cases  driven by the newly emerged Omicron variant. Some 11,500 new Covid infections were registered in the latest daily figures. That is a sharp rise on the 8,500 cases confirmed the previous day. By contrast, daily infections were averaging between 200 and 300 in mid-November, as shown in this chart:  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The first real world data showing the coronavirus variant Omicron may evade some of our immunity has been reported by scientists in South Africa. Scientists have detected a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times. It is a rapid analysis and not definitive, but fits with concern about the mutations the variant possesses. It is also not clear what this means for the protection given by vaccines. Scientists have analysed nearly 36,000 suspected re-infections in South Africa to look for any changes to re-infection rates (catching it twice or more) throughout the pandemic. They showed there was no surge in the risk of re-infection during either the Beta or Delta waves. This is despite laboratory studies suggesting those variants had the potential to evade some immunity. However, they are now detecting a spike in re-infections. They have not tested each patient to prove it is Omicron, but they say the timing suggests the variant is the driving force. Read more from James here. Some may be accused of trying to dodge the system to get a vaccine certificate, but maybe none as resourceful at this Italian man. He presented health workers in Biella, north-west Italy, with a fake arm made of silicon. But despite its realistic colour, nobody was fooled by the limb. The man, in his 50s, was reported to local police on Thursday night, AFP news agency reports. ""The case borders on the ridiculous, if it were not for the fact we are talking about a gesture of enormous gravity,"" the head of the Piedmont regional government, Albert Cirio, said in a statement on Facebook. Such an act was ""unacceptable faced with the sacrifice that our entire community has paid during the pandemic, in terms of human lives, the social and economic cost"", he added. There will be significant increases to the UK's hotel quarantine capacity from Monday onwards, the Department of Health says. We have previously heard from from peopletrying to return to the UK from South Africa who could not find availability for quarantine hotels. The government advised travellers to keep checking back for availability and try to arrive on a different date if necessary. UK residents returning from countries on the red list must pay to quarantine in a government-approved facility for 10 days, at a cost of more than Â£2,000 per adult. âWe are rapidly expanding hotel capacity in light of 10 counties being added to the red list, and there will be significant increases to capacity from Monday onwards,"" the Department of Health statement says.

"Moxon (left) and Gale (right) were both criticised by Azeem Rafiq when the former Yorkshire player spoke to MPs Director of cricket Martyn Moxon, head coach Andrew Gale and all members of the coaching staff are among 16 people to have left Yorkshire amid the racism scandal. A report found former player Azeem Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at Yorkshire. Former captain Gale says he will begin a legal fight against the club's decision to sack him. ""The decision has come as a surprise to me,"" he told BBC Sport in a statement. ""The players knew about it before I did and I will be fighting the decision legally."" Gale had beensuspendedas part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010. Moxon had been Yorkshire's director of cricket since 2007. ""Significant change is required at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and we are committed to taking whatever action is necessary to regain trust,"" said Lord Patel, the club's new chair. ""The decisions announced today were difficult to make, but are in the best interests of the club. ""Without making important changes to how we are run, we cannot move on from the past to become a culture which is progressive and inclusive."" A Yorkshire statement said a new director of cricket will be appointed ""imminently"". What is English cricket's racism scandal all about? Yorkshire to undergo governance review Vaughan ""sorry"" for hurt Rafiq has suffered Moxon, a former Yorkshire and England batter, was scheduled to appear before MPs at the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee on 16 November but was absent from work because of a ""stress-related illness"". Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire in two spells between 2008 and 2018, told the committee that racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time at the club and described English cricket as""institutionally racist"". At the hearing, Rafiq said that the day after his son was still-born in 2017, Moxon ""ripped shreds"" off him in a manner he had never seen the director of cricket use when addressing anyone else at Yorkshire. Rafiq detailed his experiences at Yorkshire, which left him close to taking his own life, for the first time in September 2020. After thefindings of the report were releaseda year later, Yorkshire originally saidno-one at the club would be disciplined. Roger Hutton, Yorkshire's former chairman who resigned in November, said Moxon and former chief executive Mark Arthur ""failed to accept the gravity of the situation"". Arthurresigned last month. The Yorkshire-commissioned investigation was widely criticised after it reportedly found a racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him while at the club and concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". Gale has spent his entire career at Yorkshire, first as a player after making his debut in 2004, then as captain between 2009 and 2016 before he ended his playing career at the age of 32 in order to take up the head coach role. This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire Speaking at the DCMS committee hearing, Rafiq said Yorkshire became ""toxic"" after Gary Ballance took over as captain, shortly after Gale replaced previous coach Jason Gillespie. Ballance, a former England batter, admitted he was responsible for some of the offensive terms Rafiq was subjected to during his time at Headingley. Rafiq said Gale's attitude towards the death of Rafiq's son was that Rafiq was ""making it more than what it is"", and that ""hardly anyone"" asked after his and his wife's wellbeing. Gale was suspended by Yorkshire on 9 November after the Jewish News reported he sent a now-deleted tweet containing an anti-Semitic slur to former Leeds United head of media Paul Dews. ""We want to make Yorkshire County Cricket Club a place for everyone, from all backgrounds,"" Patel said. ""To do this, we need to rebuild our culture and instil positive values in everyone associated with Yorkshire. We are determined to learn from the mistakes of the past to become a club which people can trust."" In response to the way Yorkshire handled Rafiq's claims, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)suspended them from staging England matchesat their Headingley home. Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave also shared their experiences of racism at the club. Thirty-six people contacted Yorkshire's independent whistleblower hotline - set up to allow any other victims of discrimination at the club to come forward - in its first week of operation. On Thursday, it was confirmed Yorkshire will undergo an independent review into club governance. The ECB haspublished a five-point plandesigned to tackle racism and discrimination that includes a ""full review of dressing-room culture"".

In particular, the RAC pointed the finger at supermarket chains who are major fuel retailers, such as Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons, saying they should have reduced prices, but had instead increased them ""unnecessarily"". Why it's the end of the road for petrol stations What's happening about petrol shortages? Petrol prices at eight-year high, says RAC ""Since Covid they've been far more reluctant to pass on any savings, even though the frequency with which they buy means they are in a position to pass on any savings in the wholesale price to drivers far more quickly,"" RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams told the BBC. ""It would be much fairer if retailers mirrored wholesale prices more closely on a daily or weekly basis."" A spokesperson from the British Retail Consortium said: ""Supermarkets are keen to provide their customers with the best value for petrol through their forecourts, offering the cheapest petrol in the country. ""However, prices at the pump will be influenced by various forces, including tax, oil prices and operational costs."" The RAC has urged the government to intervene and said the chancellor's fuel duty freeze last month is not enough. ""The government should ask the biggest retailers to explain why they're charging such high prices for fuel when wholesale prices have dropped,"" Mr Williams added. A government spokesperson said: ""Fuel prices are increasing in countries across the world and this is not an issue unique to the UK. ""We've provided Â£4.2bn of support to help people with the cost of living, including effectively cutting taxes for workers on Universal Credit, providing Â£500m of targeted support for the most vulnerable families and freezing fuel duty for the twelfth year in a row."" Analysis by the RAC found that despite wholesale costs having fallen by 7p from the middle of the month, retailers continued to put prices up, with the average cost of a litre of unleaded petrol ending the month at 147.28p and diesel up to 150.64p. Prices for both fuels peaked at record highs on 20 November and 21 November respectively - diesel reaching 151.1p per litre and petrol at 147.72p. The key factor affecting petrol is the wholesale oil market, meaning any reduction in the oil price should result in buyers paying less at the pumps. While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is competitively driven. That means the cost motorists are charged is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Mr Williams explained that the current margins big retailers are making have gone up as high as 20p a litre, which is ""unheard of when everyone is driving"". ""Sadly, our data shows all too clearly that drivers are being taken for a ride by retailers at the moment,"" he said. However, on Tuesday, motoring group the AA said that the UK's average petrol prices did begin to show the first ""significant fall"" since November 2020. Having peaked above 54.5p a litre in the second week of November, the petrol cost to retailers was down to 49p at the start of last week and yesterday dropped below 43p a litre. But the RAC said it was not enough of a fall to reflect the plummet in wholesale prices. The AA welcomed the consumer petrol price fall, but criticised the fact it had taken so much longer to drop in relation to falling wholesale prices. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman said that previously, the market would ""wait until Asda or Morrisons announced a price cut before starting to move"". ""Without that initial kick, pump prices have stagnated, and that is a potentially worrying development if it sets the pattern for the future,"" he said. ""In basic pounds, shillings and pence, if a supermarket makes a big deal about discounts of Â£2 or Â£3 off the shopping bill, but grabs back Â£2 to Â£3 per tank by not passing on savings at the pump, the consumer needs to factor that in."" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) represents independently-owned forecourts that collectively account for around two thirds of the UK's forecourts. Because its members buy fuel less frequently than larger supermarkets, it told the BBC that reductions in wholesale prices can take some days to filter through to the pump price. ""Electricity prices, business rates, labour costs have all risen and these need to be paid for if your local petrol station is to remain in business,"" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. He added that fuel retailers have been hit by the  ""double whammy"" of reduced sales and rising costs. ""Our members continually monitor prices to ensure that they remain competitive with their industry counterparts and continue to provide good value for money.""

"Dealing with the legacy of the Troubles has proved divisive but all Stormont parties oppose a statute of limitations Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has suggested that the government will not introduce legislation on legacy imminently. He was speaking in London after a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIC). On Tuesday,Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP criticised Number 10's intention to press ahead with plans to end Troubles-related prosecutions. However Mr Lewis refused to be drawn on specific timing. ""If it takes more time, we're prepared to do that,"" he said. He suggested that he wanted to find agreement on an approach to ""help Northern Ireland move forward"". ""This is ultimately about delivering for the people,"" he added. He said it appeared the legislation would not make into the final autumn statement this week, and said the government would do everything it could to reach consensus. All the main Stormont parties havecriticised the plans. Mr Lewis refused to be drawn on specific timing and said ""if it takes more time, we're prepared to do that"" It would bring in a statute of limitations to cover crimes committed during the Troubles up to April 1998 and would apply to military veterans as well as ex-paramilitaries. Also speaking at the BIIC, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney reiterated that there was ""not support"" for the UK government's plans. Mr Coveney said discussions would continue with the Stormont parties. Political reaction to PM's Troubles prosecutions plan Legacy proposals 'may give amnesty to killers' In June, thefirst British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in more than two yearstook place at Dublin Castle. After that meeting, the UK and Irish governments agreed ""a process of intensive engagement"" on legacy matters. The BIIC is a body set up to promote cooperation between the UK and Ireland and brings together representatives from both sides of the Irish Sea. Troubles amnesty 'set for imminent introduction' Plan to end all NI Troubles prosecutions confirmed On Thursday, at London's Foreign Office, Mr Lewis was also asked about negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol. He said there remained ""substantive gaps"" between the UK and EU but repeated that Number 10 did not want to trigger Article 16 to suspend parts of the arrangements. Simon Coveney and Brandon Lewis last attended a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in June Relations between London and Dublin have deteriorated because of the fallout from Brexit. Unionists have also objected to the protocol, which put a trade border in the Irish Sea and kept Northern Ireland aligned with some EU rules. The Irish government believes that an agreement on animal and plant standards would get rid of up to 80% of all checks but the UK is reluctant to align to EU rules. Discussions to reach a breakthrough between the UK and EU have been taking place for some six weeks, with more talks expected later this week.

"Siccar Point Energy says it will continue talks with the UK Government over the future of the field Oil giant Shell has pulled out of the controversial Cambo oil field development west of Shetland. The company had a 30% stake in the field, which hasfaced sustained criticism from environmental groups. Shell said the economic case for investment in the North Atlantic project was ""not strong enough"". Majority stakeholder Siccar Point Energy said it would continue talks with the UK government over the future of the field. Shell said it had carried out ""comprehensive screening"" before reaching a decision to ""ensure the best returns for the business"". Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Sturgeon urges PM to reassess Cambo oil field plan A spokesperson said: ""The economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time, as well as having the potential for delays. ""However, continued investment in oil and gas in the UK remains critical to the country's energy security. ""We believe the North Sea - and Shell in it - has a critical role to play in the UK's energy mix, supporting the jobs and skills to enable a smooth transition to Britain's low-carbon future."" The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of Shetland in water depths of between 1,050m (3,445ft) and 1,100m (3,609ft). It was originally licensed for exploration in 2001 and could yield hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling could start as early as 2022 - and continue for 25 years. Project leader Siccar Point Energy said the development ""remains critical"" to the UK's economy and energy security. CEO Jonathan Roger said:  ""Whilst we are disappointed at Shell's change of position, we remain confident about the qualities of a project. ""It will not only create over 1,000 direct jobs as well as thousands more in the supply chain, but also help ease the UK's transition to a low carbon future through responsibly produced domestic oil. ""Given Shell's decision, we are now in discussions with our contractors, supply chain and wider stakeholders to review options."" This puts the Cambo oil field in serious doubt but despite the predictions of environmentalists, it doesn't yet kill it off. It's clear from reading between the lines that it's becoming too much of a reputational liability for Shell. But the majority of the North Sea is no longer operated by the traditional big oil and gas giants. Investors - whose driver is the bottom line - are playing an increasing role. And that means that if the sums work as they still might, someone else could still swoop in to take Shell's share. Trade body OGUK said investor confidence in oil and gas ""remains essential"". External relations director Jenny Stanning said: ""This is a commercial decision between partners, but doesn't change the facts that the UK will need new oil and gas projects if we are to avoid increasing reliance on imports."" But climate campaigners said Shell's announcement signalled ""the beginning of the end"" for new oil and gas projects. Friends of the Earth Scotland's Caroline Rance said: ""People power has made the Cambo development so toxic that even oil giant Shell doesn't want to be associated with it. ""Both the UK and Scottish Governments must now officially reject Cambo, say no to any future oil and gas developments in UK waters and get on with planning a fair and fast transition for people working in this industry."" The Scottish government says unlimited extraction of fossil fuels goes against its climate obligations Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" The decision on whether drilling gets the go-ahead rests with UK authorities. The UK government said that despite moves to renewable energy sources, ""there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years"". The Scottish government said that unlimited extraction of fossil fuels is ""not consistent with our climate obligations"". A spokesperson added: ""We continue to call on the UK Government, who have the power to act in this instance, to urgently re-assess all approved oil licenses where drilling has not yet commenced against our climate commitments.""

"MicheÃ¡l Martin said the risks of going into the Christmas period without some further restrictions was ""just too high"" Irish nightclubs are to shut again and the hospitality sector faces tighter rules over Christmas as the government tries to curb the spread of Covid-19. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin announced a number of new restrictions in a televised address on Friday night. Indoor events such as concerts and sports fixtures must operate at 50% capacity and private home visits must involve no more than four households. The latest rules will be in place from 7 December until 9 January. The Irish government took the decisions at a cabinet meeting on Friday after advice from the chief medical officer and the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). Mr Martin said the ""risks associated with proceeding into the Christmas period without some restrictions to reduce the volume of personal contacts is just too high"". Nightclubs, which hadonly recently reopened for the first time since the pandemic began, will have to close again on Tuesday. Many of the restrictions which applied to pubs, hotels and restaurants prior a relaxation of Covid rules on 22 October will now be reimposed for the Christmas and New Year period. Those include: a table service only rule, which means customers cannot queue at a bar for drinks social distancing rules are being reintroduced with a minimum of 1m (3ft) between tables a maximum of six adults can sit together at a table there is a ban on multiple table bookings masks be worn when not at the table There had been speculation that closing time would be brought forward to 11:30 local time but the taoiseach confirmed that would remain at midnight. Restaurants and bars will return to table service only until the new year The Republic of Ireland isalready operating the EU Covid pass system for the hospitality industryin which people need proof of Covid status to enter certain venues. Mr Martin said the pass would also now be required for gyms and leisure centres as well as hotel bars and restaurants. New restrictions will apply to entertainment, cultural and sporting events - attendance numbers will be reduced to 50% capacity and the venues must be fully seated. Mr Martin acknowledged that many people in the hospitality and entertainment industries ""will be bitterly disappointed by this news"" and that ""many of them will be fearing for their livelihoods"". ""I want to reassure them that, just as we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, the government will stand by them and ensure that they have the financial supports necessary to weather this latest storm and to stay intact until we are out of it,"" he said. The taoiseach described the emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa as a ""cause for concern"" and disappointing twist in the pandemic. ""Just a few weeks ago South Africa was reporting approximately 300 cases per day. Yesterday it reported 11,500 new cases,"" he said. Mr Martin said experience had shown that while restrictions on travel were ""useful to delay the entry of new variants, it is impossible to stop them"". So farthe Republic of Ireland has only one confirmed Omicron casebut Mr Martin said there was ""potential for a very serious crisis"" if the new variant proved to be more transmissible. ""Further study and examination in the weeks ahead may discover that Omicron does not represent a more deadly threat,"" he said. ""If that is the case it will come as a great relief to us all, but we simply cannot take that risk with people's lives and health."" Mr Martin said the latest measures were precautionary and insisted they were not a return to lockdown. ""Large sections of our society and economy are open and thriving,"" he said. He described the Republic of Ireland as having the ""most vaccinated population in Europe"" and praised young people in particular for the sacrifices they had made to date. ""You are a very special generation,"" he told them. ""And you have done it not for yourselves but for your parents, your grandparents, your community and your country."" Earlier, the Irish government delayed by 48 hours a requirement for a negative Covid-19 test for passengers arriving at ports and airports in the Republic of Ireland. It was due to comeinto effect on Friday. From Monday, travellers must show results from a lateral flow test taken up to 48 hours before arrival or a PCR test taken up to 72 hours earlier. Passengers arriving into Irish airports and ports will need to show proof of a negative test from Monday There will be no exception for theCommon Travel Area,external, so the rule will apply to visitors from Great Britain. Children aged 11 and under will be be exemptas will some other categories,external. Airlines and ferry companies are in talks with the Department of Transport to discuss checks before people board Ireland-bound flights or boats. The new travel rules were criticised by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary as ""gobbledygook"". ""We note that neither the chief medical officer nor the government have defined what a 'professionally-done' antigen test means or look like,"" he said. ""How are airline or border control staff supposed to understand what a professionally done antigen test is, or looks like, when neither the chief medical officer nor the government have even defined it?"" he added. In his address to the nation on Friday night, the taoiseach acknowledged there had been problems with some Covid policies. ""We haven't always got it right, and there have been times of great frustration,"" he said. But, every time we have faced a new challenge we have pulled together as a nation and done what was needed. I'm asking us all to do that again."" Meanwhile,the Health Amendment Bill,external- which includes a return of mandatory hotel quarantine - passed all stages in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) on Thursday night. It will go before the Seanad (Irish senate) later and will be voted before being signed into law by President Michael D Higgins.

"Lord Frost (left) and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ (right) - pictured at a previous meeting - will speak again next Friday The European Commission's MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has said it is ""time to get medicines across the finish line"" after holding talks with Lord Frost about the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Å efÄoviÄ had previously said it was his top priority to agree a deal to guarantee the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He added that ""strong political will"" was needed to advance on other issues. UK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the progress had ""been quite limited"". ""The gap between our positions is still significant,"" he said. ""There has been some potential convergence on the medicines issue but agreement has not been reached."" Lord Frost said the UK's position remained that it would use Article 16 of the protocol, which would suspend parts of the deal, if solutions could not be found on the issues being negotiated. The two men will speak again next Friday. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border. It leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, meaning goods can flow freely with the Republic of Ireland. However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control, amounting to an ""Irish Sea border"". A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? The EU has proposed reforms to improve the operation of the protocol. However, the UK wants more fundamental change, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role. Guaranteeing supplies of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is one of the big issues to resolve On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ suggestedthe EU could act unilaterally to guarantee the supply of medicinesfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU brought forward proposals earlier this year which it said would tackle the medicines issue. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said: ""I would 100% prefer if we can present this good solution as a joint approach. ""But I'm fully conscious of time. ""I have to be very, very clear that we are ready to move on our own if it's not possible at this stage to push on a joint approach."" The UK is continuing to threaten the use of the Article 16 mechanism if agreement cannot be reached on all protocol issues. It allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally suspended if they are causing serious problems or leading to diversion of trade.

"Nisra's figures are based on death certificates whereas the Health Department's are based on positive tests Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificates of 65 people in Northern Ireland in the week up to 26 November. That's an increase of 23 on the previous week, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra). It brings the agency's total, based on mentions of the virus on death certificates, to 3,869. The Department of Health's total, up to last Friday, based on a positive test being recorded, was 2,867. Nisra's figures are higher because it records mentions of the virus on death certificates, where it may or may not have been confirmed by way of a test. Of the agency's measure, just over two-thirds of Covid-19-related deaths have occurred in hospital (69.3%). NISRA's total of deaths registered, based on those mentioned on death certificates, is 3,869 Covid-19 passport helpline gets 3,000 calls a day Covid-19 booster clinics open across NI There have been 1,136 care home resident deaths, accounting for slightly less than a third (29.3%) of all Covid-19-related deaths. People aged 75 and over accounted for 73.8% of the 3,869 Covid-19-related deaths registered between 19 March 2020 and 26 November 2021. The provisional number of deaths from all causes registered in the week ending 26 November was 413, an increase of 38 from the previous week. Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon and Mid Ulster council areas have had higher proportions of Covid-19-related deaths (12.4% and 8.2% respectively) compared with their share of all deaths in Northern Ireland (10.4% and 6.6% respectively), according to the Nisra figures. The statistics also show that Ards and North Down and Fermanagh and Omagh council areas both have relatively low shares of registered Covid-19-related deaths (2.3 and 2.1 percentage points lower respectively than their share of all deaths).

"Don't shout at us - listen to the whole thing. Those words summed up how we wanted people to approach our Year '21 podcast. The story of how Northern Ireland was created, told week by week. Now, 12 months on, as we prepare our final episode, we're relieved that no-one shouted at us. And that, in the end, we were able to examine the history of one of the bloodiest years of the 20th Century on this island in a reflective and thoughtful way. That's not to say we shied away from controversy. It would be impossible to relive every week of 1921 without making some people feel at least a little uncomfortable. Sectarian killings, shipyard expulsions and political decisions that few could stand over today. But that was the key to our podcast. We were not there to judge the actions of anyone 100 years ago. We were there to tell the story of how an island was split and how two new states were created. What we did not predict was that, thanks to the listeners, we ended up bringing many of the characters of 1921 to life. And not just the big names. We did episodes on Michael Collins, James Craig, Eamon DeValera and Edward Carson. We spoke to their relatives and found out things that weren't in most history books. But we also told the story of Matthew McDonald, a Belfast pharmacist, put out of his home and business and forced to live on the other side of the world. Matthew McDonald died in Australia after being forced out of his home and business He was at the top of his game in 1921, but died in Australia a broken man. His great grandson, Ian McBurney, told us how the trauma he suffered had a positive affect in the end. His children and grandchildren lived a different life in Australia. Their desire to tell his story was an attempt to lay the ghosts to rest. To return him home to Belfast. Then there was Mary Keily's grandfather. Patrick Keily was a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) man, part of the Regimental Guard protecting King George V when he visited Belfast in June 1921 and, as she told us, ""six foot six in his stocking soles"". He had met the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and, as he was Catholic, kept the relationship and marriage secret until the birth of their first child. Or did the marriage even happen? As Mary said: ""Maybe they're not even married, I don't know."" Patrick Keily kept his relationship with the daughter of a Presbyterian minister secret A listener did know. They found the marriage record of Mary's grandparents and we were able to share it with her. Identity has been a central theme. How the events of 1921 in Ireland shaped how we feel about this place today, whatever our perspective. Stuart McLean, the County Donegal Orangeman, illustrated that perhaps more starkly than anyone else we interviewed. He lives five miles from the border in Newtowncunningham. ""My family went to sleep under one flag and woke up under a different one the next morning,"" he told us. He has lived his entire life in the Republic, but still identifies as British and as a unionist. Dr Eamon Phoenix has been our guide, companion and chief storyteller this year, but episode 48 turned to a story about his own family -that of his grandfather Hugh Napier. He'd fought in Gallipoli and returned disabled before being given a job in the Rope Works in Belfast. During 1921, he was forced out, chased and beaten by a mob. He survived thanks to the bravery of a woman who heard the commotion and intervened, chasing the crowd away. But for her actions, Eamon Phoenix might not be here today. We were very aware that the centenary year would be celebrated by some and resented by others. We welcomed and encouraged all perspectives. It was driven by our curiosity about how we got to 2021, and how much those events have dictated what happened across 10 decades on these islands. We asked for people to help us inform our discussion. We were overwhelmed and extremely appreciative to those that did. We never expected the podcast to become a historical record in itself. It has, and for that we're extremely grateful. Hopefully future generations will be too. You can listen to all episodes of Year '21via BBC Sounds. Who were the major players in 1920?

"Retailers are continuing to put up fuel prices when they should reduce them in line with savings in wholesale oil prices, the RAC motoring services organisation has claimed. In response to concerns about the Omicron variant, oil prices fell by around $10 a barrel last week. But this reduced wholesale fuel price has not been reflected at the pumps. Retailers added on average another 3.1p to a litre of unleaded petrol and 2.7p to diesel in November. The RAC said this hike in petrol prices was ""completely unjustified"", with larger retailers making a ""shocking"" profit. In particular, the RAC pointed the finger at supermarket chains who are major fuel retailers, such as Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons, saying they should have reduced prices, but had instead increased them ""unnecessarily"". Why it's the end of the road for petrol stations What's happening about petrol shortages? Petrol prices at eight-year high, says RAC ""Since Covid they've been far more reluctant to pass on any savings, even though the frequency with which they buy means they are in a position to pass on any savings in the wholesale price to drivers far more quickly,"" RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams told the BBC. ""It would be much fairer if retailers mirrored wholesale prices more closely on a daily or weekly basis."" A spokesperson from the British Retail Consortium said: ""Supermarkets are keen to provide their customers with the best value for petrol through their forecourts, offering the cheapest petrol in the country. ""However, prices at the pump will be influenced by various forces, including tax, oil prices and operational costs."" The RAC has urged the government to intervene and said the chancellor's fuel duty freeze last month is not enough. ""The government should ask the biggest retailers to explain why they're charging such high prices for fuel when wholesale prices have dropped,"" Mr Williams added. A government spokesperson said: ""Fuel prices are increasing in countries across the world and this is not an issue unique to the UK. ""We've provided Â£4.2bn of support to help people with the cost of living, including effectively cutting taxes for workers on Universal Credit, providing Â£500m of targeted support for the most vulnerable families and freezing fuel duty for the twelfth year in a row."" Analysis by the RAC found that despite wholesale costs having fallen by 7p from the middle of the month, retailers continued to put prices up, with the average cost of a litre of unleaded petrol ending the month at 147.28p and diesel up to 150.64p. Prices for both fuels peaked at record highs on 20 November and 21 November respectively - diesel reaching 151.1p per litre and petrol at 147.72p. The key factor affecting petrol is the wholesale oil market, meaning any reduction in the oil price should result in buyers paying less at the pumps. While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is competitively driven. That means the cost motorists are charged is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Mr Williams explained that the current margins big retailers are making have gone up as high as 20p a litre, which is ""unheard of when everyone is driving"". ""Sadly, our data shows all too clearly that drivers are being taken for a ride by retailers at the moment,"" he said. However, on Tuesday, motoring group the AA said that the UK's average petrol prices did begin to show the first ""significant fall"" since November 2020. Having peaked above 54.5p a litre in the second week of November, the petrol cost to retailers was down to 49p at the start of last week and yesterday dropped below 43p a litre. But the RAC said it was not enough of a fall to reflect the plummet in wholesale prices. The AA welcomed the consumer petrol price fall, but criticised the fact it had taken so much longer to drop in relation to falling wholesale prices. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman said that previously, the market would ""wait until Asda or Morrisons announced a price cut before starting to move"". ""Without that initial kick, pump prices have stagnated, and that is a potentially worrying development if it sets the pattern for the future,"" he said. ""In basic pounds, shillings and pence, if a supermarket makes a big deal about discounts of Â£2 or Â£3 off the shopping bill, but grabs back Â£2 to Â£3 per tank by not passing on savings at the pump, the consumer needs to factor that in."" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) represents independently-owned forecourts that collectively account for around two thirds of the UK's forecourts. Because its members buy fuel less frequently than larger supermarkets, it told the BBC that reductions in wholesale prices can take some days to filter through to the pump price. ""Electricity prices, business rates, labour costs have all risen and these need to be paid for if your local petrol station is to remain in business,"" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. He added that fuel retailers have been hit by the  ""double whammy"" of reduced sales and rising costs. ""Our members continually monitor prices to ensure that they remain competitive with their industry counterparts and continue to provide good value for money.""

"Siccar Point Energy says it will continue talks with the UK Government over the future of the field Oil giant Shell has pulled out of the controversial Cambo oil field development west of Shetland. The company had a 30% stake in the field, which hasfaced sustained criticism from environmental groups. Shell said the economic case for investment in the North Atlantic project was ""not strong enough"". Majority stakeholder Siccar Point Energy said it would continue talks with the UK government over the future of the field. Shell said it had carried out ""comprehensive screening"" before reaching a decision to ""ensure the best returns for the business"". Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Sturgeon urges PM to reassess Cambo oil field plan A spokesperson said: ""The economic case for investment in this project is not strong enough at this time, as well as having the potential for delays. ""However, continued investment in oil and gas in the UK remains critical to the country's energy security. ""We believe the North Sea - and Shell in it - has a critical role to play in the UK's energy mix, supporting the jobs and skills to enable a smooth transition to Britain's low-carbon future."" The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of Shetland in water depths of between 1,050m (3,445ft) and 1,100m (3,609ft). It was originally licensed for exploration in 2001 and could yield hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling could start as early as 2022 - and continue for 25 years. Project leader Siccar Point Energy said the development ""remains critical"" to the UK's economy and energy security. CEO Jonathan Roger said:  ""Whilst we are disappointed at Shell's change of position, we remain confident about the qualities of a project. ""It will not only create over 1,000 direct jobs as well as thousands more in the supply chain, but also help ease the UK's transition to a low carbon future through responsibly produced domestic oil. ""Given Shell's decision, we are now in discussions with our contractors, supply chain and wider stakeholders to review options."" This puts the Cambo oil field in serious doubt but despite the predictions of environmentalists, it doesn't yet kill it off. It's clear from reading between the lines that it's becoming too much of a reputational liability for Shell. But the majority of the North Sea is no longer operated by the traditional big oil and gas giants. Investors - whose driver is the bottom line - are playing an increasing role. And that means that if the sums work as they still might, someone else could still swoop in to take Shell's share. Trade body OGUK said investor confidence in oil and gas ""remains essential"". External relations director Jenny Stanning said: ""This is a commercial decision between partners, but doesn't change the facts that the UK will need new oil and gas projects if we are to avoid increasing reliance on imports."" But climate campaigners said Shell's announcement signalled ""the beginning of the end"" for new oil and gas projects. Friends of the Earth Scotland's Caroline Rance said: ""People power has made the Cambo development so toxic that even oil giant Shell doesn't want to be associated with it. ""Both the UK and Scottish Governments must now officially reject Cambo, say no to any future oil and gas developments in UK waters and get on with planning a fair and fast transition for people working in this industry."" The Scottish government says unlimited extraction of fossil fuels goes against its climate obligations Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" The decision on whether drilling gets the go-ahead rests with UK authorities. The UK government said that despite moves to renewable energy sources, ""there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years"". The Scottish government said that unlimited extraction of fossil fuels is ""not consistent with our climate obligations"". A spokesperson added: ""We continue to call on the UK Government, who have the power to act in this instance, to urgently re-assess all approved oil licenses where drilling has not yet commenced against our climate commitments.""

"An illustration of how the new factory would look The UK's largest factory for making steel towers for offshore wind turbines looks set to be built in the Highlands. The Â£110m facility has been proposed for Port of Nigg on the Cromarty Firth. Inverness-headquartered Global Energy Group, which owns the port, and Spanish company Haizea Wind Group are behind the plans. The investment needed would come from a syndicate which includes SSE Renewables, in addition to funding from the Scottish and UK governments. The Nigg Offshore Wind factory would employ 400 people and in a year could roll 135 steel plate for towers each weighing more than 1,000 tonnes. Construction of the facility could start next year, subject to the project successfully securing the finance package needed. The announcement follows recent closures of Scottish yards that manufactured wind farm components. A wind turbine factory in Campbeltown, Argyll,closed earlier this year. The Scottish government put more than Â£37m into three BiFab yards in Fife and Lewis for fabricating offshore platforms. The yards later went into administration, though the Lewis sitehas since secured work under new ownership. The factory could eventually export towers for use across Europe Nigg is a deepwater port with large dry dock facilities. It is used for storing offshore wind farm components and refurbishment work to oil industry rigs. The new facility would be designed to supply towers and other large tubular components suitable for both the fixed and floating offshore wind farms. The initial contracts for tower supply would be focused on UK domestic supply, but its backers suggest the factory would be in high demand for export of towers and other products to across Europe up until 2050. Tim Cornelius, of Global Energy, said that despite the struggles faced by other yards investment had to be consistently made into cutting edge technology to be competitive in a ""global landscape"". He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""What we look forward to is announcing some of the big contracts in the near future supplying some of the biggest wind projects in the UK."" Public agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be providing the Scottish government's support to the project. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the development represented the ""most significant industrial announcement for some time"". She said: ""We need bold, collective action to tackle the global climate emergency, and the growth of our renewables sector over the next 10 years will be truly transformative, helping to deliver a just transition to net zero and a greener, fairer future for us all. ""This significant investment in Scotland's energy sector is testament to the skills, expertise and innovation within our industry."" The UK government said the project would bring a jobs boost to Easter Ross and the surrounding area. Scotland Minister Malcolm Offord said: ""We have long been recognised for our expertise in the energy industry and now our skilled workforce is leading the way in our transition to a greener future. ""It's especially fitting that this area, synonymous with the oil boom in the 1970s, is leading the way as we embrace new cleaner sources of power."" SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: ""Today's announcement shows that SSE is willing to put its money where its mouth is to support development of the Scottish manufacturing capability for the offshore wind sector. ""We have worked with Global Energy Group and stakeholders for more than two years to get to this point."" Scottish Renewables and Highland Council have welcomed the venture. Earlier this week, separate plans were announced for a ""hub"" building concrete foundations for floating offshore wind farmsat Ardersier on the Moray Firth.

"The group attended the premiere of Boxing Day, which stars member Leigh-Anne, earlier this week Little Mix say they're ""taking a break"" after their 2022 tour, but insist they're not splitting up permanently. The group shared news of their hiatus on social media on Thursday evening. ""It's been 10 amazing years, a wonderful non-stop adventure, and we feel the time is right to take a break so we can recharge and work on some other projects,"" the group posted. ""We can't thank you enough for your love and never-ending support since the beginning. We love you all SO much."" Despite the announcement, the group say they already have plans for more music, tours and performances in the future. ""We've made so many incredible memories with you all, and we can't wait to make so many more,"" they said. ""We're sisters and we'll always have each other and you, the fans, in our lives.

Ever since Jesy left, we thought this would be the route that they took,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Ashton says before Little Mix, he would only listen to R&B and hip hop - but now describes himself as a ""massive pop-head"". ""It's sad but it's not the worst thing in the world,"" says Ashton, who's looking forward to the future of Little Mix Kirsty Hillitt remembers voting for Little Mix on X Factor in 2011 - and has tickets to see them in Cardiff in 2022. ""I'm so, so gutted really. I love their music and I'm gutted we won't be hearing it from a while,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""But coming from a personal level, I can completely understand the girls needing to recharge, they've grown so much in the last 10 years. They've got to have a dabble at other things."" Kirsty says she's ""gutted"" but hopes Little Mix get what they need from their hiatus But this isn't the first time a massive pop group has announced a temporary split, only for years to pass without getting back together. When One Direction separated in 2015, that was only described as a""temporary move"". But Ashton and Kirsty are confident in Little Mix's promise to fans, and their strength as a group. ""I'm pretty optimistic about it,"" says Ashton. ""Little Mix have a different chemistry than other groups, they're very close. I do believe them, they've always delivered on their promises."" And Kirsty says fans can see the trio's connection through their interactions with each other and their followers. ""I feel like, when that connection is there, it's not going to go anywhere,"" she says. ""They've supported each other through their own projects, and that's the difference to when you see some bands breaking up - you know it's not there any more.""

"A week on from Storm Arwen thousands of people in north east Scotland, the south of Scotland and the north of England are still without power. In Scotland,about 120 military personnel have been drafted in to help, focusing on welfare checks in the communities still badly affected. The Bellwin Scheme has now been activated, giving local councils financial support from the Scottish government to deal with emergency incidents. In England,a major incident has been declared in County Durhamwhile some households have been moved into temporary accommodation. Here are the stories of some of those affected by the power cuts. Linda and Paul Dunk have relied on a camping stove for hot meals Linda Dunk made a casserole just before Storm Arwen hit - and since then it has provided her and her husband with a daily hot meal on their camping stove. Mrs Dunk, 72, and her 75-year-old husband Paul live in a converted mill outside Torphins in Aberdeenshire, which was one of the areas worst hit last Friday. They have been without power since then, and have relied on a wood burner for heat - alongside five layers of clothes - and a head torch to see in the dark. An old telephone has been their means of communication to try to find updates about possible reconnection. The couple have been using a head torch to see in the dark ""Cold becomes very exhausting"", Mrs Dunk said. ""We are both in our 70s, you start to ache more - this building is getting colder and colder. We are carrying heavy buckets of water in the snow. And it's very boring, just medieval - how our ancestors lived thousands of years ago. ""Last Friday lunchtime I made a beef casserole and then the storm came. We have lived on that - one decent hot meal every day, with rice, and cabbage from the garden. ""I think the most distressing thing is that you think you might get power back on, then you are off another 24 hours, and your optimism drops."" She added: ""I want to stress we really appreciate the efforts of the community, and the engineers out there in this weather."" This video can not be played Dr Lily Fulton-Humble is living without power with a seven-week-old baby and a sick toddler Dr Lily Fulton-Humble, who lives near Alnwick in Northumberland, said the past week had been ""difficult"". She has a seven-week old baby and a toddler. Her parents drove down from Scotland on Sunday to pick up her eldest child as she was unwell. ""It's pretty cold and, when you're feeding a baby every two hours, it's even colder,"" she said. ""It's been difficult and I think we're losing the stamina and perhaps, if we had known in advance, that it would be so long, we may have acted differently."" Meg Scarborough runs a cattery in the Scottish Borders Artist Meg Scarborough runs a cattery in Foulden in the Scottish Borders which went five nights without electricity. ""We had nine cats in during the storm, luckily the cattery itself is extremely protected so the cats didn't seem to be too bothered,"" she said. We were having to fill up hot water bottles to put in cat beds as that was the only way to keep them warm."" She said her village felt ""forgotten about"" but had rallied round to help with a nearby community larder staying open late to offer hot drinks and charging points. There were nine cats staying at the site when the power went out ""Scottish Power would send us updates every day saying we should expect power back in our homes by 16:00, then pushed back to 22:00 and every day we waited and it never happened,"" she said. ""It made us feel very helpless, especially as a lot of the people in the village are elderly or disabled."" She said that it was particularly difficult to look after one pet in her care. ""Scottish Power was offering hotels for some vulnerable people but what could we do when we run a cattery?"" she asked. ""I felt that Scottish Power should have supplied us with a generator so at least we wouldn't have had to give a diabetic cat her insulin injections under torchlight."" The Hills family have five children under 10 Tony and Nicola Hills, from Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria, reported their power cut at 06:24 GMT on Saturday morning and were told the fault would be recorded, however, later found it had not been. In a letter to Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Tim Farron, Mr Hills said:  ""We are a family with five children comprising twins at 20 months, and a four-year-old, a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old. ""Getting children to bed with candle light and then up to a cold house is so hard. We are priority customers and yet that counts for nothing as far as we can see."" Mr Hills also said the Â£700 maximum compensation available would ""in no way"" make up for the loss of earnings and spoilt food in their fridge and freezer. It will take weeks before routes can reopen at Glentress in the Borders At Glentress, a popular mountain biking and walking destination in the Borders, they are still assessing the scale of the damage. Forestry and Land Scotland's regional visitor services manager Martin Page said his team across southern Scotland had been working ""flat out"" at all of its sites. The public has been asked to stay away while they assess how soon the trails can reopen. ""It is likely to be weeks for the majority of them and some might take longer than that,"" he said. He said they hoped to be able to open some trails before Christmas - but their first priority had to be public safety. Work is ongoing to assess the damage across the south of Scotland Dr Terry Murphy from Bishop Auckland in County Durham toldBBC Radio 5 Livethere was a ""great deal of concern about the power companies' strategies"". ""If you're constantly telling vulnerable people that power will be on in a few hours, they're making bad decisions because you're giving them the wrong information,"" he said. ""If they'd given good information from day one there are a lot of people who'd be in a much better situation. ""People say, would this happen in London? ""The best I've heard it put is an elderly gentleman who said there's not much evidence of 'levelling up', it's more like 'powering down'."" SSEN project engineer John Shanks said the hours have been long There may have been complaints about communication from power companies, but many people impacted by Storm Arwen have been overwhelmingly appreciative of the efforts of engineers on the ground trying to reconnect power for the past week. SSEN project engineer John Shanks has been leading a team working to clear faults in Aberdeenshire areas, including near Hatton, Ellon, New Deer and Fyvie. Additional team members have been drafted in from Orkney, Skye and the Uists as well as Melksham in Wiltshire. He has worked for SSEN for more than 20 years, and said the widespread destruction caused by Storm Arwen was the worst he had seen. ""We're working really long hours to get the network restored back to normal"", he said. ""Storm Arwen has caused lots of windblown damage, lots of trees down, lots of flying debris - the majority of the damage is trees that are down on overhead lines. ""We generally would work until about midnight, but if there's an option to restore a few extra customers we will be working on an extra hour or two to do so. Conditions have been tough.""

"One in 60 people in the UK would test positive for Covid in the week ending 27 November - ONS estimates suggest So just over one million (1,087,000) would test positive - up slightly from 1,035,000 last week, the figures show Separately, a UK trial of seven different jabs finds Pfizer and Moderna vaccines give the best booster response And a review finds the risk of catching Covid remains higher for people belonging to certain ethnic groups Scientists in South Africa are meanwhile detecting a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times, as early data suggests Omicron may evade some immunity But experts say it's still too early to say if the new variant - which is driving a new wave there - causes more serious illness A further 50,584 coronavirus cases are reported in the UK, and 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now. Here's a
reminder of the day's main developments:  Today's live page posts were written by Alexandra
Fouche, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Joseph Lee. The live page was edited
by Holly Wallis and Lauren Turner. Thanks for joining us. Rachel SchraerBBC Reality Check Low vaccination rates might be one reason for variants The Omicron variant was first identified in South Africa, in a region with relatively low rates of vaccination. But making a link between
the two is not straightforward. The virus
mutates as it jumps between people as well as within a sick person. So in a
population with a low vaccination rate, there will be more infected people
around, and a greater opportunity for the virus to change. But potentially harmful mutations
can take hold when the virus faces new challenges like vaccines â so a
population with some immunity but with the virus widely present is a perfect
environment for new mutations to emerge. It follows that a highly vaccinated
population where infection rates are low probably provides the best barrier
against potentially harmful mutations. The challenge is to get from a low
to a high-vaccination environment as quickly as possible. âA mix is the worst thing, but
unfortunately we all have to pass through having that mix to get to the other
side,â Prof Rowland Kao, a veterinary epidemiologist says. Another factor is how many
people in a population have suppressed immune systems and could be
ill with the virus for a long time, giving it more chance to mutate. One theory is that Omicron emerged in an immunosuppressed person or
population â possibly with untreated HIV which is a big problem in the southern
African region. But this is very difficult to prove without knowing exactly where it first emerged. There are no plans to increase the level of Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland before Christmas, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says. She says the existing restrictions are ""enough"" at this time. The Sinn FÃ©in vice-president also hit out at those responsible for a fake message on social media suggesting a return to lockdown. ""Those engaged in disinformation are shameful, it's causing confusion,"" she says. Read more It remains likely that the Omicron cases identified so far in England are a result of a number of ""separate introductions"" into the country, the UK Health Security Agency says. Its latest statement,externalsays available data is limited at this ""early stage"". Delta remains the predominant variant in England, it says, accounting for more than 99% of all Covid-19 cases. There were 22 confirmed cases of Omicron in England, as of 30 November. A total of 12 of these cases were more than 14 days after receiving at least two doses of vaccine; two were more than 28 days after a first jab; and six were unvaccinated. Two had no available information. None of these cases are known to have resulted in hospitalisation or death, the agency added. Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News Leading HIV and Covid
researcher, Prof Penny Moore, says that two pandemics colliding has
created aâperfect stormâ in South Africa. Prof Moore, from the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, is at the
scientific front line of the mission to understand the threat that the Omicron
variant poses to the world. âUnfortunately in
South Africa we have a massive HIV pandemic and many, many untreated people,â
she told BBC Radio 4âs Inside Science programme. âWhen these people have
a SARS CoV-2 infection, thereâs increased risk theyâll struggle to clear it.
The longer a person has an infection, the higher the odds that the virus will
pick up a mutation that somehow benefits it. âThis is one plausible
explanation for how Omicron - and other variants - emerged.â Prof Moore added that, wherever Omicron emerged, âit
has properties that make it a risk for all of us - whether we're HIV positive
or not. âIt was identified in
South Africa, but it's now across the world. We see community transmission and
transmissions that are not linked to sub-Saharan Africa. Blocking travel to our
country makes it more scientifically difficult to tackle this project.â Prof Moore added that
the techniques and platforms developed for HIV research have accelerated
scientistsâ ability to understand Covid. âWe now need to
transfer that sense of urgency back to HIV,â she told the BBC. You can listen to
Professor Mooreâs full interview with BBC science correspondent Victoria Gill
onInside Science on BBC Sounds. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has seen a rebound of Covid-19 cases over the last
week, particularly in cities that border other countries, and seaports. There
have been 80 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours, many of those close to the
Mongolian border. However, there is not yet any indication the new
variant has reached Chinaâs mainland. Chinaâs official Xinhua news agency said
on Wednesday thatno local cases of Omicron had been detected,external. Papers have stressed over the last week that Chinaâs
zero-Covid strategy â meaning that lockdowns are imposed the moment cases are
discovered - will prevent any variant from being transmitted widely. In the last week,six cases of the new variant have been confirmed in Hong Kong,external, however. Yet all these cases have been imports, meaning that arrivals were quarantined
on entry to the city, and there is no local transmission. If an outbreak were to occur in Hong Kong, it could
threaten imminent plans to make quarantine-free travel possible between
Hong Kong and mainland China. A âHong Kong Health Codeâ system has been launched today to
facilitate this, which will provisionally allow 1,000 people to travel daily
between the two regions - which have different Covid-19 procedures in place -
without needing to quarantine. Registration for this is set to begin on 10
December. As we mentioned earlier, Belgium was going to consider a recommendation to shut schools along with a limit on the number of spectators for indoor events in view of the rising number of cases. We've now heard that they've decided to bring school holidays forward by a week for nurseries and primary schools and masks will be made compulsory in schools from age six. Secondary schools will shift to a
hybrid system, with half of classes being done at home. Officials have also given the go ahead for a limit of 200 spectators to be imposed at indoor events. Bars and restaurants will still be able to open until 23:00. ""We cannot allow the train of infection that is thundering
through our country to continue at its current pace,"" Prime
Minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. With ministers and public health officials urging people toget their booster jabs when eligibleor to take the vaccine for the first time if they have not already, the BBC caught up with three members of a family in Bournemouth - each at different stages of vaccination. Mum Safaa Abdal Motalb was getting her booster while her 16-year-old son Yasin was getting his second dose. Her elder son, 22-year-old Omar, was getting the Covid jab for the first time. Omar said he was scared of needles but added: ""It didn't hurt. ""Itâs
a quick thing to do, you just do it, you donât think about it and you get past
it straight away. It just makes sure the world is a safer place,"" he said. He said he works as an outdoor activity instructor so he's often around children, so it was especially important for him to get protected. Yasin and Safaa said they were keen to get vaccinated because they needed to travel. ""To be
safe, we all need to be safe,"" said Safaa. ""Once
we all have it, it will be safer for the community. You can take it easy and
enjoy yourself,"" said Yasin. A further 50,584 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. There have also been another 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The acceleration of delivering booster jabs will start no later than 13 December, NHS England says. In a letter sent to health leaders, NHS England said the booking service for booster jabs would be updated to reflect the reduction of the time between doses to three months ""as soon as possible and no later than 13 December"". As we've reported before, it confirmed that booster doses would be delivered ""in descending age groups, with priority given to the vaccination of older adults and those in a Covid-19 at-risk group first"". There were ""no supply challenges"" with either Moderna or Pfizer booster stocks, the letter said, and it stressed there was a ""new national mission"" to up the delivery of the jabs. GP surgeries will be allowed to defer routine health checks for those aged 75 and over to free up capacity to deliver the jabs. If you'd like to find out more about the UK's booster rollout and when you'll get your next jab,you can read all about it here. The first case of the Omicron Covid variant has been confirmed in Wales. It was found in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area, and is linked to international travel. The Welsh government says it is prepared to ""respond rapidly"" to the emerging variant, and actions are being taken to slow the spread. The government adds there is no substantial evidence that the variant will lead to a more severe illness. Read more The BBC's Andrew Harding has travelled to the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa where the new Omicron variant is causing concern. ""The new variant? Yes, I'm worried,"" says Fana Dlamini, 43, loading a bucket with sea water for use in what he says is a religious ceremony.

Reality Check A pop-up vaccination centre in Soweto, South Africa The Omicron variant appears to be
driving a sharp increase in new infections in South Africa. Some 11,500 new coronavirus cases were registered on 2 December. That's a sharp rise on the 8,500
cases confirmed the previous day. ""From the numbers over the last seven days and the curve
depicting them, there is a much steeper upward curve than has ever been seen in
the last three waves,"" says Health Minister Joe Phaahla. Gauteng province accounts for the highest number of coronavirus
infections being reported in the country (about 70%). And last month, Omicron accounted for 74% of all samples sequenced in
South Africa. But most of the sequencing to confirm the variant was done in
Gauteng province, so itâs not yet clear just how prevalent the variant is in other areas. Gauteng is also among three provinces with the lowest vaccination
rates. It has 32% of the adult population fully vaccinated, compared with the
national average of 37%. But even some provinces with higher rates of vaccination have seen sharp rises in case numbers over the past week. Omicron cases in Scotland have jumped by 16 in the past 24 hours to 29. The Scottish government warns cases of the new variant could rise significantly over the coming days as it stresses those reported so far are no longer all linked to a single event. A statement says reported cases are now linked to several different sources - including a Steps concert at the Glasgow Hydro on 22 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says: ""This confirms our view that there is now community transmission of this variant within Scotland. ""Given the nature of transmission we would expect to see cases rise - perhaps significantly - in the days ahead."" Retailers are continuing to put up fuel prices when they should be reducing them in line with savings in wholesale oil prices, the RAC motoring services organisation has said. In response to concerns about the Omicron variant, oil prices fell by around $10 (Â£7.50) a barrel last week. But this reduced wholesale fuel price has not been reflected at the pumps. Retailers added on average another 3.1p to a litre of unleaded petrol and 2.7p to diesel in November. The RAC said this hike in petrol prices was ""completely unjustified"", with larger retailers making a ""shocking"" profit. ""Since Covid, they've been far more reluctant to pass on any savings, even though the frequency with which they buy means they are in a position to pass on any savings in the wholesale price to drivers far more quickly,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams told the BBC. ""It would be much fairer if retailers mirrored wholesale prices more closely on a daily or weekly basis."" In particular, the RAC pointed the finger at supermarket chains who are major fuel retailers, such as Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons, saying they should have reduced prices, but had instead increased them ""unnecessarily"".

Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring In a sign of mounting concern over the Omicron strain of Covid-19, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to come up with a plan for combating it, and also to make more funds available for tackling coronavirus. According toPresident Putin's order published on the Kremlin website,external, the plan must include measures such as making vaccines more effective against Omicron and making more hospital beds available for new patients. The Russian government has four days to work out the plan. Putin gave Russia's regions until 15 December to come up with action plans of their own in consultation with the central health ministry in Moscow. Also today, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova sounded alarm over the continuing epidemic in Russia.

By contrast, daily infections were averaging between 200 and 300 in mid-November, as shown in this chart:  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The first real world data showing the coronavirus variant Omicron may evade some of our immunity has been reported by scientists in South Africa. Scientists have detected a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times. It is a rapid analysis and not definitive, but fits with concern about the mutations the variant possesses. It is also not clear what this means for the protection given by vaccines. Scientists have analysed nearly 36,000 suspected re-infections in South Africa to look for any changes to re-infection rates (catching it twice or more) throughout the pandemic. They showed there was no surge in the risk of re-infection during either the Beta or Delta waves. This is despite laboratory studies suggesting those variants had the potential to evade some immunity. However, they are now detecting a spike in re-infections.

"New MP Louie French wore predecessor Mr Brokenshire's rosette on election night as a mark of respect The Conservatives have held the safe suburban London seat of Old Bexley and Sidcup in a by-election. Their candidate, local councillor Louie French, won more than half the votes, with Labour's Daniel Francis second. Mr French paid tribute to the area's former MP, James Brokenshire, whose death from cancer in October triggered the contest. The Tories' majority has been cut from nearly 19,000 to 4,478, with a 10% swing to Labour. In an email to supporters, the new Conservative MP said party members ""don't have time to rest on our laurels"" and urged them to donate funds to help with campaigning in the next by-election in two weeks' time. The North Shropshire seat was vacated by Owen Paterson,who resigned after breaking lobbying rules. Although votes at mid-term polls are usually lower than at general elections, the 34% turnout on Thursday was the lowest at a by-election since 2018. Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - came third with 6.6% of the vote, with the party's leader and candidate Richard Tice describing it as a ""massive result"". The Green Party and Liberal Democrats both lost their deposits. By-election: Tory wobbles in true blue Bexley? Tributes to MP Brokenshire, who has died aged 53 Bexley is a traditionally strong area for the Conservatives and the party has held the constituency in its current form since its creation in 1983. Labour's Ellie Reeves, MP for nearby Lewisham West and Penge, said she was ""pleased with the result"". ""This is a Conservative stronghold, somewhere that had a 19,000 majority at the last general election and what we've seen tonight is that majority being slashed,"" she added. But Tory Party chairman Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast the reduced majority for his party ""reflected a very low turnout"". He described the victory as a ""good solid result for us"", adding it was consistent with elections held in the middle of a Parliament. Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""This idea that Labour have made some surge ahead is really for the birds."" by Ione Wells, BBC political correspondent This Conservative hold hasn't taken anyone by surprise. It's a seat as ""true blue"" as they come. Expectation management from the opposition parties has been going on for weeks - with all of them privately admitting the Tories' 19,000-strong majority would be very difficult to overturn. Labour are encouraged by the 10% swing to them, claiming that as a positive sign for more marginal seats in future elections. But retaining more than half the votes is a good result for the Tories too. Senior MPs who have knocked doors here in recent weeks all pointed out that governing parties used to get a hammering in midterm by-elections - seen by some voters as a free hit to send the government a message, without significantly shifting the power balance in Westminster. The Lib Dems were not expecting a good result here at all, instead throwing all their resources at the North Shropshire by-election in two weeks' time. In that contest they hope to replicate their stunning victory in Chesham and Amersham, where they overturned a large Tory majority. Tory nerves have been more tangible about that by-election - where all sides feel there is a lot more to play for. The Bexley by-election was prompted by the death of former MP James Brokenshire, who died from lung cancer aged 53 in October. At the 2019 general election, he held the south-east London seat with a majority of almost 19,000, taking 64.5% of the vote. Wearing the rosette of his predecessor, Mr French paid an emotional tribute to him in his acceptance speech, adding that the contest had been tough but ""fought with dignity"". He vowed to ""work tirelessly to repay the trust that you've placed in me and I will not let you down"". ""My focus will now be delivering on those promises that I made during the campaign - get our fair share of London's police officers, securing more investment for local schools and hospitals, protecting our precious green spaces.""

"One in 60 people in the UK would test positive for Covid in the week ending 27 November - ONS estimates suggest So just over one million (1,087,000) would test positive - up slightly from 1,035,000 last week, the figures show Separately, a UK trial of seven different jabs finds Pfizer and Moderna vaccines give the best booster response And a review finds the risk of catching Covid remains higher for people belonging to certain ethnic groups Scientists in South Africa are meanwhile detecting a surge in the number of people catching Covid multiple times, as early data suggests Omicron may evade some immunity But experts say it's still too early to say if the new variant - which is driving a new wave there - causes more serious illness A further 50,584 coronavirus cases are reported in the UK, and 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now. Here's a
reminder of the day's main developments:  Today's live page posts were written by Alexandra
Fouche, Emma Harrison, Alex Kleiderman and Joseph Lee. The live page was edited
by Holly Wallis and Lauren Turner. Thanks for joining us. Rachel SchraerBBC Reality Check Low vaccination rates might be one reason for variants The Omicron variant was first identified in South Africa, in a region with relatively low rates of vaccination. But making a link between
the two is not straightforward. The virus
mutates as it jumps between people as well as within a sick person. So in a
population with a low vaccination rate, there will be more infected people
around, and a greater opportunity for the virus to change. But potentially harmful mutations
can take hold when the virus faces new challenges like vaccines â so a
population with some immunity but with the virus widely present is a perfect
environment for new mutations to emerge. It follows that a highly vaccinated
population where infection rates are low probably provides the best barrier
against potentially harmful mutations. The challenge is to get from a low
to a high-vaccination environment as quickly as possible. âA mix is the worst thing, but
unfortunately we all have to pass through having that mix to get to the other
side,â Prof Rowland Kao, a veterinary epidemiologist says. Another factor is how many
people in a population have suppressed immune systems and could be
ill with the virus for a long time, giving it more chance to mutate. One theory is that Omicron emerged in an immunosuppressed person or
population â possibly with untreated HIV which is a big problem in the southern
African region. But this is very difficult to prove without knowing exactly where it first emerged. There are no plans to increase the level of Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland before Christmas, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says. She says the existing restrictions are ""enough"" at this time. The Sinn FÃ©in vice-president also hit out at those responsible for a fake message on social media suggesting a return to lockdown. ""Those engaged in disinformation are shameful, it's causing confusion,"" she says. Read more It remains likely that the Omicron cases identified so far in England are a result of a number of ""separate introductions"" into the country, the UK Health Security Agency says. Its latest statement,externalsays available data is limited at this ""early stage"". Delta remains the predominant variant in England, it says, accounting for more than 99% of all Covid-19 cases. There were 22 confirmed cases of Omicron in England, as of 30 November. A total of 12 of these cases were more than 14 days after receiving at least two doses of vaccine; two were more than 28 days after a first jab; and six were unvaccinated. Two had no available information. None of these cases are known to have resulted in hospitalisation or death, the agency added. Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News Leading HIV and Covid
researcher, Prof Penny Moore, says that two pandemics colliding has
created aâperfect stormâ in South Africa. Prof Moore, from the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, is at the
scientific front line of the mission to understand the threat that the Omicron
variant poses to the world. âUnfortunately in
South Africa we have a massive HIV pandemic and many, many untreated people,â
she told BBC Radio 4âs Inside Science programme. âWhen these people have
a SARS CoV-2 infection, thereâs increased risk theyâll struggle to clear it.
The longer a person has an infection, the higher the odds that the virus will
pick up a mutation that somehow benefits it. âThis is one plausible
explanation for how Omicron - and other variants - emerged.â Prof Moore added that, wherever Omicron emerged, âit
has properties that make it a risk for all of us - whether we're HIV positive
or not. âIt was identified in
South Africa, but it's now across the world. We see community transmission and
transmissions that are not linked to sub-Saharan Africa. Blocking travel to our
country makes it more scientifically difficult to tackle this project.â Prof Moore added that
the techniques and platforms developed for HIV research have accelerated
scientistsâ ability to understand Covid. âWe now need to
transfer that sense of urgency back to HIV,â she told the BBC. You can listen to
Professor Mooreâs full interview with BBC science correspondent Victoria Gill

week, particularly in cities that border other countries, and seaports. There
have been 80 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours, many of those close to the
Mongolian border. However, there is not yet any indication the new
variant has reached Chinaâs mainland. Chinaâs official Xinhua news agency said
on Wednesday thatno local cases of Omicron had been detected,external. Papers have stressed over the last week that Chinaâs
zero-Covid strategy â meaning that lockdowns are imposed the moment cases are
discovered - will prevent any variant from being transmitted widely. In the last week,six cases of the new variant have been confirmed in Hong Kong,external, however. Yet all these cases have been imports, meaning that arrivals were quarantined
on entry to the city, and there is no local transmission. If an outbreak were to occur in Hong Kong, it could
threaten imminent plans to make quarantine-free travel possible between
Hong Kong and mainland China. A âHong Kong Health Codeâ system has been launched today to
facilitate this, which will provisionally allow 1,000 people to travel daily
between the two regions - which have different Covid-19 procedures in place -
without needing to quarantine. Registration for this is set to begin on 10
December. As we mentioned earlier, Belgium was going to consider a recommendation to shut schools along with a limit on the number of spectators for indoor events in view of the rising number of cases. We've now heard that they've decided to bring school holidays forward by a week for nurseries and primary schools and masks will be made compulsory in schools from age six. Secondary schools will shift to a
hybrid system, with half of classes being done at home. Officials have also given the go ahead for a limit of 200 spectators to be imposed at indoor events. Bars and restaurants will still be able to open until 23:00. ""We cannot allow the train of infection that is thundering
through our country to continue at its current pace,"" Prime
Minister Alexander De Croo told a news conference. With ministers and public health officials urging people toget their booster jabs when eligibleor to take the vaccine for the first time if they have not already, the BBC caught up with three members of a family in Bournemouth - each at different stages of vaccination. Mum Safaa Abdal Motalb was getting her booster while her 16-year-old son Yasin was getting his second dose. Her elder son, 22-year-old Omar, was getting the Covid jab for the first time. Omar said he was scared of needles but added: ""It didn't hurt. ""Itâs
a quick thing to do, you just do it, you donât think about it and you get past
it straight away. It just makes sure the world is a safer place,"" he said. He said he works as an outdoor activity instructor so he's often around children, so it was especially important for him to get protected. Yasin and Safaa said they were keen to get vaccinated because they needed to travel. ""To be
safe, we all need to be safe,"" said Safaa. ""Once
we all have it, it will be safer for the community. You can take it easy and
enjoy yourself,"" said Yasin. A further 50,584 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. There have also been another 143 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The acceleration of delivering booster jabs will start no later than 13 December, NHS England says. In a letter sent to health leaders, NHS England said the booking service for booster jabs would be updated to reflect the reduction of the time between doses to three months ""as soon as possible and no later than 13 December"". As we've reported before, it confirmed that booster doses would be delivered ""in descending age groups, with priority given to the vaccination of older adults and those in a Covid-19 at-risk group first"". There were ""no supply challenges"" with either Moderna or Pfizer booster stocks, the letter said, and it stressed there was a ""new national mission"" to up the delivery of the jabs. GP surgeries will be allowed to defer routine health checks for those aged 75 and over to free up capacity to deliver the jabs. If you'd like to find out more about the UK's booster rollout and when you'll get your next jab,you can read all about it here. The first case of the Omicron Covid variant has been confirmed in Wales. It was found in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area, and is linked to international travel. The Welsh government says it is prepared to ""respond rapidly"" to the emerging variant, and actions are being taken to slow the spread. The government adds there is no substantial evidence that the variant will lead to a more severe illness.

""We've provided Â£4.2bn of support to help people with the cost of living, including effectively cutting taxes for workers on Universal Credit, providing Â£500m of targeted support for the most vulnerable families and freezing fuel duty for the twelfth year in a row."" Analysis by the RAC found that despite wholesale costs having fallen by 7p from the middle of the month, retailers continued to put prices up, with the average cost of a litre of unleaded petrol ending the month at 147.28p and diesel up to 150.64p. Prices for both fuels peaked at record highs on 20 November and 21 November respectively - diesel reaching 151.1p per litre and petrol at 147.72p. The key factor affecting petrol is the wholesale oil market, meaning any reduction in the oil price should result in buyers paying less at the pumps. While the price of petrol is linked to the wholesale price of oil, it is competitively driven. That means the cost motorists are charged is not directly linked to crude. Instead, suppliers control the prices they sell petrol at. Mr Williams explained that the current margins big retailers are making have gone up as high as 20p a litre, which is ""unheard of when everyone is driving"". ""Sadly, our data shows all too clearly that drivers are being taken for a ride by retailers at the moment,"" he said. However, on Tuesday, motoring group the AA said that the UK's average petrol prices did begin to show the first ""significant fall"" since November 2020. Having peaked above 54.5p a litre in the second week of November, the petrol cost to retailers was down to 49p at the start of last week and yesterday dropped below 43p a litre. But the RAC said it was not enough of a fall to reflect the plummet in wholesale prices. The AA welcomed the consumer petrol price fall, but criticised the fact it had taken so much longer to drop in relation to falling wholesale prices. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman said that previously, the market would ""wait until Asda or Morrisons announced a price cut before starting to move"". ""Without that initial kick, pump prices have stagnated, and that is a potentially worrying development if it sets the pattern for the future,"" he said. ""In basic pounds, shillings and pence, if a supermarket makes a big deal about discounts of Â£2 or Â£3 off the shopping bill, but grabs back Â£2 to Â£3 per tank by not passing on savings at the pump, the consumer needs to factor that in."" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) represents independently-owned forecourts that collectively account for around two thirds of the UK's forecourts. Because its members buy fuel less frequently than larger supermarkets, it told the BBC that reductions in wholesale prices can take some days to filter through to the pump price. ""Electricity prices, business rates, labour costs have all risen and these need to be paid for if your local petrol station is to remain in business,"" said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. He added that fuel retailers have been hit by the  ""double whammy"" of reduced sales and rising costs. ""Our members continually monitor prices to ensure that they remain competitive with their industry counterparts and continue to provide good value for money.""
