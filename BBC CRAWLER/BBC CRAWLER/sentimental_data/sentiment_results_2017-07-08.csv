"Pedro AuniÃ³n Monroy was a trained dancer, specialising in aerial stunts An acrobat from Brighton has died after reportedly falling 100ft (30m) during a stunt at a rock festival in Spain. Specialist in aerial dance Pedro AuniÃ³n Monroy, was suspended in a cage during the Mad Cool festival in Madrid, on Friday night. While near the main stage, in-between the performances by alt-J and Green Day, he fell. Paramedics spent 30 minutes trying to revive him, but were unable to save him. Mr Monroy from Portslade, who trained in the schools of Pilar LÃ³pez, Cristina Rota and in the Royal Conservatory of Dance, had his own performance company, In Fact Aerial Dance, based in Brixton, London. He also worked as a self-employed massage therapist at The Grand Hotel, Brighton. Speaking to the BBC, the hotel's general manager Andrew Mosley said: ""We are all very sad to hear the news, it is the most terrible news and our hearts go out to his friends and family."" He added the sports masseur enjoyed half marathons and was a very popular member of the staff. Just a few days before the festival, he posted a picture and a last message on Facebook of himself and his partner which said ""love, come to my arms"". Mr Monroy's last Facebook post before his death was a loving message to his partner The festival organisers did not initially inform the audience or the bands the fall was fatal because of ""security reasons"" and around 40 minutes after, Green Day took to the stage for their set. Tweeting after their performance Green Day said,external: ""We just got off stage at Mad Cool Festival to disturbing news. A very brave artist named Pedro lost his life tonight in a tragic accident.

The six-year-old Sunderland fandied on Fridayfollowing a fight with neuroblastoma - a rare type of cancer. The club's former striker struck up a close friendship with the avid Black Cats fan and club mascot in the months before his death. A tweet by the 34-year-old described Bradley as a ""little superstar"". It said the youngster's ""courage and bravery will inspire me for the rest of my life"". He wrote,external: ""Goodbye my friend, gonna miss you lots. I feel so blessed God brought u into my life and had some amazing moments with u and for that I'm so grateful"". Bradley, from Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, was diagnosed with the disease when he was 18 months old. He underwent treatment and was in remission, but relapsed last year. His plight touched the lives of many, and well-wishers raised more than Â£700,000 in 2016 to pay for him to be given antibody treatment in New York. But medics then found his cancer had grown and his family was informed his illness was terminal. Bradley has been Sunderland mascot several times with his ""best mate"" Defoe His death wasconfirmed on social media,externalby his parents.

"The wonky bike, which was spotted by a chuckling Paula Brown, has since been repainted by the contractors responsible A wonky cycle path sign that appeared in the Lincolnshire market town of Sleaford last weekend caused much mirth among local residents, who described it aslooking like a penny farthing- albeit one with angular wheels. But this was far from the first time bungling contractors have been left with red faces. BBC News rounds up some of the gaffes that have hit the headlines. The sign outside Highfield Community Primary School was corrected within 24 hours When a misspelt road marking appeared outside a school in Chester, the finger of blame was as usual pointed at hapless contractors. The lettering outside Highfield Community Primary School, in Blacon, was ""claer"" evidence that spelling was not the forte of the person who painted it. The marking washastily corrected, at no cost to the council, after it appeared in February 2014. The unnecessary ""I"" was eventually covered up with black paint At least the simplest of fixes was possible when blundering workmen misspelled the word ""minutes"" as ""minuites"" at an NCP car park at Cambridge's railway station. Although it was two years before anything was done about the gaffe, eventually an NCP boss harnessed an inner Mick Jagger and gave the order: ""I want it painted black."" Thus the offending ""I"" was covered up to restore basic literacy to this corner of Cambridge. NCP said those responsible for the cock-up were ""committed to playing Scrabble in their lunchtimes as spelling revision"". These markings were branded ""ridiculous"" A set of double yellow lines that appeared in Cardiff last summer couldn't be faulted in terms of execution - but the location chosen for the markings led to the city council being widely mocked. That's because the road on which the lines were painted is barely 5ft (1.5m) wide andtoo narrow for anything but a toy car. Despite the markings being branded ""ridiculous"" and a ""waste of money"", the beleaguered council stuck to its guns, arguing the double yellows were necessary to ""deter anti-social parking on the narrow access lane"". The seabird is straight ahead, motorist Motorists using a supermarket petrol station in Doncaster were amused to find themselves being directed towards a species of low-flying seabird. The word""petrel"" was painted in 3ft letters, next to the flawlessly spelt word ""exit"" and some perfectly drawn arrows, on the approach to the pumps at the Sainsbury's Edenthorpe store in September 2016. In a light-hearted response, Sainsbury's said it was ""correcting the misteke"". This ""ridiculous"" piece of road painting led the council to urge contractors to use ""common sense"" Not wanting to let anything as inconvenient as a parked car get in their way, slapdash council contractors tasked with painting double yellow lines in a suburb of Leeds simply daubed the markings around the vehicle. However, once the car's owner returned and drove away, the lines wereleft sticking out from the kerb,external. Leeds City Council branded the markings in Hyde Terrace, Clarendon, as ""ridiculous"" and said it would remind contractors ""to use common sense"" in future. The lines were later repainted. All official road signs in Wales are bilingual Welsh-speaking drivers in Swansea were bemused to encounter a road sign that informed them: ""I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated."" Above the baffling statement on the dual-language sign was the correct wording in English: ""No entry for heavy goods vehicles. Residential site only"". The howler came about because a non-Welsh speaking council employeeemailed the authority's in-house translation service,external, and took the response received as the translation being sought for the new road sign.

"The two boys and a girl were all under the age of 13, police say A woman and three children have died after a house fire in Bolton. The blaze broke out at Rosamond Street in the Daubhill area of the town just after 09:00 BST. A man managed to jump from a first floor window but two boys and a girl - all under the age of 13 - and a woman were still inside. One of the children was pronounced dead at the scene and the woman and two other children died later in hospital, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. The force said it was currently not treating the fire as suspicious. A man jumped from the first floor before trying to rescue other residents One resident said: ""It's terrible, absolutely terrible. I saw them bringing people out. They were doing chest compressions. ""I saw them bring two out and then they put a green sheet up."" She said she was first alerted to a ""commotion"" when she heard a man ""banging on a door"" of one of the terraced houses. ""There was just a load of hammering... I went to the window and saw smoke billowing. ""When I saw him after, he had his hands bandaged up and his head."" Assistant fire officer Tony Hunter said the man, believed to be the children's father, had jumped from the first floor window and tried to get back into the property to rescue them and their mother. He is currently being treated in hospital. Mr Hunter added firefighters had to use a specialist tool to break the front door down. They found the heat had been so ""intense"" it had burnt off plaster on the walls to reveal the brick underneath, he said. A child was pronounced dead at the scene and a woman and two other children died in hospital Police have launched a joint investigation with Manchester Fire and Rescue into the cause of the blaze. Det Ch Insp Chris Bridge, from GMP, said: ""These are utterly heartbreaking circumstances and our thoughts go out to anyone affected by this tragic incident. ""This happened on a Saturday morning when many people would be up and about and I would appeal to anyone with any information about this incident to please call us."" The fire, which has now been extinguished, led to the temporary closure of nearby roads. Manchester Fire and Rescue tweeted: ""Our deepest condolences go to the family and the community.

"The Lynx UK Trust wants to place up to six lynx in Kielder for a five-year trial Plans to reintroduce the Eurasian lynx 1,300 years after it became extinct in the UK will be submitted soon, campaigners have said. The Lynx UK Trustwants to import up to six of the catsfrom Sweden to Kielder Forest in Northumberland. With a public consultation over, thetrust said the five year trial,externalplan would go to Natural England by September. It has been criticised by some residents and sheep farmers. The trust said the lynx hunt in woods and would control the deer population The scheme would see four to six lynx wearing radio tracking devices with Kielder chosen due to its dense woodland and low number of roads. The trust said the animals would help control deer numbers as well provide a tourism boost. Dr Paul O'Donoghue from the trusttold the Guardian,externalthe lynx ""belongs here"" and is an ""intrinsic part of the the UK environment"". He also told the paper he hoped the lynx could be in the forest by the end of the year. Sheep farmers fear the animals could target their livestock although the trust said the cats would hunt in woods rather than fields. The trust did admit, however, that some sheep could be killed but farmers would be ""generously compensated"" for any losses. Phil Stocker, chief executive of the National Sheep Association, said there were several hundred sheep farmers around Kielder, any one of whom could be affected by the lynx. He said valuing a sheep was complex and, money aside, there were major welfare concerns. Mr Stocker said people would not accept animals facing ""unnecessary pain"" and one sheep being attacked by a lynx could cause major stress and possible damage to others in the flock. He said the UK no longer had the ""landscape"" for the lynx to be ""genetically sustainable"" and it would not be in the cat's interest to be reintroduced into an environment that, thanks to roads and industry, has changed so much since the cat existed here.

"Prison officers have confiscated 225kg (about 500lb) of drugs in one year in England and Wales, according to the Ministry of Justice. In 2016, 13,000 mobile phones and 7,000 Sim cards were also seized from prisoners. The haul comes after new mobile phone detectors were introduced, as well as 300 specialist dogs for drug detection. New Justice Secretary David Lidington said he was not content with the state of prisons, and hoped to improve them. Four weeks into his new post, Mr Lidington told BBC's Andrew Marr show that he planned to put in place ""effective measures"" to more accurately detect drugs, phones and drones. In recent years, legal highs - or psychoactive drugs - had become a problem, he said, as the prison population had shifted in character to include more gangsters and a higher proportion of sexual and violent offenders. This video can not be played Watch a drone deliver drugs and mobile phones to London prisoners in April 2016 The government's National Offender Management scheme previously said that by using mobile phones, inmates had: ""commissioned murder, planned escapes, imported automatic firearms and arranged drug imports"". Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said it was ""clear that we have a crisis"" and blamed the findings on cuts to prison budgets. Director of the Prison Reform Trust, Peter Dawson, said the Prison Service should consider giving prisoners legitimate access to mobile phones as they helped people ""cope with the experience"" and prepare for release. ""It's in all our interests that people retain their family ties and the phone is an obvious way of doing that,"" he said. Mr Dawson said it was ""pointless"" tracking down inmates who used a mobile to ""call their mum"" rather than for criminal purposes. This video can not be played Undercover footage shows prisoners incapacitated by drugs Former prisoner Alex Cavendish, who was released in March 2014, said the contraband haul was the ""tip of the iceberg"". He told BBC Radio 5 live that cuts to staffing budgets and ""corrupt"" prison officers were to blame, adding: ""It's really proving a struggle to keep these things out of prisons."" Dave Todd of the Prison Officers Association conceded that ""you get corruption"" in the prison workforce, but added that a lack of experienced staff ""destabilised regimes"". ""It needs addressing fundamentally by recruitment and retention of prison officers,"" he told BBC One's Breakfast, adding: ""New prison officers may be compromised by threats, they may be taken in by financial gain, which is not acceptable and my union doesn't defend those people."" In February, a reporter fromBBC's Panorama programmewent undercover at HMP Northumberland, where he found a number of inmates incapacitated from taking the drug spice. In 2016, more than 45% of prisoners in a survey conducted by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons said it was easy to get drugs behind bars. The overall number of staff employed across prisons has fallen from 45,000 to just under 31,000 in September 2016. Mr Lidington said the government planned to have 2,500 new officers trained and in place in England and Wales by the end of next year  - 500 of whom were already working. He said that at the cabinet table he would push forward ""very vigorously"" with a programme for prison reform and measures to increase security and reduce violence. The Ministry of Justice also said prisons were working to curb the use of drones in delivering phones and drugs, by creating ""a specialist squad of prison and police officers"". To date, 35 people have been arrested and 11 others have been convicted for drone-related activities. The department began rolling out tests for psychoactive substances at prisons in September 2016. It is also working with mobile network operators to develop ways of blocking mobile phone signals in prisons.

"Ms Trump accompanied her father to earlier sessions before sitting in for him later In an unusual move Ivanka Trump briefly took her father Donald's seat at a summit of world leaders on Saturday. The US president had stepped away for a meeting with the Indonesian leader during the G20 meeting. Ms Trump is an adviser to her father, but a leader's absence is usually covered by high-ranking officials. A BBC correspondent at the summit said he could recall no similar precedent. There has been widespread criticism on social media. Mr Trump returned a short while later to retake his seat between the British prime minister and the Chinese president.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Trade will be a very big factor between our two countries"" US President Donald Trump has said he expects a ""powerful"" trade deal with the UK to be completed ""very quickly"". Speaking at the G20 summit in Hamburg, he said he would visit London. Asked when, he said: ""We'll work that out."" In one-to-one talks, Mr Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May agreed to prioritise work on a post-Brexit trade deal, a UK government official said. Mrs May said she was ""optimistic"" about a deal, but warned there was ""a limit"" to what could be done before Brexit. She told a news conference that world leaders - including those from China, India and Japan, as well as the US - had expressed a ""strong desire"" to forge ""ambitious new bilateral trading relationships"" with Britain. The prime minister hailed it as a ""powerful vote of confidence"" in Britain. Asked about Mr Trump's visit the UK, Mrs May said: ""We don't have a date yet, we are still working on a date."" This video can not be played Theresa May was asked about Donald Trump's proposed visit to the UK Earlier, during a 50-minute meeting with Mr Trump - which overran by 20 minutes - the two leaders spent a ""significant"" amount of time on trade, in a discussion described as entirely ""positive"", Downing Street said. Before their meeting, Mr Trump hailed the ""very special relationship"" he had developed with Mrs May. ""There is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries,"" he told reporters. ""We have been working on a trade deal which will be a very, very big deal, a very powerful deal, great for both countries and I think we will have that done very, very quickly."" Ivanka Trump takes father's seat at G20 Climate change holds up G20 progress Trump and Putin meet face to face Under EU rules, formal talks between London and Washington cannot begin until after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, without EU agreement. Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to Washington, said Mr Trump's statement of intent was a ""very good sign for the future"" and would be ""useful"" to Mrs May. However, Sir Simon Fraser, a former diplomat who served as a permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, cast doubt on how soon any trade deal could be reached. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Donald Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Theresa May seem to be enjoying another photo shoot ""The point is we can't negotiate with them or anyone else until we've left the European Union,"" he said. ""And the Americans and others will not negotiate with us until they know what our relationship with the EU is going to be, because the access we have in Europe is hugely important for the advantages that they can get from their relations with us."" Mr Trump has previously accepted an invitation for a state visit to the UK - a prospect that has caused controversy - although no date has been given. Mr Meyer said his visit would be a ""very important moment"" to nail down Mr Trump's commitment to a strong bilateral agreement. By Rob Young, BBC business correspondent Under EU rules, formal talks between London and Washington cannot begin until March 2019, unless Brussels agrees the UK can make a start earlier. Trade talks tend to be complex and technical, lasting several years. The EU and Japan took four years to reach an agreement in principle. But those discussions involved 29 nations; UK-US talks would involve just two. With strong political will and determination, a transatlantic agreement could perhaps be completed more speedily than has been the norm for trade pacts. Talks would cover cutting customs duties, making products such as cars and food cheaper. The average UK-US tariff is relatively low anyway, at 3%, and huge amounts of trade already take place. Negotiations usually cover thornier topics, such as food safety and environmental standards. If one side agreed to accept the other's rules, a deal could be done quickly. But that would be controversial in various sectors. That's when negotiations can begin to drag. Mrs May later said she was ""dismayed"" Mr Trump had withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change. The accord, signed in Paris in 2015, is an international agreement on how to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. Mrs May said she raised the issue during one of ""a number"" of conversations she had with Mr Trump at the summit - not during the official bilateral talks. The prime minister said she had ""urged President Trump to rejoin"", adding: ""I continue to hope that is exactly what the United States will do."" Clashes erupt at Germany G20 protest Brexit reduces UK's global clout - Hague Mrs May also held a 20-minute meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a 25-minute meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. Talks with Mr Abe focused on trade and North Korea's nuclear missile programme. Japan's new trade deal with the EU, signed off on Thursday, ""could form the basis"" of an agreement between London and Tokyo following Brexit, Mrs May told her fellow leader. Meanwhile, Mr Modi told Mrs May he wanted to see economic links with the UK deepen now and after Brexit, according to a UK government official. Shinzo Abe and Theresa May discussed trade and North Korea's nuclear missile programme After a meeting on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China and the UK were in a ""golden era"" of relations and increased investment from his country since the Brexit vote showed its confidence in Britain. The G20 summit is the first gathering of world leaders since the UK's general election last month, during which Mrs May's Conservative party lost seats and her performance was widely criticised. The two-day meeting is being held against a backdrop of violent protests on the streets of Hamburg, with demonstrators and heavily-armed police clashing into the early hours of Saturday. The protests centre mainly on the presence of Mr Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, climate change and global wealth inequalities.

"There are about 1.2 billion Roman Catholics around the world Bread used to celebrate the Eucharist during Roman Catholic Mass must not be gluten-free - although it may be made from genetically modified organisms, the Vatican has reminded its bishops. In a letter, Cardinal Robert Sarah said the bread could be low-gluten. But he said there must be enough protein in the wheat to make it without additives. The cardinal said the reminder was needed because the bread was now sold in supermarkets and on the internet. Roman Catholics believe bread and wine served at the Eucharist are converted into the body and blood of Christ through a process known as transubstantiation. Glossary of Roman Catholic terms The letter reiterated advice first given in 2004. The wine used must also be ""natural, from the fruit of the grape, pure and incorrupt, not mixed with other substances"", said Cardinal Robert Sarah of the Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.

"More than 80,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Italy this year They call themselves Generation Identity. Made up of mainly 20-something tech-savvy members, the Identitarian movement has been described as the hipster right. Fiercely anti-immigration and anti-Muslim, its aim is to stop mass migration to Europe. With headquarters in Austria andFrance,the group may be small in size, but its message is starting to resonate in Italy - a country where sympathy for migrants is wearing thin. As the number of people seeking to reach Europe rises again, Italy continues to be the major point of entry for those arriving illegally on boats - particularly in the south. However, attitudes are hardening and now this new ""alt-right"" movement says it will do whatever it can to protect Italian identity and culture from outsiders. Since the start of 2017, more than 80,000 people have made the journey from Libya, across the Mediterranean, to Italian shores, the vast majority landing in Sicily. Around 2,000 are thought to have died in the attempt, but with almost all other European countries closing their borders, most of the survivors end up staying in Italy. The vast majority are not refugees fleeing war, but are considered economic migrants and mainly come from sub-Saharan Africa and as far as the Indian sub-continent. Aboard the Mediterranean's migrant rescue boats Syrian Journey: Choose your own escape route Alarmingly, there's been a rise in the number of young girls from Nigeria who are forced into prostitution, while boys as young as 16 from Bangladesh are coming via Dubai and Libya looking for work. ""More than 90% of the immigrants coming here by boat are economic refugees,"" claims 20-year-old Viviana Randazzo, a newly-recruited member of the Identitarians, although official Italian statistics put the figure at 85%. Viviana Randazzo says migrants receive preferential treatment ""We Italians are also suffering from poverty. Yet we are not given the same treatment - our needs perhaps count even less than theirs."" Italy is feeling the full burden of these new arrivals and there are now concerns that anti-immigration activists are exploiting the crisis for their own ends, calling for the ""remigration"" of second and third generation immigrants and the closure of mosques. The Identitarians point the finger of blame at aid agencies and NGOs (non-governmental organisations) operating close to the Libyan coastline, accusing them of essentially acting as a taxi service to Europe. ""I think these [migrants] are coming to Europe because they know someone will save them,"" the movement's Italy co-ordinator, Lorenzo Fiato, told me in Catania, on Sicily's eastern coast. ""You can't solve this problem by helping the human traffickers do their jobs, because they want to transport illegal migrants."" Lorenzo Fiato says the Identitarians want to defend Europe against multiculturalism The NGOs say they operate in co-ordination with the Italian coastguard and argue that they are there to save lives. ""[The people smugglers] don't need a 'pull' factor. They are pushing these people out come what may, and if we're not there, they will drown. We're not prepared to let that happen,"" says a defiant and frustrated David Alexander, from the charity Save the Children, talking to me in the western port of Trapani. This summer the Identitarian movement tried to stop a Medecins Sans Frontieres rescue ship from leaving port. The stunt failed but the group has now managed to raise more than â¬70,000 (Â£62,000) in less than three weeks, which it says it will invest in its ""Defend Europe"" campaign. Save the Children says the Vos Hestia has rescued 4,000 migrants since September 2016 Ultimately, this means the group will keep targeting boats run by NGOs trying to rescue the migrants. ""We want to defend Europe against mass immigration and multiculturalism,"" says Mr Fiato. ""We think that in every city where multiculturalism is present, radical Islam and violence is also present. ""This is a different kind of migration. These are thousands of illegal migrants coming to our shores and flooding into our cities,"" he adds. Our World: Sicily Overwhelmedis on the BBC News Channel on Saturday 8 July at 20:30 BST and on Sunday 9 July at 21:30 BST. The programme is broadcast across the weekend at various times onBBC World. Italy has recently threatened to shut its ports to foreign boats full of migrantsunless other European countries do more to help tackle the crisis.A deal has now been reached between France, Germany and Italy,externalto tighten regulations on NGOs and develop a code of conduct. This comes amid two ongoing investigations by the Italian authorities, who are trying to determine whether the NGOs are bringing migrants to Italy according to international maritime laws of saving lives, or whether they are merely assisting illegal migrants on their journey. Ambrogio Cartosio, the chief prosecutor in Trapani, said he felt that the NGOs were somehow encouraging the people smuggling trade. ""It pushes the traffickers to load the migrants on ever more precarious vessels. They can be sure that after a few miles, they will be picked up by the ships,"" he told me. The buying and selling of people is big business and the human trafficking trade continues to become more sophisticated and organised. It is estimated that this year a quarter of a million migrants will make the perilous journey from Libya to Italy, after the escalation in numbers which typically happens over the summer months. It's been described as Europe's graveyard but it's also now the only route available to them. David Alexander says people would drown if aid agencies did not get involved ""I think what is clear is that people will continue to do this, unless and until there is a safer, legal way to do it,"" says Mr Alexander. ""In the meantime, this tragedy will go on unfolding, and we will continue to pick up the pieces, and we will continue to get the blame for something that other people can solve."" While the crisis continues, so will criticism of the humanitarian effort. As will the message of intolerance. And a solution? No end in sight.

"Many of the protesters in Hamburg were demonstrating against Donald Trump's position on climate change Leaders of 19 nations at the G20 summit in Germany have renewed their pledge to implement the Paris deal on climate change, despite the US pulling out. Deadlock over the issue had held up the last day of talks in Hamburg but a final agreement was eventually reached. It acknowledges President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement without undermining the commitment of other countries. The compromise comes after violent protests in the host city. Thejoint summit statement,externalreleased on Saturday said: ""We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement."" However, the leaders of the other G20 members agreed the accord committing nations to restrict global temperature increases was ""irreversible"". In her closing news conference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she still deplored Mr Trump's position on the Paris accord but she was ""gratified"" the other 19 nations opposed its renegotiation. Memorable moments from the G20 Ivanka Trump takes father's seat at G20 How much do world leaders earn? The statement also said the US would ""endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently"". Mr Trump has pledged to help the US coal industry make a comeback and has previously characterised the Paris agreement as trying to disadvantage American workers. He won another concession on a second sticking point - trade. While renewing a pledge against protectionism, the communiquÃ© for the first time underlined the right of countries to protect their markets. Mr Trump cancelled his own scheduled news conference on Saturday, reinforcing the image of the G20 as the G19 + 1, reports the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins. It has been a divisive summit in which the rest of the world has been struggling to come to terms with the US president's ""America first"" policy, our correspondent says. ""I think it's very clear that we could not reach consensus, but the differences were not papered over, they were clearly stated,"" Mrs Merkel told reporters. She said she did not share the view of UK Prime Minister Theresa May that Washington could decide to return to the climate agreement. But Mrs May reiterated her belief that the US could rejoin the accord in her news conference on Saturday. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin: 'TV Trump is different than real Trump' And French President Emmanuel Macron also remained hopeful of persuading Mr Trump to change his mind, saying: ""I never despair of convincing him because I think it's my duty."" He announced that Paris would host another summit on 12 December to make further progress on the climate agreement and to address financing. There have been large protests in the city, with demonstrators and armed police clashing into the early hours of Saturday. Demonstrators - who were protesting against the presence of Mr Trump and Mr Putin, climate change and global wealth inequalities - set fire to vehicles and barricades, threw rocks at officers and looted shops.

Nearly 200 police officers were injured during the protests. Dozens of protesters have been detained. President Trump met Prime Minister May on the sidelines of the summit on Saturdayand said a US-UK trade deal would be signed soon. He also confirmed he would visit the UK, but said the details had still to be worked out. On Friday, the US president used his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20to discussthe alleged Russian hacking of last year's US presidential election. President Putin said on Saturday he believed President Trump had accepted his assurances that Moscow had not interfered in the vote. He said he had established a working relationship with his US counterpart and a ceasefire in southern Syria - agreed between the US, Russia and Jordan on Friday - was a result of America becoming more pragmatic.

Daisy Evans, 23, was watched by four-year-old springer poodle Boris as she picked up her degree at the University of Reading on Friday. Her 19-year-old sister Hollie suffers with anxiety, which eases in the presence of her pet. The university said it was ""delighted"" Boris could attend. Hollie was unable to speak for two years at the height of her anxiety, a problem she said improved after Boris's arrival in her life. She said the university allowing Boris to attend the graduation resulted in her family's first outing together in five years. Springer poodle Boris wore a mortar board for the graduation ceremony The teenager added: ""It's lovely to have Boris here. I get very nervous but he helps as he's a bit of a distraction.

"Caroline Hope became gravely ill after contracting E.coli during cancer treatment in Turkey A Scottish woman who contracted E.coli while undergoing treatment for cancer in a Turkish hospital has returned to Glasgow. Caroline Hope, who is from Clydebank, had been working as an English teacher in the country when she fell ill. A private plane carrying the 37-year-old landed at Glasgow Airport. Her family had feared she would not survive after contracting the bacteria and launched a JustGiving page to raise money for her return to Scotland. That appeal raised more than Â£31,000 to pay for a private medical evacuation. The fundraising appeal was in response to UK government guidelines that strictly limit the repatriation of UK citizens for medical reasons. On arrival at the airport, Caroline Hope was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city. She will eventually be moved to the Beatson cancer treatment centre. Before being diagnosed with stage four colon cancer, Caroline Hope had been teaching English at an international school in Turkey. She had planned to return to Scotland and her employer had taken out medical insurance to cover her stay at the Medical Park Hospital in Izmir until the end of July. Caroline Hope was transferred from the plane to an ambulance at Glasgow Airport However, her recovery was undermined when she became infected with E.coli during an operation to remove a tumour last month. Her mother, Catherine Hope, had been due to fly out to Turkey on Thursday but was told to stay in Scotland after the money needed to bring her daughter home was raised within hours of the appeal being launched. Catherine Hope said: ""She thought she was going to die. She wants home. She said she thought her body was giving up on her. ""But when she got on the plane, my son Scott sent me a picture of her, and she was smiling."" Scott Hope, Caroline's brother, told the BBC that doctors in Turkey had been in contact with doctors at the Beatson cancer treatment centre in Glasgow and that they were expecting his sister to be admitted there once she returned to Scotland. He added that any money raised above and beyond that required to get Ms Hope back home would be donated to the Beatson. Writing on the JustGiving page, Caroline Hope's friend Bella Shek wrote: ""We've smashed our target, unbelievable! ""Thank you, Thank you, Thank you so much. We can now get Caroline home. ""On behalf of Caroline, her family and all her friends, the support from all of you and the general public, many of whom have never met Caroline before, has been truly overwhelming.""

"Stranraer fan Jim McKie helped FC Twente supporter Dennis van Unen realise his dying wish Scottish League One outfit Stranraer have played host to Dutch top division side FC Twente thanks to links which started with a fan's dying wish. The match, which finished 5-0 to the visitors at Stair Park, was attended by hundreds of visiting fans. The clubs' links were formed when Stranraer and Rangers fan Jim McKie helped out terminally-ill FC Twente supporter Dennis van Unen. His dying wish was to see an Old Firm game, which they managed to arrange. Mr McKie and his friend James Hilton, 61, a Stranraer and Celtic fan, got hold of tickets for Mr van Unen and when he arrived in Glasgow for the game they took him on tours of Ibrox, Parkhead and Hampden. Mr van Unen (left) visited Ibrox, Parkhead and Hampden as well as attending an Old Firm game The fixture this weekend marks a decade since Mr van Unen's death from skin cancer aged 34. Links between the two clubs, some 520 miles apart, have remained strong since with Saturday's game the latest example. Mr McKie admitted he was surprised the Dutch side agreed to take part. He said: ""To be honest, when I asked them if they would come I was almost sure they would say: 'No, we can't come.'"" ""They said: 'Yes, we are coming and we are bringing the full squad - 27 players, all the coaches, everything.'"" ""Plus we don't know how many fans - it could be anything between 200 and 600 - we don't know."" He said he and Mr Hilton had never imagined what helping Mr van Unen could have led to. Links between the clubs have stayed strong since Mr van Unen's death ""It is huge, it is amazing just how it has come by one simple act,"" he said. ""James and me feel very humble about the whole thing - it is difficult at times to talk about."" However, he said that the surroundings of Stranraer's ground had come as something of a surprise to their more illustrious opponents. ""When they sent one of their team managers across to look at the facilities I could see the shock on her face,"" said Mr McKie. ""Stair Park is old school - but these guys like old school. ""They like the fact that it has not been modernised, it is not a 3G pitch - everything has been left as it is."" Stranraer chairman Iain Dougan said it was ""incredible"" to finally have the two teams meet on the pitch. ""The boys are really looking forward to it and even though it's a friendly, they're probably one of the biggest opponents we've come up against,"" he said. ""We're expecting the stadium to be packed with supporters from both sides, and businesses in the town will benefit as a result."" A memorial tournament is played every year at FC Twente in honour of Mr van Unen and another fan Boris Dijkhuizen, which Stranraer youth teams regularly participate in. Jan van Halst, technical director at the Dutch side, said: ""It's fantastic that the Scottish FC Twente supporters have helped to arrange this fixture. ""What started with a last wish from supporter Dennis van Unen has now become a close friendship between FC Twente and Stranraer."" He said they were looking forward to a ""very special friendly match"" in Scotland.

"Janice Farman had been in Mauritius since 2004 A woman who was murdered at the home she shared with her 10-year-old son in Mauritius had wanted to return to Scotland after being robbed two weeks ago, it has emerged. Janice Farman, who was 47 and originally from Clydebank, told her husband she wanted to leave the Indian Ocean island on Wednesday. Mrs Farman was asphyxiated on Friday after three masked men raided her home. She had been in Mauritius since 2004 and was working for a data group. Mrs Farman's estranged husband, Jean-Baptiste Moutou, told the BBC: ""I talked to her on the phone on Wednesday and she had expressed her wish to return to Scotland. ""She asked for my help in initiating the proceedings."" Mr Moutou said Ms Farman was robbed two weeks ago after moving to the Albion region of the country. He added: ""She decided to move to Albion and when I asked her the reason she told me she loved the beautiful beach in this region."" Police said they had yet to make an arrest in the case, contradicting earlier reports from local media that a man had been detained. Daniel Monvoisin, from the country's western criminal investigation division, said Mrs Farman had been beaten and smothered with a cushion by the intruders. They fled with a number of items, including jewellery and her car, a Nissan Tiida, which was later found abandoned by the side of the road. Mrs Farman's Nissan Tiida was later found by police at the side of the road Mrs Farman's 10-year-old son remains under the care of local child services. The British Foreign Office said it was in contact with local authorities in Mauritius about the case. An online petition has been set up by Mrs Farman's friends and work colleagues urging government action in the case. The Justice for Janice petition read: ""Janice was a gregarious lady who wholeheartedly embraced life as an islander. ""She worked tirelessly to support charitable causes and was protective towards her employees. Janice was snatched away from us by three brutes and this crime is beyond comprehension. ""How many more Janices are we going to lose because our criminal justice system is flawed?""

"Lionel Messi will pay â¬400 for every day of the 21-month sentence Football star Lionel Messi's 21-month prison sentence for tax fraud has been changed to a fine by the Spanish courts. The Barcelona star must pay â¬252,000 ($288,000, Â£223,000), equating to â¬400 for each day of the sentence, the court said in a statement. Messi, along with his father Jorge, was found guilty of defrauding Spain of â¬4.1m between 2007 and 2009. His father's 15-month sentence was replaced with a â¬180,000 fine. The pair had been found guilty of using tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to conceal earnings from image rights. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? Lionel Messi's career in photos Messi statue unveiled in Buenos Aires As well as the suspended jail terms, the Argentina international was fined about â¬2m and his father â¬1.5m. They made a voluntary â¬5m ""corrective payment"", equal to the alleged unpaid tax plus interest, in August 2013. Messi's appeal against the sentence was rejected by Spain's Supreme Court last month, but his father's jail time was reduced because he had paid some of the taxes. The footballer was never expected to serve time in jail as under the Spanish system, prison terms of under two years can be served under probation.

"Caroline Hope became gravely ill after contracting E.coli during cancer treatment in Turkey A Scottish woman who contracted E.coli while undergoing treatment for cancer in a Turkish hospital has returned to Glasgow. Caroline Hope, who is from Clydebank, had been working as an English teacher in the country when she fell ill. A private plane carrying the 37-year-old landed at Glasgow Airport. Her family had feared she would not survive after contracting the bacteria and launched a JustGiving page to raise money for her return to Scotland. That appeal raised more than Â£31,000 to pay for a private medical evacuation. The fundraising appeal was in response to UK government guidelines that strictly limit the repatriation of UK citizens for medical reasons. On arrival at the airport, Caroline Hope was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city. She will eventually be moved to the Beatson cancer treatment centre. Before being diagnosed with stage four colon cancer, Caroline Hope had been teaching English at an international school in Turkey. She had planned to return to Scotland and her employer had taken out medical insurance to cover her stay at the Medical Park Hospital in Izmir until the end of July. Caroline Hope was transferred from the plane to an ambulance at Glasgow Airport However, her recovery was undermined when she became infected with E.coli during an operation to remove a tumour last month. Her mother, Catherine Hope, had been due to fly out to Turkey on Thursday but was told to stay in Scotland after the money needed to bring her daughter home was raised within hours of the appeal being launched. Catherine Hope said: ""She thought she was going to die. She wants home. She said she thought her body was giving up on her. ""But when she got on the plane, my son Scott sent me a picture of her, and she was smiling."" Scott Hope, Caroline's brother, told the BBC that doctors in Turkey had been in contact with doctors at the Beatson cancer treatment centre in Glasgow and that they were expecting his sister to be admitted there once she returned to Scotland. He added that any money raised above and beyond that required to get Ms Hope back home would be donated to the Beatson. Writing on the JustGiving page, Caroline Hope's friend Bella Shek wrote: ""We've smashed our target, unbelievable! ""Thank you, Thank you, Thank you so much. We can now get Caroline home. ""On behalf of Caroline, her family and all her friends, the support from all of you and the general public, many of whom have never met Caroline before, has been truly overwhelming.""

"More than 80,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Italy this year They call themselves Generation Identity. Made up of mainly 20-something tech-savvy members, the Identitarian movement has been described as the hipster right. Fiercely anti-immigration and anti-Muslim, its aim is to stop mass migration to Europe. With headquarters in Austria andFrance,the group may be small in size, but its message is starting to resonate in Italy - a country where sympathy for migrants is wearing thin. As the number of people seeking to reach Europe rises again, Italy continues to be the major point of entry for those arriving illegally on boats - particularly in the south. However, attitudes are hardening and now this new ""alt-right"" movement says it will do whatever it can to protect Italian identity and culture from outsiders. Since the start of 2017, more than 80,000 people have made the journey from Libya, across the Mediterranean, to Italian shores, the vast majority landing in Sicily. Around 2,000 are thought to have died in the attempt, but with almost all other European countries closing their borders, most of the survivors end up staying in Italy. The vast majority are not refugees fleeing war, but are considered economic migrants and mainly come from sub-Saharan Africa and as far as the Indian sub-continent. Aboard the Mediterranean's migrant rescue boats Syrian Journey: Choose your own escape route Alarmingly, there's been a rise in the number of young girls from Nigeria who are forced into prostitution, while boys as young as 16 from Bangladesh are coming via Dubai and Libya looking for work. ""More than 90% of the immigrants coming here by boat are economic refugees,"" claims 20-year-old Viviana Randazzo, a newly-recruited member of the Identitarians, although official Italian statistics put the figure at 85%. Viviana Randazzo says migrants receive preferential treatment ""We Italians are also suffering from poverty. Yet we are not given the same treatment - our needs perhaps count even less than theirs."" Italy is feeling the full burden of these new arrivals and there are now concerns that anti-immigration activists are exploiting the crisis for their own ends, calling for the ""remigration"" of second and third generation immigrants and the closure of mosques. The Identitarians point the finger of blame at aid agencies and NGOs (non-governmental organisations) operating close to the Libyan coastline, accusing them of essentially acting as a taxi service to Europe. ""I think these [migrants] are coming to Europe because they know someone will save them,"" the movement's Italy co-ordinator, Lorenzo Fiato, told me in Catania, on Sicily's eastern coast. ""You can't solve this problem by helping the human traffickers do their jobs, because they want to transport illegal migrants."" Lorenzo Fiato says the Identitarians want to defend Europe against multiculturalism The NGOs say they operate in co-ordination with the Italian coastguard and argue that they are there to save lives. ""[The people smugglers] don't need a 'pull' factor. They are pushing these people out come what may, and if we're not there, they will drown. We're not prepared to let that happen,"" says a defiant and frustrated David Alexander, from the charity Save the Children, talking to me in the western port of Trapani. This summer the Identitarian movement tried to stop a Medecins Sans Frontieres rescue ship from leaving port. The stunt failed but the group has now managed to raise more than â¬70,000 (Â£62,000) in less than three weeks, which it says it will invest in its ""Defend Europe"" campaign. Save the Children says the Vos Hestia has rescued 4,000 migrants since September 2016 Ultimately, this means the group will keep targeting boats run by NGOs trying to rescue the migrants. ""We want to defend Europe against mass immigration and multiculturalism,"" says Mr Fiato. ""We think that in every city where multiculturalism is present, radical Islam and violence is also present. ""This is a different kind of migration. These are thousands of illegal migrants coming to our shores and flooding into our cities,"" he adds. Our World: Sicily Overwhelmedis on the BBC News Channel on Saturday 8 July at 20:30 BST and on Sunday 9 July at 21:30 BST. The programme is broadcast across the weekend at various times onBBC World. Italy has recently threatened to shut its ports to foreign boats full of migrantsunless other European countries do more to help tackle the crisis.A deal has now been reached between France, Germany and Italy,externalto tighten regulations on NGOs and develop a code of conduct. This comes amid two ongoing investigations by the Italian authorities, who are trying to determine whether the NGOs are bringing migrants to Italy according to international maritime laws of saving lives, or whether they are merely assisting illegal migrants on their journey. Ambrogio Cartosio, the chief prosecutor in Trapani, said he felt that the NGOs were somehow encouraging the people smuggling trade. ""It pushes the traffickers to load the migrants on ever more precarious vessels. They can be sure that after a few miles, they will be picked up by the ships,"" he told me. The buying and selling of people is big business and the human trafficking trade continues to become more sophisticated and organised. It is estimated that this year a quarter of a million migrants will make the perilous journey from Libya to Italy, after the escalation in numbers which typically happens over the summer months. It's been described as Europe's graveyard but it's also now the only route available to them. David Alexander says people would drown if aid agencies did not get involved ""I think what is clear is that people will continue to do this, unless and until there is a safer, legal way to do it,"" says Mr Alexander. ""In the meantime, this tragedy will go on unfolding, and we will continue to pick up the pieces, and we will continue to get the blame for something that other people can solve."" While the crisis continues, so will criticism of the humanitarian effort. As will the message of intolerance. And a solution? No end in sight.

"Relatives of those who died in the Grenfell Tower tragedy are angry at the time it's taking to recover and name victims. But police and forensic science experts say the process of identifying severely fire-damaged remains is a highly complicated one - and it will take some time before families can know the fate of their loved ones. On Tuesday night, tempers flared in a closed-door meeting as survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster demanded to know why the police and coroner weren't able to give out more details about those still missing. So far, 21 people have been formally identified as having died in the fire and their families informed. But police believe at least 80 were killed. Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy has said there have been a total of 87 ""recoveries"" but, due to ""catastrophic damage"" inside the building, that did not mean 87 people. Some residents suspect the figure could be even higher, and the slow pace of progress has fuelled fears of a cover-up. The distress and frustration felt by survivors as a result of the delay is understandable, especially given that police have said the final death toll will not be known until the end of the year. But experts in the specialised field of victim identification say this fire is a particularly challenging disaster and, that despite fears that the job is not being done properly, the UK has one of the best identification systems in the world. Police, firefighters and forensic science teams outside Grenfell Tower ""We need to make sure by scientific means,"" says the UK's Disaster Victim Identification Co-ordinator, Det Supt Alan Crawford. ""That's why it takes longer to get identification, but then and only then, when we are 100% certain, do we tell the family."" Scotland Yard says all ""visible human remains"" have now been removed from the building. Specially trained officers and forensic anthropologists will continue to sift through more than 15 tonnes of debris on each floor by hand in the hope of finding other human material. Disaster victim identification (DVI) is a police discipline that has developed out of lessons learnt from dealing with incidents of mass casualties around the world. Every airplane crash, terrorist bombing and natural disaster adds to the collective sum of knowledge around issues - such as where to locate a temporary mortuary, how to collect and categorise fragmented remains and what the most accurate method is to identify them. The practice is regulated internationally according to Interpol standards, adhered to by 197 countries. In the UK, a pivotal moment in disaster victim identification came after the 1989 Marchioness boat tragedy in the Thames, in which 51 people died. Eleven years after the Marchioness sank, a public inquiry was ordered to look into the work of the coroner after relatives complained they were kept in the dark, prevented from seeing bodies and that the hands of some victims had been removed unnecessarily for fingerprinting. Victims' families complained they were kept in the dark after the Marchioness disaster ""The inquiry made a number of recommendations, principles we hold true now,"" says Det Supt Crawford. ""Avoid misidentification at all costs, treat the deceased with respect and dignity, be open and honest with families at all times and give as much information as we can."" In the UK, there are now around 2,000 police officers throughout the country who have volunteered for specialist DVI training in addition to their normal duties. They can be called on at any moment. ""We're up there in relation to being one of the best in the world at what we do,"" says Det Supt Crawford. ""We lead a lot of countries and they seek our advice."" When a disaster like Grenfell Tower happens, there are two distinct strands to the process of identifying victims. One is gathering as much information as possible about potential victims from relatives, and friends, including collecting medical and dental records. On the morning of the Grenfell Tower fire, the number for a Casualty Bureau phone line was given out the media. Members of the public who called in were asked a number of specially scripted questions designed to prioritise those with information about potential victims. Those deemed likely to know someone caught up in the fire were allocated a family liaison officer who logged details about the missing person onto an official Interpol form. The other strand of identification involves collecting information from the bodies themselves. This work is led by a senior identification manager (SIM), who appoints a scene evidence recovery manager, or SERM, who in turn oversees the work of DVI-trained body recovery teams. These teams log every detail before moving them to a designated mortuary. ""At that time, we don't know who we are recovering so it's really important we recover the body or human remains in a dignified manner,"" says Det Supt Crawford. ""We need to make sure it's photographed, there's a continuity of evidence, there's a forensic preservation and all the way through that process from body recover to being lodged at the mortuary is done to a judicial standard."" When bodies are brought into the mortuary, experts try to identify them according to standards set by Interpol. This means identification must be made using dental records, fingerprints or DNA. Medical implants that carry serial numbers such as pacemakers or hip replacements can be used as secondary identifiers, as can scars, marks and tattoos. Visual identification by relatives is not used because this  is regarded as unreliable. Nor is the discovery of property on a body, such as bag or purse. Det Supt Crawford cites a 2006 case in the US where five college students were killed in a minibus crash. One family was told their daughter had died, after her body was identified from the bag she was found with. In fact, she had survived and was heavily bandaged in intensive care being watched over by another family whose daughter had been killed in the crash. It was several weeks before the mistake was discovered. Why is it taking so long to rehouse the Grenfell survivors? Will a public inquiry deliver answers? A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower In the case of Grenfell Tower, there are several factors complicating this identification process. The first is that the fire is what's referred to as an ""open"" disaster.  A ""closed"" disaster is a situation such as a plane crash, in which a manifest exists of all the passengers and crew. In such a case, identification is a relatively straightforward case of matching the dental records of those on board with the victims. Open disasters are more difficult. Here, investigators might have an idea of who was present, but do not know conclusively, making it hard to collect references for DNA, fingerprints or dental records. Although the police have a list of those missing and presumed dead from the fire, they still have no information on the inhabitants of 23 out of the 129 flats in the building. The Metropolitan Police says it is working with the Red Cross and community groups to spread their message of an amnesty for illegal immigrants, as well as those illegally sub-letting, so more potential victims can be identified. The intensity of the fire also poses an immense challenge to forensic experts. The Westminster coroner, Dr Fiona Wilcox, is reported to have described the scene inside the burnt-out tower block as ""apocalyptic"". Dr Denise Syndercombe-Court is a forensic scientist at Kings College London who works with the Metropolitan Police. She says experts will have to rely on new, sensitive techniques to analyse the remains. It's a slow and painstaking procedure. ""In some cases, these bodies are so badly damaged by the heat - terrific heat temperatures - we literally will have fragments of bones,"" she says. ""We'll work on providing strategies for what material is suitable for what analysis technique."" Knowing where the remains have been found is a key part of solving the identification puzzle. That is why it is so important for the DVI-trained body teams to log every detail before the body is moved. ""There's no point analysing material if you have no idea where it came from,"" says Dr Syndercombe-Court. When the World Trade Center towers collapsed on 9/11, human remains were fragmented and mingled in among the debris of the buildings. As a result, 40% of the victims have still not been identified. If DNA can be extracted, it then needs to be matched with that of potential victims. Here again, the ferocity of the fire poses additional challenges as surrogate samples of DNA, such as from personal items or toothbrushes, will have also been destroyed. Because many of the victims were immigrants, investigators may need to work with police forces in other countries to collect DNA from at least two family members - all of which takes time. The process can also take a huge emotional toll on those carrying it out. Forensic scientist Prof Peter Vanezis is a veteran of identification investigations, including working on mass graves in the Balkans. ""There were some people who weren't very keen on being counselled,"" he says of his time in Kosovo. ""They were the ones who were really affected because they thought they were being very macho by not worrying about these things, but they do get to you."" Det Supt Crawford says that officers who volunteer for DVI-duties are monitored and offered counselling because of the traumatic nature of the work. It's only when the coroner is satisfied that the information provided about the missing person from relatives, dental and medical records matches that taken from the remains that a formal identification can be made. This can be an extremely slow process. ""There might be an awareness of how long it takes if one sits down and thinks about it in the cool light of day,"" says Prof Peter Vanezis, who was part of the team who identified the final Kings Cross fire victim, 20 years after the disaster. ""But when you're dealing with relatives who are bereaved or waiting to find out what happened, frustration comes along very quickly.""

"Wimbledon's seeding system for the men's singles has made an unusually big difference this year, as you can see from the lists above of the ATP rankings a week before the tournament and the Wimbledon rankings. Wimbledon uses a system that favours grass-court specialists - taking the ATP ranking points, doubling the points earned at grass tournaments in the past year and adding on 75% of the points earned on grass the previous year. The other grand slams just use the ATP rankings. There are usually only two or three changes in the top eight seeds each year. Over the last five years you could classify three of the changes to the top eight seeds as being ""good"" in that they make the seeding a better predictor of the outcome, and four of them as ""bad"" because they make it a worse predictor. The highest profile example came in 2014, when Novak Djokevic was made number one seed at Wimbledon, despite being number two on the ATP rankings. He won the tournament while Rafa Nadal, who was demoted to the number two slot, was knocked out in the fourth round. On the other hand, in 2012 Tomas Berdych was promoted above David Ferrer in the seedings and was knocked out in the first round, while David Ferrer reached the quarter-finals. The difference has been marginal overall, but it also must be taken into account that changing seedings is partly a self-fulfilling policy, because a higher-seeded player is likely to get further in the tournament as a result of playing lower-ranked players. Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon as top seed in 2014 when he was number two in the ATP rankings Looking at how much difference the Wimbledon seeding system makes got the Reality Check team wondering about whether it had been a better predictor than seedings at other grand slams. To compare the seedings with the outcomes for the top eight seeds in grand slams from 2012 to 2016, we allocated a numerical value for the stage at which a player was knocked out. For example, a player knocked out in the semi-finals gets a value of 3.5, because he could have come either third or fourth. Similarly, someone knocked out in the first round would get a value of 96.5. If the seeding system was perfect then adding up the outcomes for the top eight seeds in a single year would give a total of 36 (one + two + 3.5 + 3.5 + four lots of 6.5). In fact, the average number you get for the last five years at Wimbledon is 146. And actually, you also get 146 if you do the calculation with the ATP rankings instead of the Wimbledon seedings. But that is considerably higher than the figures of 106 at the US Open, 93 at the French Open and 89 at the Australian Open. It should be said that all of these numbers are pretty high. There is not a strong correlation between seeding and outcome. Nonetheless, it is much worse an indicator at Wimbledon, suggesting that Wimbledon has been a less predictable tournament over the past five years than the other grand slams.

"As he visits troops bolstering Nato's eastern border in Estonia in response to rising tensions with Russia, General Sir Nick Carter - the British army's top soldier - explains how the armed forces need to win support for their changing mission. Public support in Britain for the Army has been consistently strong. But General Carter says there are risks here as well as benefits. ""That public support,"" he says, ""is very much based upon sympathy and not necessarily upon empathy. ""And I think if we wish to sustain our numbers, and indeed the sort of attitude you would want your army to have, I think it's important that the cursor swings more towards empathy than sympathy, so that people understand more about what an army does and why you need an army, and therefore what its final task might be."" Of course the Army is about much more than that final task - ""closing with and engaging the enemy"". But the unpopularity of some of Britain's recent wars, the lack of understanding about military matters among much of the public, and the increasing sensitivity to casualties, have all meant that the term ""boots on the ground"" - putting soldiers into harm's way - has become almost toxic. General Carter has some sympathy with this view. ""I think the term 'boots on the ground' has become difficult for people to comprehend. ""The trick of course is for boots on the ground to be applied in a way that is not necessarily risk-free, but is done for appropriate gain and benefit."" This issue of the relationship between Britain and her army is a central aspect of General Carter's thinking. He is speaking at an Estonian army base in Tapa, a garrison town a little under 100 miles from the Russian border. The general is visiting the British-led multi-national battle group, which is there as part of a Nato deployment to reassure the Estonians and to demonstrate the alliance's cohesion to Moscow. British soldiers took part in a ceremony welcoming the Nato battalion to Estonia earlier this year ""Young people join an army to be used and that is important to us,"" he says. ""So the opportunity to do something like we are doing up here in Estonia is important. ""But we also need to be prepared to be used in other ways as well, providing we can be used in an effective fashion."" For the British army, this is a period of unprecedented change as it transitions away from a dominant focus on counter-insurgency operations in the heat of Iraq and Afghanistan, and re-builds its capability to fight modern high-intensity combat - the sort of conflict it trained for day-in and day-out during the Cold War years. The strategic picture is also changing dramatically. The potential threats are becoming more complex, the dividing line between peace and war ever less clear. Some people argue that the modern, Western way of war is at arm's-length - exemplified by armed drones and stand-off weapons fired at great distances from their intended targets. By such readings the traditional army - leaving aside maybe the special forces - seems strangely out of step with the apparent new reality. But General Carter disagrees. ""I don't subscribe to the view that we find ourselves in a new era of warfare where you can do it all with stand-off; you can do it all with bombing; you can do it all with special forces and you can do it all with proxies,"" he tells me emphatically. ""Those are all simply fallacies. The bottom line in all of this is that, in the final analysis, people live on land and it is ultimately the land component that has to 'mix it' where people live. History proves that that is a requirement. ""Our policy makers absolutely understand that you have an army because, in the final analysis, armies are the business when it comes to a decision, and ultimately it's about a decision."" Britain's army is of course an awful lot smaller than it once was. How big should it be in part depends upon what the country can afford. So does General Carter think that he has enough soldiers? ""The straightforward answer to that question is that given the tasks that we have currently got, we have adequate numbers,"" he says. ""If the tasks change or the tasks increase then we might have to ask questions about it."" On equipment he is confident that the Army will get things that it needs, though ""how quickly it arrives is always a question"". But the Army itself is going to change even more dramatically in the years ahead. And this too is something that General Carter is pushing forward. Traditionally the Army - like most others - is what he terms ""bottom-fed"". In other words, ""it recruits people who are youngsters and we grow them through a career"". Military personnel paraded on National Armed Forces Day But he believes that as the Army requires and takes on more specialists, it is going to have to offer a very different career structure. ""I suspect,"" he says, ""that maybe as much as 30% of the army may be specialists in the future - and how we supply those specialist career schemes is something we have to think about."" This could mean a lot more of what the Army calls ""lateral entry"" (ie joining at a much later age, probably from an established career) or indeed sharing people with industry. Nonetheless, at least in his lifetime, General Carter does not expect the combat arms of the Army ""to look particularly different"" to the way they do today. ""I think we will still deliver that effect through a bottom-fed delivery system in the way that we understand it."" But he says specialists will need to be recruited differently and that will have significant implications requiring a review of ranks, career structures, working practices and so on. General Carter thinks that the Army is about a year or two away from taking on regular personnel by this lateral entry method. But the core business of the Army is not going to change. While its roles go way beyond just training for high-intensity combat, as here in Estonia, it remains part of the nation's insurance policy. So being so close to the Russian border, what security challenge does the general worry about most? ""Probably the greatest risk at the moment,"" he says, ""is the risk of miscalculation. ""Understanding your potential opponents,"" he says, ""and having the communications systems in place and the processes in place so that you realise what messages you are sending is fundamental. ""Miscalculation is the thing that we probably need to watch.""

"Melissa Kentner and Barbara Kentner (right) The death of an indigenous woman in Thunder Bay is the latest in a series of violent incidents affecting the local indigenous community. As the police ponder whether to charge her assailant with murder, many are wondering if the force has what it takes to pursue justice for all. Barbara Kentner, an Anishinaabe woman, was walking down the street with her sister in January when she was struck by a trailer hitch someone had thrown at her out of the window of a car. ""Oh, I got one,"" her sister, Melissa Kentner, heard someone say. The hitch struck Barbara in the abdomen and she was taken to hospital. Shortly after, Thunder Bay police charged Brayden Bushby, 18, with aggravated assault. Over the next five months, Kentner lay in hospital, suffering from internal injuries and damage to her organs. She died on 4 July at the age of 34. Now her family and the indigenous community want to see Bushby's charges upgraded, and the driver and other passengers in the car charged as well. Thunder Bay, Ontario ""I want them to be in jail and feel the same kind of pain I've been feeling,"" she says. But a number of external reviews of the Thunder Bay Police Service, as well as decades of racially-motivated violence, have left many with considerable doubt. ""At this point in time, we don't have the faith in the Thunder Bay police to be able to conduct a proper investigation and a fair investigation,"" says Anna Betty Achneepineskum, the Nishnawbe Aski Nation Deputy Grand Chief. Attacks like the one that killed Kentner are all too commonplace in Thunder Bay, says her childhood friend Deanne Hupfield. The city of about 100,000 is one of the last urban outposts on the way to Ontario's vast north, which is mostly inhabited by indigenous people on reserves. In 2011, 10% of the city's population had Aboriginal identity, compared to about 4% across the country. Hupfield says throwing things at indigenous women ""is a normal thing here"". ""It happened to me growing up. It happened to my mom, my sisters and my friends."" She says people would yell racial and sexual epithets and chuck beer cans, water bottles or trash at them. Canada's Red River Women Public hearings begin into Canada's missing and murdered indigenous women Canada has 4,000 missing and murdered indigenous women One time, a man threw a crowbar at her sister in front of an undercover police officer. Deanne Hupfield was a childhood friend of Kentner's. The officer chased the assailant down, yelled at him and then returned, without taking the man into custody. The officer told her and her sister: ""Don't worry, we scared them"", she says. When Hupfield was a teenager, she watched in horror as a group of cops beat up her cousin after the two of them had been arrested for joyriding. Now an arts educator living in Toronto, Hupfield wants Thunder Bay police to address systemic racism in the force. ""They're not willing to take that hard look at themselves and acknowledge their own beliefs about us,"" she says. Both Kentner's sister and Hupfield believe the attack on Barbara Kentner was racially motivated, and hope it is prosecuted as a hate crime. But her death is not the first to strike the community. In May, the bodies of teenagers Josiah Begg and Tammy Keeash were both found in local waterways. In 2015, Stacey DeBungee, 41, was found dead in the McIntyre River. And between 2000 and 2011, seven indigenous students died after moving to the city to attend high school. None of these deaths led to criminal charges; many were ruled accidental by police after brief investigations. Searching for an indigenous-driven approach to suicide These 10 deaths are now the subject of a systemic review by Ontario's police oversight board, and its ""ongoing concern"" about how Thunder Bay police investigate the deaths of indigenous people. The review was prompted by a 2016 coroner's inquest into the deaths of the seven students, which found that the cause of four out of the seven deaths was ""undetermined"". 14-year-old Josiah Begg was found dead after disappearing while visiting Thunder Bay with his father. Ontario's chief coroner, Dr Dirk Huyer, has also asked for assistance from an outside police force, the York Regional Police, in the ongoing investigation into the deaths of Begg and Keeash. ""When I looked at the investigations, I felt that there would be a benefit from some additional resources, another set of eyes, external perspective, to work together with the Thunder Bay police to really give us the best opportunity to give those answers,"" Dr Huyer says. Chris Adams, a spokesperson for the Thunder Bay Police Service, says they welcome working with York police. ""We certainly supported it and we still do,"" he told the BBC. ""It's really in the interest of finding answers."" Adams says the police is working on improving community relations, looking to a number of other communities to understand how they can improve their police force, including more efforts to recruit indigenous officers. ""We really recognise the need to have some reconciliation in that regard,"" he says. Adams adds the force is working with Fort William First Nation to better understand some of the issues at play, and would welcome working with the Nishnawbe Aski Nation as well. Meanwhile, Kentner's family is eagerly awaiting the result of the coroner's post-mortem. Police say they will wait for the results before deciding on whether they will upgrade the charges. Barbara Kentner (right) with her cousin Debbie Kakagamic Doctors told Melissa Kentner her sister died of liver failure exacerbated by the internal injuries she suffered during the attack, which included a ruptured intestine. ""Yeah, sure, she had problems with her liver,"" Ms Kentner says. ""But she quit drinking and everything. She wanted to have that transplant."" She's sickened by comments on social media that disparage her sister's memory, saying Barbara was a ""caring and loving person"". In her last weeks alive, Kentner knew she was going to die but hoped for justice, her sister says. ""She just wished that it never happened to anybody else.""

"University tuition fees in England have become a political battleground - with renewed calls that they should be scrapped. When they were increased a few years ago to Â£9,000 they became a literal battleground, with activists clashing with police on the streets around Westminster. Now they are going to rise again. But what has the impact of higher fees been? Have they cut student numbers? And are they worth the money? Students in England leave university with higher debts than almost anywhere else in the developed world,the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week. Charging Â£9,250 a year for an undergraduate degree makes England a real outlier by international standards. It's even an outlier in the UK, where Scotland has no fees for Scottish students, and fees in Wales and Northern Ireland are much lower. Much of Europe still sticks with low fees or no fees - and Germany, which used to charge fees, has scrapped them. There are also lower costs in many European countries where many more students live at home. The only country with comparable fees is the United States. But the US is not a straightforward comparison because courses are four years rather than three and any ""average"" covers a hugely diverse market. Top private colleges can charge more than Â£30,000 per year while state colleges can charge local students less than fees in England. Tuition fees have been abolished in German universities The University of Washington has lower annual fees than the University of Wolverhampton and until the pound's value slipped, fees would have been cheaper at UCLA in California than UCLAN in Preston. In New York state, with a population bigger than many European countries, fees are being scrapped for families earning less than about Â£100,000. But there is another very important aspect to all this - England's system requires no money up front and repayment depends on earning at least Â£21,000. Not in the long term. Student numbers have increased relentlessly, regardless of funding changes, fees and economic ups and downs. It represents a huge aspirational demand for higher education. It's easy to forget what a massive change this represents. In 1980, there were only 68,000 people starting university - this autumn there will be more than 500,000. Twice as many people are now getting a degree as were getting five O-levels in the early 1980s. Applications have dipped only three times - on each occasion when fees were introduced or increased - but they have always recovered. And one of the main arguments in favour of fees has been that such wide access is unsustainable unless students make a contribution to the cost. In the early 1980s only about one in six young people could expect to go to university - now, for girls at least, it's over half. Students from all backgrounds are more likely to go to university than ever before - including the poorest. There are different ways of identifying disadvantaged students - either living in areas where few people go to university, having been eligible for free meals at school or under measures of multiple deprivation. And they all show the same pattern - more of these youngsters are going to university, with the numbers rising through the years of fee increases. But there is another important dimension to this. Poorer youngsters are still much less likely to go to university than their better-off classmates. There is a brutal economic symmetry to this. Each upward notch in affluence is linked to a higher entry rate into university. There are also significant cross-currents of gender and geography.Women are 35% more likely to go to university than men, and youngsters in London are more likely to go to university than anywhere else in the UK. There are ethnic differences too, withpoor white men, in places such as north-east England, the least likely to get university places. A tuition fees protest, London 2015 Fees are going up to Â£9,250 and interest rates on loans are rising to 6.1%, which will push up average student debt on graduation to more than Â£50,000, including maintenance loans. The clock on interest charges starts ticking as soon as students begin their course - and it means that they will have run up Â£5,800 in interest charges before they have even left university. A high-earning graduate could pay back Â£40,000 in interest charges, on top of repaying the amount they have borrowed. These figures could go even higher. Interest rates are linked to inflation and if that begins to rise, then so will the amount charged for repayments. The rapid increase in tuition fees - trebling in 2006 and then trebling again in 2012 - means that the amount of outstanding debt has soared. The figures from the Student Loans Company show the debt level has almost doubled in four years and will continue to climb if fee levels and interest rates rise further. But about three-quarters of students will not repay their debts in full before the 30-year limit when the loans are written off. The government wants tosell off student debt to private investorsand has begun looking for a buyer for pre-2012 loans. If this is achieved it will mean another big step away from the idea of universities receiving direct public funding. At most universities, no matter what course you are following, the level of fee is likely to be the same flat rate of Â£9,000 (soon to be Â£9,250). But the cost of delivering costs is going to vary widely. Science courses need more expensive equipment and courses such as medicine are going to get much more teaching time and personal instruction. As the chart shows, subjects such as history will have significantly fewer classroom hours. But there is no recognition of this in the fees system. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, raising fees to Â£9,000 brought universities 25% more funding per student. But for arts and humanities, they made an extra 47% on each student. Students say university value for money is falling Students face sharp rise in interest rates Student loan debt up for private sale A lack of teaching hours - and a lack of information about how tuition fees are spent - are among the factors that have seen a plunging level of students thinking they're getting value for money. The chart shows an annual tracking of student attitudes, which in recent years has seen asteady fall in satisfied customersand a rising level of discontent. Five years ago, 53% of students across the UK thought university was ""good"" or ""very good"" value - but this has now slumped to its lowest level of 35%. Students getting more hours and with expectations of high future earnings, such as medicine, were most likely to think they were getting good value for money. Least convinced about the value were business and social studies students. The Higher Education Policy Institute, which carried out the survey, says the quality of teaching is a key factor in perceptions of value. Everyone has heard a story about someone getting a degree and then ending up in a job that didn't need such qualifications. And there are stories of millionaires who never bothered with college. But all the evidence suggests a relentless link between level of qualifications and future earnings. As the chart shows, that is the case at every level of education. According to the OECD, there is no sign that the increase in graduates will take away the financial advantage. Having a degree means better pay and a lower likelihood of being unemployed. And the stories about maverick billionaires who never went to college are the exception rather than the rule, as an analysis of billionaires' education showed that they are usually highly educated andmore likely to have two degrees than no degree. The question of ""value"" from a degree isn't just about a monetary return. There's a much wider social and cultural dimension. But even in narrow financial terms, the relationship between the cost of fees and earnings is not straightforward. For example, there are big differences in the future average earnings between people who studied for medicine and those who took media degrees, even though the annual fee might have been the same. Medical students pay the same as arts students although their projected earnings are often far higher Degrees from top-ranking universities can also convert into greater earning power and class of degree is another factor. And any calculation of financial return on fees will be a combination of factors - what you studied, where you studied and the current demand in the jobs market. The political attention over tuition fees has focused on the impact on young people taking undergraduate, full-time degrees. But the biggest change, often overlooked, has been the collapse in part-time students. These were often adults with other responsibilities who were more sensitive to increased costs. And the recession saw a big reduction in firms willing to pay for their staff to take qualifications. There have been repeated warnings from industry about a skills gap, but there are few signs of any recovery in part-time student numbers. 10 charts that show what's gone wrong with social care 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble 10 charts demonstrating the impact of the smoking ban Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Data research by Eleanor Lawrie and Catherine Bean At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Military commanders say they are close to declaring a complete victory So-called Islamic State (IS) defences in the Iraqi city of Mosul are collapsing fast and troops expect to take full control in the next few hours, state television has announced. Only a few metres remain to be taken, a correspondent said. Some Iraqi security forces have been seen dancing in the streets even though commanders have not confirmed the news. Iraqi forces, backed by US-led air strikes, have tried to retake the key city since17 October last year. WATCH: Mosul from above in 360 video Battle for Mosul: The story so far The Iraqi towns still under IS control Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, supported by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, have been involved in the battle to retake Mosul. Police have started celebrating in the streets of Mosul The government announced the full ""liberation"" of eastern Mosul in January, but the west of the city has presented a more difficult challenge, with its narrow, winding streets. Russia 'may have killed IS head Baghdadi' Why IS militants destroy ancient sites The UN has warned that IS may be holding more than 100,000 people in the city as human shields. Last October, the Iraqi army said there were 6,000 militants in the city. Fewer than 300 were thought to be holding out. Some 900,000 people have been displaced from the city since 2014 - about half the the pre-war population- aid organisations say. Last month, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the destruction of the ancient mosque in the city of Mosul was ""an official declaration of defeat"" by IS.

"Nasa later reassured Mr Pence that it was ""OK to touch the surface"" US Vice-President Mike Pence has made a tongue-in-cheek apology to Nasa after a photo of him touching a piece of space flight equipment went viral. Mr Pence was visiting the Kennedy Space Center in Florida when he placed his hand on a piece of hardware - despite a large sign that read ""do not touch"". He later apologised to Nasa on Twitter, joking that Florida Senator Marco Rubio ""dared"" him to do it. Nasa has assured Mr Pence the equipment was in need of a clean anyway. The vice-president, who addressed Nasa staff at Cape Canaveral on Thursday, sparked a social media storm after a photo emerged of him touching a cover for the Orion spacecraft, which was labelled as a piece of ""critical space flight hardware"". On Friday, Mr Pence apologised to the space agency - while pointing the finger at his colleague. Nasa replied that it was OK, and saidin a statement,externalthat ""procedures require the hardware to be cleaned before tiles are bonded to the spacecraft, so touching the surface is absolutely okay."" If the hardware was not OK to touch, it ""would have had a protective cover over it"", Nasa added. Mr Pence later posted a further tweet mocking the incident, replacing the Nasa hardware in the photo with a porcupine. The original photo had gone viral within hours - with some social media users criticising Mr Pence for ignoring the sign. ""Good to know our vice president has the self control of a sugar-charged third grader on a field trip,"" wrote Twitter user @KentoTFH. Others said those criticising Mr Pence were taking the matter far too seriously, and injected a little humour into their tweets. ""After six months at Trump's side, Mike Pence quietly envies the capsule for its journey to the cold, tranquil emptiness of space,"" wrote @KevinMKruse. Twitter user @Michael_Bell_, in reference to the administration'sprevious viral photoinvolving US President Donald Trump on a visit to Saudi Arabia, said: ""Now, on to the orb of destiny!"" A photo of Mr Trump and his Saudi and Egyptian counterparts around a glowing orb had also sparked online jokes Is Pence distancing himself from Trump?

"Handcuffing must be recorded as a use of force Police officers in England and Wales have criticised a new 10-page form they have to fill out every time they use any kind of force against someone. Since April this year officers have had to record a series of details every time they use handcuffs, CS spray or draw a baton. One Police Federation official said the new process was ""very bureaucratic"". But the Home Office defended the form, saying it would help bring about ""unprecedented transparency"". The new rules wereannounced in March,externalby Mrs May's successor as Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, with the aim of ensuring that police record every encounter involving force. Some in the police say the form could help to counter ""accusations"" that officers use excessive force. Simon Kempton, operational lead on policing for the Police Federation, said: ""We will now be able to argue, with solid evidence, that in comparison to the huge numbers of incidents we attend, we rarely have to resort to using force."" He said the data would demonstrate that police ""always try to use the lowest level of force available to us"". Ms Rudd said that ""when police take the difficult decision to deploy force, it is also vital that the people they serve can scrutinise it. ""These new rules will introduce unprecedented transparency to this important subject and reinforce the proud British model of policing by consent."" But John Apter, chairman of the Hampshire Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said filling out the 10-page form had proved to be like ""writing an exam essay"". Mr Apter said he understood the need to capture data about the use of force, but thought the process was too complex and took too long, especially at a time when police were already over-stretched. It is ""over-engineered"", he said. ""I know officers who haven't got the time to fill in the form,"" he said, adding that in some city forces, such as London's Metropolitan Police, officers might have to fill in six forms on each shift. He believes a better approach would be to scan officers' pocketbooks and use samples of these to provide and analyse data. Jan Berry, a former Police Federation chairman who worked with the Home Office to cut red tape, said there was ""absolutely no reason"" to introduce the form. ""I sort of despair, and think have we gone backwards?"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, describing the process as ""the wrong way"". Ms Berry, who produced a report on reducing bureaucracy for the Conservative-led coalition in 2010, said the information on the form was already being collected by custody officers. ""That information is being captured anyway, certainly if they've arrested a person or used handcuffs,"" she said. Officers must mark a diagram to indicate where on the body force was used Police forces will begin publishing data from the forms over the next couple of weeks. The rules require a ""use of force monitoring form"", administered by the National Police Chiefs' Council, to be completed ""as soon as practicable"" after any incident involving force. A separate form must be completed for each person on whom force is used and officers are expected to complete forms for their own constabulary, even if the incident took place in another police force's area. The forms require full details of the incident, including location, whether officers were themselves threatened or assaulted and what sort of force they used. Officers are expected to mark a diagram showing what areas of the person's body the force was used on, whether the person was injured and whether medical assistance was offered or provided. Previously each force was required to provide details of the use of Tasers and firearms, but the new rules also ask for details of the use of batons, spit-guards, dogs, shields, handcuffs and unarmed restraint, as well as irritant sprays such as CS. Speaking in May 2011,,externalduring her six years as Home Secretary, Mrs May promised that her policies would ""do away with the bureaucratic accountability of the past. So we will free the police to do their job"". ""I have said loud and clear that the days of the bureaucrats controlling and managing the police from Whitehall are over. ""The Home Office will no longer scrutinise and supervise police performance and come up endlessly with new schemes and initiatives."" A Home Office spokeswoman said the changes were ""police-led"". ""Our police reforms have overhauled the previous cumbersome regime of top-down targets and unnecessary bureaucracy,"" the spokeswoman said. ""But when officers take the difficult decision to deploy force it is vital that they can be scrutinised by the people they serve. ""These rules changes, which are police-led, bring unprecedented transparency and reinforce the proud British model of policing by consent.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Trade will be a very big factor between our two countries"" US President Donald Trump has said he expects a ""powerful"" trade deal with the UK to be completed ""very quickly"". Speaking at the G20 summit in Hamburg, he said he would visit London. Asked when, he said: ""We'll work that out."" In one-to-one talks, Mr Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May agreed to prioritise work on a post-Brexit trade deal, a UK government official said. Mrs May said she was ""optimistic"" about a deal, but warned there was ""a limit"" to what could be done before Brexit. She told a news conference that world leaders - including those from China, India and Japan, as well as the US - had expressed a ""strong desire"" to forge ""ambitious new bilateral trading relationships"" with Britain. The prime minister hailed it as a ""powerful vote of confidence"" in Britain. Asked about Mr Trump's visit the UK, Mrs May said: ""We don't have a date yet, we are still working on a date."" This video can not be played Theresa May was asked about Donald Trump's proposed visit to the UK Earlier, during a 50-minute meeting with Mr Trump - which overran by 20 minutes - the two leaders spent a ""significant"" amount of time on trade, in a discussion described as entirely ""positive"", Downing Street said. Before their meeting, Mr Trump hailed the ""very special relationship"" he had developed with Mrs May. ""There is no country that could possibly be closer than our countries,"" he told reporters. ""We have been working on a trade deal which will be a very, very big deal, a very powerful deal, great for both countries and I think we will have that done very, very quickly."" Ivanka Trump takes father's seat at G20 Climate change holds up G20 progress Trump and Putin meet face to face Under EU rules, formal talks between London and Washington cannot begin until after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, without EU agreement. Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador to Washington, said Mr Trump's statement of intent was a ""very good sign for the future"" and would be ""useful"" to Mrs May. However, Sir Simon Fraser, a former diplomat who served as a permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, cast doubt on how soon any trade deal could be reached. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Donald Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Theresa May seem to be enjoying another photo shoot ""The point is we can't negotiate with them or anyone else until we've left the European Union,"" he said. ""And the Americans and others will not negotiate with us until they know what our relationship with the EU is going to be, because the access we have in Europe is hugely important for the advantages that they can get from their relations with us."" Mr Trump has previously accepted an invitation for a state visit to the UK - a prospect that has caused controversy - although no date has been given. Mr Meyer said his visit would be a ""very important moment"" to nail down Mr Trump's commitment to a strong bilateral agreement. By Rob Young, BBC business correspondent Under EU rules, formal talks between London and Washington cannot begin until March 2019, unless Brussels agrees the UK can make a start earlier. Trade talks tend to be complex and technical, lasting several years. The EU and Japan took four years to reach an agreement in principle. But those discussions involved 29 nations; UK-US talks would involve just two. With strong political will and determination, a transatlantic agreement could perhaps be completed more speedily than has been the norm for trade pacts. Talks would cover cutting customs duties, making products such as cars and food cheaper. The average UK-US tariff is relatively low anyway, at 3%, and huge amounts of trade already take place. Negotiations usually cover thornier topics, such as food safety and environmental standards. If one side agreed to accept the other's rules, a deal could be done quickly. But that would be controversial in various sectors. That's when negotiations can begin to drag. Mrs May later said she was ""dismayed"" Mr Trump had withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change. The accord, signed in Paris in 2015, is an international agreement on how to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. Mrs May said she raised the issue during one of ""a number"" of conversations she had with Mr Trump at the summit - not during the official bilateral talks. The prime minister said she had ""urged President Trump to rejoin"", adding: ""I continue to hope that is exactly what the United States will do."" Clashes erupt at Germany G20 protest Brexit reduces UK's global clout - Hague Mrs May also held a 20-minute meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a 25-minute meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. Talks with Mr Abe focused on trade and North Korea's nuclear missile programme. Japan's new trade deal with the EU, signed off on Thursday, ""could form the basis"" of an agreement between London and Tokyo following Brexit, Mrs May told her fellow leader. Meanwhile, Mr Modi told Mrs May he wanted to see economic links with the UK deepen now and after Brexit, according to a UK government official. Shinzo Abe and Theresa May discussed trade and North Korea's nuclear missile programme After a meeting on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China and the UK were in a ""golden era"" of relations and increased investment from his country since the Brexit vote showed its confidence in Britain. The G20 summit is the first gathering of world leaders since the UK's general election last month, during which Mrs May's Conservative party lost seats and her performance was widely criticised. The two-day meeting is being held against a backdrop of violent protests on the streets of Hamburg, with demonstrators and heavily-armed police clashing into the early hours of Saturday. The protests centre mainly on the presence of Mr Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, climate change and global wealth inequalities.
