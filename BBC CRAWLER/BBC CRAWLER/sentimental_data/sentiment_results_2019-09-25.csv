"This video can not be played How one man gave birth to his own baby A transgender man, who has given birth to a child and does not want to be described as ""mother"" on a birth certificate, has lost a legal battle. Freddy McConnell wanted to be registered as ""father"" or ""parent"". But a High Court judge ruled the status of ""mother"" was afforded to a person who carries and gives birth to a baby. He said while Mr McConnell's gender was recognised by law as male, his parental status of ""mother"" derives from the biological role of giving birth. Mr McConnell, a journalist at the Guardian, has told the BBC he plans to appeal against the ruling. During the trial in London, the High Court heard how Mr McConnell was a single parent, who was born a woman but now lived as a man following surgery. He was biologically able to get pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy last year, but had legally become a man by the time of the birth. Mr McConnell's journey to parenthood was documented in a film called Seahorse and included his thoughts and footage of him going through fertility treatment, conception and the birth of his baby boy. When he registered the birth of the child, he was told by a registrar that the law required people who give birth to be registered as mothers, the court heard. Mr McConnell took legal action against the General Register Office, which is responsible for the registration of births and deaths in England and Wales, accusing it of discrimination. He said it breached his human right to respect for private and family life. By Ben Hunte, BBC LGBT correspondent Initial reaction to the judgement has been varied - as well as transphobic comments being shared online, some people in support of the transgender community have also said they think that today's ruling was correct. Some transgender individuals I have spoken to say they are ""deeply disappointed"" by this ruling, but they are not surprised by it. Aside from legality, some see this decision as a ""missed opportunity to send a much-needed positive message about transgender identity"". Legal representatives have told me that they are hopeful that if Freddy does not appeal, other transgender parents will continue with their fight for equality. The ruling means that transgender people will not be recognised as their trans identities in all areas of their lives; in some circumstances, like this, they will now be forced to ""out"" their birth gender. A transgender man, whose child calls them ""Dad"", will be listed on the child's birth certificate as their mother. One transgender individual told me that this will cause further anxiety around trans parenting. Had he been successful, Mr McConnell's son would have become the first person born in England and Wales not to legally have a mother. In his ruling,,externalSir Andrew McFarlane, president of the Family Division of the High Court, said: ""There is a material difference between a person's gender and their status as a parent. ""Being a 'mother', whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth. ""It is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognised in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. ""Whilst that person's gender is 'male', their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of 'mother.'"" Sir Andrew added: ""There would seem to be a pressing need for Government and Parliament to address square-on the question of the status of a trans-male who has become pregnant and given birth to a child."" Karen Holden, founder of A City Law Firm, who is representing Mr McConnell, said: ""Equality shouldn't have to come at a price, but this case has taken three years, hours of work and manpower, public attention and yet the courts still failed to help this family set out its actual family structure correctly in terms of its legal status. ""A birth certificate will stay with a child for life and it will be factually and legally inaccurate under current rules."" Transgender man wants to be named father The dad who gave birth.

"King Charles has delivered the Labour government's first King's Speech in the House of Lords. Part of the State Opening of Parliament ceremony, the speech marks the start of the parliamentary year. The King's Speech set out the new Labour government's priorities for the months ahead, following the party's general election victory. Formally called the Speech from the Throne, Charles gavehis first King's Speech in November 2023. He also delivered the Queen's Speech on behalf of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, in May 2022. The quirks and crowns of the King's State Opening The speech is written by the government, and the monarch delivers it in a neutral tone, to avoid any appearance of political support. Its length depends on the number of proposed laws and other announcements - such as foreign policy objectives - but it normally lasts about 10 minutes. The 2024 Kings Speech outlined the draft laws which Labour plan to introduce in the coming months. These include bills on workers' rights, the renationalisation of the railways, illegal immigration, housing and planning and House of Lords reform. Key points in King's Speech at a glance Traditionally, the State Opening begins with a procession in which the King travels from Buckingham Palace to Westminster by carriage. On arrival, he uses the Sovereign's Entrance, reserved for the monarch. The King then processes to the throne in the House of Lords. MPs are summoned to the Lords by Black Rod,an official position currently held by Sarah Clarke,external. Before entering the House of Commons, Black Rod has the door shut in their face. They then have to knock three times on the door with the rod to gain entry before it is opened, and MPs follow Black Rod back to the House of Lords to hear the speech. MPs, peers and other dignitaries generally listen in silence. Traditionally, the government MP holding the position ofvice-chamberlain of the household,external- currently Samantha Dixon - is ""held hostage"" in Buckingham Palace while the King is in Parliament, to ensure the monarch's safe return. Who is Black Rod and what do they do in Parliament? What does the King do? Yes. About two hours after the speech is delivered, MPs reassemble in the House of Commons to begin debating its contents. After introductory speeches by two MPs, the prime minister will ""sell"" the speech to the Commons, setting out a vision for the country. The leader of the opposition then gets the chance to respond, before other MPs are allowed to contribute. The last prime minister to lose a vote on the speech was Stanley Baldwin in 1924 The debate on what is known as ""the Humble Address"" normally lasts about five days. At the end of the debate there is a vote. It is normally seen as symbolic, as it is extremely rare for a government to lose it. The last time this happened was in January 1924, under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Mr Baldwin proceeded with a King's Speech - George V was the monarch at the time - despite having lost his majority in the previous month's general election. He was forced to resign, and Labour formed a short-lived government. The speech outlined21 laws that ministers had intended to pass in the 2023 Parliamentary session. They included plans to boost investment in transport, laws to stop people smoking, and tougher sentences for serious offenders. However, when former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the 4 July general election, the government was forced to abandon many of its planned bills.

"The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

"Boris Johnson had ""no role whatsoever"" in awarding a grant to a firm owned by US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, a junior minister has told MPs. Matt Warman said the government has launched a ""review"" of the Â£100,000 award made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's training company Hacker House. But he insisted it had been an ""open, transparent and competitive process"". It follows newspaper revelations about the prime minster's friendship with Ms Arcuri, when the PM was London mayor. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, asking an urgent question in the Commons, said she cared ""very little about the personal life of the prime minister"". But she said she did ""care a lot about how this government manages conflicts of interest and how it spends taxpayers' money"". ""The fact that we are back in the Commons today is because the prime minister has been shown to have ridden roughshod over the laws of the land. ""It would be disappointing if we were to find that the prime minister has form in bending the rules for personal or political gain."" So far, Â£47,000, out of the Â£100,000, has been paid to Hacker House under the government's Cyber Security Immediate Impact Fund, with the remainder put on hold until the review has been completed. Ms Moran said the government fund was meant to be for UK-based initiatives only. ""Yet we now know that Hacker House is not based in the UK,"" she told MPs. ""The Sunday Times reports that its owner, Jennifer Arcuri, moved back to the USA in June 2018. These grants weren't open for application until November. ""The registered address of the company is, in fact, a house in Cheshire and the current occupant, apparently, sends any post addressed to Miss Arcuri back to sender."" The Lib Dem MP accused government officials of failing to carry out due diligence and asked why they had waived the rule that any grant made under the fund should not exceed 50% of the company's revenue. Junior culture minister Matt Warman, who was making his debut at the despatch box, said officials had been so impressed with other aspects of Hacker House's application it ""more than outweighed"" the need for the company to meet the 50% of revenue criteria. He told MPs the government's review of the Hacker House decision would ""leave no stone unturned"" and its findings would be released next month. But he repeatedly stressed that ""the prime minister and his staff have had absolutely no role in the award of this grant"" and that Mr Johnson, who was foreign secretary when the grant was awarded, had not lobbied officials on behalf of Ms Arcuri. Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, who is also the party's culture spokesman, said: ""As I understand it, Hacker House is a company headquartered in California. The principal owners of the company live in the United States. ""The company claims to have employees in London but refuses to reveal who they are or where they are. It is very difficult to see how the company fulfilled the criteria for these grants."" Mr Watson said the allegations showed Mr Johnson was ""a man whose character renders him unsuitable and unfit for the office he holds"". Lib Dem MP Jamie Stone said: ""The impression of money being doshed out to mates is corrosive to public confidence in the grant system and that, in turn, is damaging to the reputation of any government."" Mr Warman replied: ""That impression is, in part, why we are having that review."" But, he added, there was no evidence the PM had done anything improper. Conservative MP Damian Collins confirmed that Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is due to give evidence on Hacker House to his DCMS select committee on 16 October. Mr Johnson is, separately, being investigated by the London Assembly's oversight committee over alleged conflicts of interest when he was London mayor, between 2008 and 2016.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Amazon Alexa gets Samuel L Jackson's voice Amazon has announced that its virtual assistant Alexa will soon be able to mimic the voice of the actor Samuel L Jackson among other celebrities. The firm intends to charge a fee for the feature, with each voice costing $0.99 (80p). The company has also refreshed its range of Echo speakers, adding a larger high-end version with Dolby Atmos for ""3D sound"". Amazon is the world's best-selling smart speaker brand. Amazon devices chief Dave Limp hosted its hardware event in Seattle However, that position is being challenged by Chinese companies including Baidu, while Google is also expected to unveil new gear of its own next month. The company has also extended its Echo range into a selection of wearable tech for both humans and pets for the first time. The new devices include: Echo Frames - a pair of titanium-framed glasses that vibrate to provide notifications, and have built-in microphones and speakers to use Alexa, but no display Echo Buds - a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds that feature noise-reduction tech, giving them an edge over Apple's Airpods, and which can activate the firm's virtual assistant by voice alone, unlike other Alexa-enabled headphones Echo Loop - a ring that features two microphones and a ""tap-on"" button, which allows owners to record messages and send them to an Echo smart speaker Fetch - a pet tracker designed to attach to a dog collar This video can not be played WATCH: A first look at Amazon's Alexa-powered Frame glasses and Loop ring In addition, the firm said its smart assistant would be built into General Motors' vehicles from next year, and that some existing models could be upgraded to include the feature. ""This avalanche of new products underlines Amazon's desire to extend Alexa's reach to every part of people's lives - be that in the home, or on the move via new Echo Buds or in the car through the deal with General Motors,"" commented Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight. ""Not only will it will strengthen Amazon's reach with existing customers that use Alexa-powered products, it will also provide the opportunity to woo more consumers to embrace its increasingly ubiquitous voice assistant."" Amazon's pet tracker will use a new wireless data-transfer technology to let owners monitor their dog from up to 500m away Amazon said it would use a ""neural text-to-speech"" engine to mimic celebrities' voices on Alexa-powered devices. It will use recordings the stars provide as the basis for other computer-generated utterances. Samuel L Jackson's voice will be offered in both a ""clean"" and an ""explicit"" mode for Alexa In the case of Avengers actor Samuel L Jackson, consumers will be given the choice of whether they want a version that swears or not. The firm said other famous stars - who will be paid for their services - will follow. Amazon recently announced it was upgrading its music streaming service to a ""high definition"" format to help its fortunes. Its new Studio speaker should provide users with a means to appreciate the extra detail it offers. Like Sonos' kit, it fine tunes its sound to suit the acoustics of the room it is placed in.

And two of the $200 (Â£190 in the UK) speakers can be paired and connected to a Fire TV stick or television to create a home theatre experience. ""Amazon has never really had a smart speaker which was marketed specifically for its audio quality, in the manner of an Apple HomePod or a Google Home Max,"" commented Ben Stanton from the tech consultancy Canalys. ""Typically, third-parties like Harman and Sonos would be the ones to differentiate in this space on Amazon's behalf. ""If it [lives up to its promise], it will cannibalise these third-party products, and leave little room left for third-party smart speaker vendors to innovate."" Amazon's stock closed the day 1.5% higher, while shares in Sonos sank 5% lower. Amazon's devices chief Dave Limp addressed users' privacy concerns early on during the launch event at the firm's Seattle headquarters, even showing a tweet it had received complaining about one of its speakers activating without the trigger word ""Alexa"" being uttered. ""We care about this,"" he said. ""Privacy is absolutely foundational to everything we do in and around Alexa."" Mr Limp showed a tweet in which a British father-of-three had expressed concerns about Alexa He highlighted the fact that users can now command a device to delete everything they have said that day. In addition, the firm recently added an option to its Alexa app to let users opt out of having their voices transcribed by humans to improve the service's accuracy. However, some of its rivals - including Apple and Google - have gone further by requiring their users to opt in to similar programmes. ""Privacy is a huge issue for all technology manufacturers and recent revelations show that Amazon is vulnerable,"" commented Adam Simon from the market intelligence firm Context. ""All our research shows that it is a major concern to consumers. ""Yet, ironically, it is not the most important barrier preventing people buying smart home products. Privacy is far outweighed by lack of understanding, lack of perception of value, and lack of good use cases."" Amazon Echo screen flicker angers owners Google seeks permission to listen to Assistant recordings Amazon Alexa: Privacy watchdog in discussions about recordings He added that later this year, users will be able to ask Alexa ""why did you do that?"", to question it about unexpected behaviour. Furthermore, a new setting will allow them to set recordings to be auto-deleted after a set period of time ranging from three to 18 months. Amazon said it decided to launch a smart oven after its previous Alexa-enabled microwave became a bestseller Other announcements included a new 8in (20.3cm) Echo Show smart display, which can now show group video calls with several people on-screen at once. It features the same ""high definition"" screen resolution as the 10in model, but only a one megapixel camera versus the 5MP sensor in the larger device. That means it will likely never add the kind of auto-framing feature that Facebook's Portal and Google Nest Hub Max video chat devices offer, which is achieved by cropping into the image. The Echo Show 8 has similar quality speakers but a lower resolution camera than the older Echo Show (2nd Gen) Other new kit included: a small version of its smart speaker that plugs directly into the wall and features a port into which owners can plug accessories such as a motion sensor or a nightlight, called the Echo Flex an internet-connected lamp that can change colours in time with music, called the Echo Glow a voice-controlled smart fan oven, which can also cook food via microwaves or an oil-based ""air-fryer"". It can be paired to a smartphone to allow users to scan  packaged foods' barcodes to set the device to cook them at the appropriate temperatures for the recommended amount of times a new wireless protocol called Sidewalk, which can connect devices up to 500m (0.3 miles) away - giving it an advantage over Bluetooth and wifi - but uses less power than a 4G or 5G data link Allow Twitter content?

Mr Limp also announced changes to its Ring-branded smart doorbells. These will now gain use of Alexa, including a service that will allow visitors to record a message if the owner is out and unable to answer remotely via the device's app. He also unveiled new Ring hardware including a security camera for inside the home - which will compete against Google's Nest Cam as well as similar products from Hive and Canary - and a ""retrofit"" kit that adds smart features to existing alarm systems.

"About 1,200 Wrightbus workers have been made redundant after the company entered administration. Just 50 jobs will be retained at the firm - the last UK-owned bus manufacturer - administrators said. The company had suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner. Talks with two potential buyers of the firm, best known for building the New Routemaster, known as the ""Boris Bus"",failed to reach a conclusion last week. Reaction to Ballymena firm entering administration Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Bus firm faces questions over religious donations Deloitte, the firm's administrator, said the lack of a buyer for Wrightbus had caused the redundancies. The Wright family, who founded Wrightbus in 1946, said ""global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK"". In a statement, the family said that it moved work from its facility in Malaysia to Ballymena in a bid to secure local jobs. ""These factors have resulted in significant losses at Wrightbus which our family have been covering for a over a year."" This video can not be played Government must 'invest in Wrightbus' - Jackie Pollock, Unite regional secretary But a statement added: ""It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support."" Read more reaction here. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, union officials called for the immediate intervention of the British government. They said they sought meetings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and NI Secretary Julian Smith, who they said they must ""stand up for British industry"". Jackie Pollock, Unite's regional secretary, added ""the government must intervene to save jobs and skills"". ""The administrator will need to find someone of calibre and of real standing who has the wherewithal and the skill to take this company on,"" he said. Wrightbus is best known for building the New Routemaster, or 'Boris Bus', which were ordered from the firm by Boris Johnson, the then mayor of London by BBC News NI North East reporter Sara Girvin It used to be a bustling market town - but the years have not been kind. The potential loss of so many jobs would be a blow to any town in Northern Ireland, but this isn't the first time Ballymena has been hit. The closure of big employers like JTI and Michelin in recent years have already left scars on the town. Read more about company closures in Ballymena here. This video can not be played Staff at the Ballymena bus manufacturer fear for the future as 1,200 lose their jobs. Norman Stephens has worked at Wrightbus for 30 years and said he is gutted. ""For the last five years, management has told us that they can't give us a wage rise as they were investing it in the company. ""Who is going to employ a 62-year-old man? I have nothing now. That's it. ""I'm off shift and due back in tomorrow night but I've been in since 8 o'clock hoping to find out if I've got a job."" Latest accounts show that the Wrightbus group lost Â£1.7m on a turnover of Â£227m in 2017. But its financial situation has deteriorated since then. This video can not be played 'This is a body blow for Ballymena' - DUP MP Ian Paisley It made two rounds of redundancies last year with 95 jobs going in February and June, which it said reflected continued low levels of demand for new buses in the UK market. The UK has traditionally been Wrightbus's biggest market but it has been contracting for over two years. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that in the second quarter of this year new bus and coach registrations are down 30% compared to the same period last year. That marks the tenth quarter in a row that new registrations have declined. In 2012, Wrightbus was riding high. The company launched the New Routemasters, which were ordered by the then mayor Boris Johnson - and so became known as Boris Buses. It was a triumphant time for the Ballymena business, but now it's been brought low. Read more on the firm's financial fall here. In the last six years Wrightbus has donated more than Â£15m to Green Pastures, a religious charity led by the firm's majority shareholder Jeff Wright. The donations helped it to develop plans for a huge church and village complex known as Project Gateway. Green Pastures is led by Wrightbus's majority shareholder Jeff Wright In the wake of the firm's fall into administration, questions have been asked over the use of money. Read more here. In March 2016, Wrightbus founderSir William Wright became the first major business figure in Northern Ireland to voice his support for Brexit. The businessman told the Ballymena Guardian newspaper: ""I am totally in favour of getting out.""

"This video can not be played Campaigner Gina Miller reacts to the judgement outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday Gina Miller is the businesswoman and campaigner who has twice led legal challenges against the government and won. Her first victory came in September 2017, when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving MPs a say over triggering Article 50 - the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU. Her second came on Tuesday,when the Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful. Her success in the courts has come at a price - she has become a hate figure for many Brexit supporters and has had to employ round-the-clock security after threats to her life. She says she does not want to block Brexit, but is standing up for Parliamentary democracy. Speaking outside the Supreme Court after the ruling on Tuesday, she said: ""Today is not a win for any individual or cause, it's a win for Parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers and the independence of our British courts. ""Crucially, this ruling confirms that we are a nation governed by the rule of law."" Mrs Miller is not officially aligned to any political party, havingspurned the advances of the Liberal Democrats, who rapturously received a speech she gave at their 2018 party conference. A 54-year-old investment manager and philanthropist, Mrs Miller was born in Guyana and educated in Britain. She went first to an exclusive all-girls private boarding school, Roedean, on the outskirts of Brighton, at the age of 10, then to Moira House Girls' School, in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Afterwards, she studied law at the University of East London, but left before completing her degree. Mrs Miller went on to start a successful marketing consultancy business with clients including private medical specialists in Harley Street in London. In 2009, she used the money she had made in marketing to co-found an investment firm supporting smaller charities. ""I realised then it was my money, I could do what I wanted with it and so I used that money to get involved in social justice,"" Mrs Miller toldUnfiltered with James O'Brien,externallast year. And in 2012, the businesswoman began the True and Fair Campaign, which campaigned for greater transparency in the City of London's fund management industry. According to an interview with theFinancial Times in 2016,external, this led some in the industry to label her the ""black widow spider"". Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City."" Mrs Miller launched her first Brexit legal case with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney - a UK citizen who lives in France. Backed by a crowd-funding campaign, they argued the government could not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - starting the formal process of the UK leaving the EU - without seeking approval from Parliament. Mrs Miller argued only Parliament could make a decision leading to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law. But she stressed the challenge was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now."" In November 2016,three High Court judges ruled Parliament had to voteon when the process could begin. Speaking after her victory, Mrs Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"". And she said the legal challenge was about more than Brexit, arguing that it was ""verging on dictatorship"" for a prime minister to be able to take away people's rights without Parliament's consent. The government appealed, and the case went to the Supreme Court the following December, butthe 11 judges rejected it by a majority of eight to three. Mrs Miller after winning her High Court legal challenge in November 2016 Following the successful legal challenge, Mrs Miller suffered online abuse, including rape and death threats against her and her family. She told James O'Brien: ""It has changed the way we live our lives, and the conversations we have with the children"". ""We use humour a lot because that's the only way to get through it"", she told him. In July 2017, an aristocrat who wrote a Facebook post offering Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over Mrs Millerwas sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. Describing the businesswoman as a ""boat jumper"", Rhodri Colwyn Philipps - the 4th Viscount St Davids - wrote: ""If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles."" The peer claimed the comments were ""satire"" and a ""joke"". But the judge, who said the post effectively put a ""bounty"" on Mrs Miller's head, found him guilty of two charges of making menacing communications. Later that year,Mrs Miller was named as Britain's most influential black person. ""It's amazing to get an accolade when what I've done has solicited a huge amount of abuse,"" she said on receiving her title. ""To have somebody acknowledge me is extraordinarily kind and counters a lot of what I still get on a daily basis."" Mrs Miller arrived at the Supreme Court in 2017 flanked by security guards, having received death threats Despite the backlash, Mrs Miller went on to launch a second challenge against the government to""defend Parliamentary sovereignty"". After Mr Johnson announced in August that he would suspend Parliament for five weeks, Mrs Miller challenged the legality of the decision at the High Court. She argued thatParliament would be ""silenced""for an ""exceptional"" length of time in the critical period before the 31 October Brexit deadline. She initially lost her case, but in Scotland, a separate legal challenge succeeded, with judges taking the view thatthe suspension was unlawful. The UK government appealed to the Supreme Court against the Scottish judgement, and the two cases were then heard together. The court unanimously ruled in favour of Mrs Miller's appeal and against the government's. Gina Miller spoke to the media outside the Supreme Court after her victory Judges said it waswrong to stop MPs carrying out duties in the run-up to the Brexit deadlineon 31 October. After the ruling Mrs Miller told reporters the ruling showed the government ""will push the law, they will push the constitution and they will even bend it to get their own way"".

"This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Was there a quid pro quo? The Trump administration has released details of a phone conversation in July that has triggered a US impeachment inquiry against the president. According to the notes, Donald Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to look into corruption claims involving the son of Joe Biden, Mr Trump's possible rival in next year's presidential election. Concerns about the call were initially raised by a whistleblower. The Democrats accused Mr Trump of seeking foreign help to smear a rival. Under the US constitution, a president can be impeached for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours"" - a procedure that can lead to removal from office. In July, Mr Trump froze military aid to Ukraine but he has insisted that this was not used to put pressure on the new government in Kiev. Dissecting phone call behind Trump impeachment push Trump call could embarrass Ukraine's president Mr Trump discusses with his newly elected Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, the 2016 removal of a prosecutor, Viktor Shokin,according to notes of their 25 July telephone conversation released by the White House,external. The US president is quoted as saying in the half-hour call: ""I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. ""A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved."" He continues: ""The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution [of Mr Biden's son] and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the [US] Attorney General would be great. This video can not be played Trump: 'It was going to be the call from hell. It turned out to be a nothing call' ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."" Mr Zelensky says in response: ""We will take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case."" Thanking Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky says he stayed in Trump Tower in New York City during a previous visit to the US. On the call, the US president also asks Mr Zelensky to work with US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to look into the matter, according to the notes. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that Mr Trump had not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate Mr Biden, and Mr Barr had not communicated with Ukraine. Mr Trump and his conservative allies have focused on how Mr Biden, as US vice-president in 2016, lobbied Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin. Mr Shokin's office had opened an investigation into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Mr Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a board member. This video can not be played ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry Other Western officials had called for Mr Shokin to be fired because of the perception that he was soft on corruption. Mr Biden last year told a foreign policy event how he threatened to withhold $1bn in aid to Ukraine unless Mr Shokin was removed.

Mr Trump had promised that a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" of the 25 July call would be released. But the details disclosed by the White House on Wednesday morning were notes of the conversation taken by US officials who listened in. The July call occurred days after Mr Trump directed the US government to withhold about $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. In the summary of the call, Mr Trump does not tell the Ukrainian president that US aid hinges upon him investigating Mr Biden. But Mr Trump stresses the importance of US financial support, before pressing Mr Zelensky for action on the Democratic candidate. ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,"" Mr Trump says. In one of the most cryptic passages from the call, Mr Trump mentions a ""server"" and CrowdStrike.

That cyber-breach led to the leak of numerous emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. CrowdStrike determined a pair of hacking groups with suspected Russian ties was responsible for the hack. Mr Trump has previously questioned why the DNC did not turn over the hacked email server to the FBI, instead of asking CrowdStrike to investigate. The US president told the Associated Press news agency in April 2017 that he had ""heard"" CrowdStrike was ""owned by a very rich Ukranian"". In the phone call with Mr Zelensky, Mr Trump appears to suggest the DNC server is stored somewhere in Ukraine.

"The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

"This video can not be played ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry The US Democratic Party has begun a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over allegations that he pressured a foreign power to damage a political rival. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the president ""must be held accountable"". Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the efforts a ""witch hunt"". There is strong support from House Democrats for impeachment, but the proceedings would be unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. The high-stakes move by House Speaker Ms Pelosi, prompted by allegations that Mr Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his leading political rival Joe Biden, lays the groundwork for a potentially hugely consequential confrontation between Democrats and the president ahead of the 2020 election. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Why Pelosi made her move How the impeachment process works If the inquiry moves forward, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will vote on any charges. If Democrats were to remain united, the measure would be carried - and Mr Trump would become the third president in US history to be impeached. But the proceedings would be expected to stall in the Senate, where the president's Republican party holds enough seats to prevent him from being removed from office by a two-thirds majority. Ms Pelosi did not provide any timeline for how the process might play out. Senior Democrats including Ms Pelosi had previously resisted growing calls from within the party to begin impeachment proceedings. But the party's leadership united on the issue after an intelligence whistleblower lodged a formal complaint about one or more phone calls between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Trump administration has so far refused to release the whistleblower complaint to Congress but Democrats say Mr Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Mr Zelensky agreed to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Trump's leading political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Trump has admitted discussing Joe Biden with Mr Zelensky. He has denied that he exerted pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival. On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed that military aid to Ukraine had been withheld but said he had done this to try and pressure European nations to increase their contributions to the country. Two presidents have been impeached in US history - Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. But neither were removed from office by a Senate trial. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached. For months now, Democratic leaders have been playing a semantics game. They wanted those who supported and those who opposed a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump to both think they were getting what they wanted. This strategy suggested Nancy Pelosi and others feared that heading down the path to impeachment would put moderate Democrats facing tough 2020 re-election fights at risk. That calculation has changed after the rapid drumbeat of new revelations about Mr Trump's contacts with the Ukrainian president. Now even middle-of-the road politicians are coming out in favour of impeachment proceedings. The dam has broken. The genie is out of the bottle. Pick your metaphor. The simple fact is that Ms Pelosi - a keen judge of the political mood within her caucus - has made the decision to shift from resisting impeachment to advocating for it. The path forward is uncertain. Opinion surveys could show the latest drama is taking a toll on one party or the other, causing political will to crumble. Or, both sides could dig in for a long, gruelling battle that could drag into the darkest days of winter. More from Anthony on why Ms Pelosi has made her move In a statement on Tuesday she said Mr Trump had betrayed his oath of office and committed ""a violation of the law"". She called his actions ""a breach of his constitutional responsibilities"". ""This week the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take action that would benefit him politically,"" she said, adding: ""The president must be held accountable.

"Sue Petrow was due to fly home on Wednesday Thomas Cook holidaymakers and crew are free to leave Cuba, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. Repatriation flights have been arranged with the aid of the British Ambassador to Cuba, it said. Tourists had said they were prevented from leaving their hotels until they paid extra for their stay. One holidaymaker, Sue Petrow, who was due to leave, said her hotel had told her she could be held at the airport unless she paid her bill. Cabin crew from Thomas Cook had also said they were effectively being ""held hostage"" by security guards at a hotel. Live updates: Thomas Cook repatriation continues Thomas Cook collapse: Your questions answered Thomas Cook worker: 'I've been thrown under a bus' But Dame Deirdre Hutton, the chair of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), told the BBC's Today programme: ""That has been sorted out by the ambassador overnight, and the Cuban flight is in the air on its way back, which is very good news."" ""It's also an example of how we're working very closely with the Foreign Office, which is great."" ""It's very distressing for people who are finding difficulties with their accommodation, but what we've done is issue guarantees to the... hotels with Atol-protected British tourists,"" she added. The British Ambassador to Cuba said hotels had been instructed to allow customers to depart without paying additional charges.

Sue Petrow said she and other guests had refused to pay extra charges demanded by the hotel. Holidaymakers like Sue may have paid for their rooms and meals months in advance, but hotels would normally only receive the money from Thomas Cook several weeks after their stay. Reports suggested there was widespread concern in Cuba over whether the industry insurance fund Atol, which covers payments in the event of a firm failing, would foot the costs. The fund covers bills that have been run up since Thomas Cook's collapse on Monday morning. However, bills run up at hotels before Thomas Cook's collapse will not be covered. Affected hoteliers will have to apply to the liquidators for their money. Dame Deirdre said the CAA had issued guarantees for payment to 3,000 hotels around the world, and had already started making the first payments. The CAA had 200 staff working with Thomas Cook employees, she added. ""Given how much those hotels are owed by Thomas Cook, it's hardly surprising that they are suspicious and angry,"" she said. Thomas Cook owes hotels Â£338m, with one hotel in Mexico owed Â£2.5m, she added. The Insolvency Service has written to local tourist boards to make sure hotels are working with the CAA on payments, Dame Hutton said.

There are 70 flights scheduled on Wednesday, bringing back a further 16,500 people. The flying programme will continue until 6 October with more than 1,000 flights planned. Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA, said: ""I would like those remaining on holiday to enjoy the rest of their stay because we aim to also fly you home on the day when you were originally booked to fly with Thomas Cook, or very shortly thereafter.

"This video can not be played Vaping fears: 'A new generation of nicotine addicts' Kevin Burns, chief executive of vaping firm Juul, has stepped down, amid growing concerns around vaping health risks and criticism of its marketing. The firm has also announced it will withdraw all US advertising. Mr Burns will be replaced immediately by KC Crosthwaite, former chief growth officer at tobacco giant Altria,Juul said,external. Juul is 35%-owned by Altria, and in the past has been accused of targeting vaping devices at children. Mr Burns said: ""Since joining Juul Labs, I have worked non-stop, helping turn a small firm into a worldwide business, so a few weeks ago I decided that now was the right time for me to step down."" At the same time, Altria said its merger talks with fellow cigarette-maker Phillip Morris would not move forward. The changes come as Juul faces serious threats to its once explosive growth. The Trump administration this month said it was preparing a nationwide ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. Juul is also facing multiple investigations, including into its marketing practices. Walmart ceases e-cigarette sales Juul 'ignored law' in US e-cigarette adverts 'Half as many Britons' vape as smoke Juul has for years promoted its e-cigarettes, which contain addictive nicotine, as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products. However, the Food and Drug Administration recently warned Juul against making health claims without presenting scientific evidence to authorities for approval. Former Juul chief Kevin Burns Juul said it would not lobby against the proposed ban on flavoured e-cigarettes. However, Mr Crosthwaite said he remains committed to making Juul's products available to adult smokers. ""Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry,"" he said. The crackdown on Juul, which dominates the US e-cigarette market, follows a spate of serious lung injuries in the US linked to vaping. Health authorities have not blamed the outbreak, in which nine people have died and more than 530 people been taken ill, on any one product. Most of the patients had a history of using vaping products that contain THC, the chemical in marijuana, they said. However, the injuries have raised alarm, especially in conjunction with surging rates of teen vaping. Two US states, New York and Michigan, have already imposed bans on flavoured e-cigarettes, while Massachusetts has announced a four-month ban on all vaping products. Walmart last week announced it would stop e-cigarette sales, citing the regulatory uncertainty.

"The German subsidiary believes that by filing for insolvency it can save its national brands Thomas Cook's German subsidiary has announced it is filing for insolvency in an attempt to save its national brands after the collapse of the UK parent company on Monday. Almost 100,000 holidaymakers are travelling with the German affiliates and it is not clear what the bankruptcy proceedings will mean for them. The German government has already granted a â¬380m (Â£335m; $420m) bridging loan to the holiday airline Condor. Condor is 49% owned by Thomas Cook. The central state of Hesse, where Condor is based, also stepped in to rescue the airline, arguing that it was profitable. The company said it was ""operationally healthy"" and the six-month loan was aimed at preventing any ""bottlenecks"" resulting from its British parent company. The funding will be paid out pending an agreement with the European Commission. Thomas Cook Germany is also based in Hesse and state premier Volker Bouffier said it was in principle willing to step in to help that company too. It said that it had long been burdened by the weak Thomas Cook business in Great Britain and by Brexit. A total of 600,00 holidaymakers have been caught up in the collapse of the UK company. Many have travelled from the UK but Thomas Cook's empire stretches across Europe and tens of thousands have travelled with its subsidiaries. Under EU package holiday rules,holidaymakers are protected financially,externalfrom a company's insolvency as well as having the right to repatriation. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has had the task of bringing back more than 150,000 holidaymakers. It repatriated more than 14,000 passengers on Tuesday and was expecting to bring back another 16,500 on Wednesday. This video can not be played A passenger raises funds for Thomas Cook staff on a flight from Turkey Thousands of Dutch, Belgian and Polish tourists are still abroad, but the biggest group affected outside the UK is from Germany. A spokeswoman said on Wednesday that 97,000 people were currently travelling with the company. Live updates: Thomas Cook repatriation continues Holidaymakers 'can leave Cuba', says CAA Impact of Thomas Cook's collapse around the world Thomas Cook collapse: Your rights explained Thomas Cook Germany employs some 2,000 people and has several national brands, including Neckermann, Ãger Tours, Air Marin and Bucher Reisen. A thousand people are employed by the company near Frankfurt. It said it was talking to the German foreign ministry as well as the travel bankruptcy insurer, Zurich, about repatriating customers. Like Condor, it has asked the Hesse state government and the federal government for a bridging loan. The German subsidiary believes its brands have a future and is in negotiations with investors and hotel operators to continue in business. Thomas Cook GmbH said it had been forced to seek insolvency to extricate itself from its (UK) parent company's ""financial tie-ups and related liabilities"". Allow Twitter content?

Founded in 1841, parent company Thomas Cook filed for bankruptcy after failing to secure emergency funding of Â£200m from the UK government. In the UK, anyone who has bought a package holiday covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol) will have the cost refunded. However, some customers whose future holidays have been cancelled have seen the price of replacement deals spiral. There is also concern that local businesses will be badly affected in countries where Thomas Cook operates: The Balearic Islands in Spain is set to lose millions of euros. Thomas Cook has a tax office in Palma with hundreds of employees and works with a number of local hotels In Cyprus, hoteliers and the wider economy could lose â¬50m, according to Cyprus's deputy tourism minister The Gambia is bracing itself for a big impact on tourism, which contributes to more than 30% of its economic output Turkey's hotel federation says many small businesses depend on Thomas Cook.

"Katrice Lee went missing on her second birthday while out shopping with her mother A former serviceman, arrested in connection with a toddler who went missing in Germany 38 years ago has been released without charge. Katrice Lee, from Hartlepool,disappeared from a supermarketnear a British army base in Paderborn in 1981. Royal Military Police said an arrest was made in the Swindon area on Monday and a property was being searched. The youngster's father, Richard Lee, said the man's release ""did not mean the investigation is over"". Katrice was with her mother at a Naafi supermarket when she vanished. In 2012, Royal Military Police chiefs admitted mistakes were made during the initial investigation into her disappearance, and in 2017 the government agreed to review the case. A year later, the Royal Military Police undertook a forensic search on the bank of the River Alme, near where she went missing.

"This video can not be played ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry The US Democratic Party has begun a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over allegations that he pressured a foreign power to damage a political rival. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the president ""must be held accountable"". Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the efforts a ""witch hunt"". There is strong support from House Democrats for impeachment, but the proceedings would be unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. The high-stakes move by House Speaker Ms Pelosi, prompted by allegations that Mr Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his leading political rival Joe Biden, lays the groundwork for a potentially hugely consequential confrontation between Democrats and the president ahead of the 2020 election. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Why Pelosi made her move How the impeachment process works If the inquiry moves forward, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will vote on any charges. If Democrats were to remain united, the measure would be carried - and Mr Trump would become the third president in US history to be impeached. But the proceedings would be expected to stall in the Senate, where the president's Republican party holds enough seats to prevent him from being removed from office by a two-thirds majority. Ms Pelosi did not provide any timeline for how the process might play out. Senior Democrats including Ms Pelosi had previously resisted growing calls from within the party to begin impeachment proceedings. But the party's leadership united on the issue after an intelligence whistleblower lodged a formal complaint about one or more phone calls between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Trump administration has so far refused to release the whistleblower complaint to Congress but Democrats say Mr Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Mr Zelensky agreed to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Trump's leading political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Trump has admitted discussing Joe Biden with Mr Zelensky. He has denied that he exerted pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival. On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed that military aid to Ukraine had been withheld but said he had done this to try and pressure European nations to increase their contributions to the country. Two presidents have been impeached in US history - Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. But neither were removed from office by a Senate trial. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached. For months now, Democratic leaders have been playing a semantics game. They wanted those who supported and those who opposed a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump to both think they were getting what they wanted. This strategy suggested Nancy Pelosi and others feared that heading down the path to impeachment would put moderate Democrats facing tough 2020 re-election fights at risk. That calculation has changed after the rapid drumbeat of new revelations about Mr Trump's contacts with the Ukrainian president. Now even middle-of-the road politicians are coming out in favour of impeachment proceedings. The dam has broken. The genie is out of the bottle. Pick your metaphor. The simple fact is that Ms Pelosi - a keen judge of the political mood within her caucus - has made the decision to shift from resisting impeachment to advocating for it. The path forward is uncertain. Opinion surveys could show the latest drama is taking a toll on one party or the other, causing political will to crumble. Or, both sides could dig in for a long, gruelling battle that could drag into the darkest days of winter. More from Anthony on why Ms Pelosi has made her move In a statement on Tuesday she said Mr Trump had betrayed his oath of office and committed ""a violation of the law"". She called his actions ""a breach of his constitutional responsibilities"". ""This week the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take action that would benefit him politically,"" she said, adding: ""The president must be held accountable. No-one is above the law."" This video can not be played Pelosi: ""The president must be held accountable; no one is above the law."" Mr Biden has denied wrongdoing and no evidence has emerged to back up the claims against him. He has also said he supports impeachment proceedings unless the US president complies with investigations. Impeaching Mr Trump ""would be a tragedy"", Mr Biden said. ""But a tragedy of his making."" He is the current frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election. In a series of tweets Mr Trump said Democrats ""purposely had to ruin and demean"" his trip to the UN in New York ""with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage"". ""They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!"" he added. This video can not be played Trump confirms he withheld aid to Ukraine - but insists there was no ""quid pro quo"" He promised to release a transcript of his conversation with Ukraine's president on Wednesday to show it was ""totally appropriate"".

"A ""quiet green tax"" is deterring gardeners from recycling their waste, it has been claimed. Analysis shows some UK councils charge up to Â£100 a year for a kerbside collection, despite one in four councils providing a free service. Critics say the service should be free to residents to reduce the amount of clippings being sent to landfill. Councils say the service is not statutory and home composting is a cheaper alternative. The BBC's Shared Data Unit looked at the annual subscription charges levied by local councils for regular kerbside garden waste collections. More than 140 local authorities provide a free collection, but charges for other councils range from Â£18 to Â£96. The average annual charge is around Â£31, with higher costs levied in London and the South East. Garden waste collected by local authorities is turned into compost If it is sent to landfill, it breaks down without oxygen, which produces methane gas Methane is around 25 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide produced from composting Source:WRAP,external Anthony O'Sullivan, the managing director of Gardeners Club, said the charge was a ""quiet green garden tax which seems to go against every other positive environmental initiative the UK is trying to promote"". ""So whilst the rest of the world is encouraging us all to reduce our carbon footprints and generally live a better environmental way of life, why are UK councils doing the opposite?"" he added. Lynn Wright said the service provided by Dorset Council was expensive, but saved her a trip to the recycling centre. She said: ""We have a garden waste collection service fortnightly - Â£50.50 a year, which I think is rather high, but does save costs of travelling to our tip. ""The local tip is a problem for me as it involves climbing steep stairs to offload the waste."" Elsewhere, Sue Backhouse, a landscape gardener from Eastbourne in East Sussex, pays around Â£52 a year for a garden waste collection. She said the charges had led to an increase in the dumping of garden waste in public areas, while many residents had abandoned their green bin altogether. ""The anger towards the garden bin charge is not just that people feel it should be covered by their council tax, but that councils turn the composted garden waste into bags of soil enrichers, which they sell to the public and use for free on council projects,"" she said. ""Surely this financial advantage and income should be taken into account when calculating garden bin collection costs?"" Tony and Marie Newton, who have an award-winning garden called Four Seasons, live in Walsall where the service is free of charge. The couple say if charges were introduced, they think it is ""most unlikely that enthusiastic gardeners would be off put from their hobby"". ""Overall, we think that this policy has great benefits for the Walsall borough as well as for very many householders,"" they added. The government says free regular collections are the best way to improve rates of garden waste recycling. It hasasked for opinions,externalon the possibility of all councils in England providing the service free of charge from 2023. But the Local Government Association (LGA) warned if free collections became mandatory, the government would have to foot the bill. ""Ultimately, garden waste collection has to be paid for by someone,"" said Councillor David Renard, the LGA's environment spokesman. ""It's only fair that those households which have gardens and generate the waste pay for the service. This is why some councils charge for this as it's not a universal service."" Gardeners served by Harlow Council in Essex face the highest charges at Â£96 a year followed by Adur and Worthing Councils in West Sussex at Â£85 and the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire at Â£78. Councillor Danny Purton, the portfolio holder for environment at Harlow Council, said residents were able to book a collection in advance from ""as little as 95p per bag"", or sign up to the year-round wheelie bin service. He said: ""Although the wheelie bin service is more expensive, it has proven to be popular. ""We expect the cost of the service to reduce as more people use the service."" In Northern Ireland, none of the 11 local authorities charge for the service. In Wales, more than half do not ask residents to foot the bill, and in Scotland, more than three-quarters do not charge. Eleven local authorities in the UK do not provide regular collections of garden waste.

"This video can not be played How one man gave birth to his own baby A transgender man, who has given birth to a child and does not want to be described as ""mother"" on a birth certificate, has lost a legal battle. Freddy McConnell wanted to be registered as ""father"" or ""parent"". But a High Court judge ruled the status of ""mother"" was afforded to a person who carries and gives birth to a baby. He said while Mr McConnell's gender was recognised by law as male, his parental status of ""mother"" derives from the biological role of giving birth. Mr McConnell, a journalist at the Guardian, has told the BBC he plans to appeal against the ruling. During the trial in London, the High Court heard how Mr McConnell was a single parent, who was born a woman but now lived as a man following surgery. He was biologically able to get pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy last year, but had legally become a man by the time of the birth. Mr McConnell's journey to parenthood was documented in a film called Seahorse and included his thoughts and footage of him going through fertility treatment, conception and the birth of his baby boy. When he registered the birth of the child, he was told by a registrar that the law required people who give birth to be registered as mothers, the court heard. Mr McConnell took legal action against the General Register Office, which is responsible for the registration of births and deaths in England and Wales, accusing it of discrimination. He said it breached his human right to respect for private and family life. By Ben Hunte, BBC LGBT correspondent Initial reaction to the judgement has been varied - as well as transphobic comments being shared online, some people in support of the transgender community have also said they think that today's ruling was correct. Some transgender individuals I have spoken to say they are ""deeply disappointed"" by this ruling, but they are not surprised by it. Aside from legality, some see this decision as a ""missed opportunity to send a much-needed positive message about transgender identity"". Legal representatives have told me that they are hopeful that if Freddy does not appeal, other transgender parents will continue with their fight for equality. The ruling means that transgender people will not be recognised as their trans identities in all areas of their lives; in some circumstances, like this, they will now be forced to ""out"" their birth gender. A transgender man, whose child calls them ""Dad"", will be listed on the child's birth certificate as their mother. One transgender individual told me that this will cause further anxiety around trans parenting. Had he been successful, Mr McConnell's son would have become the first person born in England and Wales not to legally have a mother. In his ruling,,externalSir Andrew McFarlane, president of the Family Division of the High Court, said: ""There is a material difference between a person's gender and their status as a parent. ""Being a 'mother', whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth. ""It is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognised in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. ""Whilst that person's gender is 'male', their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of 'mother.'"" Sir Andrew added: ""There would seem to be a pressing need for Government and Parliament to address square-on the question of the status of a trans-male who has become pregnant and given birth to a child."" Karen Holden, founder of A City Law Firm, who is representing Mr McConnell, said: ""Equality shouldn't have to come at a price, but this case has taken three years, hours of work and manpower, public attention and yet the courts still failed to help this family set out its actual family structure correctly in terms of its legal status. ""A birth certificate will stay with a child for life and it will be factually and legally inaccurate under current rules."" Transgender man wants to be named father The dad who gave birth.

"Sainsbury's is shutting another 60 to 70 Argos shops and moving them inside its supermarkets as part of a reorganisation. It will also close up to 15 supermarkets and 40 convenience stores. The closures are part of a plan to reduce costs by Â£500m over five years,it said,external. However Sainsbury's also plans to open around 120 new grocery outlets, mostly convenience stores. The supermarket did not say where the closures would be, but said all Argos staff would be relocated. The plans were announced as Sainsbury's warned investors profits had dipped over the last six months. It blamed bad weather and higher marketing costs for the forecast Â£50m drop on the period last year. Sainsbury's has been under pressure to show that its business is on track after the collapse of its plan to merge with Asda. Overhauling its large store estate is part of the new plan. It was clear when Sainsbury's bought Argos in 2016 that hundreds of Argos stores would be closed and relocated into Sainsbury's stores. This integration is now well underway. There are now some 290 Argos stores inside a Sainsbury's shop - half of these are relocations. Sainsbury's is keen to point out that ultimately, it'll end up with as many as 100 more shops overall, including a net loss of around five supermarkets. There's no detail today on where the openings and closures could be, nor how many roles will be affected, only that it hoped to boost operating profits by Â£20m a year through the changes. Sainsbury's is now on a mission to cut costs, some Â£500m, over the next five years. It's got a tricky balancing act ahead as it tries to cut prices to fend off the discounters and improve its profitability. The supermarket will also cease new mortgage sales as part of a plan to make its financial services division more profitable. Earlier this month, larger rival Tesco sold its entire mortgage portfolio to Halifax, exiting a very competitive market. Low interest rates have made mortgages less profitable for lenders. These moves add weight to the view that offering banking services is becoming a lower priority for the supermarkets, the BBC's personal finance reporter, Kevin Peachey said. ""The big grocery stores were often talked of being the main challengers to the established High Street banks, given customers' brand loyalty and an existing ""branch"" network,"" he said. Sainsbury's reported sales for the three months to 21 September for stores open at least a year and excluding fuel dropped 0.2%. Clothing and food sales rose, while household goods sales dropped 2%. A fall in its pension deficit means it can reduce its contributions by Â£50m a year. ""We have focused on reducing prices on every day food and grocery products and expanding our range of value brands, which have been very popular with customers,"" said Chief Executive Mike Coupe. ""At the same time, we are investing significantly in our supermarkets."" Fewer items on promotion and fewer new video game and toy releases hurt sales at Argos, he said, while Sainsbury's Tu brand of clothing performed well. Sainsbury's has been under pressure to come up with a ""plan B"" after its failed attempt to buy Asda earlier this year. It had argued the tie-up was necessary to cut costs and improve its buying power so it could reduce prices to counter the rise of the discounters. Mr Coupe told investors that Sainsbury's could thrive on its own and the reorganisation represented a continuation of his existing strategy with a ""few tweaks"" along the way. ""We're more competitive than we've ever been,"" Mr Coupe said. ""We are confident in our ability to sustainably fund investment in the customer offer."" Sainsbury's is hoping to generate an extra Â£20m a year in operating profit with the overhaul of its store estate. New convenience stores will be more targeted to what shoppers want, it said. For instance, in London and other city centre locations, outlets will have more ""food-to-go"". It also wants to open around ten larger convenience stores, containing Argos services, in more suburban locations. Sainsbury's has been cutting prices on some daily essentials as well as launching new budget brands , like J James meat, fish and poultry, as they try to match the success of Asda and Tesco's new own-brand ranges.

"Sue Petrow was due to fly home on Wednesday Thomas Cook holidaymakers and crew are free to leave Cuba, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. Repatriation flights have been arranged with the aid of the British Ambassador to Cuba, it said. Tourists had said they were prevented from leaving their hotels until they paid extra for their stay. One holidaymaker, Sue Petrow, who was due to leave, said her hotel had told her she could be held at the airport unless she paid her bill. Cabin crew from Thomas Cook had also said they were effectively being ""held hostage"" by security guards at a hotel. Live updates: Thomas Cook repatriation continues Thomas Cook collapse: Your questions answered Thomas Cook worker: 'I've been thrown under a bus' But Dame Deirdre Hutton, the chair of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), told the BBC's Today programme: ""That has been sorted out by the ambassador overnight, and the Cuban flight is in the air on its way back, which is very good news."" ""It's also an example of how we're working very closely with the Foreign Office, which is great."" ""It's very distressing for people who are finding difficulties with their accommodation, but what we've done is issue guarantees to the... hotels with Atol-protected British tourists,"" she added. The British Ambassador to Cuba said hotels had been instructed to allow customers to depart without paying additional charges.

Sue Petrow said she and other guests had refused to pay extra charges demanded by the hotel. Holidaymakers like Sue may have paid for their rooms and meals months in advance, but hotels would normally only receive the money from Thomas Cook several weeks after their stay. Reports suggested there was widespread concern in Cuba over whether the industry insurance fund Atol, which covers payments in the event of a firm failing, would foot the costs. The fund covers bills that have been run up since Thomas Cook's collapse on Monday morning. However, bills run up at hotels before Thomas Cook's collapse will not be covered. Affected hoteliers will have to apply to the liquidators for their money. Dame Deirdre said the CAA had issued guarantees for payment to 3,000 hotels around the world, and had already started making the first payments. The CAA had 200 staff working with Thomas Cook employees, she added. ""Given how much those hotels are owed by Thomas Cook, it's hardly surprising that they are suspicious and angry,"" she said. Thomas Cook owes hotels Â£338m, with one hotel in Mexico owed Â£2.5m, she added. The Insolvency Service has written to local tourist boards to make sure hotels are working with the CAA on payments, Dame Hutton said. This video can not be played A passenger raises funds for Thomas Cook staff on a flight from Turkey On Monday, the CAA launched the UK's largest peacetime repatriation operation to bring more than 150,000 people back to the UK after the collapse of the holiday firm. So far, more than 95% of people have been brought back on their original day of departure, the CAA said. On Tuesday, 70 flights brought back more than 14,000 passengers, it said. There are 70 flights scheduled on Wednesday, bringing back a further 16,500 people. The flying programme will continue until 6 October with more than 1,000 flights planned. Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA, said: ""I would like those remaining on holiday to enjoy the rest of their stay because we aim to also fly you home on the day when you were originally booked to fly with Thomas Cook, or very shortly thereafter.

"This video can not be played ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry The US Democratic Party has begun a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over allegations that he pressured a foreign power to damage a political rival. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the president ""must be held accountable"". Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the efforts a ""witch hunt"". There is strong support from House Democrats for impeachment, but the proceedings would be unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. The high-stakes move by House Speaker Ms Pelosi, prompted by allegations that Mr Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his leading political rival Joe Biden, lays the groundwork for a potentially hugely consequential confrontation between Democrats and the president ahead of the 2020 election. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Why Pelosi made her move How the impeachment process works If the inquiry moves forward, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will vote on any charges. If Democrats were to remain united, the measure would be carried - and Mr Trump would become the third president in US history to be impeached. But the proceedings would be expected to stall in the Senate, where the president's Republican party holds enough seats to prevent him from being removed from office by a two-thirds majority. Ms Pelosi did not provide any timeline for how the process might play out. Senior Democrats including Ms Pelosi had previously resisted growing calls from within the party to begin impeachment proceedings. But the party's leadership united on the issue after an intelligence whistleblower lodged a formal complaint about one or more phone calls between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Trump administration has so far refused to release the whistleblower complaint to Congress but Democrats say Mr Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Mr Zelensky agreed to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Trump's leading political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Trump has admitted discussing Joe Biden with Mr Zelensky. He has denied that he exerted pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival. On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed that military aid to Ukraine had been withheld but said he had done this to try and pressure European nations to increase their contributions to the country. Two presidents have been impeached in US history - Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. But neither were removed from office by a Senate trial. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached. For months now, Democratic leaders have been playing a semantics game. They wanted those who supported and those who opposed a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump to both think they were getting what they wanted. This strategy suggested Nancy Pelosi and others feared that heading down the path to impeachment would put moderate Democrats facing tough 2020 re-election fights at risk. That calculation has changed after the rapid drumbeat of new revelations about Mr Trump's contacts with the Ukrainian president. Now even middle-of-the road politicians are coming out in favour of impeachment proceedings. The dam has broken. The genie is out of the bottle. Pick your metaphor. The simple fact is that Ms Pelosi - a keen judge of the political mood within her caucus - has made the decision to shift from resisting impeachment to advocating for it. The path forward is uncertain. Opinion surveys could show the latest drama is taking a toll on one party or the other, causing political will to crumble. Or, both sides could dig in for a long, gruelling battle that could drag into the darkest days of winter. More from Anthony on why Ms Pelosi has made her move In a statement on Tuesday she said Mr Trump had betrayed his oath of office and committed ""a violation of the law"". She called his actions ""a breach of his constitutional responsibilities"". ""This week the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take action that would benefit him politically,"" she said, adding: ""The president must be held accountable. No-one is above the law."" This video can not be played Pelosi: ""The president must be held accountable; no one is above the law."" Mr Biden has denied wrongdoing and no evidence has emerged to back up the claims against him. He has also said he supports impeachment proceedings unless the US president complies with investigations. Impeaching Mr Trump ""would be a tragedy"", Mr Biden said. ""But a tragedy of his making."" He is the current frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election. In a series of tweets Mr Trump said Democrats ""purposely had to ruin and demean"" his trip to the UN in New York ""with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage"". ""They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!"" he added. This video can not be played Trump confirms he withheld aid to Ukraine - but insists there was no ""quid pro quo"" He promised to release a transcript of his conversation with Ukraine's president on Wednesday to show it was ""totally appropriate"".

In his response to the Democrats' move, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said: ""Speaker Pelosi happens to be the Speaker of this House, but she does not speak for America when it comes to this issue."" ""She cannot unilaterally decide we're in an impeachment inquiry,"" he added. Meanwhile, the acting director of US national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share the whistleblower report with Congress. He is due to testify before a public House intelligence committee hearing on Thursday. In a separate development, the unnamed whistleblower is seeking to meet directly with lawmakers. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff suggested in a tweet that this could happen later this week. Ms Pelosi's announcement gives an official go-ahead for lawmakers to investigate the US president's phone call with the Ukrainian leader and determine whether he committed an impeachable offence. In her announcement Ms Pelosi said the six congressional committees already investigating Mr Trump would continue their work, but now under the umbrella of a formal impeachment inquiry. What would impeachment take? If the process moves forward the House of Representatives will vote on one or more articles of impeachment. If any pass, the process would next move to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required - and where the Republicans hold sway. By Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring Commentators in Ukraine see President Volodymyr Zelensky's role in this affair as accidental, but at the same time believe it could lead to history-making consequences. Den, a daily newspaper, warns President Zelensky against taking sides in the drama unfolding in Washington. ""Ukraine is facing an unstoppable tsunami, and our president will just have to do some surfing,"" it says. Some argue that the timing could not be worse for President Zelensky, who is scheduled to meet Donald Trump in New York later on Wednesday. Public TV station Pershy describes the controversy as a ""trap"" for Ukraine. ""It would be stupid to start playing into the hands of either Democrats or Republicans,"" said one of the channel's commentators. Others contend that the Ukrainian president has US politicians over the barrel. ""Zelensky has two pistols in his hands: one pointing at Trump, and the other at Biden,"" reports Pryamy TV.
