"A word that is commonly used to describe the Scottish weather has been named the ""most iconic"" Scots word. ""Dreich"" - meaning dull or gloomy - topped a poll to mark Book Week Scotland, led by the Scottish Book Trust. It beat off contenders including ""glaikit"", ""scunnered"" and ""shoogle"". The charity said the first recorded use of the word ""dreich"" was in 1420, when it originally meant ""enduring"" or ""slow, tedious"". A total of 1,895 votes were cast in the annual poll. If you ask someone to be quiet, you might say ""wheesht"". Dreich - tedious; damp and wet glaikit - stupid or foolish scunnered - disgust or strong dislike shoogle - shake or move from side to side wheesht - call for quiet or silence fankle - to tangle or mix-up outwith - outside or beyond braw -  fine or pleasant beastie - an insect or animal bumfle - an untidy bundle It was the second time ""dreich"" had finished first in a poll after it also topped a YouGov poll in 2013 of favourite Scots words. Marc Lambert, CEO of Scottish Book Trust, said: ""We were overwhelmed by the many submissions for our iconic Scots words vote - it's certainly a subject close to people's hearts. ""Dreich is such an evocative word with the ability to sum up the Scottish weather, or mood, perfectly. ""It's also a word that is very well used here in Scotland and beyond."" Rhona Alcorn, CEO of the Scots Language Dictionary, said: ""Once again, dreich has been chosen as the most iconic Scots word, with glaikit taking the silver medal. ""Dreich has been part of the core vocabulary of Scots for hundreds of years so it is especially fitting that one of its primary meanings is 'enduring, persistent'.""

"Syria's state media released images of what they say are destroyed houses near Damascus Israel says it has hit dozens of targets in Syria belonging to the government and allied Iranian forces. The Israeli military says the ""wide-scale strikes"" responded to rockets fired by an Iranian unit into Israel. Syria says two civilians died and that Syrian air defences shot down most of the missiles over Damascus. Other reports say the death toll was higher. Local reports said loud explosions were heard in the capital. Pictures on social media showed a number of fires. Israel hits 'Iranian killer drone sites' in Syria Iran's network of influence in Mid-East 'growing' Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards On Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said it had intercepted four rockets fired from Syria towards northern Israel. It said the rockets did not hit the ground. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria since the civil war broke out in 2011. It has been trying to thwart what it calls Iran's ""military entrenchment"" there and block shipments of Iranian weapons to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement. But the latest operation was one of the broadest attacks to date, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Jerusalem. A senior Israeli security official said the Israelis had decided on a powerful retaliatory strike to signal they were ""changing the rules"" - that even a small attack from Syria would trigger an extensive response, our correspondent reports. Early on Wednesday,the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tweeted that the strikes targeted positions of Iran's Quds Force and Syria's armed forces.,external Allow Twitter content?

""During our strike of Iranian & Syrian terror targets, a Syrian air defence missile was fired despite clear warnings to refrain from such fire. As a result, a number of Syrian aerial defence batteries were destroyed,"" the IDF said. The IDF also said it held ""the Syrian regime responsible for the actions that take place in Syrian territory and warn them against allowing further attacks against Israel"". Iran's Quds Force is the external operations wing of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC). Israel did not target the Russian-made advanced S-300 surface-to-air missile systems deployed near the positions of Russian troops, Israeli media report. Russia, whose forces have helped turned the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, condemned the Israeli strikes. Moscow, whose air defence system covers most of Syria's airspace, generally does not interfere with Israeli strikes on Iranian forces and their affiliates. The leaders of Russia and Israel enjoy good relations, and the Israeli military is said to warn the Russian military before it carries out any attacks. Syria's state news agency Sana said that the country's ""air defence confronted the heavy attack and intercepted the hostile missiles"". It said that Syria destroyed ""most"" of the Israeli missiles. The news agency added that the strikes on Syrian territory were carried out from ""Lebanese and Palestinian territories"". Israel has a number of times hit targets inside Syria from war planes in Lebanese airspace.

Syria said two civilians were killed in the Israeli strikes. Meanwhile, a UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), said that 11 fighters, including seven foreigners, died. The SOHR said that the Israeli missiles hit sites in and around Damascus in Kiswa, Saasaa, Mezzeh military airport, Jdaidat Artouz, Qudsaya and Sahnaya. The Iranian authorities have so far made no public comment. The message from Israel to Tehran is clear. Any attacks out of Syria will be met by a disproportionate response. Now it is upping the military stakes. But Iran is sending a message of its own, too. Despite a long-running Israeli air campaign designed to constrain the Iranian build-up in Syria, Tehran is determined that this project will continue. It is a close ally of the Assad regime in Damascus, and it sees Syrian territory both as a frontline across which to confront Israel and as an important link to its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Quds (Jerusalem) Force answers directly to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei. It is led by Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, who is believed to be more than a mere military commander. Since the US-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003, the Quds Force has intensified its operations across the Middle East, providing training, funding and weapons to non-state groups allied to Tehran. It has also developed forms of asymmetric warfare, such as swarm tactics, drone and cyber-attacks, that have allowed Iran to undermine its enemies' superiority in conventional weapons. Gen Qasem Soleimani commands the IRGC's shadowy Quds Force In April, US President Donald Trump designated the IRGC, including the Quds Force, a ""foreign terrorist organisation"" (FTO). It was the first time the US had named a part of another government as an FTO.

"This video can not be played Jeane Freeman: ""I refute absolutely that I am careless or irresponsible on these matters."" Scotland's health secretary has apologised to the parents of two patients who died in the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow. Jeane Freeman expressed her ""deepest sympathies"" to the families of Milly Main, 10, and a three-year-old boy. The two children died three weeks apart in August 2017 at the hospital, which is part of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus. They had been treated on a ward which was affected by water contamination. On Monday, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) apologised for the distress caused to parents. The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children share a campus in the south of Glasgow In a statement to MSPs on Wednesday, Ms Freeman said: ""To lose a loved one in any circumstances is hard, but I cannot begin to imagine the pain of losing a child in these circumstances - or the suffering and grief that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. ""I also want to apologise to them that they feel they have not had their questions answered. ""They are absolutely right to ask and pursue their questions, and they are entitled to have them answered and to receive the support they need."" The five-step process to keep NHS boards in line Timeline: The trials of Scotland's super hospital Look back at Jeane Freeman's statement with Holyrood Live The children's deaths emerged after Labour MSP Anas Sarwar was contacted by a whistleblower, and the health secretary said NHS employees must have the confidence to speak up when something is wrong. Ms Freeman told MSPs: ""There is no room in our health service for anyone to criticise whistleblowers, publicly or otherwise - or to put them in fear for the safety of their jobs. ""We need to recognise that whistleblowing is not something people who have dedicated their lives to health care, do lightly. It takes courage and they should be thanked."" MSP Anas Sarwar has described the NHSGGC as ""not fit for purpose"" Ms Freeman also told parliament she has asked the head of NHS Scotland to review whether any escalation of measures for the health board is required. The five-stage NHS Board Performance Escalation Framework is the Scottish equivalent of special measures, which apply in England and Wales. Labour's Monica Lennon asked the health secretary who the parents of sick children should put their trust in. Ms Freeman replied: ""They can place trust in me. I have compassion, I have empathy, and that is why I met with those families and have undertaken the work that I have done. ""I refute absolutely from Miss Lennon, or from anyone else, that I am careless or irresponsible on these matters - it could not be further from the truth. It may suit you [Ms Lennon] to make those points for other reasons but they are not true and I refute them absolutely."" Ms Lennon, Labour's health spokeswoman, later said: ""The tragic deaths and infection scandals at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital have been cloaked in secrecy for too long. ""Families and the wider public need to have full confidence in the health board and the cabinet secretary. That's why vague answers from Jeane Freeman are sorely disappointing."" Scottish Conservatives health spokesman Miles Briggs called on Ms Freeman to resign or be sacked. He said: ""At the heart of this scandal, we must never forget, are grieving families who are completely unsatisfied and think there has been a cover-up, and who can blame them? ""The SNP planned and built this hospital, and has presided over its first few years in operation - it can't just keep pointing the finger at everyone else. As the SNP health secretary, the buck stops with Jeane Freeman."" Milly Main, ten, died at the hospital in August 2017 An independent review is examining water contamination and other problems at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus. On Tuesday Ms Freeman told MSPs on Holyrood's health committee it would publish its findings in the spring. The health secretary said she expects a separate public inquiry, which will examine safety and wellbeing issues at the QEUH and the new children's hospital in Edinburgh, will also look at water contamination. Milly Main died on 31 August while recovering from leukaemia treatment. Her mother said she was ""100%"" convinced her death was linked to water contamination issues. NHSGGC has insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. On Sunday police confirmed they had investigated the death of a three-year-old boy three weeks before Milly died. Police said they passed a report to the procurator fiscal. NHSGGC said they had fully investigated and shared their findings with the boy's family but the child's mother later described the board's media statement as ""highly inaccurate"". Last week awhistleblower revealed that a doctor-led review,externalhad identified 26 infections at RHC during 2017 which were potentially linked to contaminated water. The Â£842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital ""super hospital"" has faced a number of problems since it opened in 2015. Two cancer wards at the adjoining children's hospitalwere closed last year amid concern about infections and investigation of water supplyissues, with patients decanted to the adult hospital. In January it emerged that two patients at the QEUH had died aftercontracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings. Minister says 'trust me' over hospital concerns.

"A protester uses a torch light while crawling within a sewer tunnel to see how wide it is Some of the last protesters remaining at a besieged university in Hong Kong have tried to escape and evade police by crawling through sewers. Hundreds of protesters have already left PolyU but dozens remain inside. The campus - the scene of some of the most intense clashes witnessed during months of anti-government protests - is surrounded by police who are arresting for rioting any adults trying to leave. Six people were arrested on Wednesday for an attempted escape via the sewers. The group included two men climbing out of an underground drain and four people - three men and a woman - who had removed a manhole cover and lowered a rope into the drain to assist them, police said. ""It was complicated and dark down there, I wanted to get home as soon as possible,"" one young man who unsuccessfully attempted a sewer escape told BBC Chinese. ""But how else could we leave the PolyU campus?"" Former UK consulate worker says China tortured him Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong: 'I was tear gassed getting my lunch' The four-day campus siege at PolyU - Hong Kong Polytechnic University - has been one of the most dramatic confrontations in the wider protest movement that has paralysed the city for more than five months The protests started after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way the former British colony is administered by Beijing. PolyU is the last of five Hong Kong universities that protesters had occupied in the last 10 days. Fewer than 100 hardcore demonstrators remain on the campus after days of violent clashes with security forces. Many have surrendered to police or emerged as part of medical evacuations. More than 1,000 people have been arrested. Those under 18 were allowed to go home but had their details registered. Fire service divers searched the tunnels for any trapped protesters Several small groups of protesters seeking to avoid possibly years in prison if arrested on rioting charges have reportedly attempted a dangerous escape route through the sewers. They have descended into the tunnels armed with torches and gas masks. The fire brigade have now blocked the main entrance into the sewers within the PolyU campus to thwart such escapes. On Tuesday and Wednesday divers searched the tunnels for any protesters who might have been trapped but found none. Whether any protesters have successfully escaped via the sewers remains unclear, despite rumours on campus to the contrary. The two arrested on Wednesday made it about half a kilometre from the university when they emerged and were arrested. Bowie, a 21-year-old student who made an attempt, told Reuters news agency: ""The sewer was very smelly, with many cockroaches, many snakes. Every step was very, very painful. I'd never thought that one day I would need to hide in a sewer or escape through sewers to survive."" One protester makes a daring escape Her group spent an hour swimming in the fetid water, but when they emerged, were crushed to realise they were still within the university grounds, she said. Tunnelling out of campus is just the latest escape plan hatched by increasingly desperate protesters. On Monday, dozens slid down ropes from a bridge, fleeing on waiting motorcycles.  Police said nearly 40 of them were later arrested. How is Hong Kong run?

"This video can not be played Simon Cheng says he was blindfolded and beaten in China A former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate has told the BBC that he was tortured in China and accused of inciting political unrest in the city. Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen who worked for the UK government for almost two years, was detained for 15 days on a trip to mainland China in August. ""I was shackled, blindfolded and hooded,"" the 29-year-old tells me. UK government sources say they believe his claims - of being beaten and forced to sign confessions - are credible. Following our interview, the British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab summoned the Chinese ambassador. ""We are outraged by the disgraceful mistreatment that Mr Cheng faced when he was in detention in mainland China... and we've made clear that we expect the Chinese authorities to review and hold to account those responsible,"" Mr Raab told the BBC. But on Wednesday a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC they ""absolutely cannot accept the UK government's interference in this case"" - and would in return summon the UK ambassador to ""express their opposition and anger"". ""We hope the UK will be prudent and stop interfering in Hong Kong and in China's domestic affairs because it will, eventually, only harm the UK's own interests,"" the spokesperson added. Mr Cheng says he spent his free time gathering information about Hong Kong's protests, at the urging of the British Consulate Mr Cheng's raises questions for both the Chinese and the UK governments. The claims he makes - including that he saw other Hongkongers in Chinese custody - are likely to fuel protesters' fears that their city's freedoms are being eroded under Chinese rule. ""They said they work for the secret service and that there are no human rights,"" he tells me. ""Then they started the torture."" As a trade and investment officer at the UK consulate, Simon Cheng's particular brief was to drum up interest in investing in Scotland among the Chinese business community. It required him to travel frequently to mainland China. But in June, with Hong Kong engulfed in mass demonstrations, Mr Cheng volunteered for an additional role. ""The British Consulate instructed staff to collect information about the status of the protests,"" he says. As a supporter of the pro-democracy movement he found it easy to blend in and, with the consent of the consulate, he signed up to some of the social media groups through which the protesters co-ordinated their actions. Paid overtime for the information he gathered, he began reporting back what he saw to his colleagues. His task, both Mr Cheng and UK government sources insist, was not to direct events in any way but to purely observe - the kind of civil society monitoring work many embassies do. Mr Cheng says he was paid overtime to gather information on Hong Kong's protests But China had already begun to accuse the UK of meddling in Hong Kong, with British politicians becoming increasing vocal in their support for the protesters. On 8 August, with emails still on his phone linking him to that work observing the protests, he was sent by the consulate to a business conference in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. He didn't know it, but his life was about to change forever. Although China has ruled Hong Kong for more than 20 years, the border between the city and the mainland still looks and feels like an international boundary. The ""one country two systems"" principle - that the protesters say they are fighting to preserve - is meant to ensure that Hong Kong retains control over most of its affairs, including its borders. But Simon Cheng was about to discover for himself the blurred edges of that legal and political framework. Since the opening of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen high-speed rail link last year, a new border post has been placed inside West Kowloon station, in the heart of Hong Kong. The West Kowloon railway station, where Mr Cheng was first detained, has also seen protests It is deeply controversial: Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement views the presence of the Chinese police, manning the Chinese side, as an unwelcome extension of Chinese authority. It was here they stopped Simon Cheng, returning from his business trip. He was put on a train, transported back to Shenzhen and handed over, he says, to three plainclothes officers from China's National Security Police. Raising his arms above his head Mr Cheng shows me how he was hung up from the chain linking the handcuffs on his wrists. The questions focused on his involvement in the protests with the aim, he says, of forcing him to confess to fomenting unrest on behalf of the British state. ""They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests - they asked what support, money and equipment we were giving to the protesters."" The detention centre where Mr Cheng alleges he was held He says he was made to hold stress positions - squatting against a wall for example - for hours on end, and beaten if he moved. ""They would beat the bony parts, like my ankles... or any vulnerable part."" He claims he was subjected to sleep deprivation, with his interrogators forcing him to sing the Chinese national anthem to keep himself awake. And, he believes, he was not the only Hongkonger undergoing such treatment. ""I saw a bunch of Hong Kong people getting arrested and interrogated. I heard someone speak in Cantonese saying: 'Raise your hands up - you raised the flags in the protest didn't you?'"" Summaryof theprotests in 100 or 500 words Timelineofmajor events so far How is Hong Kong runand what is the Basic Law? Watch: The identity crisis behind the protests Avisual guideto how one peaceful protest turned violent From a large pile of more than 1,000 photographs of Hong Kong protesters, he says, he was told to jot down the names and political affiliations of anyone he recognised. ""The secret police clearly stated that batches after batches of Hong Kong protesters had been caught, delivered and detained in mainland China."" Strapped to a chair and held by his hair, he says they tried to force him to open his mobile phone using the facial recognition function. Once they'd gained access, they printed off the emails detailing the information he'd passed to the UK consulate about the protests. ""I told them I want to make it 100% clear, the UK didn't assign resources or help with the protests,"" he tells me. But it was no use. Eventually, they made him record two video confessions, he says, one for the ""betrayal of the motherland"" and another for ""soliciting prostitution"". The detention of a local employee of a foreign embassy or consulate is a relatively rare event. The last high-profile case involving the UK was the arrest in 2009 of a number of Iranian employees at the British embassy in Tehran. They were accused of playing a significant role in that year's violent demonstrations - an accusation that finds echoes in Simon Cheng's account. Mr Cheng, pictured during a BBC interview, says he was forced into stress positions by China's National Security Police As in his own case, locally-employed staff usually have no diplomatic protection, potentially making them soft targets for intelligence gathering. But Mr Cheng may have been targeted for other reasons. He tells me he had a mainland Chinese friend who'd been arrested for taking part in the Hong Kong protests and was now on bail there. During his business trip to Shenzhen, without the knowledge of the UK consulate, Mr Cheng had met the relatives of this friend to collect money for his living expenses. Any mainlander known to have joined the pro-democracy demonstrations would be at risk of being placed under Chinese surveillance. Although collecting money for a friend in legal difficulty is unlikely to constitute a crime, even in China, it could well have placed Mr Cheng under suspicion too. I ask him what he thinks is the most likely reason for his detention - his position at the UK consulate, or his friendship with this mainland Chinese protester? ""Until now I have no idea,"" he replies. ""But I think both factors could be part of the reason."" Alongside our interview, Mr Cheng haspublished his own detailed account,externalof what happened to him. In it, he says that on the 11th day of his detention his treatment suddenly improved, a date that he says coincides with the first international media reports about his disappearance. UK government sources say that, behind the scenes, intense diplomatic activity was already under way to try to secure his release. Of China's only public version of events - the allegation that he was placed in 15 days administrative detention for soliciting prostitution - Mr Cheng is dismissive. ""It was a tactic for secretly and arbitrarily incarcerating me for an even longer period, without interference from third parties."" The detention prompted a public outcry and considerable media coverage In China, administrative detention is a penalty that can be imposed by the police, acting with no judicial oversight. And, he suggests, the circumstances of his arrest appear unusual. Allegations of soliciting prostitution are normally dealt with in China as a routine matter by the local police. They are far less likely to be the concern of the Chinese border authorities in West Kowloon station. Mr Cheng's written statement also mentions that, before his arrest, he stopped in Shenzhen for a massage. I ask him directly if he paid for sex. ""I don't want to focus on the question of whether I solicited a prostitute, because that's exactly what they want,"" he replies. ""So, I just want to state clearly that I did nothing regrettable to the people I cherish and love."" Whatever the reasons behind the decision to release him, he says it came with a warning. ""They stated that if I receive media interviews and speak out [about] anything other than 'soliciting prostitution' publicly, I will be taken back to mainland China from Hong Kong."" The UK's Hong Kong consulate has since reviewed, and tightened up, its guidelines for local staff travelling on work trips to the Chinese mainland. Simon Cheng has told the BBC that he believes it is too dangerous for him to return to Hong Kong. Initially, he was so concerned about his safety, he refused to allow the UK government to issue a statement condemning the way he'd been treated. 'I was tear gassed getting my lunch' 'Why we stormed the parliament' Picture power: portraits of Hong Kong protesters 'I can't say I love China anymore' He was also given little choice but to resign because the UK government now sees him as a security risk following his long interrogation at the hands of the Chinese secret police. But UK sources say he has been provided with support, including a two-year working visa for the UK. ""Our hearts are with Simon Cheng and his family,"" Dominic Raab, the British Foreign Secretary, told the BBC. ""From the outset my overriding concern has been to make sure that he's taken care of properly and he gets the support that he needs."" Mr Cheng believes it is too dangerous for him to go back to Hong Kong, and says he is seeking asylum But Mr Cheng's written statement suggests he does not see the protection he's being offered as adequate and, he says, he's now seeking asylum anywhere he can feel safe. While he faces an uncertain future, the political and diplomatic ramifications of his extraordinary testimony are likely to be significant. The claims he makes will feed into the already frayed relations between the UK and China over the subject of Hong Kong. China will face questions about the use of torture in its headlong search for proof of foreign interference. The British government will face questions about whether it could have done more to protect Mr Cheng as well as its treatment of him since.

"Amy Dalla Mura repeatedly called Anna Soubry a traitor and interrupted interviews An election candidate standing in the same seat as Anna Soubry has been found guilty of harassing her and banned from campaigning in the constituency. English Democrat candidate Amy Dalla Mura is standing in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, which Ms Soubry has represented since 2010. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the defendant repeatedly targeted the Independent Group for Change candidate and called her a traitor on television. She will be sentenced on 16 December. Mrs Soubry has represented Broxtowe since 2010 The court heard Dalla Mura, from Hove, attended an event in Parliament on 23 January where Ms Soubry was speaking, repeatedly interrupting her and live streaming the event on her phone. The meeting was eventually abandoned when she refused to stop. The court was also told Dalla Mura approached Ms Soubry in Parliament's Central Lobby while she was appearing on BBC Newsnight on 14 March, calling her a ""traitor"" while again filming her. Passing the verdict, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot described Dalla Mura's behaviour as ""oppressive and unacceptable"", with conduct ""driven by anger at Ms Soubry's political views on Brexit"". She said it had also ""caused harassment in the sense of alarm and distress"". The 56-year-old will be sentenced four days after the election but will still be allowed to stand. However, as a condition of bail, she cannot enter Broxtowe and has been banned from contacting or mentioning Ms Soubry on social media.

"Joseph McCann is accused of tying up a mother with electrical cable and assaulting her children A mother was tied up while her children were abused by a knife-wielding sex attacker who threatened to slit her throat, a court has heard. Joseph McCann is accused of tricking his way into the woman's Lancashire home after a night out. He used electrical cable to tie her up before assaulting her daughter, 17, and 11-year-old son, the Old Bailey was told. Mr McCann, 34, from Harrow, denies 37 offences against 11 victims. Jurors have heard the mother tried to comfort her son after the three of them managed to escape, telling him: ""It's OK, son. We are alive."" She described her ordeal on 5 May in a police interview played during the trial. ""I have come back in a taxi where this fella has said 'I will come with you to make sure you get home OK',"" she said. This video can not be played Mr McCann was allegedly captured on CCTV at a petrol station Mr McCann later produced a knife as he ordered the woman to lie down in her son's bedroom, forcing the children into another bedroom, the jury was told. ""He tied my legs together and then he turned me back over again but he kept coming in saying 'you watch, or say anything, I will slit your throat,"" the woman continued. ""I said 'are you going to kill us all' and he said 'shut up'."" She described hearing Mr McCann tell her son to lie down on the floor and not to look at him. ""It was like I was in and out of consciousness,"" she said, adding: ""I don't know if it was fright. ""I was trying to get out but I thought if he sees me he would kill me. He had my children in the bedroom."" CCTV images allegedly show Joseph McCann at the Phoenix Lodge Hotel in Watford on 25 April The court was told Mr McCann checked on her three or four times during the ordeal. The woman said her son later ran downstairs, grabbed their attacker's discarded knife and used it to cut her free, saying: ""Mummy, let's go out the back door."" She continued: ""I said 'hold onto me'. I said 'run like you never ran before and you get out'."" During cross-examining, Jo Sidhu QC suggested the woman had been tied up because she tried to attack Mr McCann with a kitchen knife when he was in a bedroom with her daughter. ""It was obvious he was tying you up in order to stop you from being violent towards him because you were out of control,"" he said. The witness replied: ""I disagree with all of that.""

"Boris Johnson aims to change National Insurance rules so workers will not have to pay it until they earn Â£12,500. The Tory leader earlier said his party would put up the threshold to ensure ""low tax for working people"" if it wins the general election. But he later confirmed to the BBC it would be raised to Â£9,500 in the first budget of a Tory government, with no timetable for the additional Â£3,000. Labour said the reduced revenue would harm public services. The current threshold sees workers paying National Insurance contributions once they earn earn Â£166 a week, equivalent to an annual salary of Â£8,632 a year. Mr Johnson had promised to raise the threshold to Â£12,500 during the Tory leadership contest. What else is Johnson planning to spend on? Has Johnson got his NI numbers confused? Lib Dems vow Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit What is Labour's four-day working week plan? He told the BBC this was now an ""ambition"" of his government and a timeframe would be announcement at their first budget if they are elected. But the PM said bringing in the Â£9,500 threshold sooner would ""help with the cost of living"" and ""put Â£500 in the pocket of everybody"" - although a later press release claimed the saving would be around Â£100 per person. Both figures are still higher than the estimate of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who said the threshold would save workers about Â£85 per year and cost the government Â£2bn. An earlier estimate by the independent economic think tank said a rise to Â£12,500 - which would match the threshold where workers start paying income tax - would save workers up to Â£465 a year, and cost the government Â£11bn. But Xiaowei Xu, a research economist with the IFS, said without knowing the proposed timescale of the increase ""we do not know how big a policy this is"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he wants to ""help people with the cost of living"" On a visit to an engineering plant in Teesside, Mr Johnson was asked by one of the workers whether his pledges for low tax were ""for people like you... or people like us"". The PM said: ""I mean low tax for people... working people. ""We are going to be cutting national insurance up to Â£12,000 [and] we are going to be making sure that we cut business rates for small businesses. We are cutting tax for working people."" BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said it sounded like Mr Johnson had accidentally revealed his big election tax pledge. He later had to correct the figures in an interview with the BBC, revising it to a Â£9,500 threshold next year, with an eventual goal of Â£12,500. Mr Johnson said: ""We want to operate in a prudent way, but we do want to help now with the cost of living while simultaneously having the funds we need to invest into the NHS, police officers and education as well."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell criticised the cost to tax payers, quoting the IFS' Â£11bn figure. ""Even after 10 years of cruel cuts and despite creaking public services, the Tories still think the answer to the challenges of our time is a tax cut of Â£1.64 a week, with those on Universal Credit getting about 60p,"" he said. ""Meanwhile independent experts have said this will cost up to Â£11bn, so everyone who relies on public services and social security will be wondering whether they will be paying the price."" The SNP's Drew Hendry also attacked the policy, saying if the Conservatives ""really wanted to help people on low incomes"" then they would ""fix and stop the rollout"" of Universal Credit. He said raising the threshold would benefit the ""better-off first, and even more than those people on low incomes"". The IFS also said that a rise in the threshold was ""an extremely blunt instrument"" if the intention was to help lower paid workers. ""Less than 10% of the total gains from raising [National Insurance contributions] thresholds accrue to the poorest fifth of working households,"" they said. ""The government could target low-earning families much more effectively by raising in-work benefits, which would deliver far higher benefits to the lowest-paid for a fraction of the cost"". National Insurance is a tax paid by workers and the self-employed who are over 16, with the amount varying depending on how much you earn. Employers do make some contributions on behalf of their workers, but it again depends on how much they are paid. For employees, it is taken straight out of your salary before you receive it, while self-employed people need to pay as part of their self-assessment. By paying the tax, you are entitled to a number of benefits, such as a state pension, Jobseeker's Allowance and maternity pay. The contributions cover these benefits, with some also going towards the NHS. The Liberal Democrats announced in their manifesto earlier that they plan to review the tax and National Insurance status of employees, dependent contractors and freelancers ""to ensure fair and comparable treatment"" and to ""modernise rights to make them fit for the age of the gig economy"". The Green Party also pledged in their manifesto - launched earlier this week - that they wanted to merge employees' National Insurance, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, dividend tax and income tax into a single consolidated income tax, claiming it would ""close loopholes"" and bring in an additional Â£20bn to the public purse. Labour has yet to publish its manifesto, but in an announcement about its plans for the ""Living Wage"" earlier this month, the party pledged not to raise income tax or National Insurance contributions for the bottom 95% of earners. The SNP says on its website it would oppose any increases in National Insurance. Plaid Cymru are calling for an increase to National Insurance contributions for higher rate and additional rate taxpayers, while offering special exemptions for employers in rural and industrial areas with high unemployment.

"This video can not be played Labour's Angela Rayner on the party's plan to build 100,000 council houses a year by 2024 Labour and the Conservatives have set out rival plans to tackle England's housing shortage. Jeremy Corbyn promised the biggest affordable house building programme since the 1960s, including 100,000 new council houses a year by 2024. Boris Johnson announced measures to help first-time buyers and boost private house building, promising a million homes over the next five years. The announcements came ahead of Labour's manifesto launchon Thursday. Labour's Angela Rayner said the state was going to take ""more direct control"" of housing adding that ""the market hasn't delivered"". ""Many families are in sub-standard accommodation, paying huge amounts of money for it,"" she said. Promising to protect the green belt, she said the houses would be built on brownfield sites and unused public sector land. Asked about his party's policy, Mr Johnson said those renting would be helped ""to get the high-value mortgage they may need to buy the home"". ""We believe in home ownership. We think it's the right way forward,"" he said. LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Who should I vote for? Election policy guide Election translator: Key words explained Labour says its Â£75bn plans will be paid for using half of its Â£150bn Social Transformation Fund - a pot it says it will use to ""repair the social fabric"" in the country if it wins a majority in 12 December's general election. Homes would be built and run by local authorities, and paid for out of the public purse - with rent returning to the councils. This video can not be played Liz Truss seems unsure about how many starter homes had been built by her party Labour also promised 50,000 ""genuinely affordable homes"" a year to be offered through Housing Associations - scrapping the current definition of ""affordable"" and replacing it with one linked to local incomes. Housing Associations are not-for-profit organisations which put any money made through rent back into the maintenance and building of new houses, and can be subsidised by the government. Homes run by these groups fall under the umbrella term of ""social housing"", along with council homes. Labour says its plan will be the biggest council and social housing programme in decades - a repeat of the pledge it made at the 2017 general election. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote Housing charity Shelter welcomed the Labour proposals, with chief executive Polly Neate saying it ""would be transformational for housing in this country"". But Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said, if carried out quickly, Labour's policies might ""risk... cannibalising what's going in the private sector"". Labour is promising to be building a very large number of homes in England in five years. In 2017, it promised 100,000 council or housing association homes a year. Now it's 150,000 between them. You have to go back over 40 years to find more than 100,000 council homes being built in a year, while housing associations have never managed to build as many as 50,000 homes in a year. It has been unusual recently to see 150,000 new homes being built in a year by anybody, let alone just by local authorities and housing associations. There has already been talk of skills shortages in the construction sector, so there is going to have to be a great deal of training or a lot of construction workers being attracted from overseas if this target is going to be met. The Conservatives have announced a number of policies alongside their million homes pledge, which includes an overhaul of the planning system. The party says it would not use public money to build the houses, but pursue policies that it believes will encourage the private sector to build more. It is promising to introduce a new mortgage with long-term fixed rates, requiring only a 5% deposit, to help renters buy their first homes. And it says it will create a scheme where first-time buyers will be able to get a 30% discount on new homes in their area. ""The Conservatives have always been the party of homeownership, but under a Conservative majority government in 2020 we can and will do even more to ensure everyone can get on and realise their dream of owning their home,"" said Mr Johnson. ""At the moment renting a property can also be an uncertain and unsettling business, and the costs of deposits make it harder to move. We are going to fix that."" BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said the relaxing of affordability rules for mortgage borrowers could be controversial. The Bank of Englandconsidered when it might be appropriate,externalto relax this recently and concluded it should only do so if first-time buyers were being deterred by prices rising faster than they are now. So a strategy of less cautious lending could put the government on a collision course with the Bank of England, added our correspondent. On Wednesday,the Liberal Democrats launched their manifesto, promising to build 300,000 homes a year by 2024, including 100,000 social homes. The Green Party also announced in their manifestothat it wants to build an extra 100,000 council houses a year. Do you have any questions about the election?

"This video can not be played The big names who had a bad day at the hearing A top US diplomat has told an impeachment inquiry that he followed President Donald Trump's orders to put pressure on Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. The instruction came from Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Ambassador Gordon Sondland said. The inquiry is assessing if Mr Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as a precondition. He denies any wrongdoing. It is illegal in the US to seek foreign help to gain electoral advantage. Mr Biden is one of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. Mr Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, told the latest hearing in the US House of Representatives that Mr Giuliani had sought a public statement from Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, announcing an inquiry into ""corruption issues"". Mr Giuliani specifically mentioned the company Burisma - which had the son of Democratic presidential candidate Mr Biden, Hunter, as a board member - and issues surrounding the 2016 US presidential election, he said. Sondland's testimony and reaction Five key moments from impeachment hearing Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? Why Ukraine is so important to the US If found guilty in a majority vote in the House, the Republican president will face an impeachment trial in the Senate. But two-thirds of members of that Republican-controlled chamber would then need to vote for Mr Trump to be removed from office. In his opening statement, he said he had worked with Mr Giuliani ""at the express direction of the president"". While he is the US ambassador to the EU, Mr Sondland said his brief included work on Ukraine alongside other colleagues - despite that country not being an EU member. ""We did not want to work with Mr Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president's orders,"" he added. He then confirmed the president had sought an investigation in exchange for a White House visit for Mr Zelensky - a quid pro quo (a favour in return for a favour). ""I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes."" This video can not be played EU ambassador Gordon Sondland testifies that Trump's personal lawyer ""requests were a quid pro quo"" However, Mr Sondland also said he had never directly heard from the president that military aid would be released in exchange for such an inquiry. The US diplomat said he was ""adamantly opposed"" to the suspension of military aid to Ukraine, and was never told why it was withheld. A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story The impeachment story explained But he came to believe it was linked to Ukraine announcing corruption investigations. Mr Sondland said he had later told an aide to the Ukrainian president: ""I believed that the resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks."" This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump Moreover, the ambassador insisted that this was not a secret plan, as some critics have suggested, instead arguing it was transparent and that his superiors were ""fully supportive"". Mr Sondland said the leaders of the state department, National Security Council and White House had been informed, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He does not remember any objections from his superiors to the policy. The ambassador said he had even discussed the fact military aid had been withheld with Vice President Mike Pence on a visit to Warsaw in September. The chief of staff for Mr Pence has denied the vice president ever spoke to Mr Sondland ""about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations"". Similarly, a spokesman for the state department said Mr Sondland had ""never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the President was linking aid to investigations of political opponents. Any suggestion to the contrary is flat out false"". This video can not be played ""I want nothing"" - Trump re-enacts Sondland call Mr Sondland, a wealthy hotelier, donated to Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign and was appointed to his position by the president in July 2018. Mr Trump has already responded to the testimony. Brandishing a copy of Mr Sondland's opening statement on the White House South Lawn, he read out a transcript of a phone conversation the pair had, in which the president said: ""I want nothing. That's what I want from Ukraine."" He also told reporters he did not know the EU ambassador ""very well"", but said he seemed ""like a nice guy"". Mr Giuliani has also denied Mr Sondland's testimony, tweeting he had ""never met him and had very few calls with him"". With his opening statement to the House impeachment hearings on Wednesday, Gordon Sondland fired a torpedo that has blown a hole in the White House's defences. Water is rushing in, and it's now a question of whether the Trump presidency can be saved before it disappears beneath the waves. Mr Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, was working with Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukrainian policy at the explicit direction of the president. There was a quid pro quo. A White House visit for President Zelensky was conditional on opening investigations that could help the president politically. Mr Sondland also came to believe that US military aid to Ukraine was being held up for this reason. Everyone at the White House - acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former National Security Adviser John Bolton and others - was ""in the loop"". The word ""bombshell"" gets thrown around a lot these days, but Mr Sondland's testimony,  which represents a shift from his earlier closed-door statements, is a watershed moment in these impeachment investigations. Read more from Anthony Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence Laura Cooper and Undersecretary of State David Hale testified later on Wednesday. Ms Cooper told the lawmakers that as early as 25 July - the day President Trump had his phone call with President Zelensky - she had received expressions of concern about the aid from the Ukrainian embassy. ""The Ukrainian embassy staff asked - what is going on with Ukrainian security assistance?"" She added that the embassy staff had raised similar concerns with the state department. David Hale and Laura Cooper testified late on Wednesday Mr Hale said that in March he had been ""concerned"" by a campaign of attacks in Ukraine against then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and had felt she needed a statement of support from the state department. He told the hearing he had immediately briefed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the issue, but Mr Pompeo ""did not issue a statement at that time"". In May Ms Yovanovitch was recalled by President Trump, who called her ""bad news"" in his controversial phone call.

"This video can not be played Lib Dems want to stop Boris Johnson winning a majority, says Davey The Lib Dems' deputy leader says the party can stop Boris Johnson from winning the general election ""and through that we can stop Brexit"". Sir Ed Davey told the BBC the most likely outcome on 12 December was a ""minority Tory government"". He suggested the Lib Dems would support them, along with other parties, if they agreed to another EU referendum. The party launched its election manifesto earlier with a pledge to stop Brexit which they say would save Â£50bn. If the party wins the general election outright, it says it would revoke Article 50, halting Brexit and keeping the UK in the European Union. If it does not win, it will continue campaigning for another EU referendum, or ""People's Vote"". Sir Ed told the BBC's Andrew Neil Show the party wants to stop the Conservatives getting a majority at the election and then use whatever leverage they have to push for another referendum. Live: Debate reaction and Lib Dem manifesto Islam: Lib Dems are banking on taxation with a purpose Lib Dems promise 20,000 more teachers A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats ""The most likely result I think, looking at the figures, is probably a minority Tory government,"" said Sir Ed. ""If it's a minority Tory government, Boris Johnson says he wants to deliver Brexitâ¦ The only way he could do that is with a People's Vote and so we will challenge him and we will work with others to say 'if you want to do what you said, Mr Johnsonâ¦ if you want to do what you said, work for a People's Vote."" He added: ""We can stop Boris Johnson getting a majority and through that we can stop Brexit."" Sources inside the party concede now that after the withdrawal of the Brexit Party in Conservative seats, what might have been a wildly unpredictable four-way race, has moved to a scrappy national two-way - with the SNP separately dominant in Scotland, and the third smaller UK-wide party eagerly trying to nibble at the margins to get in. With Labour yet to make any big breakthrough in the campaign, the Lib Dems claim they are the ones who can nab seats from the Conservatives. So Lib Dem votes in marginal seats are the ones that could prevent Johnson from a clear run at five years in office. The party's private hopes a few weeks ago of a massive increase in the number of seats has slipped a lot. Read Laura's full blog This video can not be played Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is pressed on whether she'd block a Tory or Labour government Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has repeatedly insisted that she is aiming to be the prime minister of a Liberal Democrat government after 12 December's election - but she admitted in a BBC interview that it would be a ""big step"", given the current opinion polls. She told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg her MPs would not actively support a Labour or Tory programme of government as she believes neither Jeremy Corbyn nor Boris Johnson are fit to be prime minister. But she did not rule out allowing either of them to take office - by abstaining in a vote on their first Queen's Speech - if they agreed to hold another EU referendum. She also suggested there could be a ""government of national unity"" - made up of senior figures from different parties - if there was no overall winner at the polls. ""It's certainly something which I put forward and suggested a few months ago, it wasn't something which there was a majority for, ultimately, in the previous Parliament, but we don't know what the arithmetic of the next Parliament will look like. ""And I just don't think that we should be sort of trapped by convention into thinking our politics has to go down the tramlines that we've assumed it would in the past because this is a time of change in politics."" She said people needed to be ""more imaginative about what happens"" after an election, suggesting that there were MPs in other parties that the Lib Dems could work with. At her party's manifesto launch, Ms Swinson said the economic boost the UK would get from staying in the EU was at the heart of her plan to build a ""brighter future for people"". The so-called Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra cash for schools and support for the low-paid. She said the UK ""deserved better"" than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. The largest single spending commitmentin the Lib Dems' 96-page manifesto,external, launched at an event in north London, is a major expansion of free childcare, to be paid for by an increase in corporation tax and changes to capital gains allowances on the sale of assets. There are also eye-catching pledges to freeze the cost of many rail fares for five years, to legalise and tax cannabis sales to over-18s and to charge those taking frequent international flights more. The Lib Dems are hoping to significantly boost their presence in Parliament on the back of their opposition to Brexit, as they target pro-Remain seats in the south of England and London held by the Conservatives and Labour. Speaking at her manifesto launch, she accused Boris Johnson of ""lying"" when he said a Tory victory on 12 December would ""get Brexit done"". What lay ahead instead, she said, were ""years and years of endless trade negotiations"" with the EU and ""more time and energy wasted in getting something we know will not be as good as what we have now"".

"Amy Dalla Mura repeatedly called Anna Soubry a traitor and interrupted interviews An election candidate standing in the same seat as Anna Soubry has been found guilty of harassing her and banned from campaigning in the constituency. English Democrat candidate Amy Dalla Mura is standing in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, which Ms Soubry has represented since 2010. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the defendant repeatedly targeted the Independent Group for Change candidate and called her a traitor on television. She will be sentenced on 16 December. Mrs Soubry has represented Broxtowe since 2010 The court heard Dalla Mura, from Hove, attended an event in Parliament on 23 January where Ms Soubry was speaking, repeatedly interrupting her and live streaming the event on her phone. The meeting was eventually abandoned when she refused to stop. The court was also told Dalla Mura approached Ms Soubry in Parliament's Central Lobby while she was appearing on BBC Newsnight on 14 March, calling her a ""traitor"" while again filming her. Passing the verdict, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot described Dalla Mura's behaviour as ""oppressive and unacceptable"", with conduct ""driven by anger at Ms Soubry's political views on Brexit"". She said it had also ""caused harassment in the sense of alarm and distress"". The 56-year-old will be sentenced four days after the election but will still be allowed to stand. However, as a condition of bail, she cannot enter Broxtowe and has been banned from contacting or mentioning Ms Soubry on social media.

"Disciplined England dig in to build solid platform after winning toss Stokes - dropped on 63 by Taylor at slip - ends unbeaten on 67 Denly (74) & Burns (52) make patient half-centuries All four batsmen to fall caught behind the wicket Callum Matthews, Jack Skelton and Amy Lofthouse Right, that's us done for day one. England's day or honours even? Either way Joe Root's side have a promising platform. You can read Amy Lofthouse's report on the day's actionhere. The latest Test Match Special podcast will be available to download in the next few hours overhere. You can scroll back through this page for the best quotes and reaction while we'll have the latest Jonathan Agnew column on the website later today. Thanks for joining us, see you at 21:30 GMT! BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra You can listen to commentary of the final session from the Gabba where Australia are facing Pakistan from 6am overhere. Pakistan have had a slight recovery and are currently 175-6. Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special England will fancy their chances. I don't think the wicket is going to change, it looks good for batting. England have a left-hand, right-hand combination at the crease and it's not a brand new ball. England will be aiming at 400. Trent Boult:0-61 off 22 overs Tim Southee:1-46 off 21 overs Colin de Grandhomme:2-28 off 19 overs Neil Wagner:1-77 off 23 overs Mitchell Santner:0-24 off five overs Steven FinnEngland bowler on BBC Test Match Special The first 10 overs tomorow will be really crucial. If New Zealand get two or three wickets they have a real foothold. Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special New Zealand's bowlers are very good at bowling to their field and England's top order were perhaps a little bit conservative in their approach at the crease. They were focused for setting a platform for the rest of the team. Only four down at the end of the day means England will be well pleased with their work. Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope shared an unbeaten 38 in the final eight overs of the day as England continued to build a promising platform. Stokes hit 16 off one Trent Boult over - where he was also dropped at slip by Ross Taylor - as he brought up his 20th Test half-century. Pope finished the day on 18 off 23 deliveries and looked busy and proactive during 33-minute innings. Joe Denly reached his fifth Test half-century as he shared 83 with Ben Stokes. The pair upped the ante after tea as both took a particular liking to the left-arm spin of Mitchell Santner. Denly eventually fell for 74 as he edged a good delivery from Tim Southee through to the diving BJ Watling behind the stumps. Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root didn't look balanced today. He lacked fluency and his usual intent. That brought Joe Root to the crease and he didn't look at all comfortable. Normally so proactive, it took him 21 balls to get off the mark. The very next ball he guided a catch - almost like you would in catching practice - to Tim Southee at second slip. It was a strange dismissal and a strange innings from England's captain. Steven FinnEngland bowler on BBC Test Match Special Burns, Sibley and Denly allowed England to get a foothold into the game. Root downwards are fluent players so having that platform at the top of the order is very important. A 52-run opening stand was a promising start for England and it was built upon by Rory Burns and Joe Denly who helped them to 113-1 before Burns feathered a thin edge off Colin de Grandhomme behind to fall for 52. Joe Root won the toss and elected to bat first giving debutant Dom Sibley an early opportunity at Test match cricket. He got off to the perfect start as he clipped his first ball through mid-wicket for four. The Warwickshire opener played a couple more lovely shots through the leg side before eventually falling for 22. Sibley was trying to work the ball to leg but got a leading edge off Colin de Grandhomme to slip. It was a promising start to Test cricket for the 24-year-old but it did also highlight a potential technical flaw in his game because the ball that dismissed him should have been hit through the off side. Let's have a recap of the day's action... England batsman Rory Burns on Test Match Special:""It was a tough day but a good day. ""It looked like a good wicket - it was a bit slower than I thought it would be and that made the cricket a bit attritional. ""Me and Sibley are going to be a bit more traditional at the top of the innings. It didn't really feel different for me personally - I always go about my batting that way, see off the good balls, pick off the bad ones. ""I don't think there were any nerves for Dom - and if there were any, they were gone after his first ball, a lovely shot for four. ""I was nowhere near my fluent best but managed to stick in and grit it out. I'm disappointed to only get a 50 and not a big one. ""The bounce might get a bit lower. It was a bit inconsistent earlier in the day. It's going to be hard work."" Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special These players have been away from this format for a few weeks. England will be reasonably happy with their day. The two openers negotiated the first hour very competently. The late flurry, with Ollie Pope looking in particularly good touch, was nice to see. Steven FinnEngland bowler on BBC Test Match Special It felt an even day. Both teams were sussing each other out in the morning session. There was not much for the England batsmen to capitalise on from New Zealand's bowlers. But England earned the right to score runs off tired bowlers later in the day. A lot has been made about England's approach to Test cricket in the last year or so and in the build-up to this Test Chris Silverwood and Joe Root have admitted they'll look to approach it differently and play a more patient style. Today was our first viewing of the style and while 241-4 is a promising position for England, there were 21 maidens. While a more conservative approach was needed, it's important England don't retreat too much. They've got to be proactive and look to rotate the strike more than they did today. It felt like they were a bit reserved at the crease at times today. #bbccricket Charlie:It's weird nowadays when you can describe a day of Test match cricket as ""a proper day of Test match cricket"". New Zealand bowler Neil Wagner on Test Match Special:""I thought we bowled pretty well and England batted well. A tough day. ""We played a first-class game here a couple of weeks ago and it was a similar pitch. With the wind the wicket can dry out a touch. But the bowlers stuck to it pretty well, we kept charging in but England batted really well. ""The ball was swinging still and continued throughout the day but when we put it in the right area, they were patient and when we got it wrong, they put it away. ""But they haven't run away from us and if we get a couple of early wickets tomorrow we're right back in it."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Swinson acknowledged her party was being squeezed in the opinion polls and it would be a ""big step"" for them to win the most seats on 12 December. If the Lib Dems - which had 20 MPs at the end of the last Parliament - win a majority, they will cancel Brexit entirely by revoking the Article 50 process for leaving the EU. If not, they have said they will push for another referendum. Ms Swinson insisted her party would not actively help either the Tory or Labour leaders into power as neither offered a ""route"" to stopping Brexit. But she refused to say whether she would actually block them from taking office and would not rule out talking to other parties about forming a government of national unity if no single party won a majority. ""We should not be trapped by convention to think politics should go down the tramlines that we have assumed it would in the past because this is a time of huge change in politics."" The party says the UK will reap a massive economic dividend from staying in the EU, claiming the economy will be 1.9% larger by 2024-5 than it would otherwise be if the UK leaves on the basis of Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote Maintaining the UK's membership would boost economic growth and generate Â£50bn in total additional tax receipts over the next five years. The forecast, which the party says is conservative, takes into account savings from the UK not paying the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" and also the cost of continued UK budget payments to the EU. Education will be the main beneficiary, with Â£10.5bn earmarked for teacher recruitment and increased money for schools in England. Per-pupil funding will be returned to 2015 levels, the last year the Lib Dems were in government with the Conservatives. Key policies explained Who should I vote for? Election policy guide The ""Remain bonus"" will also be used to fund changes to benefits designed to tackle in-work poverty. Cuts to work allowances for families on Universal Credit will be reversed while there will be additional support for families with two earners. Ms Swinson said any form of Brexit would damage the UK's economic prospects and ""starve"" the public services of investment. ""Labour and the Conservatives can't offer the country a brighter future because they both want Brexit. We know that will be bad for our economy, bad for our NHS and bad for our environment. ""Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit and invest in our mental health services, give free childcare to working parents, put 20,000 more teachers into classrooms and take ambitious action to tackle the climate emergency."" Rail fares for commuters and season ticket holders to be frozen for the next five years All trains to be electric or hydrogen-powered by 2035 A new target for 80% of UK energy to come from renewable sources by 2030 A Â£10,000 grant for every adult in England to put towards education and training over 30 years 35 hours of free childcare for children aged two to four, or from nine months for working parents Replacing business rates for companies with a levy based on land value A higher minimum wage at ""times of normal demand"" for those on zero-hours contracts Â£11bn for mental health services over five years, including on 24-hour support A new tax on gambling companies to fund the treatment of problem gambling The Lib Dems say their manifesto is fully costed and other spending commitments will be paid for by tax rises. They are proposing to raise income tax rates by 1% to pay for an extra Â£7bn a year for NHS and social care services. Air Passenger Duty will be reformed, with those taking frequent international flights likely to have to pay more. The proceeds will be used to boost green transport, including slashing VAT rates on electric cars to 5%. There will also be a levy on the sale of cannabis to over-18s, with the money raised going to fund community policing and youth services. The Lib Dems have long called for the legalisation and taxation of cannabis, a move opposed by the Conservatives and Labour. In 96 pages of promises, one topic dominates: Brexit. ""Stop Brexit: build a brighter future"" reads the manifesto's front cover. A few pages in, there is a full page picture of Jo Swinson, as she seeks to contrast herself with what she calls ""the two tired old parties"" - the Conservatives and Labour -""reusing ideas from the past, whether the 1870s or the 1970s"". The Lib Dems argue they would have extra tax revenue to spend because forecasts suggest remaining in the EU would lead to higher economic growth. The party also wants to ensure overall national debt continues to decline as a share of national income; a promise that could prove crucial if the party holds the balance of power in the next parliament. The Conservatives say they will deliver Brexit by the end of January 2020 under the terms of the PM's deal negotiated with the EU. Labour wants to renegotiate the PM's Brexit deal then put it to a referendum within six months, with the option of staying in the EU. The party has not said which side it would take in such a vote. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. The Brexit Party wants the UK to leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. The Tories say they would spend an extra Â£2.6bn on schools next year, rising to an additional Â£7.1bn per year by 2022/23. The Greens say they would increase funding by at least Â£4bn per year. Labour has not specified its schools budget yet but is pledging to reduce class sizes to under 30 for all five, six, and seven-year-olds. The Greens, which published their manifesto on Monday, have pledged that wind should provide 70% of the UK's electricity by 2030, with other renewable energy sources providing ""much of the remainder"". Labour has already pledged to build 37 new offshore wind farms in which the government would have a majority stake. Do you have any questions about the election?

It has been trying to thwart what it calls Iran's ""military entrenchment"" there and block shipments of Iranian weapons to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement. But the latest operation was one of the broadest attacks to date, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Jerusalem. A senior Israeli security official said the Israelis had decided on a powerful retaliatory strike to signal they were ""changing the rules"" - that even a small attack from Syria would trigger an extensive response, our correspondent reports. Early on Wednesday,the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tweeted that the strikes targeted positions of Iran's Quds Force and Syria's armed forces.,external Allow Twitter content?

""During our strike of Iranian & Syrian terror targets, a Syrian air defence missile was fired despite clear warnings to refrain from such fire. As a result, a number of Syrian aerial defence batteries were destroyed,"" the IDF said. The IDF also said it held ""the Syrian regime responsible for the actions that take place in Syrian territory and warn them against allowing further attacks against Israel"". Iran's Quds Force is the external operations wing of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC). Israel did not target the Russian-made advanced S-300 surface-to-air missile systems deployed near the positions of Russian troops, Israeli media report. Russia, whose forces have helped turned the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, condemned the Israeli strikes. Moscow, whose air defence system covers most of Syria's airspace, generally does not interfere with Israeli strikes on Iranian forces and their affiliates. The leaders of Russia and Israel enjoy good relations, and the Israeli military is said to warn the Russian military before it carries out any attacks. Syria's state news agency Sana said that the country's ""air defence confronted the heavy attack and intercepted the hostile missiles"". It said that Syria destroyed ""most"" of the Israeli missiles. The news agency added that the strikes on Syrian territory were carried out from ""Lebanese and Palestinian territories"". Israel has a number of times hit targets inside Syria from war planes in Lebanese airspace. Danny Makki, a British-Syrian journalist based in Damascus, posted footage of what he said he believed were Israeli missiles hitting targets south of Damascus. Allow Twitter content?

Syria said two civilians were killed in the Israeli strikes. Meanwhile, a UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), said that 11 fighters, including seven foreigners, died. The SOHR said that the Israeli missiles hit sites in and around Damascus in Kiswa, Saasaa, Mezzeh military airport, Jdaidat Artouz, Qudsaya and Sahnaya. The Iranian authorities have so far made no public comment. The message from Israel to Tehran is clear. Any attacks out of Syria will be met by a disproportionate response. Now it is upping the military stakes. But Iran is sending a message of its own, too. Despite a long-running Israeli air campaign designed to constrain the Iranian build-up in Syria, Tehran is determined that this project will continue. It is a close ally of the Assad regime in Damascus, and it sees Syrian territory both as a frontline across which to confront Israel and as an important link to its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Quds (Jerusalem) Force answers directly to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei. It is led by Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, who is believed to be more than a mere military commander. Since the US-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003, the Quds Force has intensified its operations across the Middle East, providing training, funding and weapons to non-state groups allied to Tehran. It has also developed forms of asymmetric warfare, such as swarm tactics, drone and cyber-attacks, that have allowed Iran to undermine its enemies' superiority in conventional weapons. Gen Qasem Soleimani commands the IRGC's shadowy Quds Force In April, US President Donald Trump designated the IRGC, including the Quds Force, a ""foreign terrorist organisation"" (FTO). It was the first time the US had named a part of another government as an FTO.

"This video can not be played Protesters outside Malta's parliament demand justice A Maltese businessman has been arrested as part of the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia two years ago. Yorgen Fenech was detained by armed officers after his yacht was intercepted and searched. It comes a day after PM Joseph Muscat said he would consider a pardon for the alleged middleman in the case. Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption blogger, was killed by a car bomb near her home in October 2017. Malta's handling of the case has drawn international criticism. Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Malta journalist 'threatened for years' On Wednesday, several hundred people protested outside parliament in Valetta demanding the resignation of the prime minister. Demonstrators trapped one minister in his car, banging on the roof as police officers struggled to move them back. Mr Muscat referred to Mr Fenech as ""a person of interest"" in the case when addressing local media. A government source later confirmed to the BBC that Mr Fenech was arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation. The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia stunned Maltese society ""The fact that the country's institutions were given the resources to carry out this operation - a major operation, to ensure no-one fled the country or tried to flee the country - shows the government's resolve and mine,"" the prime minister said. ""We are leaving no stone unturned."" Witnesses quoted by the Times of Malta said Mr Fenech's luxury yacht was intercepted by an armed patrol boat as it left the port of Portomaso, north of Valletta, early on Wednesday. Yorgen Fenech is a well known businessman in Malta On Tuesday, Mr Muscat said the alleged money launderer suspected of being the middleman would first have to give evidence in court before a pardon could be issued. ""I gave a mandate to the attorney general to negotiate with the person's lawyers to take an unprecedented step,"" the prime minister was quoted as saying. ""If the person collaborates and the information provided is sufficient to prosecute the mastermind of this crime, they will receive a presidential pardon."" Mr Fenech was head of the Tumas Group and a director of energy generating company Electrogas, but had recently resigned from both positions, according to documents made public on Wednesday. He was also identified by Malta's Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) as being the owner of a Dubai-registered company called 17 Black. This was later confirmed to the BBC. Yorgen Fenech's yacht was taken back to Portomaso and sealed off by police In Junethe Council of Europe named 17 Black in a resolution,externaloutlining ""fundamental weaknesses"" that had allowed major scandals to go unchecked in Malta. Its report said 17 Black had been expected to make large monthly payments to secret Panama companies owned by senior Maltese officials and had also received large sums of money from an Azerbaijani national. The German industrial group Siemens, which is a shareholder in Electrogas, said in a statement on Wednesday that after corruption allegations against Mr Fenech ""became known some time ago"" it confronted him about the reports. ""Due to the public doubts in Mr Fenech's integrity, Siemens urged that he be dismissed from his membership on the Board of Directors,"" Siemens said. As well as the suspected middleman - who has not been named - three other suspects are in custody over the journalist's murder. This video can not be played Andrew Borg Cardona, a friend of Daphne Caruana Galizia, speaks about her death Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the car bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Vincent Muscat is not related to the prime minister. She was an investigative reporter who, in her 30-year career, had worked for the local Sunday Times and Malta Independent newspapers. But by the time she was killed she was best known for her anti-corruption blog Running Commentary, which she had been compiling since 2008. After a piece on the Panama Papers leak and its implications in Malta, the news site Politico described her as ""a one-woman WikiLeaks, crusading against untransparency and corruption in Malta, an island nation famous for both"". Caruana Galizia, pictured just a few months before her death, was best known for her blog Running Commentary She was regularly threatened or hit with defamation claims from the powerful figures she exposed. She was also on the receiving end of intimidation and threats to her life. Before her death, Caruana Galizia was considering leaving Malta out of concern for her safety. However, she refused to be put under permanent police protection as she said it would make it impossible for her to do her job. She published her final blog post just half an hour before she was killed. ""There are crooks everywhere you look now,"" she wrote. ""The situation is desperate.""

"Burger King advertises the plant-based burger as ""100% Whopper, 0% Beef"". A vegan customer is suing Burger King for cooking its plant-based patties on the same grills it uses for meat. In a proposed class action filed in the US, Philip Williams said the way the Impossible Whopper is grilled leaves it ""coated in meat by-products"". He said the burger's tagline - ""100% Whopper, 0% Beef"" - was misleading. Burger King did not comment, but the small print on its website says people wanting a meat-free option can request ""a non-broiler method of preparation"". A spokeswoman for the supplier, Impossible Foods, also told Reuters news agency that vegetarians and vegans ""are welcome to ask"" for their Impossible Whopper to be cooked in a microwave. The Russian vegans cooking up a revolution Australian woman sues neighbours over barbecue smell Shares in Beyond Meat burger company sizzle In the lawsuit filed in a Miami federal court, Mr Williams says that the burger chain does not clearly advertise that the plant-based burgers are cooked with meat. He said he visited a drive-through restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia, and ordered the Impossible Whopper without mayonnaise. At no point was he told the Whopper was cooked on the same grill as the meat burgers, he said - adding that, had he known, he would not have ordered it. This video can not be played In September, we looked at the rise of vegan fast food. Mr Williams said he wanted damages for everyone in the US who bought the Impossible Whopper, as well as an injunction requiring Burger King to ""plainly disclose"" that the vegan burgers and meat burgers are cooked on the same grills. Burger King started selling the Impossible Whopper in Sweden in May, before rolling it out to US stores in August. It started selling the meatless burger in 25 other European countries earlier this month.

"This video can not be played The big names who had a bad day at the hearing A top US diplomat has told an impeachment inquiry that he followed President Donald Trump's orders to put pressure on Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. The instruction came from Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Ambassador Gordon Sondland said. The inquiry is assessing if Mr Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as a precondition. He denies any wrongdoing. It is illegal in the US to seek foreign help to gain electoral advantage. Mr Biden is one of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. Mr Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, told the latest hearing in the US House of Representatives that Mr Giuliani had sought a public statement from Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, announcing an inquiry into ""corruption issues"". Mr Giuliani specifically mentioned the company Burisma - which had the son of Democratic presidential candidate Mr Biden, Hunter, as a board member - and issues surrounding the 2016 US presidential election, he said. Sondland's testimony and reaction Five key moments from impeachment hearing Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? Why Ukraine is so important to the US If found guilty in a majority vote in the House, the Republican president will face an impeachment trial in the Senate. But two-thirds of members of that Republican-controlled chamber would then need to vote for Mr Trump to be removed from office. In his opening statement, he said he had worked with Mr Giuliani ""at the express direction of the president"". While he is the US ambassador to the EU, Mr Sondland said his brief included work on Ukraine alongside other colleagues - despite that country not being an EU member. ""We did not want to work with Mr Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president's orders,"" he added. He then confirmed the president had sought an investigation in exchange for a White House visit for Mr Zelensky - a quid pro quo (a favour in return for a favour). ""I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes."" This video can not be played EU ambassador Gordon Sondland testifies that Trump's personal lawyer ""requests were a quid pro quo"" However, Mr Sondland also said he had never directly heard from the president that military aid would be released in exchange for such an inquiry. The US diplomat said he was ""adamantly opposed"" to the suspension of military aid to Ukraine, and was never told why it was withheld. A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story The impeachment story explained But he came to believe it was linked to Ukraine announcing corruption investigations. Mr Sondland said he had later told an aide to the Ukrainian president: ""I believed that the resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks."" This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump Moreover, the ambassador insisted that this was not a secret plan, as some critics have suggested, instead arguing it was transparent and that his superiors were ""fully supportive"". Mr Sondland said the leaders of the state department, National Security Council and White House had been informed, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He does not remember any objections from his superiors to the policy. The ambassador said he had even discussed the fact military aid had been withheld with Vice President Mike Pence on a visit to Warsaw in September. The chief of staff for Mr Pence has denied the vice president ever spoke to Mr Sondland ""about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations"". Similarly, a spokesman for the state department said Mr Sondland had ""never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the President was linking aid to investigations of political opponents. Any suggestion to the contrary is flat out false"". This video can not be played ""I want nothing"" - Trump re-enacts Sondland call Mr Sondland, a wealthy hotelier, donated to Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign and was appointed to his position by the president in July 2018. Mr Trump has already responded to the testimony. Brandishing a copy of Mr Sondland's opening statement on the White House South Lawn, he read out a transcript of a phone conversation the pair had, in which the president said: ""I want nothing. That's what I want from Ukraine."" He also told reporters he did not know the EU ambassador ""very well"", but said he seemed ""like a nice guy"". Mr Giuliani has also denied Mr Sondland's testimony, tweeting he had ""never met him and had very few calls with him"". With his opening statement to the House impeachment hearings on Wednesday, Gordon Sondland fired a torpedo that has blown a hole in the White House's defences. Water is rushing in, and it's now a question of whether the Trump presidency can be saved before it disappears beneath the waves. Mr Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, was working with Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukrainian policy at the explicit direction of the president. There was a quid pro quo. A White House visit for President Zelensky was conditional on opening investigations that could help the president politically. Mr Sondland also came to believe that US military aid to Ukraine was being held up for this reason. Everyone at the White House - acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former National Security Adviser John Bolton and others - was ""in the loop"". The word ""bombshell"" gets thrown around a lot these days, but Mr Sondland's testimony,  which represents a shift from his earlier closed-door statements, is a watershed moment in these impeachment investigations. Read more from Anthony Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence Laura Cooper and Undersecretary of State David Hale testified later on Wednesday. Ms Cooper told the lawmakers that as early as 25 July - the day President Trump had his phone call with President Zelensky - she had received expressions of concern about the aid from the Ukrainian embassy. ""The Ukrainian embassy staff asked - what is going on with Ukrainian security assistance?"" She added that the embassy staff had raised similar concerns with the state department. David Hale and Laura Cooper testified late on Wednesday Mr Hale said that in March he had been ""concerned"" by a campaign of attacks in Ukraine against then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and had felt she needed a statement of support from the state department. He told the hearing he had immediately briefed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the issue, but Mr Pompeo ""did not issue a statement at that time"". In May Ms Yovanovitch was recalled by President Trump, who called her ""bad news"" in his controversial phone call.

"A letter written to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has cast doubt on when the Duke of York first met convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The 2011 letter,externalsays they met in the early 1990s, not in 1999 as Prince Andrew said in his BBC interview. It comes as the duke faces a growing backlash after he said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein. Buckingham Palace said the prince's words speak for themselves and he stands by his recollection of events. Writing to the Times in March 2011, the duke's then private secretary Alastair Watson aimed to address ""widespread comment"" about the relationship with the New York financier, who died in prison this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He said Prince Andrew had known Epstein ""since being introduced to him in the early 1990s"", but dismissed the ""insinuations and innuendos"" as ""without foundation"". Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview But in his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said they ""met through his girlfriend back in 1999"" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. The 2011 letter was published after the Times reported on the existence of a photo of the prince with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, who would later testify that she had been forced to have sex with him. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. The duke was pictured with Ms Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 BT has become the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew since the interview was broadcast. In a statement, BT said it had been working with iDEA - which helps people develop digital, business and employment skills - since 2017 but ""our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York"". ""In light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,"" a spokeswoman said. Among some close to the prince there was a belief that ""once the dust died down"" the  Newsnight interview would have been worth it - because his core denials and admissions would be what was left in the public's mind. It is hard to see the logic of that position now. The letter to the Times from the prince's former private secretary undermines Prince Andrew's recollection of when his friendship with Epstein started. The Daily Mail hashighlighted at least one example,external, illustrated with photos, of when he and the Duchess of York broke what he called their ""simple rule"" that when one of them was away, the other was always with their children in the evening. That ""simple rule"" was offered as a reason why the prince could not have been with Virginia Roberts in London on the night she claims he danced and had sex with her. The loss of corporate support is particularly troubling for the palace: it is a ""real-world"" response to the interview, not just commentary and headlines. BT goes out of its way to say they'd reconsider if the organisation that they currently sponsor changed its patron - the prince. This is not getting better for the prince, or for the palace. It is getting worse. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG earlier announced they werewithdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiativePitch@Palace, but sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview. Four Australian universities have also said they would not be continuing their involvement in Pitch@Palace Australia. Prince Andrew cancelled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, three days after the interview aired,the Sun newspaper reported,external. This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' It is understood the visit was deemed inappropriate in the midst of an election campaign. In his Newsnight interview, the duke answered questions for the first time about his friendship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. He ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre, but the interview provoked a backlash. Pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca and Hult International Business School, are reviewing their partnerships with Pitch@Palace Outward Bound, the charity the Duke of Edinburgh was patron of for 65 years, has called a board meeting to discuss the prince's patronage London Metropolitan University, said it will consider the prince's role as its patron, saying it ""opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse and human trafficking"" University of Huddersfield students are calling for the prince to be sacked as their chancellor Four Australian universities listed as partners of Pitch@Palace Australia - Bond University, Murdoch University, the University of Wollongong and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology - said they had either ended their relationship with the initiative or would not be continuing it Despite the criticism, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond reported that those close to the duke say a withdrawal from public life is not under consideration. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Prince Andrew said in the interview that he could not recall ever meeting Virginia Giuffre and recalled that he went to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home the night she claims they first met. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. And the duke said meeting Epstein for a final time in 2010 was ""the wrong decision"", but said the ""opportunities I was given to learn"" about business meant he did not regret the friendship.

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' The Duke of York says he is stepping back from royal duties because the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. Prince Andrew, 59, said he had asked the Queen for permission to withdraw for the ""foreseeable future"". He said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"". The duke has faced a growing backlash followinga BBC interviewabout his friendship with the US financier. Companies he has links with, such as BT and Barclays, have joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. For several months the duke had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, whotook his own life in Augustwhile awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. His latest move, described by Buckingham Palace as ""a personal decision"", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein In a statement, the duke said: ""I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. ""His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. ""I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives."" He added that he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said his latest statement was ""completely different in tone"" to his recent TV interview and had ""addressed all the issues that he'd been criticised for"", including offering sympathy to Epstein's victims. She described his decision to step back as a ""drastic"" move but said ""the rumours that had been circulating had been really difficult for the Royal Family to manage"". The duke was pictured with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 In his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said the ""opportunities I was given to learn"" about business meant he did not regret the friendship with Epstein, although he said meeting him for a final time in 2010 was ""the wrong decision"".

He sought to cast doubt on her testimony claiming that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. He said he had met Epstein ""through his girlfriend back in 1999"" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. Since the interview, a letter written in 2011 to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has emerged, saying they met in the early 1990s. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is ""for the foreseeable future"". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Roberts Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken. Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter told the BBC News Channel that the prince's position had become ""untenable"" and the only surprise was that it took so long, adding ""there was no other direction he could go"". However, he said the prince was ""not out of the woods yet"" as the FBI and lawyers for some of Epstein's alleged victims wanted to talk to him under oath. Lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing several of Epstein's victims, told BBC Newsnight that she was ""very glad"" the prince had indicated he was willing to speak to law enforcement, but said she didn't know why he had added ""if required"" to his statement. She said he should volunteer to cooperate ""without any condition and without any more delay"". The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein The duke's website,externalsays he carries out official duties for the Queen, focusing on promoting economic growth and skilled job creation. Over the past two months he has carried out overseas engagements in Australia, United Arab Emirates and Thailand. The prince's announcement means he won't be carrying out public engagements, but he will still attend Royal Family events such as Trooping the Colour and Remembrance Sunday. BT became the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew ""in light of recent developments"". In a statement, the firm said it had been working with iDEA - which helps people develop digital, business and employment skills - since 2017 but ""our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York"". ""We are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,"" a spokeswoman said. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG also announced they were withdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiative Pitch@Palace. Sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview. Four Australian universities also said they would not be continuing their involvement in Pitch@Palace Australia.

"The Liberal Democrats have launched their 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan Stop Brexit Build A Brighter Future. It sets out the polices the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,externalruns to 96 pages and contains pledges on a variety of subjects, with Brexit and the NHS to the fore. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and, potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? Article 50 would be revoked and Brexit cancelled. The words ""STOP BREXIT"" appear in large capital letters on the front of the manifesto. Uniquely among UK-wide parties, the Liberal Democrats are promising to revoke Article 50 immediately - and stop Britain leaving the EU without another referendum. The pledge stands out from Labour, who would offer another vote, and the Conservatives, who are promising to leave the EU in January. The Liberal Democrats believe the clarity of this approach won them votes during the European elections - and can be a vote-winner again.  It also underpins their plans to increase public spending - the Liberal Democrats say staying in the EU would deliver a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" to the economy - money that could be spent on public services. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Will this be a Brexit election? This video can not be played Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is pressed on whether she'd block a Tory or Labour government Raise Â£7bn a year over five years - a total of Â£35bn - to spend on the NHS and social care. The one penny in the pound extra on income tax will be ring-fenced for the NHS and social care. But this is a vague concept and simply means the party has promised Â£7bn a year more for health and social care and identified how the revenue might be raised.  It will be hard to track precisely how the money is spent. Longer term, the party wants to move to a dedicated health and care tax. which is called ""hypothecation"", to reassure voters their money is for key public services. The big problem is that in an economic downturn the tax receipts might fall, and, if so, would the government feel obliged to cut health and care spending? If the Treasury was obliged to top up funding from the central pot, the benefits of hypothecation would be lost. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run their own health services, but they will also benefit from any extra funding. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? All children aged two to four will qualify for 35 hours a week, 48 weeks a year. This is an eye-catching and potentially eye-wateringly expensive election promise. According to the independent economists at the Institute of Fiscal Studies, it would represent an extra Â£13bn a year, which is four-and-a-half times higher than the current level of spending. This is an expensive offer that could attract criticism as a big giveaway to some better-off parents, while not helping the poorest children who might benefit most. Currently all three to four-year-olds with both parents working can access 30 hours free childcare, unless either parent earns more than Â£100,000 a year. Childcare is a devolved issue. Achieve this target by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions. Even by the standards of an election busy this target is ambitious. We are already on a path of rapid decarbonisation - with 40% of our electricity produced by wind, solar and biomass in the third quarter of this year. And recent government projections suggest that contribution is set to rise to just under 50% over the next decade. So the Liberal Democrats' plan for 80% would mean the extremely rapid construction of many more solar farms and wind turbines on land and out at sea. Only the Green Party envisages a faster transition. These targets would apply to the whole of the UK. Lib Dems pledge Â£100bn climate fund over five years What is a climate emergency? Those who take the most international flights face a tax rise, while costs would come down for people who take one or two international return flights a year. The statistics suggest a frequent flyer levy is justified. More than half of those surveyed by the Department for Transport in 2014 said they had not taken any flights in the previous 12 months. The Lib Dems' policy becomes less radical when you consider people only taking one or two return flights a year would pay less tax. The UK already has one of the highest rates of Airport Passenger Duty in the world. Unsurprisingly airline bosses are against a rise. Ultimately they could pass any additional cost on to passengers. Then it comes down to whether their customers are prepared to pay more. With aviation's impact on the climate in sharp focus, some type of tax reform feels inevitable. This policy would apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Air taxes are devolved to Scotland. Spend Â£10.6bn more a year on schools and hire thousand of new teachers by the end of the next Parliament. The promise of another 20,000 teachers in England's schools and falling class sizes may be deceptively hard to deliver. Schools in England decide how to spend their own budgets. Many of the posts that have disappeared have been support staff such as counsellors or librarians. Head teachers may restore these posts first. There is so much pressure to get results that teachers' jobs are often the last to go, although some are quietly not replaced. There are 453,400 teachers already in England but there is also a population bulge hitting secondary schools, which is due to continue until 2025. So while primary class sizes might shrink, secondary classes could grow. Education is fully devolved to each part of the UK. Lib Dems promise 20,000 more teachers CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Help to break the grip of the criminal gangs by introducing a legal, regulated market for cannabis. Legalising the recreational use of cannabis for adults is one of the most radical of the Lib Dems' proposals, having first appeared in its 2017 manifesto. The Lib Dems believe it would help ""break the grip"" of the criminal gangs that profit from the lucrative trade in illegal drugs. And it's a powerful argument. But evidence suggests legalisation would not end the cannabis black market for under-18s, nor for those wanting more potent strains. There is also concern it could encourage greater use of the drug and act as a gateway to more harmful substances - which is why most of the other political parties will not make the same, bold commitment. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? The freeze would apply to all peak-time and season tickets for the next Parliament. Too many commuters in too many parts of Britain have suffered an unreliable service for too long. So a fare freeze for all peak-time and season tickets seemsâ¦fair! The Liberal Democrats say the taxpayer would foot the bill. They reckon it will cost Â£1.6bn over five years. For context, operating and maintaining the UK's rail infrastructure costs about Â£6bn a year. When you consider inflation, the policy in effect makes rail travel cheaper. The more intractable issue is how to make it better. The Liberal Democrats are committed to completing the HS2 high-speed railway, which would create extra capacity. They say they would also spend Â£15bn on enhancements to the existing rail infrastructure over five years. That's above recent rates of spending. Rail fare regulations are devolved. Pay boost thehigher minimum wage for people working on zero-hours contracts. Some form of pay bonus for insecure work has been suggested before. Matthew Taylor, who led a review into UK working practices, hassuggested a 15% minimum wage boost,external, echoing a similar policy in Australia, whereby a 25% pay premium is added to casual work. Jonathan Cribb, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the proposal is interesting for two reasons: It could reduce the number of firms who want to hire people on zero-hours contracts and it could mean people in regular employment might seek out a zero-hours contract because they like the flexibility. He says: ""So essentially, there could be fewer opportunities for these contracts and more people searching for them."" This policy would apply to most workers across the UK. In the next 10 years, 10,000 more unaccompanied refugee children will also be allowed into the UK. Since 2015, about 16,000 refugees have found sanctuary under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme, which was set up for those affected by the conflict in Syria. In June, the government announced that in 2020 it would replace the programme with a global resettlement project for 5,000 refugees each year. The Lib Dems' proposal, therefore, would double the number taken in by the UK, with an extra 1,000 unaccompanied children allowed to settle each year. The practical difficulties associated with the idea include finding enough local authorities prepared to house the refugees and ensuring that they're not exploited once they're in the UK. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Why do people risk their lives to get to the UK? Brexit bonus funds new teachers, flying taxes fight climate change. The Liberal Democrats are positioning themselves as the most fiscally virtuous of the major parties, with the toughest rule on borrowing. That means they've raised taxes, and are going to be the only party promising a basic rate tax rise. Many of the tax rises are specifically earmarked for spending commitments. Known as hypothecation, this is very much out of fashion at the Treasury which prefers everything to go into a central pot. The manifesto says the air passenger duty rise will go to the fight against climate change, business taxes will pay for an increase in free childcare and an extension of free school meals. The problem is that if any of these sources of funding falls short individually, will they really defund the spending promises associated with it? What are the challenges for the UK's economy? How much tax do British people pay? Bring the supply of new houses into line with demand. A total of 300,000 new homes a year is the current official target for England, but governments have consistently struggled to meet it - England gained only 220,000 last year. This is due in part, to the whims of builders and planning factors. More striking are tweaks to the tax system. These include permission for local authorities to levy up to six times the typical council tax fee on homes left empty for more than six months a year, and basing stamp duty on a property's energy rating. For tenants, there are plans to help with up-front deposit costs through a Help to Rent loan for all first-time renters under 30. Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.

"The Liberal Democrats are, on the face of it, planning the most austere attitude to borrowing of all the major parties. Unlike both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have positioned their aim for the taxes raised annually over and above the day-to-day costs of public services to run a surplus of 1%. But the message of their manifesto is that each tax rise has a purpose. The most visible result of this is a potentially painful form of fiscal virtue for the Lib Dems. They are advocating an extra penny on all income tax rates - ie an extra 1p on the basic rate, the higher rate and the additional rate of income tax, raising nearly Â£8bn at the end of the Parliament. Lib Dems vow Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit Why did the Lib Dems go tough on spending? Their hope is that the electorate see this as an honest message to the public about the funding pressures for health and social care from an ageing society. But it does leave them as the only UK-wide party advocating basic-rate income tax rises. In addition, corporation tax back up to 20p and capital gains tax allowances being scrapped raises Â£15bn. And then there is a huge Â£5bn rise in the Air Passenger Duty levy, which in fact will have to raise even more than that from the most frequent fliers, as the Lib Dems claim infrequent fliers will save money. For reference, the entire APD system currently raises Â£3.7bn a year, the majority of receipts raised by economy flights, because 95% of the 110 million international flights are taken in this class. Another eye-catching new tax - on the consumption, after legalisation, of cannabis - will raise Â£1.5bn a year, the Lib Dems claim. The interesting thing about the manifesto is that many of the tax rises are specifically earmarked for spending commitments. This, known as hypothecation, is very much out of fashion at the Treasury, which prefers everything to go into a central pot, but helps sell tax hikes to the public. But the manifesto says the proceeds of the Air Passenger Duty rise will go to the fight against climate change, while business taxes will pay for an increase in free childcare and the extension of free school meals. The income tax rise goes to health and social care, and the ""Remain bonus"" - the fiscal boost predicted from a larger economy if Brexit is revoked - goes on 20,000 new teachers. Finally, welfare reform and the cannabis savings will fund the police and youth services. The problem is that if any of these sources of funding falls short individually, will they really de-fund the spending promises associated with it? Do police get less if the country buys less cannabis? If the ""Remain bonus"" is not as bountiful as predicted, will there be fewer teachers?

"A letter written to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has cast doubt on when the Duke of York first met convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The 2011 letter,externalsays they met in the early 1990s, not in 1999 as Prince Andrew said in his BBC interview. It comes as the duke faces a growing backlash after he said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein. Buckingham Palace said the prince's words speak for themselves and he stands by his recollection of events. Writing to the Times in March 2011, the duke's then private secretary Alastair Watson aimed to address ""widespread comment"" about the relationship with the New York financier, who died in prison this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He said Prince Andrew had known Epstein ""since being introduced to him in the early 1990s"", but dismissed the ""insinuations and innuendos"" as ""without foundation"". Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview But in his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said they ""met through his girlfriend back in 1999"" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. The 2011 letter was published after the Times reported on the existence of a photo of the prince with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, who would later testify that she had been forced to have sex with him. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. The duke was pictured with Ms Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 BT has become the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew since the interview was broadcast. In a statement, BT said it had been working with iDEA - which helps people develop digital, business and employment skills - since 2017 but ""our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York"". ""In light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,"" a spokeswoman said. Among some close to the prince there was a belief that ""once the dust died down"" the  Newsnight interview would have been worth it - because his core denials and admissions would be what was left in the public's mind. It is hard to see the logic of that position now. The letter to the Times from the prince's former private secretary undermines Prince Andrew's recollection of when his friendship with Epstein started. The Daily Mail hashighlighted at least one example,external, illustrated with photos, of when he and the Duchess of York broke what he called their ""simple rule"" that when one of them was away, the other was always with their children in the evening. That ""simple rule"" was offered as a reason why the prince could not have been with Virginia Roberts in London on the night she claims he danced and had sex with her. The loss of corporate support is particularly troubling for the palace: it is a ""real-world"" response to the interview, not just commentary and headlines. BT goes out of its way to say they'd reconsider if the organisation that they currently sponsor changed its patron - the prince. This is not getting better for the prince, or for the palace. It is getting worse. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG earlier announced they werewithdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiativePitch@Palace, but sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview. Four Australian universities have also said they would not be continuing their involvement in Pitch@Palace Australia. Prince Andrew cancelled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, three days after the interview aired,the Sun newspaper reported,external. This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' It is understood the visit was deemed inappropriate in the midst of an election campaign. In his Newsnight interview, the duke answered questions for the first time about his friendship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. He ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre, but the interview provoked a backlash. Pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca and Hult International Business School, are reviewing their partnerships with Pitch@Palace Outward Bound, the charity the Duke of Edinburgh was patron of for 65 years, has called a board meeting to discuss the prince's patronage London Metropolitan University, said it will consider the prince's role as its patron, saying it ""opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse and human trafficking"" University of Huddersfield students are calling for the prince to be sacked as their chancellor Four Australian universities listed as partners of Pitch@Palace Australia - Bond University, Murdoch University, the University of Wollongong and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology - said they had either ended their relationship with the initiative or would not be continuing it Despite the criticism, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond reported that those close to the duke say a withdrawal from public life is not under consideration. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Prince Andrew said in the interview that he could not recall ever meeting Virginia Giuffre and recalled that he went to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home the night she claims they first met. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. And the duke said meeting Epstein for a final time in 2010 was ""the wrong decision"", but said the ""opportunities I was given to learn"" about business meant he did not regret the friendship.

Stacey Andrew, 27, from Boston in Lincolnshire, was at the Fly DSA Arena on Monday when she was set on fire,The Star reported,external. ""The flare hit my head and fell down my top, at first I didn't realise what had happened until people shouted,"" she said. ""It looks like someone let a firework off on my chest"". Ms Andrew said it was her first gig. She and her partner Callum Mutton were near the front and the people with flares were behind to the right. ""I didn't realise what had happened then people started patting me. My shirt was in flames and a man ripped it off,"" she said. ""People were shouting, 'She's on fire'.""

"Many Iranians rely on wi-fi to connect to the internet - but millions have been cut off since Saturday A country of 80 million people - and practically no way to get online. Iran's internet shutdown has lasted for four days now, sparking international concern. Following protests over a sharp increase in fuel pricesin the country, internet connections began to go dark beginning late on Saturday night, local time. On social media, Iranians living or travelling abroad have shared stories of being cut off from their families and friends back home. Many are still waiting for news of their welfare. Alp Toker atinternet-monitoring non-profit NetBlocks,externalwatched it unfold. ""We detected fluctuations in regional connectivity,"" he tells the BBC. ""This extended towards having national impact by later in the evening."" Since then, internet traffic in the country has plummeted to 5% of normal levels, according to NetBlocks. NetBlocks tracks connectivity in countries around the world by scanning the internet for communications devices - routers, servers, mobile phone towers - and keeping a database of those known to be online in each territory. By periodically sending brief messages over the internet to these devices, a practice called ""pinging"", NetBlocks and similar organisations can see when they go offline. Netblocks, a non-profit organisation, has been tracking the internet blackout Mr Toker says he is taken aback by the extent of the blackout in Iran: ""This is on a different scale to other instances we've seen around the world."" He points out that the internet system in the country is not a single network that is easy to switch on or off. Rather, a bit like in the UK, it is formed of a series of privately-owned networks that link together. Disrupting such a system is not straightforward. However, connections to the outside world in Iran arefunnelled through just two entities,external: the state telecoms firm and the Institute for Physics and Mathematics, which means that authorities are more easily able to block communications in and out of the country. ""If you architect your country's internet access so you control the gateways, i.e. create choke points, you can censor at will,"" says Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert at the University of Surrey.

""I can't remember the last time that we had a full blackout for four days,"" he says. Tech firm Oracle'sinternet-monitoring service,externalhas described it as ""the largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran"". Mr Tajdin notes that Iran has spent years developingan internal ""intranet"" networkso that certain branches of government and banks, for example, can stay online inside the country during shutdowns that cut Iran off from the outside world. ""People can still access domestic websites that are connected to this network, which means that Iranian apps can work, websites can work although there's no [international] internet access,"" he explains. This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets across Iran as fuel price rises were introduced The existence of this internal intranet has caused alarm among those who think Iran could use it to justify ever longer and more disruptive internet shutdowns. Besides social consequences, there may be serious economic ones too, says Mr Toker. ""We estimate that the economic impact to Iran is in the region of $60m (Â£46m) per day.

"Boris Johnson aims to change National Insurance rules so workers will not have to pay it until they earn Â£12,500. The Tory leader earlier said his party would put up the threshold to ensure ""low tax for working people"" if it wins the general election. But he later confirmed to the BBC it would be raised to Â£9,500 in the first budget of a Tory government, with no timetable for the additional Â£3,000. Labour said the reduced revenue would harm public services. The current threshold sees workers paying National Insurance contributions once they earn earn Â£166 a week, equivalent to an annual salary of Â£8,632 a year. Mr Johnson had promised to raise the threshold to Â£12,500 during the Tory leadership contest. What else is Johnson planning to spend on? Has Johnson got his NI numbers confused? Lib Dems vow Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit What is Labour's four-day working week plan? He told the BBC this was now an ""ambition"" of his government and a timeframe would be announcement at their first budget if they are elected. But the PM said bringing in the Â£9,500 threshold sooner would ""help with the cost of living"" and ""put Â£500 in the pocket of everybody"" - although a later press release claimed the saving would be around Â£100 per person. Both figures are still higher than the estimate of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who said the threshold would save workers about Â£85 per year and cost the government Â£2bn. An earlier estimate by the independent economic think tank said a rise to Â£12,500 - which would match the threshold where workers start paying income tax - would save workers up to Â£465 a year, and cost the government Â£11bn. But Xiaowei Xu, a research economist with the IFS, said without knowing the proposed timescale of the increase ""we do not know how big a policy this is"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he wants to ""help people with the cost of living"" On a visit to an engineering plant in Teesside, Mr Johnson was asked by one of the workers whether his pledges for low tax were ""for people like you... or people like us"". The PM said: ""I mean low tax for people... working people. ""We are going to be cutting national insurance up to Â£12,000 [and] we are going to be making sure that we cut business rates for small businesses. We are cutting tax for working people."" BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said it sounded like Mr Johnson had accidentally revealed his big election tax pledge. He later had to correct the figures in an interview with the BBC, revising it to a Â£9,500 threshold next year, with an eventual goal of Â£12,500. Mr Johnson said: ""We want to operate in a prudent way, but we do want to help now with the cost of living while simultaneously having the funds we need to invest into the NHS, police officers and education as well."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell criticised the cost to tax payers, quoting the IFS' Â£11bn figure. ""Even after 10 years of cruel cuts and despite creaking public services, the Tories still think the answer to the challenges of our time is a tax cut of Â£1.64 a week, with those on Universal Credit getting about 60p,"" he said. ""Meanwhile independent experts have said this will cost up to Â£11bn, so everyone who relies on public services and social security will be wondering whether they will be paying the price."" The SNP's Drew Hendry also attacked the policy, saying if the Conservatives ""really wanted to help people on low incomes"" then they would ""fix and stop the rollout"" of Universal Credit. He said raising the threshold would benefit the ""better-off first, and even more than those people on low incomes"". The IFS also said that a rise in the threshold was ""an extremely blunt instrument"" if the intention was to help lower paid workers. ""Less than 10% of the total gains from raising [National Insurance contributions] thresholds accrue to the poorest fifth of working households,"" they said. ""The government could target low-earning families much more effectively by raising in-work benefits, which would deliver far higher benefits to the lowest-paid for a fraction of the cost"". National Insurance is a tax paid by workers and the self-employed who are over 16, with the amount varying depending on how much you earn. Employers do make some contributions on behalf of their workers, but it again depends on how much they are paid. For employees, it is taken straight out of your salary before you receive it, while self-employed people need to pay as part of their self-assessment. By paying the tax, you are entitled to a number of benefits, such as a state pension, Jobseeker's Allowance and maternity pay. The contributions cover these benefits, with some also going towards the NHS. The Liberal Democrats announced in their manifesto earlier that they plan to review the tax and National Insurance status of employees, dependent contractors and freelancers ""to ensure fair and comparable treatment"" and to ""modernise rights to make them fit for the age of the gig economy"". The Green Party also pledged in their manifesto - launched earlier this week - that they wanted to merge employees' National Insurance, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, dividend tax and income tax into a single consolidated income tax, claiming it would ""close loopholes"" and bring in an additional Â£20bn to the public purse. Labour has yet to publish its manifesto, but in an announcement about its plans for the ""Living Wage"" earlier this month, the party pledged not to raise income tax or National Insurance contributions for the bottom 95% of earners. The SNP says on its website it would oppose any increases in National Insurance. Plaid Cymru are calling for an increase to National Insurance contributions for higher rate and additional rate taxpayers, while offering special exemptions for employers in rural and industrial areas with high unemployment.

"   By James Cook It is spring in the old mining village and a shy teenager stands in a quiet cul-de-sac, steadying her nerve. The pebbledash bungalow in front of her is unremarkable but for one thing. This is the west of Scotland in 1987, a place cast from coal and iron, the heartland of the Labour Party, and yet the posters in this house are not scarlet red but canary yellow. It is home to the local candidate for the Scottish National Party. At the last general election, Kay Ullrich had finished a distant and dismal fourth, winning less than a third as many votes as the supposedly hated Tories. Yet the 16-year-old Nicola Sturgeon has walked half a mile or so from her council estate in Dreghorn to offer to help Ullrich - and the SNP - try again. It was the first step in a political journey that would transform both the young woman and the fortunes of the party she supports. More than three decades on and her home village is represented by SNP politicians in London and Edinburgh. Sturgeon leads the party of government in Scotland and the third largest party at Westminster, although her record is under scrutiny like never before, and the political goal she values above all - independence for Scotland - remains stubbornly out of her reach. Many have tried to define that young woman from Ayrshire. She has appeared in the pages of Vogue and on American chat shows. The Sun photoshopped her face on to Miley Cyrus’s body riding a wrecking ball, while a Daily Mail front page screamed that she was the “Most Dangerous Woman in Britain”. So who is Nicola Sturgeon and what drives her? I once asked Nicola Sturgeon what got her into politics. We were strolling along the beach at Irvine, a couple of miles from the village where she grew up. She had just become Scotland’s first minister, the first woman to hold that office. However, she told me it was in the shadow of another groundbreaking female leader that she became politically active. Between 1983 and 1986, more than three million people in the UK languished on the dole as Margaret Thatcher sought to fashion a more competitive economy, while taming inflation, shrinking the state and vanquishing the unions. Without government support, the heavy industries - coal, steel, shipbuilding and so on - which had been the bedrock of employment, pride and identity for 20th Century Scotland, were dying. The mines, which had been a significant source of employment in Ayrshire, were almost all gone. For the shy, studious daughter of a young electrician and an even younger dental nurse (Robin Sturgeon was 21 when he wed; his bride Joan Ferguson just 17), life felt precarious. Families were one step away from the dole, Sturgeon told me. There was a feeling that if your dad lost his job he might never work again. There was also a sense of hopelessness, she said, of despair even. “You had the prospect of leaving school and maybe never getting a job.” The blame, she felt, lay in London where Thatcher’s Conservative Party had embraced what came to be called neo-liberal economics - a belief in the primacy of the market and a disdain for state intervention. The Sturgeons were SNP voters but politics was not a hot topic in their household, and it wasn’t a grim childhood by any means. The young Nicola and her friends spent Saturday nights whizzing around Frosty’s ice disco at Irvine’s Magnum Leisure Centre to the sounds of Wham! “Bathgate no more, Linwood no more, Methil no more, Irvine no more” “Bathgate no more, Linwood no more, Methil no more, Irvine no more”  At home, she drove her parents mad by endlessly playing Letter from America by Scottish duo The Proclaimers. With its description of hardships in both rural and urban Scotland, and even a reference to her hometown (“Irvine no more”) it was, Sturgeononce toldthe BBC’s Desert Island Discs, the “soundtrack to my political awakening”. She had been an avid reader from a young age, devouring newspapers and novels alike, and her interest in politics at home and abroad, and in particular her commitment to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), had been nurtured by an encouraging modern studies teacher at Irvine’s Greenwood Academy.  Leader profiles: Boris Johnson Jeremy Corbyn Jo Swinson Nigel Farage  But why the SNP and not Labour? “I think even back then it just seemed to me that Labour wasn't able to offer real protection against the Tories,” Sturgeon told me. “For me it was, ‘What's the point of voting Labour?’ I think in those days it was 50 Labour MPs but they could do nothing to stop what Mrs Thatcher was doing. “And that very directly is what led me to think, ‘Well why should we have governments that we don't vote for? Surely it would be better if Scotland was independent, choosing our own governments.’” That thought would come to define her but, leaving school as the 80s came to a close, a full-time career as an SNP politician was not yet a realistic option. Instead, further study beckoned, and she graduated in 1993 from the University of Glasgow with a 2:1 in law. Nicola Sturgeon in 2000 Nicola Sturgeon in 2000 As a trainee solicitor in Glasgow, she worked with a law firm specialising in contracts and property, before moving on to Drumchapel Law and Money Advice Centre in one of the poorest suburbs of one of the UK’s poorest cities. She is said to have been more at home here. By now a political path was opening up. In 1997, in a referendum granted by Tony Blair’s Labour Party, Scots overwhelming voted for a devolved parliament sitting in Edinburgh. Sturgeon had already stood unsuccessfully for the Westminster parliament twice. In 1999 she ran for Holyrood and became an inaugural Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow thanks to itssystem of proportional representation. Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon was 29 years old, and her career was about to blossom.  “Utter and total commitment to the party and the role,” is how one well-known political rival described Nicola Sturgeon to me. It was a reputation she began to establish the moment she entered parliament and became shadow education secretary. The health brief followed, then justice. She became known as a competent and combative - if rather serious, even dour - parliamentarian. Commentators wrote about her clothes and hairstyles in unflattering terms. They used the pejorative Scots nickname “nippy sweetie” - suggesting an unlikeable and sharp-tongued woman - to describe her approach in debate. “Here’s the trap for women,”said Sturgeon years laterat the Edinburgh International Book Festival. “You find yourself emulating the traits that in men are seen as strengths. Then you quickly realise that in women they are not seen as strengths. So the male politician who’s very assertive, aggressive and adversarial is a great, strong leader. A woman is bossy and strident - a ‘nippy sweetie’ as they used to call me.”  Speaking up for women, promoting gender equality, and criticising misogynistic attitudes have been hallmarks of Sturgeon’s political career, particularly in later years. Posting a photograph of herself as first minister meeting Prime Minister Theresa May for the first time in Edinburgh, she wrote: “Politics aside - I hope girls everywhere look at this photograph and believe nothing should be off limits for them.” The Daily Mail’s decision to summarise another meeting between the two leaders with the headline “Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it,” was greeted with widespread scorn. “It’s a vivid illustration of how much more we have to achieve,” said Sturgeon. After marrying the SNP’s chief executive Peter Murrell in 2010, Sturgeon endured years of speculation and questions about why the couple did not have children - questions that were not, she noted during an interview with journalist and author Tina Brown, asked of Alex Salmond, whom she would eventually succeed as leader. The distressing truth - and it was five years before Sturgeondecided to make it public- was that she had suffered a miscarriage in 2011. Strikingly, she had fulfilled a public engagement during that ordeal, attending a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the Ibrox stadium disaster in Glasgow. Sturgeon had shared the “painful experience”,she tweeted, “in the hope that it might challenge some of the assumptions and judgements that are still made about women - especially in politics - who don’t have children.”  Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell's wedding, Glasgow, July 2010 Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell's wedding, Glasgow, July 2010 Sturgeon met Murrell when she was a teenager, but it would be some 15 years before they stepped out as a couple. By then, she was fast approaching the biggest moment of her career - running for leadership of the party. It was the summer of 2004 and SNP leader John Swinney had resigned following a poor performance in the European parliamentary elections. His woes were exacerbated by internal division about the best way to advance the cause of independence, an old debate that continues to bedevil the party. At first the SNP's biggest star, Alex Salmond, who had led the party from 1990 to 2000, ruled out standing again, declaring in typically grand style: “If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign.” Instead, he supported Sturgeon’s campaign. It quickly ran into trouble and by the time nominations were about to close, the SNP’s private polling suggested she would be thumped by her rival, Roseanna Cunningham. Concerned about that outcome, Salmond announced that he would stand after all, with Sturgeon joining him on the ticket as deputy. They swept to victory together and an extraordinarily successful political partnership began, although the two made an odd couple. One senior SNP insider who knows them both well says Sturgeon “is a very private person” to whom the showmanship of politics did not come easily. It was an obvious contrast with Salmond. “I think she is somebody who has worked really hard at learning the skills of being a politician,” they said. This included self-consciously remaking her image in a transition named “Project Nicola”. Nicola Sturgeon in Bathgate during the 2014 referendum campaign Nicola Sturgeon in Bathgate during the 2014 referendum campaign  The newspapers noted that she had both smartened up her look and softened her edges. But this was tricky terrain because the feminist in her had long resisted the kind of lifestyle interviews where she talked about hairstyles and high heels. Having previously professed a total lack of interest in fashion, suddenly the public was hearing all about her shoe collection and her fondness for colourful outfits. Her home life also went on public display. She talked about how she loved to relax by reading fiction and watching television and revealed that she rarely entered the kitchen, which was her husband’s domain. “She still irons my shirts,” the wry Murrell told me once. “Only domestic thing I do,” she replied in a flash, adding: “I think in my head as long as I do that I'm off the hook for everything else.”    Project Nicola resulted in a lot of positive coverage. The Times’ fashion writer Anna Murphy,for example, praised the first minister's “sharply tailored skirt suits and dresses in even sharper colours” as she awarded her the title of Best Makeover 2015. When Murrell tweeted a link to the article, his wife replied “Dear@PeterMurrell- I'm sure what you meant to say was that no makeover was necessary… best wishes, your wife!” To me, that droll tweet illustrated the transformation from private to public politician, and the ease with which Sturgeon had embraced social media -  particularly Twitter - both as a campaigning tool and to project herself to the public. Perhaps she had to - Scottish politics was about to pick up pace.     Thursday 3 May 2007 was a particularly sweet night for Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP had won 47 out of 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament, one more than Labour, and for the first time in its history it had a taste of national power. Salmond became first minister in a minority government with Sturgeon as his deputy as well as health secretary, a role in which she quickly won a reputation as a capable and well-informed administrator, despite her lack of ministerial or managerial experience. Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon in 2007 Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon in 2007 Her philosophy in the health department was rooted in the socialist values of the west of Scotland of her youth. She opposed the centralisation of hospital services, even when it meant prioritising the concerns of local communities over the expert advice of clinicians; she was hostile to the involvement of private contractors in the NHS, and she repeatedly expressed her determination to tackle poverty and inequality. In policy terms, this health secretary scrapped charges for prescriptions and hospital parking - a boon for the middle classes as much as the poor. She also began a long, difficult but ultimately successful attempt to introduce a minimum price per unit of alcohol. Her aim was to try to push up the cost of booze and bring down sales to tackle social ills. On both prescriptions and minimum alcohol pricing Sturgeon was accused of abandoning her avowed commitment to prioritise the poorest in society. Critics also charged her with failing to tackle the twin deadly scourges of illegal drug consumption and hospital-acquired infections. On the other hand, waiting times and bed-blocking fell during her tenure as health secretary and she earned plaudits, and attracted attention beyond Scotland, for her handling of a deadly swine flu outbreak. She also had her first taste of political scandal. Sturgeon had tried to persuade a sheriff in Glasgow to consider alternatives to sending a constituent of hers to jail for benefit fraud. This intervention in the judicial process on behalf of a twice-convicted fraudster immediately led to calls for her resignation as deputy first minister. But rather than brazening it out, Sturgeon was frank, acknowledging that she had made a mistake and apologising. By the time of the Holyrood elections in 2011, Sturgeon was a seasoned campaigner both online and off, at the forefront of the SNP’s historic victory. The party took 69 seats to Labour’s 37, securing an overall majority and setting Scotland on the path towards an independence referendum. The Labour Party, which had bestrode Scottish politics for decades, was fading and the SNP was on the rise. A year later, Salmond handed Sturgeon the task of overseeing the referendum, a role which instantly saw her dubbed the “Yes Minister” by the press. Her appointment was “a game-changer” in referendum negotiations between the UK and Scottish governments, according to her interlocutor at the Scotland Office, Michael Moore. The two sides quickly got down to business and agreed a deal for the poll. Sturgeon traded a potential second question on the ballot - regarding the transfer of considerable powers short of full independence from London to Edinburgh - in favour of control over the date, the wording and the franchise which would be extended to include 16 and 17-year-olds. The campaign itself would see her role blossom further. She was a key figure for the SNP and the wider Yes movement, whether taking selfies with voters on the streets or debating with her opponents in the television studios. In both arenas, Sturgeon generally sketched a positive vision of an independent Scotland, predicting a “second oil boom” and denying that voting “Yes” would lead to economic disaster and international isolation. Within months of the final vote, the price of oil slumped, leading to thousands of job losses in the North Sea, and Scotland’s notional deficit soared (although it has since shown some improvement). The most damning judgement of Salmond and Sturgeon’s campaign strategy came from a former SNP leader, Gordon Wilson (now deceased), who said they had “failed to present a case on the currency, a central bank and fiscal policy that was credible”. Voting in the Scottish referendum Voting in the Scottish referendum When it came down to it, on 18 September 2014, voters had to answer a single question: Should Scotland be an independent country? Sturgeon has described herself as a pessimist by nature but when I bumped into her near the Scottish Parliament on the night before the poll she was bubbling with energy and anticipation. To me she looked and sounded far more like a woman who believed she was standing on the verge of historic victory than a politician exhausted by the rigours of a losing campaign. She was wrong.  Resplendent in their Sunday best and sporting broad smiles, members of the SNPposed for the cameraat their party’s annual conference. The venue was a hotel in Bridge of Allan, in the shadow of the monument to William Wallace.  SNP members in 1956 SNP members in 1956 It was 1956 and party historians record that all but a handful of the delegates attending the SNP’s conference that year were present for the picture. Now rush forward through nearly 60 years of Scottish history until you arrive on the north bank of Glasgow's River Clyde, the cranes strangely still and the shipyards silent, and you will see what appears to be a pulsating, abandoned spaceship which is actually an enormous concert hall. The woman on the stagebeing feted by 12,000 fans is not a rock star but a politician, the leader of the SNP, no less. It is just weeks since she was left “totally and utterly devastated” by the Yes campaign's failure to seize the “once-in-a-generation” opportunity of independence, which had been rejected at the ballot box by 55.3% to 44.7%. Nicola Sturgeon had no time to wallow in despair. Arriving in Portree, 2015 Arriving in Portree, 2015 Within hours of theformal result being announced, Salmond - who had failed to win over voters in his own backyard of Aberdeenshire and Moray - announced he was leaving the stage. There was never any serious question about the identity of his successor. Sturgeon immediately began preparing to succeed Salmond by issuing effusive tributes about the “outstanding record and achievements of the finest first minister Scotland has had”. “The personal debt of gratitude I owe Alex is immeasurable,” she said. “He has been my friend, mentor and colleague for more than 20 years. Quite simply, I would not have been able to do what I have in politics without his constant advice, guidance and support through all these years.” It was Sturgeon’s party now, and her personal popularity was seen as a key electoral asset. “I’m with Nicola” merchandise flew off the stalls at party conferences. But hitching the fortunes of a party, let alone a movement, to one person is a risk.  Party insiders say Sturgeon is not at all collegiate, relying on a very tight circle of advisers, including her husband. If she were to face a political scandal which threatened her career, she might find herself isolated, the SNP would lack an obvious, experienced successor, and the path to independence would probably be obstructed. None of that mattered in 2015 when Sturgeon led the SNP to an astonishing landslide victory in the general election in Scotland, crushing her opponents, taking 56 of the 59 Westminster seats, and sending shockwaves through British politics. The following year the party added another victory in the Holyrood elections while campaigning heavily on its leader’s popularity. The cover of their manifesto simply bore a picture of the leader and the single word “re-elect”. Around this time I found myself standing beside two famous newspaper columnists who had alighted from London to watch Sturgeon address her party conference. I asked for their verdict. The man from the Guardian replied that he loved her, while the Daily Mail man’s opinion was that we were now screwed - although to be honest, he used a stronger verb. This sense that Sturgeon was a champion of social democracy with the power to end the United Kingdom was common at that time. What was missing was a powerful reason for the SNP to revisit the issue. Brexit changed everything. While the UK voted to leave by 52% to 48%, Scotland’s vote was 62% to 38% for Remain. This, in the SNP’s view, was a “material change” in circumstances mentioned in their manifesto as a trigger for a second independence referendum - or indyref2 as it was quickly dubbed. Sturgeon sought and won the backing of Holyrood and fired off a formal request for the power to hold a referendum. A photograph of her writing that letter to Theresa May, feet up on the sofa, was no doubt intended to project  a relaxed air of confidence. In truth she was under pressure. May’s reply was simple: “Now is not the time” for indyref2, she said. And then, in April 2017, the prime minister surprised everyone by calling a snap general election. The result changed the dynamics. The Scottish electorate, it seemed, had wearied of constitutional politics and the SNP lost a third of their seats, while the Tories doubled their share of the vote, surging from one to 13 seats north of the border. “Jumping too far ahead of public opinion on this issue cost us a lot of votes,” wasthe judgement offormer SNP minister Alex Neil, who voted for Brexit. Since then, Sturgeon has been treading water on the subject of a second independence referendum to the irritation of many in the wider independence movement. “Losing half a million votes and 21 seats has utterly scarred her,” one senior Holyrood insider told me. Her party was changing, too. The SNP, which had numbered 25,000 before the referendum,now boastedmore than 125,000 members. Their views about the direction of travel do not always match those of their leader. The movement is restless, urgent and specific in its demands and Sturgeon’s leadership has been characterised by caution, compromise and, arguably, a certain amorphousness. For example, the woman who once remarked, “I was in the CND before I was in the SNP,” now appears content to shelter under Nato's nuclear umbrella. Far from seeking the socialist Scotland of which some independence supporters dream, she has expressed admiration for different flavours of capitalism, such as the Nordic model with its high quality of life (and taxation to match), and Rhine capitalism which combines competitive markets with a collegiate approach to labour relations and a strong social safety net. How exactly Sturgeon would guide an independent Scotland to these destinations remains rather vague, as does her vision for balancing the nation’s books without tax hikes, more austerity or higher borrowing. True, she has used the Scottish Parliament’s new fiscal powers to raise some taxes and has approved state intervention to save a shipyard and an airport, but she still insists that “pursuing greater equality and tackling social justice” is only possible with a “vibrant business base earning the wealth”, leaving some critics to wonder whether the SNP is really New Labour in a kilt. Arguments among supporters of independence now range from that central topic to transgender rights and much in between, with some criticising what they perceive as a lack of radical ambition from the Sturgeon government. Meanwhile, the attack line from her opponents is to “get back to the day job”. On taking office, Sturgeon promised toprioritise educationand, while schools have been refurbished and access to nursery extended,critics still describea litany of problems. In the Scottish NHS, meanwhile, the government watchdog Audit Scotland says more people are being seen and treated on time, and patient safety is improving. But just two out of eight key waiting time standards were met last year and the service isfacing a funding crisisif it does not speed up the integration of health and social care. On top of that, flagship hospital projects in Glasgow and Edinburgh have run into serious trouble. Famously disciplined in recent years, the SNP now seems more fractious with reports - denied - about divisions between the Westminster and Holyrood groups. Then there is the looming shadow of Sturgeon’s predecessor. Alex Salmond is due to stand trial early in 2020 accused of serious sexual offences, which he denies. Separately, in January this year, Salmond won a civil case against Sturgeon’s government when it admitted acting unlawfully in investigating harassment claims against him.  Legal restrictions mean there is not much that can be written at this stage. However, Scottish law and political circles are abuzz with talk about it. There is a feeling of anxiety among senior figures in the SNP about what the trial will mean for the SNP and for Nicola Sturgeon. And, for the first time, some in the SNP are beginning to look beyond her leadership. The case against Brexit has been fought in the courts by the SNP MP Joanna Cherry and in the Commons by the party’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford. At Holyrood, the name of Finance Secretary Derek Mackay is sometimes raised as a potential future leader. Some have demanded a “plan B” if there is no agreement from the UK on indyref2. Sturgeon, on the more careful wing of the independence movement, is having none of it, perhaps wary of the Catalonia example. Until very recently, she had been notably absent from the large independence rallies which regularly take place in Scotland’s towns and cities. “An impatient gradualist,” is how one well-informed insider describes her. “I think she feels obliged to speak the language of the Yes movement,” adds the SNP source, but “I'm not sure that comes naturally from what she really thinks.” Having said that, the insider argues that she is by some distance the “most experienced leader” in UK politics and “her remaining in post is, I think, crucial. It's necessary in order to take independence forward”. Sturgeon’s hopes for independence now appear to rest on surviving as leader; gaining a renewed mandate at the Scottish parliamentary elections in May 2021 and persuading a UK Labour government to agree to another independence referendum. Not only that but she would probably then have to convince voters that the economic uncertainty of leaving a 46-year-old union would not be eclipsed by the economic uncertainty of leaving a 312-year-old one. That is a very long list of ifs and buts without even mentioning the possibility of a second Brexit referendum removing the “material change” reason for holding another vote on Scotland’s future within the UK. On 20 November, 2019, it is exactly five years since Nicola Sturgeon became first minister of Scotland. She is spending that day in the same way she began all those years ago in that Ayrshire street, knocking doors, meeting voters, campaigning for Scottish independence. Her journey has taken many turns but it is hard to avoid the idea that time is no longer on her side. We are nearing a decisive stage in Nicola Sturgeon’s story, a story which could yet determine the future of the entire United Kingdom.   Brexit changed everything.

"Billie Eilish, Lizzo and Ariana Grande all have multiple nominations Two years after the head of the Grammys said women need to ""step up"" if they wanted to be recognised, female artists are dominating the 2020 nominations. Five of the eight album of the year nominees are women, Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey among the front-runners. Meanwhile, Lizzo and Billie Eilish are shortlisted in all of the ceremony's ""big four"" categories: best new artist, best song, best record and best album. Only one artist, Christopher Cross, has won all four awards in a single year. Grammys 2020: Snubs and surprises Grammy Awards 2020: List of nominees Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi has also been recognised, with Someone You Loved picking up a nomination for song of the year; while English singer Yola picked up a surprise mention in the best new artist category. And Lil Nas X received multiple nominations for his country-rap crossover Old Town Road, which spent a record-breaking 19 weeks at number one in the US earlier this year. The nominees for the main categories are: Album of the year I, I - Bon Iver Norman Rockwell - Lana Del Rey Thank U, Next - Ariana Grande When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? - Billie Eilish Cuz I Love You - Lizzo I Used To Know Her - HER 7 - Lil Nas X Father Of The Bride - Vampire Weekend Song of the year Always Remember Us This Way - Lady Gaga Bad Guy - Billie Eilish Bring My Flowers Now - Tanya Tucker Hard Place - HER Lover - Taylor Swift Norman Rockwell - Lana Del Rey Someone You Loved - Lewis Capaldi Truth Hurts - Lizzo Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved is nominated for song of the year Record of the year Hey Ma - Bon Iver Bad Guy - Billie Eilish 7 Rings - Ariana Grande Hard Place - HER Talk - Khalid Old Town Road - Lil Nas X ft Billy Ray Cyrus Truth Hurts - Lizzo Sunflower - Post Malone and Swae Lee Best new artist Black Pumas Billie Eilish Lizzo Lil Nas X Maggie Rogers Rosalia Tank and the Bangas Yola British nominees include Ed Sheeran, whose No. 6 Collaborations Project is up for best pop album; Ella Mai, whose debut record is nominated for best R&B album; and violinist Nicola Bendetti, who is recognised for a new concerto, written especially for her by jazz musician Wynton Marsalis. The Chemical Brothers receive three nominations in the dance categories; while Thom Yorke and James Blake go up against each other for best alternative album. There are also posthumous nominations for The Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan, and murdered rap star Nipsey Hussle. Lizzo was understandably excited to cap off her breakthrough year with so many nominations. She tweeted:,external""This has been an incredible year for music and I'm just so thankful to even be part of it. ""We are all winners."" Lil Nas X posted a simple but explosive: ""NO WAY"" (with an expletive in between those two words). The Grammys were mired in controversy in 2018, after only one woman, Alessia Cara, won an award during the televised ceremony. Asked to respond to the lack of female representation, Recording Academy president Neil Portnow said women needed ""to step up because I think they would be welcome. ""I don't have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it's upon us - us as an industry - to make the welcome mat very obvious."" His comments sparked outrage, and this year's ceremony rang the changes, with Kacey Musgraves' space-age country album Golden Hour taking home the main prize, presented by a new female host, Alicia Keys. Bebe Rexha and Alicia Keys announced the nominations on Wednesday As she picked up the best new artist trophy, British star Dua Lipa drove home the point, saying: ""I guess this year we really stepped up."" To be clear, the 2020 nominees all earned their place on merit. There's no quota system in place. Instead, artists like Billie Eilish and electro-flamenco star RosalÃ­a, have written some of the most forward-thinking, head-turning records of the last 12 months. The Recording Academy's new president, Deborah Dugan, commented on the phenomenon as she announced the shortlist for best pop solo performance in Los Angeles. ""Wow, that's a lot of women,"" she quipped. ""Just sayin.'"" We'll discover who wins when the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards take place on Sunday, 26 January 2020, hosted again by Alicia Keys. The event takes place a month earlier than normal, after the Oscars moved their ceremony forward, taking the Grammys traditional slot.

"The teenager drew up a ""hit list"" of areas he wanted to attack A teenage neo-Nazi who wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and identified a series of possible targets has been convicted of preparing terrorist acts. The 16-year-old boy listed the locations from his home city of Durham in his ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. He also described himself as a ""natural sadist"", Manchester Crown Court heard. The boy is the youngest person to be convicted of planning a terrorist attack in the UK. A jury found the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty of preparation of terrorist acts between October 2017 and March this year.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab defends the rebranding: ""No-one gives a toss about social media cut and thrust"" Senior Tories have dismissed criticism of the rebranding of one of their Twitter accounts as a ""fact-checking"" site during the leaders' debate amid claims it deceived the public. The @CCHQPress account - the Tory press office - was renamed ""factcheckUK"" for the duration of the hour-long TV show. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said ""no-one will have been fooled"" and they had the right to rebut Labour's claims. But the Lib Dems urged the Electoral Commission to intervene. In response, the watchdog said it did not have the powers to do so but it urged the parties to act with transparency and integrity. Twitter rebuked the Conservatives, saying it would take ""decisive, corrective"" action if something similar happened again. Live: Latest on election campaign Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit Kuenssberg: First TV debate not a game-changer Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked During the ITV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, the first ever televised head-to head encounter between Tory and Labour leaders, the party's press account changed its name and its appearance, telling people it was ""fact checking Labour from CCHQ"". Its Twitter handle remained the same and it retained the blue tick - signalling that it is a verified account. Mr Raab defended the move, which has attracted widespread criticism from non-partisan fact-checking bodies, telling the BBC ""no one gives a toss about social media cut and thrust"" and were only concerned about the substance of the arguments. ""It was pegged to CCHQ,"" he told BBC's Breakfast. ""No-one looking at it for a split second will have been fooled - they can see it's from CCHQ."" He said there was ""huge scepticism"" among the public about what politicians were saying and the Conservatives had a right to set the record straight over ""nonsense"" claims the NHS would be ""up for sale"" if they won. ""It matters that we have an instant rebuttal mechanism,"" he said.

"Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke says she found the nude scenes ""hard"". Speaking on actor Dax Shepard'spodcast,external, she says she would ""cry in the bathroom"" before certain scenes - but adds this would have happened ""whether there was nudity or not"". Her role as Daenerys Targaryen initially required her to take her clothes off quite a lot. She thinks it was necessary for the story - but that the show would be ""very different"" if it was made today. Emilia says her attitude to nudity is ""very different"" now The actress, who's from London, got the part when she was 23. It was her first big break in the industry. ""I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was like, 'Oh, there's the catch,'"" she told the podcast. ""But I'd come fresh from drama school and I approached it as a job. ""If it's in the script then it's clearly needed, this is what this is and I'm going to make sense of it. Everything's going to be cool."" Emilia is now in romcom Last Christmas She added: ""I'd been on a film set twice before then and I'm now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don't know what I'm meant to do. ""I don't know what's expected of me, I don't know what you want and I don't know what I want. ""Regardless of there being nudity or not, I would have spent that first season thinking I'm not worthy of requiring anything. I'm not worthy of needing anything at all. ""Whatever I'm feeling is wrong, I'm going to go cry in the bathroom and then I'm going to come back and we're going to do the scene and it's going to be completely fine."" Emilia and Jason at the season three premiere in 2013 She says co-star Jason Momoa, who played her abusive, warlord husband helped her through the first series. And, despite the fact she thinks we live in ""shifting times for nudity"", she wouldn't change how it was filmed between 2009 and 2010. ""I've had so many people say so many things to me about Khaleesi's nudity in the show. But people wouldn't care about her if you hadn't had seen her be abused. So you had to see it."" Emilia's now starring in the festive romcom Last Christmas. She says she now has ""fights on set"" about whether nudity is necessary. ""Things are very, very different. I'm a lot more savvy with what I'm comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing."" HBO and the creators of Game Of Thrones have been contacted for comment.

"Billie Eilish, Lizzo and Ariana Grande all have multiple nominations Two years after the head of the Grammys said women need to ""step up"" if they wanted to be recognised, female artists are dominating the 2020 nominations. Five of the eight album of the year nominees are women, Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey among the front-runners. Meanwhile, Lizzo and Billie Eilish are shortlisted in all of the ceremony's ""big four"" categories: best new artist, best song, best record and best album. Only one artist, Christopher Cross, has won all four awards in a single year. Grammys 2020: Snubs and surprises Grammy Awards 2020: List of nominees Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi has also been recognised, with Someone You Loved picking up a nomination for song of the year; while English singer Yola picked up a surprise mention in the best new artist category. And Lil Nas X received multiple nominations for his country-rap crossover Old Town Road, which spent a record-breaking 19 weeks at number one in the US earlier this year. The nominees for the main categories are: Album of the year I, I - Bon Iver Norman Rockwell - Lana Del Rey Thank U, Next - Ariana Grande When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? - Billie Eilish Cuz I Love You - Lizzo I Used To Know Her - HER 7 - Lil Nas X Father Of The Bride - Vampire Weekend Song of the year Always Remember Us This Way - Lady Gaga Bad Guy - Billie Eilish Bring My Flowers Now - Tanya Tucker Hard Place - HER Lover - Taylor Swift Norman Rockwell - Lana Del Rey Someone You Loved - Lewis Capaldi Truth Hurts - Lizzo Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved is nominated for song of the year Record of the year Hey Ma - Bon Iver Bad Guy - Billie Eilish 7 Rings - Ariana Grande Hard Place - HER Talk - Khalid Old Town Road - Lil Nas X ft Billy Ray Cyrus Truth Hurts - Lizzo Sunflower - Post Malone and Swae Lee Best new artist Black Pumas Billie Eilish Lizzo Lil Nas X Maggie Rogers Rosalia Tank and the Bangas Yola British nominees include Ed Sheeran, whose No. 6 Collaborations Project is up for best pop album; Ella Mai, whose debut record is nominated for best R&B album; and violinist Nicola Bendetti, who is recognised for a new concerto, written especially for her by jazz musician Wynton Marsalis. The Chemical Brothers receive three nominations in the dance categories; while Thom Yorke and James Blake go up against each other for best alternative album. There are also posthumous nominations for The Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan, and murdered rap star Nipsey Hussle. Lizzo was understandably excited to cap off her breakthrough year with so many nominations. She tweeted:,external""This has been an incredible year for music and I'm just so thankful to even be part of it. ""We are all winners."" Lil Nas X posted a simple but explosive: ""NO WAY"" (with an expletive in between those two words). The Grammys were mired in controversy in 2018, after only one woman, Alessia Cara, won an award during the televised ceremony. Asked to respond to the lack of female representation, Recording Academy president Neil Portnow said women needed ""to step up because I think they would be welcome. ""I don't have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it's upon us - us as an industry - to make the welcome mat very obvious."" His comments sparked outrage, and this year's ceremony rang the changes, with Kacey Musgraves' space-age country album Golden Hour taking home the main prize, presented by a new female host, Alicia Keys. Bebe Rexha and Alicia Keys announced the nominations on Wednesday As she picked up the best new artist trophy, British star Dua Lipa drove home the point, saying: ""I guess this year we really stepped up."" To be clear, the 2020 nominees all earned their place on merit. There's no quota system in place. Instead, artists like Billie Eilish and electro-flamenco star RosalÃ­a, have written some of the most forward-thinking, head-turning records of the last 12 months. The Recording Academy's new president, Deborah Dugan, commented on the phenomenon as she announced the shortlist for best pop solo performance in Los Angeles. ""Wow, that's a lot of women,"" she quipped. ""Just sayin.'"" We'll discover who wins when the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards take place on Sunday, 26 January 2020, hosted again by Alicia Keys. The event takes place a month earlier than normal, after the Oscars moved their ceremony forward, taking the Grammys traditional slot. That means the 2020 honours are based on a shortened, 11-month eligibility period. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Police found the 19-year-old man after being called to reports of a fight in Ilford A man was stabbed to death in a fight outside a block of east London flats in a ""particularly vicious attack"". The 19-year-old was found by police responding to reports of a disturbance outside Owen Waters House, in Fullwell Avenue, Ilford, on Tuesday night. The victim died at the scene and his next of kin have been informed. No arrests have been made but the Met said ""the possibility that the murder is gang-related is a very strong line of inquiry"". Police are establishing if the stabbing is linked to a fire at some nearby garages where a car was found burnt out. The Met said fire crews had been called to the blaze at about 22:20 GMT while traces of blood had also been found around the vehicle. Det Ch Insp Chris Soole described the killing as a ""particularly vicious attack"" and appealed for witnesses. A burnt-out car was found by some garages near to where the teenager was stabbed A Section 60 Order - giving police stop-and-search powers - was put in place for the whole of the Redbridge borough until 06:30. There have been five murder investigations in the borough in 2019 - three of which have been as a result of fatal stabbings. So far this year, almost 130 murder investigations have been launched in the capital. Three investigations have been carried out by British Transport Police and 124 have been investigated by the Met. A forensic tent is outside the tower block marking the spot where the teenager died. Residents have been telling me about rising tensions in the last few weeks. The block - just off a main road in Ilford - is known as a meeting point for drug dealers and people said the issue is ""rampant"". They have also described a lot of ""youth disturbance and violence"" in the area and expressed their fear, anger and shock. Officers have been coming in and out of the flats and they are trying to work out whether a burnt-out car is linked to the fatal stabbing.

"Burger King advertises the plant-based burger as ""100% Whopper, 0% Beef"". A vegan customer is suing Burger King for cooking its plant-based patties on the same grills it uses for meat. In a proposed class action filed in the US, Philip Williams said the way the Impossible Whopper is grilled leaves it ""coated in meat by-products"". He said the burger's tagline - ""100% Whopper, 0% Beef"" - was misleading. Burger King did not comment, but the small print on its website says people wanting a meat-free option can request ""a non-broiler method of preparation"". A spokeswoman for the supplier, Impossible Foods, also told Reuters news agency that vegetarians and vegans ""are welcome to ask"" for their Impossible Whopper to be cooked in a microwave. The Russian vegans cooking up a revolution Australian woman sues neighbours over barbecue smell Shares in Beyond Meat burger company sizzle In the lawsuit filed in a Miami federal court, Mr Williams says that the burger chain does not clearly advertise that the plant-based burgers are cooked with meat. He said he visited a drive-through restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia, and ordered the Impossible Whopper without mayonnaise. At no point was he told the Whopper was cooked on the same grill as the meat burgers, he said - adding that, had he known, he would not have ordered it. This video can not be played In September, we looked at the rise of vegan fast food. Mr Williams said he wanted damages for everyone in the US who bought the Impossible Whopper, as well as an injunction requiring Burger King to ""plainly disclose"" that the vegan burgers and meat burgers are cooked on the same grills. Burger King started selling the Impossible Whopper in Sweden in May, before rolling it out to US stores in August. It started selling the meatless burger in 25 other European countries earlier this month. According to Burger King's suggested pricing, the plant-based burger costs US customers about a dollar more than the beef version.

"The Lib Dems have promised to recruit 20,000 more teachers in England and spend billions more on schools if they are elected to government. The party, which will launch its manifesto later, says it will reverse school cuts with an ""emergency cash injection"" of Â£4.6bn next year. The extra funding would rise to Â£10.6bn by 2024/25 compared to 2019/20, under their plan. The party is also promising to widen access to free school lunches. They plan to spend an extra Â£1.1bn per year on meals for every primary school child, and secondary school children whose families receive universal credit (UC). Since 2018, children in school year three or above from families on UC have qualified only if the family's annual employment income is less than Â£7,400. The anti-Brexit party says Â£10bn will be taken from what they claim will be a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" from staying in the EU to increase school funding. Leader Jo Swinson also flagged up another likely manifesto policy in an interview with ITV on Tuesday, saying the party had plans for a frequent flyer tax. ""We've got plans for a frequent flyer lever that would certainly be discouraging many flights but would be raising revenue from that, so it wouldn't be an outright ban or limit but would be an effective measure to change behaviour,"" she said. Labour pledges counsellors for every secondary school A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 Your Questions: Can fathers get maternity pay? The Liberal Democrats say their extra spending would boost teacher numbers by 20,000 over five years. To attract and retain teachers, the party says it will increase starting salaries to Â£30,000, and guarantee a pay rise of at least 3% a year over five years. The party would also spend Â£7bn on improving school buildings over the next five years. On a visit to Trumpington Park primary school in Cambridge, Ms Swinson said the extra investment in education was essential. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""School leaders that I've spoken to would very much welcome this money, and, yes, we do need to keep spending."" She said her party's prediction that staying in the EU would provide an extra Â£50bn a year for public services was based on ""conservative estimates"" of better economic growth. ""By stopping Brexit there will be an uptick to our economy, there is no independent forecast which doesn't suggest that's true,"" she said. Defending her party's plan to replace Ofsted, she said the school watchdog's brand was ""broken"", and it should be ""entirely scrapped and replaced"". The Lib Dems would set up an ""independent body"" to oversee curriculum changes, she added, which would stop ""political interference"". After a decade of tightening budgets, the political parties in England are competing to offer more cash to England's schools.  Since 2010, the spending per pupil in England has fallen by 8% in real terms, despite being at its highest ever level in cash terms. That's because of rising costs for schools including teachers' pay, employer pension contributions, national insurance and utility bills. These plans by the Lib Dems go further than the commitment already made by the Conservatives. They would reverse the spending cuts, and because there is a commitment further into the future, offer schools the prospect of a real terms increase. Recruiting, and just as importantly keeping, teachers is a big challenge in England. But pay is not the only issue, with many teachers complaining about workload. The Lib Dems, like Labour, say scrapping the end of primary tests and replacing Ofsted would help take the pressure off schools. Labour and the Conservatives have yet to publish their election manifestos. But in August, Tory leader Boris Johnson promised an increase in funding for English schools that would amount to Â£7.1bn more than at present by 2022-23. The independent Institute for Fiscal studies said this would return funding to the levels of 2009. The government also proposed in September to raise starting salaries for teachers to Â£30,000 by 2022-23. Labour plans to increase education spending - and its conference voted in September to abolish private schools and redistribute their assets to the state sector, if Labour wins power on 12 December.

"The Liberal Democrats have launched their 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan Stop Brexit Build A Brighter Future. It sets out the polices the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,externalruns to 96 pages and contains pledges on a variety of subjects, with Brexit and the NHS to the fore. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and, potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? Article 50 would be revoked and Brexit cancelled. The words ""STOP BREXIT"" appear in large capital letters on the front of the manifesto. Uniquely among UK-wide parties, the Liberal Democrats are promising to revoke Article 50 immediately - and stop Britain leaving the EU without another referendum. The pledge stands out from Labour, who would offer another vote, and the Conservatives, who are promising to leave the EU in January. The Liberal Democrats believe the clarity of this approach won them votes during the European elections - and can be a vote-winner again.  It also underpins their plans to increase public spending - the Liberal Democrats say staying in the EU would deliver a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" to the economy - money that could be spent on public services. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Will this be a Brexit election? This video can not be played Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is pressed on whether she'd block a Tory or Labour government Raise Â£7bn a year over five years - a total of Â£35bn - to spend on the NHS and social care. The one penny in the pound extra on income tax will be ring-fenced for the NHS and social care. But this is a vague concept and simply means the party has promised Â£7bn a year more for health and social care and identified how the revenue might be raised.  It will be hard to track precisely how the money is spent. Longer term, the party wants to move to a dedicated health and care tax. which is called ""hypothecation"", to reassure voters their money is for key public services. The big problem is that in an economic downturn the tax receipts might fall, and, if so, would the government feel obliged to cut health and care spending? If the Treasury was obliged to top up funding from the central pot, the benefits of hypothecation would be lost. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run their own health services, but they will also benefit from any extra funding. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? All children aged two to four will qualify for 35 hours a week, 48 weeks a year. This is an eye-catching and potentially eye-wateringly expensive election promise. According to the independent economists at the Institute of Fiscal Studies, it would represent an extra Â£13bn a year, which is four-and-a-half times higher than the current level of spending. This is an expensive offer that could attract criticism as a big giveaway to some better-off parents, while not helping the poorest children who might benefit most. Currently all three to four-year-olds with both parents working can access 30 hours free childcare, unless either parent earns more than Â£100,000 a year. Childcare is a devolved issue. Achieve this target by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions. Even by the standards of an election busy this target is ambitious. We are already on a path of rapid decarbonisation - with 40% of our electricity produced by wind, solar and biomass in the third quarter of this year. And recent government projections suggest that contribution is set to rise to just under 50% over the next decade. So the Liberal Democrats' plan for 80% would mean the extremely rapid construction of many more solar farms and wind turbines on land and out at sea. Only the Green Party envisages a faster transition. These targets would apply to the whole of the UK. Lib Dems pledge Â£100bn climate fund over five years What is a climate emergency? Those who take the most international flights face a tax rise, while costs would come down for people who take one or two international return flights a year. The statistics suggest a frequent flyer levy is justified. More than half of those surveyed by the Department for Transport in 2014 said they had not taken any flights in the previous 12 months. The Lib Dems' policy becomes less radical when you consider people only taking one or two return flights a year would pay less tax. The UK already has one of the highest rates of Airport Passenger Duty in the world. Unsurprisingly airline bosses are against a rise. Ultimately they could pass any additional cost on to passengers. Then it comes down to whether their customers are prepared to pay more. With aviation's impact on the climate in sharp focus, some type of tax reform feels inevitable. This policy would apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Air taxes are devolved to Scotland. Spend Â£10.6bn more a year on schools and hire thousand of new teachers by the end of the next Parliament. The promise of another 20,000 teachers in England's schools and falling class sizes may be deceptively hard to deliver. Schools in England decide how to spend their own budgets. Many of the posts that have disappeared have been support staff such as counsellors or librarians. Head teachers may restore these posts first. There is so much pressure to get results that teachers' jobs are often the last to go, although some are quietly not replaced. There are 453,400 teachers already in England but there is also a population bulge hitting secondary schools, which is due to continue until 2025. So while primary class sizes might shrink, secondary classes could grow. Education is fully devolved to each part of the UK. Lib Dems promise 20,000 more teachers CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Help to break the grip of the criminal gangs by introducing a legal, regulated market for cannabis. Legalising the recreational use of cannabis for adults is one of the most radical of the Lib Dems' proposals, having first appeared in its 2017 manifesto. The Lib Dems believe it would help ""break the grip"" of the criminal gangs that profit from the lucrative trade in illegal drugs. And it's a powerful argument. But evidence suggests legalisation would not end the cannabis black market for under-18s, nor for those wanting more potent strains. There is also concern it could encourage greater use of the drug and act as a gateway to more harmful substances - which is why most of the other political parties will not make the same, bold commitment. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? The freeze would apply to all peak-time and season tickets for the next Parliament. Too many commuters in too many parts of Britain have suffered an unreliable service for too long. So a fare freeze for all peak-time and season tickets seemsâ¦fair! The Liberal Democrats say the taxpayer would foot the bill. They reckon it will cost Â£1.6bn over five years. For context, operating and maintaining the UK's rail infrastructure costs about Â£6bn a year. When you consider inflation, the policy in effect makes rail travel cheaper. The more intractable issue is how to make it better. The Liberal Democrats are committed to completing the HS2 high-speed railway, which would create extra capacity. They say they would also spend Â£15bn on enhancements to the existing rail infrastructure over five years. That's above recent rates of spending. Rail fare regulations are devolved. Pay boost thehigher minimum wage for people working on zero-hours contracts. Some form of pay bonus for insecure work has been suggested before. Matthew Taylor, who led a review into UK working practices, hassuggested a 15% minimum wage boost,external, echoing a similar policy in Australia, whereby a 25% pay premium is added to casual work. Jonathan Cribb, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the proposal is interesting for two reasons: It could reduce the number of firms who want to hire people on zero-hours contracts and it could mean people in regular employment might seek out a zero-hours contract because they like the flexibility. He says: ""So essentially, there could be fewer opportunities for these contracts and more people searching for them."" This policy would apply to most workers across the UK. In the next 10 years, 10,000 more unaccompanied refugee children will also be allowed into the UK. Since 2015, about 16,000 refugees have found sanctuary under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme, which was set up for those affected by the conflict in Syria. In June, the government announced that in 2020 it would replace the programme with a global resettlement project for 5,000 refugees each year. The Lib Dems' proposal, therefore, would double the number taken in by the UK, with an extra 1,000 unaccompanied children allowed to settle each year. The practical difficulties associated with the idea include finding enough local authorities prepared to house the refugees and ensuring that they're not exploited once they're in the UK. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Why do people risk their lives to get to the UK? Brexit bonus funds new teachers, flying taxes fight climate change. The Liberal Democrats are positioning themselves as the most fiscally virtuous of the major parties, with the toughest rule on borrowing. That means they've raised taxes, and are going to be the only party promising a basic rate tax rise. Many of the tax rises are specifically earmarked for spending commitments. Known as hypothecation, this is very much out of fashion at the Treasury which prefers everything to go into a central pot. The manifesto says the air passenger duty rise will go to the fight against climate change, business taxes will pay for an increase in free childcare and an extension of free school meals. The problem is that if any of these sources of funding falls short individually, will they really defund the spending promises associated with it? What are the challenges for the UK's economy? How much tax do British people pay? Bring the supply of new houses into line with demand. A total of 300,000 new homes a year is the current official target for England, but governments have consistently struggled to meet it - England gained only 220,000 last year. This is due in part, to the whims of builders and planning factors. More striking are tweaks to the tax system. These include permission for local authorities to levy up to six times the typical council tax fee on homes left empty for more than six months a year, and basing stamp duty on a property's energy rating. For tenants, there are plans to help with up-front deposit costs through a Help to Rent loan for all first-time renters under 30. Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.

"The Liberal Democrats are, on the face of it, planning the most austere form of fiscal policy of the major parties. Unlike both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, they have positioned their aim for the taxes raised annually over and above the day-to-day costs of public services to run a surplus of 1%. This compares with aiming for balance - zero surplus or deficit - in three years for the Conservatives or five years for Labour. It is stricter than both their fiscal targets and means more tax rises or spending cuts would be required. ""The Liberal Democrats are the only party of sound finance,"" said their shadow chancellor, Sir Ed Davey, in a speech this week. In practice, this would mean, set against Labour or Conservative plans, having to find some tax rises or spending cuts immediately. Sir Ed has promised to put up both corporation tax and capital gains tax for that purpose. Actually, the Lib Dems also assume what they call a ""remain bonus"" of extra tax income from a larger economy arising from not leaving the European Union. Capital spending on future investments, such as railways and hospitals, would be allowed outside of this limit, but only where vetted by an independent watchdog to generate more money for the taxpayer than the initial cost of borrowing. This is a similar plan to that outlined by Labour's John McDonnell, targeting not the stock of debt, but the increase in the value of assets, too - what is known as a ""net worth"" target. It should allow considerable capital investment, Â£100bn of which would be spread out over the lifetime of the next Parliament to deal with climate change. There is an extra Â£7bn for schools and college buildings and Â£10bn on hospitals. There is an option to abandon the target in a downturn and, instead, target a current deficit of 1%. But if there is no such occurrence, these rules on day-to-day spending are tighter than the others. Is the Â£1.2tn claim justifiable?

"The Liberal Democrats are, on the face of it, planning the most austere attitude to borrowing of all the major parties. Unlike both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have positioned their aim for the taxes raised annually over and above the day-to-day costs of public services to run a surplus of 1%. But the message of their manifesto is that each tax rise has a purpose. The most visible result of this is a potentially painful form of fiscal virtue for the Lib Dems. They are advocating an extra penny on all income tax rates - ie an extra 1p on the basic rate, the higher rate and the additional rate of income tax, raising nearly Â£8bn at the end of the Parliament. Lib Dems vow Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit Why did the Lib Dems go tough on spending? Their hope is that the electorate see this as an honest message to the public about the funding pressures for health and social care from an ageing society. But it does leave them as the only UK-wide party advocating basic-rate income tax rises. In addition, corporation tax back up to 20p and capital gains tax allowances being scrapped raises Â£15bn. And then there is a huge Â£5bn rise in the Air Passenger Duty levy, which in fact will have to raise even more than that from the most frequent fliers, as the Lib Dems claim infrequent fliers will save money. For reference, the entire APD system currently raises Â£3.7bn a year, the majority of receipts raised by economy flights, because 95% of the 110 million international flights are taken in this class. Another eye-catching new tax - on the consumption, after legalisation, of cannabis - will raise Â£1.5bn a year, the Lib Dems claim. The interesting thing about the manifesto is that many of the tax rises are specifically earmarked for spending commitments. This, known as hypothecation, is very much out of fashion at the Treasury, which prefers everything to go into a central pot, but helps sell tax hikes to the public. But the manifesto says the proceeds of the Air Passenger Duty rise will go to the fight against climate change, while business taxes will pay for an increase in free childcare and the extension of free school meals. The income tax rise goes to health and social care, and the ""Remain bonus"" - the fiscal boost predicted from a larger economy if Brexit is revoked - goes on 20,000 new teachers. Finally, welfare reform and the cannabis savings will fund the police and youth services. The problem is that if any of these sources of funding falls short individually, will they really de-fund the spending promises associated with it? Do police get less if the country buys less cannabis? If the ""Remain bonus"" is not as bountiful as predicted, will there be fewer teachers?

But the first head-to-head clash between the two men who could be the next prime minister did not transform the landscape of this election. There were clashes, predictably, on Brexit and the NHS. And Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson both stepped carefully through the minefield of commenting on the monarchy and Prince Andrew's recent jaw-dropping interview. But neither man seem to have made a meaningful mistake. Nor did either of them appear to have a breakthrough moment. Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit It is still early in this election campaign and likely that swathes of the public have quite understandably only started to think vaguely about the choice in front of them. But at this stage, with Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. That seemed a taste of how many people may well feel in this election, that they are being asked to choose a national leader from a less than tempting pair.

"The Lib Dems have promised to recruit 20,000 more teachers in England and spend billions more on schools if they are elected to government. The party, which will launch its manifesto later, says it will reverse school cuts with an ""emergency cash injection"" of Â£4.6bn next year. The extra funding would rise to Â£10.6bn by 2024/25 compared to 2019/20, under their plan. The party is also promising to widen access to free school lunches. They plan to spend an extra Â£1.1bn per year on meals for every primary school child, and secondary school children whose families receive universal credit (UC). Since 2018, children in school year three or above from families on UC have qualified only if the family's annual employment income is less than Â£7,400. The anti-Brexit party says Â£10bn will be taken from what they claim will be a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" from staying in the EU to increase school funding. Leader Jo Swinson also flagged up another likely manifesto policy in an interview with ITV on Tuesday, saying the party had plans for a frequent flyer tax. ""We've got plans for a frequent flyer lever that would certainly be discouraging many flights but would be raising revenue from that, so it wouldn't be an outright ban or limit but would be an effective measure to change behaviour,"" she said. Labour pledges counsellors for every secondary school A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 Your Questions: Can fathers get maternity pay? The Liberal Democrats say their extra spending would boost teacher numbers by 20,000 over five years. To attract and retain teachers, the party says it will increase starting salaries to Â£30,000, and guarantee a pay rise of at least 3% a year over five years. The party would also spend Â£7bn on improving school buildings over the next five years. On a visit to Trumpington Park primary school in Cambridge, Ms Swinson said the extra investment in education was essential. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""School leaders that I've spoken to would very much welcome this money, and, yes, we do need to keep spending."" She said her party's prediction that staying in the EU would provide an extra Â£50bn a year for public services was based on ""conservative estimates"" of better economic growth. ""By stopping Brexit there will be an uptick to our economy, there is no independent forecast which doesn't suggest that's true,"" she said. Defending her party's plan to replace Ofsted, she said the school watchdog's brand was ""broken"", and it should be ""entirely scrapped and replaced"". The Lib Dems would set up an ""independent body"" to oversee curriculum changes, she added, which would stop ""political interference"". After a decade of tightening budgets, the political parties in England are competing to offer more cash to England's schools.  Since 2010, the spending per pupil in England has fallen by 8% in real terms, despite being at its highest ever level in cash terms. That's because of rising costs for schools including teachers' pay, employer pension contributions, national insurance and utility bills. These plans by the Lib Dems go further than the commitment already made by the Conservatives. They would reverse the spending cuts, and because there is a commitment further into the future, offer schools the prospect of a real terms increase. Recruiting, and just as importantly keeping, teachers is a big challenge in England. But pay is not the only issue, with many teachers complaining about workload. The Lib Dems, like Labour, say scrapping the end of primary tests and replacing Ofsted would help take the pressure off schools. Labour and the Conservatives have yet to publish their election manifestos. But in August, Tory leader Boris Johnson promised an increase in funding for English schools that would amount to Â£7.1bn more than at present by 2022-23. The independent Institute for Fiscal studies said this would return funding to the levels of 2009. The government also proposed in September to raise starting salaries for teachers to Â£30,000 by 2022-23. Labour plans to increase education spending - and its conference voted in September to abolish private schools and redistribute their assets to the state sector, if Labour wins power on 12 December.

"Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson faced off on ITV in the first head-to-head debate of the election campaign Head to head. Mano a mano.Without Jo Swinson or the other party leaders, this was Boris Johnson v Jeremy Corbyn. And the battle online was just as raucous as the debate on screen. While much of UK political Twitter was busysliding uninvited into Arron Banks' DMs, Labour's 280-character cheerleaders were propelling #WinForCorbyn towards the upper echelons of the list of top UK trends. Nothing says ""for the many, not the few"" quite like furiously retweeting a hashtag which implicitly asks you to consider not so much what the country can do for you, but what it might do for Jezza (and, incidentally, the Labour leader's nickname also went briefly viral).

Later, Boris Johnson was asked if the truth mattered in this election. ""I think it does,"" he responded, to laughter from the audience. It wasn't the only time pointed laughter was heard from the studio audience, with Mr Corbyn's failure to spell out his position on Brexit also eliciting snorts. On the Facebook front, a second-screen battle was being waged, with official party pages quickly firing out posts to respond to key points in the debate. ""THE MOMENT OF THE DEBATE SO FAR,"" one Conservative post declared over a video of Johnson responding to questions on the NHS: Minutes later the Labour Party shared a video of its own, declaring: ""You can't trust the Tories with the NHS."" And then, via an odd forced handshake and further sparring, the debate drew to a close - and the rush for supporters to declare their man the winner began.

"A letter written to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has cast doubt on when the Duke of York first met convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The 2011 letter,externalsays they met in the early 1990s, not in 1999 as Prince Andrew said in his BBC interview. It comes as the duke faces a growing backlash after he said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein. Buckingham Palace said the prince's words speak for themselves and he stands by his recollection of events. Writing to the Times in March 2011, the duke's then private secretary Alastair Watson aimed to address ""widespread comment"" about the relationship with the New York financier, who died in prison this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He said Prince Andrew had known Epstein ""since being introduced to him in the early 1990s"", but dismissed the ""insinuations and innuendos"" as ""without foundation"". Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview But in his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said they ""met through his girlfriend back in 1999"" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. The 2011 letter was published after the Times reported on the existence of a photo of the prince with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, who would later testify that she had been forced to have sex with him. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. The duke was pictured with Ms Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 BT has become the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew since the interview was broadcast. In a statement, BT said it had been working with iDEA - which helps people develop digital, business and employment skills - since 2017 but ""our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York"". ""In light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,"" a spokeswoman said. Among some close to the prince there was a belief that ""once the dust died down"" the  Newsnight interview would have been worth it - because his core denials and admissions would be what was left in the public's mind. It is hard to see the logic of that position now. The letter to the Times from the prince's former private secretary undermines Prince Andrew's recollection of when his friendship with Epstein started. The Daily Mail hashighlighted at least one example,external, illustrated with photos, of when he and the Duchess of York broke what he called their ""simple rule"" that when one of them was away, the other was always with their children in the evening. That ""simple rule"" was offered as a reason why the prince could not have been with Virginia Roberts in London on the night she claims he danced and had sex with her. The loss of corporate support is particularly troubling for the palace: it is a ""real-world"" response to the interview, not just commentary and headlines. BT goes out of its way to say they'd reconsider if the organisation that they currently sponsor changed its patron - the prince. This is not getting better for the prince, or for the palace. It is getting worse. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG earlier announced they werewithdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiativePitch@Palace, but sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview. Four Australian universities have also said they would not be continuing their involvement in Pitch@Palace Australia. Prince Andrew cancelled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, three days after the interview aired,the Sun newspaper reported,external. This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' It is understood the visit was deemed inappropriate in the midst of an election campaign. In his Newsnight interview, the duke answered questions for the first time about his friendship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. He ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre, but the interview provoked a backlash. Pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca and Hult International Business School, are reviewing their partnerships with Pitch@Palace Outward Bound, the charity the Duke of Edinburgh was patron of for 65 years, has called a board meeting to discuss the prince's patronage London Metropolitan University, said it will consider the prince's role as its patron, saying it ""opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse and human trafficking"" University of Huddersfield students are calling for the prince to be sacked as their chancellor Four Australian universities listed as partners of Pitch@Palace Australia - Bond University, Murdoch University, the University of Wollongong and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology - said they had either ended their relationship with the initiative or would not be continuing it Despite the criticism, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond reported that those close to the duke say a withdrawal from public life is not under consideration. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Prince Andrew said in the interview that he could not recall ever meeting Virginia Giuffre and recalled that he went to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home the night she claims they first met. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. And the duke said meeting Epstein for a final time in 2010 was ""the wrong decision"", but said the ""opportunities I was given to learn"" about business meant he did not regret the friendship.

"More than 2 million adults in England are unable to see an NHS dentist, BBC analysis suggests. They include an estimated 1.45 million who have tried and failed to get an NHS appointment in two years with the rest on waiting lists or put off by cost. Another 2 million assume they cannot get care where they live, suggesting nearly one in 10 miss out overall. Dental leaders said the findings - based on official NHS data - showed access was a problem in every region. British Dental Association leader Dave Cottam said there was a ""perfect storm"" of underfunding, failed contracts and recruitment problems. ""These access problems are no longer affecting a few 'hotspots', but are now the reality for millions across every English region. ""The public are entitled to access care, but the system is stacked against them. ""Those losing out are the patients who need us most. The next government owes it to them to ensure this service has a future."" NHS England said steps were already being taken to tackle the problems - and urged people to use the NHS website to find local dentists that were accepting patients. Similar data is not available in other parts of the UK. But the BDA said there were serious problems with access in Wales, while similar issues existed in Northern Ireland and Scotland albeit on a smaller scale. It was only thanks to a mobile service provided by a charity that Basir Afzal was able to get dental treatment. Mr Afzal had been struggling with severe dental pain for months but, despite repeated requests, had been unable to find an NHS dentist to see him. In November he had emergency treatment to have some teeth extracted. The work was done by Dentaid, a charity which normally works in developing countries, but is increasingly being asked to help people in England. ""I was in so much pain. I could not take it any more. I was only sleeping two hours a night."" He was one of 50 patients given care during a two-day clinic run from the town hall in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The charity has recently bought a second mobile dental van to meet demand in England. This is the first time the scale of this problem has been identified in this way. The NHS monitors the number of people using High Street dentists - figures show about half of adults have accessed NHS care in the past two years. But that does not take into account the vulnerable groups getting support from specialist services, those who do not need care or people opting to use private dentistry. Using theGP Patient Survey,external, which also asks questions about dentistry, the BBC has been able to provide estimates for the number of people who cannot get care, are put off getting care because of the cost or believe where they live NHS care is not available. The analysis shows the level of unmet need has remained pretty consistent for the past five years. The scale of the problems do vary from area to area. Places such as Bradford, Brighton, Cornwall and parts of Kent, Surrey, Norfolk and London have the worst levels of access with around one in six adults not getting care. Despite dental care being available on the NHS, some people still have to pay for it. Only those on low incomes, children and pregnant women get treatment for free. Others have to pay. Treatment is split into three payment bands from Â£22.70 for checks-ups, scale-and-polishes and X-rays through to Â£269.30 for complex care such as dentures and crowns. As a result, cost puts some people off coming forward for treatment, the analysis suggests. But greater numbers have found themselves turned away or believe there are no NHS appointments available locally. The BDA said there were a variety of reasons behind this. It pointed to figures showing three-quarters of practices have experienced difficulties filling posts and a 29% fall in funding per head in seven years once inflation was taken into account. The union has also been critical of the way the contract works - dentists are given block contracts meaning once they have seen their quota they do not get paid any extra. NHS England said it was ""actively working"" with local areas to better understand what was causing problems. Work has been done to make the contract more flexible. Patients who are trying to find out what services are available can use the NHS website to find which local dentists are accepting NHS patients, a spokeswoman said. Plans have also been put forward during the election campaign to improve access. Labour has proposed introducing free dental check-ups by scrapping band one charges - and eventually provide free NHS dental care. Both the Tories and Liberal Democrats said they were proposing investing more money in the NHS to improve services. The Lib Dems in particular said it was aiming to recruit more dentists with the extra funds. Nearly half of treatments provided on the NHS are provided free of charge because patients are exempt.

"This video can not be played Protesters outside Malta's parliament demand justice A Maltese businessman has been arrested as part of the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia two years ago. Yorgen Fenech was detained by armed officers after his yacht was intercepted and searched. It comes a day after PM Joseph Muscat said he would consider a pardon for the alleged middleman in the case. Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption blogger, was killed by a car bomb near her home in October 2017. Malta's handling of the case has drawn international criticism. Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Malta journalist 'threatened for years' On Wednesday, several hundred people protested outside parliament in Valetta demanding the resignation of the prime minister. Demonstrators trapped one minister in his car, banging on the roof as police officers struggled to move them back. Mr Muscat referred to Mr Fenech as ""a person of interest"" in the case when addressing local media. A government source later confirmed to the BBC that Mr Fenech was arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation. The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia stunned Maltese society ""The fact that the country's institutions were given the resources to carry out this operation - a major operation, to ensure no-one fled the country or tried to flee the country - shows the government's resolve and mine,"" the prime minister said. ""We are leaving no stone unturned."" Witnesses quoted by the Times of Malta said Mr Fenech's luxury yacht was intercepted by an armed patrol boat as it left the port of Portomaso, north of Valletta, early on Wednesday. Yorgen Fenech is a well known businessman in Malta On Tuesday, Mr Muscat said the alleged money launderer suspected of being the middleman would first have to give evidence in court before a pardon could be issued. ""I gave a mandate to the attorney general to negotiate with the person's lawyers to take an unprecedented step,"" the prime minister was quoted as saying. ""If the person collaborates and the information provided is sufficient to prosecute the mastermind of this crime, they will receive a presidential pardon."" Mr Fenech was head of the Tumas Group and a director of energy generating company Electrogas, but had recently resigned from both positions, according to documents made public on Wednesday. He was also identified by Malta's Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) as being the owner of a Dubai-registered company called 17 Black. This was later confirmed to the BBC. Yorgen Fenech's yacht was taken back to Portomaso and sealed off by police In Junethe Council of Europe named 17 Black in a resolution,externaloutlining ""fundamental weaknesses"" that had allowed major scandals to go unchecked in Malta. Its report said 17 Black had been expected to make large monthly payments to secret Panama companies owned by senior Maltese officials and had also received large sums of money from an Azerbaijani national. The German industrial group Siemens, which is a shareholder in Electrogas, said in a statement on Wednesday that after corruption allegations against Mr Fenech ""became known some time ago"" it confronted him about the reports. ""Due to the public doubts in Mr Fenech's integrity, Siemens urged that he be dismissed from his membership on the Board of Directors,"" Siemens said. As well as the suspected middleman - who has not been named - three other suspects are in custody over the journalist's murder. This video can not be played Andrew Borg Cardona, a friend of Daphne Caruana Galizia, speaks about her death Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the car bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Vincent Muscat is not related to the prime minister. She was an investigative reporter who, in her 30-year career, had worked for the local Sunday Times and Malta Independent newspapers. But by the time she was killed she was best known for her anti-corruption blog Running Commentary, which she had been compiling since 2008. After a piece on the Panama Papers leak and its implications in Malta, the news site Politico described her as ""a one-woman WikiLeaks, crusading against untransparency and corruption in Malta, an island nation famous for both"". Caruana Galizia, pictured just a few months before her death, was best known for her blog Running Commentary She was regularly threatened or hit with defamation claims from the powerful figures she exposed. She was also on the receiving end of intimidation and threats to her life. Before her death, Caruana Galizia was considering leaving Malta out of concern for her safety. However, she refused to be put under permanent police protection as she said it would make it impossible for her to do her job. She published her final blog post just half an hour before she was killed. ""There are crooks everywhere you look now,"" she wrote. ""The situation is desperate.""

"Syria's state media released images of what they say are destroyed houses near Damascus Israel says it has hit dozens of targets in Syria belonging to the government and allied Iranian forces. The Israeli military says the ""wide-scale strikes"" responded to rockets fired by an Iranian unit into Israel. Syria says two civilians died and that Syrian air defences shot down most of the missiles over Damascus. Other reports say the death toll was higher. Local reports said loud explosions were heard in the capital. Pictures on social media showed a number of fires. Israel hits 'Iranian killer drone sites' in Syria Iran's network of influence in Mid-East 'growing' Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards On Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said it had intercepted four rockets fired from Syria towards northern Israel. It said the rockets did not hit the ground. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria since the civil war broke out in 2011. It has been trying to thwart what it calls Iran's ""military entrenchment"" there and block shipments of Iranian weapons to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement. But the latest operation was one of the broadest attacks to date, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Jerusalem. A senior Israeli security official said the Israelis had decided on a powerful retaliatory strike to signal they were ""changing the rules"" - that even a small attack from Syria would trigger an extensive response, our correspondent reports. Early on Wednesday,the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tweeted that the strikes targeted positions of Iran's Quds Force and Syria's armed forces.,external Allow Twitter content?

""During our strike of Iranian & Syrian terror targets, a Syrian air defence missile was fired despite clear warnings to refrain from such fire. As a result, a number of Syrian aerial defence batteries were destroyed,"" the IDF said. The IDF also said it held ""the Syrian regime responsible for the actions that take place in Syrian territory and warn them against allowing further attacks against Israel"". Iran's Quds Force is the external operations wing of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC). Israel did not target the Russian-made advanced S-300 surface-to-air missile systems deployed near the positions of Russian troops, Israeli media report. Russia, whose forces have helped turned the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, condemned the Israeli strikes. Moscow, whose air defence system covers most of Syria's airspace, generally does not interfere with Israeli strikes on Iranian forces and their affiliates. The leaders of Russia and Israel enjoy good relations, and the Israeli military is said to warn the Russian military before it carries out any attacks. Syria's state news agency Sana said that the country's ""air defence confronted the heavy attack and intercepted the hostile missiles"". It said that Syria destroyed ""most"" of the Israeli missiles. The news agency added that the strikes on Syrian territory were carried out from ""Lebanese and Palestinian territories"". Israel has a number of times hit targets inside Syria from war planes in Lebanese airspace. Danny Makki, a British-Syrian journalist based in Damascus, posted footage of what he said he believed were Israeli missiles hitting targets south of Damascus. Allow Twitter content?

Syria said two civilians were killed in the Israeli strikes. Meanwhile, a UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), said that 11 fighters, including seven foreigners, died. The SOHR said that the Israeli missiles hit sites in and around Damascus in Kiswa, Saasaa, Mezzeh military airport, Jdaidat Artouz, Qudsaya and Sahnaya. The Iranian authorities have so far made no public comment. The message from Israel to Tehran is clear. Any attacks out of Syria will be met by a disproportionate response. Now it is upping the military stakes. But Iran is sending a message of its own, too. Despite a long-running Israeli air campaign designed to constrain the Iranian build-up in Syria, Tehran is determined that this project will continue. It is a close ally of the Assad regime in Damascus, and it sees Syrian territory both as a frontline across which to confront Israel and as an important link to its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Quds (Jerusalem) Force answers directly to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei. It is led by Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, who is believed to be more than a mere military commander. Since the US-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003, the Quds Force has intensified its operations across the Middle East, providing training, funding and weapons to non-state groups allied to Tehran. It has also developed forms of asymmetric warfare, such as swarm tactics, drone and cyber-attacks, that have allowed Iran to undermine its enemies' superiority in conventional weapons. Gen Qasem Soleimani commands the IRGC's shadowy Quds Force In April, US President Donald Trump designated the IRGC, including the Quds Force, a ""foreign terrorist organisation"" (FTO). It was the first time the US had named a part of another government as an FTO.

"This video can not be played Protesters outside Malta's parliament demand justice A Maltese businessman has been arrested as part of the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia two years ago. Yorgen Fenech was detained by armed officers after his yacht was intercepted and searched. It comes a day after PM Joseph Muscat said he would consider a pardon for the alleged middleman in the case. Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption blogger, was killed by a car bomb near her home in October 2017. Malta's handling of the case has drawn international criticism. Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Malta journalist 'threatened for years' On Wednesday, several hundred people protested outside parliament in Valetta demanding the resignation of the prime minister. Demonstrators trapped one minister in his car, banging on the roof as police officers struggled to move them back. Mr Muscat referred to Mr Fenech as ""a person of interest"" in the case when addressing local media. A government source later confirmed to the BBC that Mr Fenech was arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation. The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia stunned Maltese society ""The fact that the country's institutions were given the resources to carry out this operation - a major operation, to ensure no-one fled the country or tried to flee the country - shows the government's resolve and mine,"" the prime minister said. ""We are leaving no stone unturned."" Witnesses quoted by the Times of Malta said Mr Fenech's luxury yacht was intercepted by an armed patrol boat as it left the port of Portomaso, north of Valletta, early on Wednesday. Yorgen Fenech is a well known businessman in Malta On Tuesday, Mr Muscat said the alleged money launderer suspected of being the middleman would first have to give evidence in court before a pardon could be issued. ""I gave a mandate to the attorney general to negotiate with the person's lawyers to take an unprecedented step,"" the prime minister was quoted as saying. ""If the person collaborates and the information provided is sufficient to prosecute the mastermind of this crime, they will receive a presidential pardon."" Mr Fenech was head of the Tumas Group and a director of energy generating company Electrogas, but had recently resigned from both positions, according to documents made public on Wednesday. He was also identified by Malta's Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) as being the owner of a Dubai-registered company called 17 Black. This was later confirmed to the BBC. Yorgen Fenech's yacht was taken back to Portomaso and sealed off by police In Junethe Council of Europe named 17 Black in a resolution,externaloutlining ""fundamental weaknesses"" that had allowed major scandals to go unchecked in Malta. Its report said 17 Black had been expected to make large monthly payments to secret Panama companies owned by senior Maltese officials and had also received large sums of money from an Azerbaijani national. The German industrial group Siemens, which is a shareholder in Electrogas, said in a statement on Wednesday that after corruption allegations against Mr Fenech ""became known some time ago"" it confronted him about the reports. ""Due to the public doubts in Mr Fenech's integrity, Siemens urged that he be dismissed from his membership on the Board of Directors,"" Siemens said. As well as the suspected middleman - who has not been named - three other suspects are in custody over the journalist's murder. This video can not be played Andrew Borg Cardona, a friend of Daphne Caruana Galizia, speaks about her death Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the car bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Vincent Muscat is not related to the prime minister. She was an investigative reporter who, in her 30-year career, had worked for the local Sunday Times and Malta Independent newspapers. But by the time she was killed she was best known for her anti-corruption blog Running Commentary, which she had been compiling since 2008. After a piece on the Panama Papers leak and its implications in Malta, the news site Politico described her as ""a one-woman WikiLeaks, crusading against untransparency and corruption in Malta, an island nation famous for both"". Caruana Galizia, pictured just a few months before her death, was best known for her blog Running Commentary She was regularly threatened or hit with defamation claims from the powerful figures she exposed. She was also on the receiving end of intimidation and threats to her life. Before her death, Caruana Galizia was considering leaving Malta out of concern for her safety. However, she refused to be put under permanent police protection as she said it would make it impossible for her to do her job. She published her final blog post just half an hour before she was killed. ""There are crooks everywhere you look now,"" she wrote. ""The situation is desperate.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn locked horns over the NHS, Brexit and the Royal Family Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over Brexit in the first TV election debate of the campaign. Mr Johnson promised to ""end this national misery"" and said Labour offered ""only division and deadlock"". Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""get Brexit sorted by giving you, the people, the final say"". An average audience of 6.7m people watched the leaders lock horns over the NHS, trust and leadership, the future of Scotland - and the Royal Family. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear if either men had won or lost the debate but it was striking how the audience had been ready to laugh at their statements. A snap YouGov poll suggested the public were evenly split on who had won the debate, ""with most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won"". Tories criticised over 'factcheckUK' rebranding Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked How did the election debate play out online? Five things from the debate Reaction after Johnson and Corbyn go head-to-head Meanwhile, the Conservativesreceived criticismfor rebranding one of their Twitter accounts as ""factcheckUK"" during the debate. Will Moy, the chief executive of fact-checking website Full Fact, accused the party of trying to ""mislead"" voters and said Twitter ""could have acted sooner,"" including by forcibly renaming the account. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the move, saying it offered an ""instant rebuttal mechanism"" against ""nonsense thrown at the Conservatives"". The Electoral Commission said voters were entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners. It said it has no role in regulating campaign content but urged parties to ""undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""not impressed at all"" by the debate and said neither man was ""fit"" to be prime minister. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson dismissed the performances of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn as ""bluster and diversion from both of them"". Green Party co-leader Sian Berry expressed dismay at the ""climate chaos"" issue being ""relegated to the quickfire round in that debate"". And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Corbyn was the ""better debater"" but criticised him for not saying if he would Leave or Remain in a future referendum. The Lib Dems and SNP lost a court challengeto ITV's decision not to include their party leaders in the debate. The first half of the debate was dominated by questions on Brexit. Mr Johnson wants to win a majority in 12 December's general election so he can get the Brexit deal he struck with the EU into law and take the UK out of the bloc 31 January and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. Mr Corbyn says he would tear up Mr Johnson's agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU, with a customs union and a closer relationship with the single market, which he would then put to a public vote. A row broke out over the Labour leader's claim that US health firms will be given access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal. This video can not be played Moment Corbyn produces 'NHS dossier' Mr Corbyn told the PM: ""You are going to sell our National Health Service out to the United States and Big Pharma."" He held up redacted accounts of ""a series of secret meetings"" with the US, in which the government proposed ""full market access for US products to our NHS."" In response, Mr Johnson said the claims were ""an absolute invention"" and that there were ""no circumstances whatever in which this government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."" With Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. Read Laura's full blog The two leaders then clashed over whether Brexit put the future of the union between England and Scotland at risk. Mr Johnson claimed Labour would agree to another referendum on Scotland to get the support of the SNP and that isn't a price he would be willing to pay. But Mr Corbyn called the PM's comments ""nonsense"" and insisted his party would not form a coalition between with the SNP. Asked about the issue of trust, Mr Johnson said a toxic atmosphere in politics had been caused by MPs ""repeatedly refusing to honour the referendum"". The Labour leader said ""trust is something that has to be earned and as a public representative you have to listen"". He said his style of leadership was to ""listen to people and try to bring consensus"". Asked by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham if they would ""make a gesture"" to change the tone of the debate, the pair shook hands. Some audience members laughed at Mr Johnson's statement on trust, while others laughed at Mr Corbyn's statements on a Labour's proposal for a reduced working week and his party's Brexit stance. This video can not be played The two leaders had differing views on the monarchy On health, both men praised the NHS, with Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson describing it as ""one of the most civilised things about this country"" and ""one of the single most beautiful and brilliant things about Britain"" respectively. However they quickly differed over NHS management. Mr Corbyn called for an ""end to privatisation"" of services.  Mr Johnson insisted his party was not privatising the NHS. Asked if the monarchy was ""fit for purpose"", Mr Corbyn replied: ""Needs a bit of improvement."" Mr Johnson said: ""The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."" Asked if the Duke of York Prince Andrew was ""fit for the purpose"" following criticism over his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Mr Corbyn said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered"" adding ""nobody should be above the law"". Mr Johnson said ""The law must certainly take its course."" The final question pushed the leaders to say what Christmas present they would give each other. Mr Corbyn said he would get the PM a copy of Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ""and then he can understand how nasty Scrooge was"". Mr Johnson initially said he would buy the Labour leader ""a copy of my brilliant Brexit deal"" but when pushed to give a ""non-political answer"" he said he would get ""some damson jam"". Following the head-to-head between the Labour and Conservative leaders, the leaders of the Brexit Party, Greens, Lib Dems and SNP were interviewed separately on ITV. During her interview, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson emphasised her party's opposition to Brexit and said she could offer the country a ""better future"" than ""those two tired old parties"". She also said her party had plans for a frequent flyer tax to help combat climate change. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland's future"" and promised voters that her party would ensure people ""escape the chaos of Brexit"". She also insisted ""no deal has been done"" to form a coalition with the Labour Party in the event of a hung Parliament. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the current political system ""broken, rotten and corrupt"" and said he would change the voting system and scrap the House of Lords. Last up was Green Party co-leader Sian Berry, who accused Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson of failing properly to address climate change, which she said would leave young people feeling ""let down"". The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

To mark the occasion,Radio 1's Newsbeat spoke to Jamie Heavens, a roofer from Bournemouth, who became a millionaire at the age of 22, about what it is like to win such a sum overnight. ""It doesn't really sink in until the money hits your account. There's a sense of relief that you can go and do what you want to do,"" he said. ""People think I'm minted - that I'm cash rich and can just go and buy what I want every day. But it's not like that."" I won the lottery at 22, here's what happened next What do you do with Â£170m?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn locked horns over the NHS, Brexit and the Royal Family Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over Brexit in the first TV election debate of the campaign. Mr Johnson promised to ""end this national misery"" and said Labour offered ""only division and deadlock"". Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""get Brexit sorted by giving you, the people, the final say"". An average audience of 6.7m people watched the leaders lock horns over the NHS, trust and leadership, the future of Scotland - and the Royal Family. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was not clear if either men had won or lost the debate but it was striking how the audience had been ready to laugh at their statements. A snap YouGov poll suggested the public were evenly split on who had won the debate, ""with most Labour voters thinking Jeremy Corbyn won, most Conservative voters thinking Boris Johnson won"". Tories criticised over 'factcheckUK' rebranding Corbyn v Johnson fact-checked How did the election debate play out online? Five things from the debate Reaction after Johnson and Corbyn go head-to-head Meanwhile, the Conservativesreceived criticismfor rebranding one of their Twitter accounts as ""factcheckUK"" during the debate. Will Moy, the chief executive of fact-checking website Full Fact, accused the party of trying to ""mislead"" voters and said Twitter ""could have acted sooner,"" including by forcibly renaming the account. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the move, saying it offered an ""instant rebuttal mechanism"" against ""nonsense thrown at the Conservatives"". The Electoral Commission said voters were entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners. It said it has no role in regulating campaign content but urged parties to ""undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""not impressed at all"" by the debate and said neither man was ""fit"" to be prime minister. Liberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson dismissed the performances of Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn as ""bluster and diversion from both of them"". Green Party co-leader Sian Berry expressed dismay at the ""climate chaos"" issue being ""relegated to the quickfire round in that debate"". And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Corbyn was the ""better debater"" but criticised him for not saying if he would Leave or Remain in a future referendum. The Lib Dems and SNP lost a court challengeto ITV's decision not to include their party leaders in the debate. The first half of the debate was dominated by questions on Brexit. Mr Johnson wants to win a majority in 12 December's general election so he can get the Brexit deal he struck with the EU into law and take the UK out of the bloc 31 January and begin talks with Brussels on a permanent trading relationship. Mr Corbyn says he would tear up Mr Johnson's agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU, with a customs union and a closer relationship with the single market, which he would then put to a public vote. A row broke out over the Labour leader's claim that US health firms will be given access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal. This video can not be played Moment Corbyn produces 'NHS dossier' Mr Corbyn told the PM: ""You are going to sell our National Health Service out to the United States and Big Pharma."" He held up redacted accounts of ""a series of secret meetings"" with the US, in which the government proposed ""full market access for US products to our NHS."" In response, Mr Johnson said the claims were ""an absolute invention"" and that there were ""no circumstances whatever in which this government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."" With Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements. Read Laura's full blog The two leaders then clashed over whether Brexit put the future of the union between England and Scotland at risk. Mr Johnson claimed Labour would agree to another referendum on Scotland to get the support of the SNP and that isn't a price he would be willing to pay. But Mr Corbyn called the PM's comments ""nonsense"" and insisted his party would not form a coalition between with the SNP. Asked about the issue of trust, Mr Johnson said a toxic atmosphere in politics had been caused by MPs ""repeatedly refusing to honour the referendum"". The Labour leader said ""trust is something that has to be earned and as a public representative you have to listen"". He said his style of leadership was to ""listen to people and try to bring consensus"". Asked by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham if they would ""make a gesture"" to change the tone of the debate, the pair shook hands. Some audience members laughed at Mr Johnson's statement on trust, while others laughed at Mr Corbyn's statements on a Labour's proposal for a reduced working week and his party's Brexit stance. This video can not be played The two leaders had differing views on the monarchy On health, both men praised the NHS, with Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson describing it as ""one of the most civilised things about this country"" and ""one of the single most beautiful and brilliant things about Britain"" respectively. However they quickly differed over NHS management. Mr Corbyn called for an ""end to privatisation"" of services.  Mr Johnson insisted his party was not privatising the NHS. Asked if the monarchy was ""fit for purpose"", Mr Corbyn replied: ""Needs a bit of improvement."" Mr Johnson said: ""The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."" Asked if the Duke of York Prince Andrew was ""fit for the purpose"" following criticism over his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Mr Corbyn said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered"" adding ""nobody should be above the law"". Mr Johnson said ""The law must certainly take its course."" The final question pushed the leaders to say what Christmas present they would give each other. Mr Corbyn said he would get the PM a copy of Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens ""and then he can understand how nasty Scrooge was"". Mr Johnson initially said he would buy the Labour leader ""a copy of my brilliant Brexit deal"" but when pushed to give a ""non-political answer"" he said he would get ""some damson jam"". Following the head-to-head between the Labour and Conservative leaders, the leaders of the Brexit Party, Greens, Lib Dems and SNP were interviewed separately on ITV. During her interview, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson emphasised her party's opposition to Brexit and said she could offer the country a ""better future"" than ""those two tired old parties"". She also said her party had plans for a frequent flyer tax to help combat climate change. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland's future"" and promised voters that her party would ensure people ""escape the chaos of Brexit"". She also insisted ""no deal has been done"" to form a coalition with the Labour Party in the event of a hung Parliament. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called the current political system ""broken, rotten and corrupt"" and said he would change the voting system and scrap the House of Lords. Last up was Green Party co-leader Sian Berry, who accused Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson of failing properly to address climate change, which she said would leave young people feeling ""let down"". The BBC will also host a live head-to-head debate between the Conservative and Labour leaders in Southampton on 6 December, plus a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. The Lib Dems have sent a legal letter to the BBC over its decision not to include Ms Swinson in the head-to-head. BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.

"A lot of huffing and puffing. A lot of over eager attempts to land and repeat their stock lines. But the first head-to-head clash between the two men who could be the next prime minister did not transform the landscape of this election. There were clashes, predictably, on Brexit and the NHS. And Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson both stepped carefully through the minefield of commenting on the monarchy and Prince Andrew's recent jaw-dropping interview. But neither man seem to have made a meaningful mistake. Nor did either of them appear to have a breakthrough moment. Johnson and Corbyn clash over Brexit It is still early in this election campaign and likely that swathes of the public have quite understandably only started to think vaguely about the choice in front of them. But at this stage, with Labour behind in the polls, tonight the danger was for Boris Johnson, to throw away his lead, and that didn't happen. And the opportunity was for Jeremy Corbyn to start closing the gap and he didn't manage to take it. This is a genuinely momentous election. The decision the country faces is between two fundamentally different paths. But what was striking too in Salford, where the debate was held, was the readiness among the audience to laugh at both men's statements.

"A letter written to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has cast doubt on when the Duke of York first met convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The 2011 letter,externalsays they met in the early 1990s, not in 1999 as Prince Andrew said in his BBC interview. It comes as the duke faces a growing backlash after he said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein. Buckingham Palace said the prince's words speak for themselves and he stands by his recollection of events. Writing to the Times in March 2011, the duke's then private secretary Alastair Watson aimed to address ""widespread comment"" about the relationship with the New York financier, who died in prison this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He said Prince Andrew had known Epstein ""since being introduced to him in the early 1990s"", but dismissed the ""insinuations and innuendos"" as ""without foundation"". Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview But in his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said they ""met through his girlfriend back in 1999"" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. The 2011 letter was published after the Times reported on the existence of a photo of the prince with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, who would later testify that she had been forced to have sex with him. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. The duke was pictured with Ms Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 BT has become the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew since the interview was broadcast. In a statement, BT said it had been working with iDEA - which helps people develop digital, business and employment skills - since 2017 but ""our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York"". ""In light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,"" a spokeswoman said. Among some close to the prince there was a belief that ""once the dust died down"" the  Newsnight interview would have been worth it - because his core denials and admissions would be what was left in the public's mind. It is hard to see the logic of that position now. The letter to the Times from the prince's former private secretary undermines Prince Andrew's recollection of when his friendship with Epstein started. The Daily Mail hashighlighted at least one example,external, illustrated with photos, of when he and the Duchess of York broke what he called their ""simple rule"" that when one of them was away, the other was always with their children in the evening. That ""simple rule"" was offered as a reason why the prince could not have been with Virginia Roberts in London on the night she claims he danced and had sex with her. The loss of corporate support is particularly troubling for the palace: it is a ""real-world"" response to the interview, not just commentary and headlines. BT goes out of its way to say they'd reconsider if the organisation that they currently sponsor changed its patron - the prince. This is not getting better for the prince, or for the palace. It is getting worse. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG earlier announced they werewithdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiativePitch@Palace, but sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview. Four Australian universities have also said they would not be continuing their involvement in Pitch@Palace Australia. Prince Andrew cancelled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, three days after the interview aired,the Sun newspaper reported,external. This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' It is understood the visit was deemed inappropriate in the midst of an election campaign. In his Newsnight interview, the duke answered questions for the first time about his friendship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. He ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre, but the interview provoked a backlash. Pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca and Hult International Business School, are reviewing their partnerships with Pitch@Palace Outward Bound, the charity the Duke of Edinburgh was patron of for 65 years, has called a board meeting to discuss the prince's patronage London Metropolitan University, said it will consider the prince's role as its patron, saying it ""opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse and human trafficking"" University of Huddersfield students are calling for the prince to be sacked as their chancellor Four Australian universities listed as partners of Pitch@Palace Australia - Bond University, Murdoch University, the University of Wollongong and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology - said they had either ended their relationship with the initiative or would not be continuing it Despite the criticism, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond reported that those close to the duke say a withdrawal from public life is not under consideration. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Prince Andrew said in the interview that he could not recall ever meeting Virginia Giuffre and recalled that he went to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home the night she claims they first met. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. And the duke said meeting Epstein for a final time in 2010 was ""the wrong decision"", but said the ""opportunities I was given to learn"" about business meant he did not regret the friendship.

"More than 2 million adults in England are unable to see an NHS dentist, BBC analysis suggests. They include an estimated 1.45 million who have tried and failed to get an NHS appointment in two years with the rest on waiting lists or put off by cost. Another 2 million assume they cannot get care where they live, suggesting nearly one in 10 miss out overall. Dental leaders said the findings - based on official NHS data - showed access was a problem in every region. British Dental Association leader Dave Cottam said there was a ""perfect storm"" of underfunding, failed contracts and recruitment problems. ""These access problems are no longer affecting a few 'hotspots', but are now the reality for millions across every English region. ""The public are entitled to access care, but the system is stacked against them. ""Those losing out are the patients who need us most. The next government owes it to them to ensure this service has a future."" NHS England said steps were already being taken to tackle the problems - and urged people to use the NHS website to find local dentists that were accepting patients. Similar data is not available in other parts of the UK. But the BDA said there were serious problems with access in Wales, while similar issues existed in Northern Ireland and Scotland albeit on a smaller scale. It was only thanks to a mobile service provided by a charity that Basir Afzal was able to get dental treatment. Mr Afzal had been struggling with severe dental pain for months but, despite repeated requests, had been unable to find an NHS dentist to see him. In November he had emergency treatment to have some teeth extracted. The work was done by Dentaid, a charity which normally works in developing countries, but is increasingly being asked to help people in England. ""I was in so much pain. I could not take it any more. I was only sleeping two hours a night."" He was one of 50 patients given care during a two-day clinic run from the town hall in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The charity has recently bought a second mobile dental van to meet demand in England. This is the first time the scale of this problem has been identified in this way. The NHS monitors the number of people using High Street dentists - figures show about half of adults have accessed NHS care in the past two years. But that does not take into account the vulnerable groups getting support from specialist services, those who do not need care or people opting to use private dentistry. Using theGP Patient Survey,external, which also asks questions about dentistry, the BBC has been able to provide estimates for the number of people who cannot get care, are put off getting care because of the cost or believe where they live NHS care is not available. The analysis shows the level of unmet need has remained pretty consistent for the past five years. The scale of the problems do vary from area to area. Places such as Bradford, Brighton, Cornwall and parts of Kent, Surrey, Norfolk and London have the worst levels of access with around one in six adults not getting care. Despite dental care being available on the NHS, some people still have to pay for it. Only those on low incomes, children and pregnant women get treatment for free. Others have to pay. Treatment is split into three payment bands from Â£22.70 for checks-ups, scale-and-polishes and X-rays through to Â£269.30 for complex care such as dentures and crowns. As a result, cost puts some people off coming forward for treatment, the analysis suggests. But greater numbers have found themselves turned away or believe there are no NHS appointments available locally. The BDA said there were a variety of reasons behind this. It pointed to figures showing three-quarters of practices have experienced difficulties filling posts and a 29% fall in funding per head in seven years once inflation was taken into account. The union has also been critical of the way the contract works - dentists are given block contracts meaning once they have seen their quota they do not get paid any extra.

"This video can not be played Footage of security appearing to grapple with Mr Azamati was filmed in the chamber The president of Oxford Union has resigned over a row involving a blind student who was ""violently"" removed from a society debate. Ebenezer Azamati was ""accosted"" by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat he had earlier reserved before the discussion on 17 October. On Saturday,he was cleared of any wrongdoing. President of the society Brendan McGrath apologised for his ""mistakes"" and resigned. Postgraduate student Mr Azamati, from Ghana, said his treatment made him feel ""unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country"". After the charges against Mr Azamati were successfully appealed,Mr McGrath apologised to the Africa Society,external""for the distress and any reputational damage"" to the student. Helen Mountfield QC, representing Mr Azamati, had said there were ongoing talks with the union over what steps it could take to address the ""failings"" exposed by the case. The Oxford Union intentionally resembles the House of Commons In a letter to the standing committee,posted on Oxford Union's Facebook page,external, Mr McGrath said: ""For all my shortcomings, and all of my mistakes, I apologise profusely and unqualifiedly."" He said managing the response to Mr Azamati's eviction from the debate had been ""the most difficult thing I've ever been charged with"". The Oxford Union, which is independent from the university, has a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823. It is one of the most prestigious societies in the world and its debating chamber intentionally resembles the House of Commons. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan once said the union is ""the last bastion of free speech in the Western world"". The union invites world leaders, politicians, celebrities and controversial speakers to give speeches to its members, who are mostly current or former Oxford students. Past presidents include Benazir Bhutto, Boris Johnson, Gyles Brandreth and former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe. Mr McGrath said he had been asked by those present to bring the disciplinary complaint against him on behalf of a staff member but added he ""should have recognised a wider obligation"". ""The right response would not have begun with prosecution and apportioning blame; it would have addressed immediately the extreme distress of all involved,"" he continued. Before signing his resignation, he added he had proposed ""a full, public and independent review"" of the union's policies in relation to disability, how it trains its staff and whether the current security system ""is fit for the purpose of a student society"". Oxford University previously tweeted its support for Mr Azamati, and said it shared ""the widespread outrage regarding the unacceptable treatment"" of the student. Allow Twitter content?

"Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke says she found the nude scenes ""hard"". Speaking on actor Dax Shepard'spodcast,external, she says she would ""cry in the bathroom"" before certain scenes - but adds this would have happened ""whether there was nudity or not"". Her role as Daenerys Targaryen initially required her to take her clothes off quite a lot. She thinks it was necessary for the story - but that the show would be ""very different"" if it was made today. Emilia says her attitude to nudity is ""very different"" now The actress, who's from London, got the part when she was 23. It was her first big break in the industry.

"More than 2 million adults in England are unable to see an NHS dentist, BBC analysis suggests. They include an estimated 1.45 million who have tried and failed to get an NHS appointment in two years with the rest on waiting lists or put off by cost. Another 2 million assume they cannot get care where they live, suggesting nearly one in 10 miss out overall. Dental leaders said the findings - based on official NHS data - showed access was a problem in every region. British Dental Association leader Dave Cottam said there was a ""perfect storm"" of underfunding, failed contracts and recruitment problems. ""These access problems are no longer affecting a few 'hotspots', but are now the reality for millions across every English region. ""The public are entitled to access care, but the system is stacked against them. ""Those losing out are the patients who need us most. The next government owes it to them to ensure this service has a future."" NHS England said steps were already being taken to tackle the problems - and urged people to use the NHS website to find local dentists that were accepting patients. Similar data is not available in other parts of the UK. But the BDA said there were serious problems with access in Wales, while similar issues existed in Northern Ireland and Scotland albeit on a smaller scale. It was only thanks to a mobile service provided by a charity that Basir Afzal was able to get dental treatment. Mr Afzal had been struggling with severe dental pain for months but, despite repeated requests, had been unable to find an NHS dentist to see him. In November he had emergency treatment to have some teeth extracted. The work was done by Dentaid, a charity which normally works in developing countries, but is increasingly being asked to help people in England. ""I was in so much pain. I could not take it any more. I was only sleeping two hours a night."" He was one of 50 patients given care during a two-day clinic run from the town hall in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The charity has recently bought a second mobile dental van to meet demand in England. This is the first time the scale of this problem has been identified in this way. The NHS monitors the number of people using High Street dentists - figures show about half of adults have accessed NHS care in the past two years. But that does not take into account the vulnerable groups getting support from specialist services, those who do not need care or people opting to use private dentistry. Using theGP Patient Survey,external, which also asks questions about dentistry, the BBC has been able to provide estimates for the number of people who cannot get care, are put off getting care because of the cost or believe where they live NHS care is not available. The analysis shows the level of unmet need has remained pretty consistent for the past five years. The scale of the problems do vary from area to area. Places such as Bradford, Brighton, Cornwall and parts of Kent, Surrey, Norfolk and London have the worst levels of access with around one in six adults not getting care. Despite dental care being available on the NHS, some people still have to pay for it. Only those on low incomes, children and pregnant women get treatment for free. Others have to pay. Treatment is split into three payment bands from Â£22.70 for checks-ups, scale-and-polishes and X-rays through to Â£269.30 for complex care such as dentures and crowns. As a result, cost puts some people off coming forward for treatment, the analysis suggests. But greater numbers have found themselves turned away or believe there are no NHS appointments available locally. The BDA said there were a variety of reasons behind this. It pointed to figures showing three-quarters of practices have experienced difficulties filling posts and a 29% fall in funding per head in seven years once inflation was taken into account. The union has also been critical of the way the contract works - dentists are given block contracts meaning once they have seen their quota they do not get paid any extra. NHS England said it was ""actively working"" with local areas to better understand what was causing problems. Work has been done to make the contract more flexible. Patients who are trying to find out what services are available can use the NHS website to find which local dentists are accepting NHS patients, a spokeswoman said.

"The Lib Dems have promised to recruit 20,000 more teachers in England and spend billions more on schools if they are elected to government. The party, which will launch its manifesto later, says it will reverse school cuts with an ""emergency cash injection"" of Â£4.6bn next year. The extra funding would rise to Â£10.6bn by 2024/25 compared to 2019/20, under their plan. The party is also promising to widen access to free school lunches. They plan to spend an extra Â£1.1bn per year on meals for every primary school child, and secondary school children whose families receive universal credit (UC). Since 2018, children in school year three or above from families on UC have qualified only if the family's annual employment income is less than Â£7,400. The anti-Brexit party says Â£10bn will be taken from what they claim will be a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" from staying in the EU to increase school funding. Leader Jo Swinson also flagged up another likely manifesto policy in an interview with ITV on Tuesday, saying the party had plans for a frequent flyer tax. ""We've got plans for a frequent flyer lever that would certainly be discouraging many flights but would be raising revenue from that, so it wouldn't be an outright ban or limit but would be an effective measure to change behaviour,"" she said. Labour pledges counsellors for every secondary school A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 Your Questions: Can fathers get maternity pay? The Liberal Democrats say their extra spending would boost teacher numbers by 20,000 over five years. To attract and retain teachers, the party says it will increase starting salaries to Â£30,000, and guarantee a pay rise of at least 3% a year over five years. The party would also spend Â£7bn on improving school buildings over the next five years. On a visit to Trumpington Park primary school in Cambridge, Ms Swinson said the extra investment in education was essential. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""School leaders that I've spoken to would very much welcome this money, and, yes, we do need to keep spending."" She said her party's prediction that staying in the EU would provide an extra Â£50bn a year for public services was based on ""conservative estimates"" of better economic growth. ""By stopping Brexit there will be an uptick to our economy, there is no independent forecast which doesn't suggest that's true,"" she said. Defending her party's plan to replace Ofsted, she said the school watchdog's brand was ""broken"", and it should be ""entirely scrapped and replaced"". The Lib Dems would set up an ""independent body"" to oversee curriculum changes, she added, which would stop ""political interference"". After a decade of tightening budgets, the political parties in England are competing to offer more cash to England's schools.  Since 2010, the spending per pupil in England has fallen by 8% in real terms, despite being at its highest ever level in cash terms. That's because of rising costs for schools including teachers' pay, employer pension contributions, national insurance and utility bills. These plans by the Lib Dems go further than the commitment already made by the Conservatives. They would reverse the spending cuts, and because there is a commitment further into the future, offer schools the prospect of a real terms increase. Recruiting, and just as importantly keeping, teachers is a big challenge in England. But pay is not the only issue, with many teachers complaining about workload. The Lib Dems, like Labour, say scrapping the end of primary tests and replacing Ofsted would help take the pressure off schools. Labour and the Conservatives have yet to publish their election manifestos. But in August, Tory leader Boris Johnson promised an increase in funding for English schools that would amount to Â£7.1bn more than at present by 2022-23. The independent Institute for Fiscal studies said this would return funding to the levels of 2009. The government also proposed in September to raise starting salaries for teachers to Â£30,000 by 2022-23. Labour plans to increase education spending - and its conference voted in September to abolish private schools and redistribute their assets to the state sector, if Labour wins power on 12 December.

"Standard Chartered has become the second corporate partner to sever ties with the Duke of York's business mentoring initiative, Pitch@Palace. The bank joined accountancy firm KPMG in pulling support for the scheme. It said it was not renewing its sponsorship for ""commercial reasons"". Several businesses and universities are reviewing their association with Prince Andrew following a BBC interview about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Sources have told the BBC the decisions by Standard Chartered and KPMG were made before the Newsnight interview. Prince Andrew cancelled a planned visit to flood-hit areas of Yorkshire on Tuesday, three days after the interview aired,the Sun newspaper reported.,external It is understood the visit was deemed inappropriate in the midst of an election campaign. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were asked about whether the duke was ""fit for purpose"" during their head-to-head debate on ITV on Tuesday evening. The Labour leader said there were ""very, very serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law"". The prime minister said: ""I think all our sympathies should be, obviously, with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the law must certainly take its course."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says monarchy ""beyond reproach"" In his Newsnight interview,the Queen's third child said he still did not regret his friendship with US financier Epstein - who took his own life in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in the US. The interview has provoked a backlash, with businesses, charities and other institutions announcing that they were reviewing their association with the prince. In addition to Standard Chartered and KPMG ending their support for Pitch@Palace: Pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca and Hult International Business School are reviewing their partnerships with the business scheme Outward Bound, the charity the Duke of Edinburgh was patron of for 65 years, has called a board meeting to discuss the prince's patronage London Metropolitan University said it will consider the prince's role as its patron, saying it ""opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse and human trafficking"" University of Huddersfield students are calling for the prince to be sacked as their chancellor Three Australian universities listed as partners of Pitch@Palace Australia - Bond University, the University of Wollongong and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology - said they had either ended their relationship with the initiative or would not be continuing it On Monday, the Huddersfield students' union panel passed a motion to lobby the prince to resign as their chancellor. The university has since said that it listens to its students' views and will ""now be consulting with them over the coming weeks"". Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The duke has stood by his decision to speak out, aftercritics labelled the interview a ""car crash"". But speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Tuesday, Huddersfield student Tristan Smith criticised the prince over his friendship with Epstein. He accused Prince Andrew of ""trying to dismiss"" the row and failing to recognise Epstein's victims. Meanwhile, a woman who has accused Epstein of sexually abusing her as a 15-year-old hasurged Prince Andrew to share information about his former friend. The accuser, identified as ""Jane Doe 15"", did not accuse Prince Andrew of any wrongdoing but called on him and others to come forward and give a statement under oath. ""Jane Doe 15"", left, gave a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred Elsewhere, former home secretary Jacqui Smith alleged that Prince Andrew made racist comments to her during a state dinner. ""I have to say the conversation left us slack-jawed with the things that he felt it was appropriate to say,"" she told the LBC election podcast. And Rohan Silva, who was an adviser to former prime minister David Cameron, also accused the prince of using a racial slur in his presence. A Buckingham Palace spokesman strenuously denied the claims, adding that Prince Andrew ""does not tolerate racism in any form"". There is no wholesale repudiation of Prince Andrew's public role. But whether as a result of the interview he gave, or because of the continuing swirl of allegations, there is a falling away of support for the prince, both corporate and political. The former Labour lord chancellor and justice secretary, Lord Falconer, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he thought the time had come for Prince Andrew to step away from public duties. Those close to Prince Andrew say that a withdrawal from public life is not under consideration. But if support continues to seep from him, it will undermine his public position. There was also further reaction to the prince's BBC appearance. Actress Rose McGowan - one of the most prominent figures of the #MeToo movement - told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she thought it was not a truthful interview. ""It's also certainly not the mark of someone who is an empathetic character who cares about victims in any way,"" she added. The actress also said she wished more questions had been asked about Epstein's alleged victims. ""We can't forget there is human tragedy behind this... This has serious repercussions, serious ramifications and serious pain that is involved in this story."" However, Alastair Campbell - Tony Blair's ex-communications chief - said that although he thought the interview was a ""mistake"", it was not ""as bad as it is now being defined"". Mr Campbell, who was another high-profile Briton to be named in Epstein's 97-page ""black book"" of contacts, also told the Today programme that he met the financier on a visit to the US for a funeral and found him to be ""a bit creepy"". ANALYSIS:'Little apology or remorse' TRANSCRIPT:Read Prince Andrew's interview in full AS IT HAPPENED:Newsnight interview REACTION:Prince Andrew 'bulldozed' into interview Prince Andrew's BBC interview followed allegations by Virginia Giuffre, known at the time as Virginia Roberts, who claims the prince had sex with her on three occasions - the first when she was aged 17.

"This video can not be played Protesters outside Malta's parliament demand justice A Maltese businessman has been arrested as part of the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia two years ago. Yorgen Fenech was detained by armed officers after his yacht was intercepted and searched. It comes a day after PM Joseph Muscat said he would consider a pardon for the alleged middleman in the case. Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption blogger, was killed by a car bomb near her home in October 2017. Malta's handling of the case has drawn international criticism. Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Malta journalist 'threatened for years' On Wednesday, several hundred people protested outside parliament in Valetta demanding the resignation of the prime minister. Demonstrators trapped one minister in his car, banging on the roof as police officers struggled to move them back. Mr Muscat referred to Mr Fenech as ""a person of interest"" in the case when addressing local media. A government source later confirmed to the BBC that Mr Fenech was arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation. The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia stunned Maltese society ""The fact that the country's institutions were given the resources to carry out this operation - a major operation, to ensure no-one fled the country or tried to flee the country - shows the government's resolve and mine,"" the prime minister said. ""We are leaving no stone unturned."" Witnesses quoted by the Times of Malta said Mr Fenech's luxury yacht was intercepted by an armed patrol boat as it left the port of Portomaso, north of Valletta, early on Wednesday. Yorgen Fenech is a well known businessman in Malta On Tuesday, Mr Muscat said the alleged money launderer suspected of being the middleman would first have to give evidence in court before a pardon could be issued. ""I gave a mandate to the attorney general to negotiate with the person's lawyers to take an unprecedented step,"" the prime minister was quoted as saying. ""If the person collaborates and the information provided is sufficient to prosecute the mastermind of this crime, they will receive a presidential pardon."" Mr Fenech was head of the Tumas Group and a director of energy generating company Electrogas, but had recently resigned from both positions, according to documents made public on Wednesday. He was also identified by Malta's Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) as being the owner of a Dubai-registered company called 17 Black. This was later confirmed to the BBC. Yorgen Fenech's yacht was taken back to Portomaso and sealed off by police In Junethe Council of Europe named 17 Black in a resolution,externaloutlining ""fundamental weaknesses"" that had allowed major scandals to go unchecked in Malta. Its report said 17 Black had been expected to make large monthly payments to secret Panama companies owned by senior Maltese officials and had also received large sums of money from an Azerbaijani national. The German industrial group Siemens, which is a shareholder in Electrogas, said in a statement on Wednesday that after corruption allegations against Mr Fenech ""became known some time ago"" it confronted him about the reports. ""Due to the public doubts in Mr Fenech's integrity, Siemens urged that he be dismissed from his membership on the Board of Directors,"" Siemens said. As well as the suspected middleman - who has not been named - three other suspects are in custody over the journalist's murder. This video can not be played Andrew Borg Cardona, a friend of Daphne Caruana Galizia, speaks about her death Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the car bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Vincent Muscat is not related to the prime minister. She was an investigative reporter who, in her 30-year career, had worked for the local Sunday Times and Malta Independent newspapers. But by the time she was killed she was best known for her anti-corruption blog Running Commentary, which she had been compiling since 2008. After a piece on the Panama Papers leak and its implications in Malta, the news site Politico described her as ""a one-woman WikiLeaks, crusading against untransparency and corruption in Malta, an island nation famous for both"". Caruana Galizia, pictured just a few months before her death, was best known for her blog Running Commentary She was regularly threatened or hit with defamation claims from the powerful figures she exposed. She was also on the receiving end of intimidation and threats to her life. Before her death, Caruana Galizia was considering leaving Malta out of concern for her safety. However, she refused to be put under permanent police protection as she said it would make it impossible for her to do her job. She published her final blog post just half an hour before she was killed. ""There are crooks everywhere you look now,"" she wrote. ""The situation is desperate.""

"Hallie Rubenhold has worked as a curator for the National Portrait Gallery and as a university lecturer. A book that tells the ""untold"" stories of the women killed by Jack the Ripper has won a literary prize. Hallie Rubenhold's The Five took this year's Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction, it was announced on Tuesday. The author and historian bagged Â£50,000 for the book, which attempts to give a voice to the women murdered mysteriously in Victorian east London. ""These were ordinary people, like you and I, who happened to fall upon hard times,"" said Rubenhold. Hacking the Ripper - BBC News The book reconstructs the lives of the five women - Mary Ann ""Polly"" Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly - killed by the unidentified serial killer in the Whitechapel area of the city, often using little more than the DNA of a single hair. ""There's so much in their stories that we can take away that tells us about how we live today: everything from homelessness to addiction to domestic violence,"" she went on. ""And people become victims because society doesn't care about them.""

Rebecca Armstrong fromiNews,externalwrote that Rubenhold was ""giving Jack the Ripper's victims back their voices"". ""Throughout the book, Rubenhold uses the particulars of her subjects' lives as a springboard to depict social circumstances that shaped millions of lives,"" added Wendy Smith inThe Washington Post.,external Jad Adams from theLiterary Review,externalacknowledged how the book did not include any gory accounts of how each victim met her death.

"Two of the people found on the ferry were taken to hospital for treatment Police in the Netherlands have arrested a Romanian lorry driver after 25 stowaways were found in a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for the UK. They were found at around 19:00 (18:00 GMT), forcing the ship to return to the port of Vlaardingen near Rotterdam. The Danish-registered ferry had been en route to Felixstowe. The incident comes just weeks after the bodies of 39 people were found in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex in eastern England. The stowaways found on Tuesday received medical attention at the port of Vlaardingen, where police were waiting for the ship's arrival. Two were taken to hospital to receive extra medical care, while the other 23 people were transferred to a police facility after a medical check-up, authorities said. Essex lorry deaths: Who are the victims? Essex lorry deaths: What we know The stowaways, whose nationalities have not yet been confirmed, were found in a refrigerated container on a lorry on board the ferry, authorities said. The driver of the lorry was detained and was being questioned over possible involvement, police told the Dutch broadcaster NOS. Police told the broadcast that crew members found the stowaways and alerted authorities after hearing ""sounds coming from the cooling container"". A search of the ferry involving police dogs was carried out but no-one else was found. Seafarers' charity Stella Maris said it was important to recognise the ""hugely stressful"" nature of these types of incidents for crew. The bodies found in the Essex container last month were those of Vietnamese nationals who had arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Two lorry drivers have since been charged with manslaughter, and several other men have been arrested in connection with the case.

"This video can not be played Adoptive mum Catherine Griffiths' children suffer from Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder An adoptive mum has spoken of her ""lonely and isolating"" journey to getting a diagnosis for her children's Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. It was eventually discovered Catherine Griffiths' two children had the condition which can affect those whose mothers drank alcohol during pregnancy. Just one of Wales' seven health boards has specific guidelines for diagnosis. The Welsh Government said it was investing in new legislation for those with additional learning needs. Ms Griffiths' adoptive children are half-siblings, born to the same alcoholic mother - there are five other adopted siblings who are with other families. Some of them have also been diagnosed with FASD. Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder: The 'heartbreaking' reality The 'brutal reality' for alcohol-damaged children Conversation boosts honesty over drinking in pregnancy, study finds ""Someone somewhere should have said - 'we can see that you're struggling, can we help you in any way',"" she said. Ms Griffiths, from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, has lost her hair due to the stress and worries of raising children with FASD. ""We, as parents, are getting older and I'm scared for my children's future,"" she said. ""We need urgent action so that everyone has heard of FASD. Everyone needs to be kinder to people that are different."" Catherine Griffiths lost her hair due to the stress and worries of raising children with FASD Those with FASD may have a smaller than average head, growth problems, distinctive facial features and behavioural problems They are also susceptible to cerebral palsy, learning difficulties, behavioural problems, conditions affecting the liver, kidneys, heart or other organs, and hearing and sight complications It is estimated 3.2% of babies born in the UK are affected by FASD - that is nearly four times the rate of autism Ms Griffiths said: ""We need a Wales-wide strategy to help people with FASD throughout their lives, not just as children. ""We need a centre in every health board where they can specialise in autism, ADHD and FASD."" The idea would be that such conditions could be assessed and diagnosed in one place. ""What we really need is training in schools and colleges so that teachers and support workers can learn strategies that can help,"" Ms Griffiths said. ""FASD means trying something different, not trying harder. Unfortunately, the current curriculum doesn't allow for that."" Kate Young, director of learning disabilities organisation All Wales Forum, said Ms Griffiths' story was not an ""isolated one"". She said raising awareness was vital. ""Many children and adults who live with it are often faced with unintended discrimination due to a wider ignorance around the symptoms and a lack of understanding on how to offer support,"" she added. Campaigners say FASD is often misunderstood The Welsh Government said: ""OurHealthy Child Wales Programme,externalsets out what support children and their families can expect from health boards to support early years health and development. ""We are also investing Â£20m to support new legislation for learners with additional learning needs to get the support they need, including where this has arisen as a result of FASD, autism and ADHD.""

"The Welsh Government runs education in Wales, with a Liberal Democrat minister in charge The Liberal Democrats claim Wales would gain an extra Â£560m a year due to their election pledges on education. The party has unveiled a Â£10bn boost to schools in England in its manifesto. Education is devolved, so more spending in England triggers extra cash for the Welsh Government to use as it sees fit. Pledging to stop Brexit if it wins a majority, the party says it would herald a wider remit for the assembly with powers over policing and prisons. Lib Dem plans to spend more on services in England would generate an extra Â£1.87bn for the Welsh Government in 2024/25, they said. That compares to the Welsh Government's revenue budget of around Â£14.4bn this year. ""The election of a Liberal Democrat majority government on a clear stop Brexit platform will provide a democratic mandate to stop this mess, revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU,"" the manifesto, launched Wednesday, said. ""We are unashamedly fighting to stay in the European Union, and we are the strongest party of Remain."" Why did the Lib Dems go tough on spending? A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats Who should I vote for? Election policy guide Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds said she would urge ministers in Cardiff to spend the extra money promised on schools, to give children ""the best start in life"". Her party colleague Kirsty Williams is education minister in the Labour-led Welsh Government. ""Our ambitious plans to reverse cuts to education in England would provide Â£560m more that the Welsh Government can spend on our schools and teachers, to ensure we continue to build an education system fit for the 21st Century,"" Ms Dodds said. The Lib Dems say the money would come from what they claim would be a Â£50bn boost to public finances by cancelling Brexit. Jo Swinson said her party's plans would give Wales an extra Â£560m in cash Funding for public services in Wales would be 13% higher in five years compared to this year's budget, under the Liberal Democrats' plans. Inflation will eat into that, and we cannot yet compare it to detailed plans from Labour and the Conservatives who have not published their manifestos. The biggest contribution to the Lib Dems' extra spending is based on the economic growth they expect to see if Brexit was cancelled. Although forecasts say the economy will grow faster if the UK were to remain in the EU, that cannot be guaranteed. The Lib Dems also intend to raise money by putting 1p on all income tax bands. The Welsh Government is free to spend its budget - including any additional funding - on its own priorities. It also has powers to vary the level of income tax so could remove the 1p tax rise if it wanted. Revenue funding covers day-to-day spending, such as wages, and does not include the capital funding that pays to build infrastructure. The manifesto pledges a ""written, federal constitution"" that would make the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliaments permanent institutions. As it stands, the assembly can technically be abolished through an act of parliament. The Lib Dems would devolve powers over criminal justice to politicians in Cardiff Bay, giving them control over youth justice, probation services, prisons and policing. Criminal justice in Wales is currently overseen by the UK government in London. Plans for policing promise to invest Â£1bn across England and Wales to restore community policing, ""enough for two new police officers in every ward"". The Lib Dems promised to separate England and Wales' legal systems to reflect the growing difference in laws, and to devolve air passenger duty. This video can not be played What does devolution mean? Police and crime commissioners would be abolished and replaced with local boards made up of councillors, while the party would fund a two percent pay rise for police officers. The Lib Dems said it would include the Welsh Government on UK policy making on drug policy and student visas, and create a joint climate council of the nations to coordinate action on the climate emergency. On funding for Wales, the Lib Dems said it recognised that Wales is underfunded and will seek ""over a parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an equitable level."" Wales' devolved services are mostly funded from the block grant, which comes from the UK government. Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

"Music streaming generated Â£829m for the UK music industry last year Spotify, Apple and Amazon Music have revived the fortunes of the music industry, but fans aren't getting enough choice, a new report claims. It says streaming services are too similar, offering the same collection of songs with little price variation. Appealing to older music fans and offering ""super-premium"" features could double the value of the market, from Â£829m this year to Â£1.6bn in 2023. The findings came in a report for the Entertainment Retailers Association. ""There's a major prize at stake,"" said Pedro Sanches, of consultancy firm OC&C, who conducted the study. The current ""all-you-can-eat"" streaming model had ""enjoyed enormous success, in part because of its simplicity,"" he said, ""but further innovation will drive more growth"". The report identified several new avenues, including premium subscriptions that offer access to exclusive content and merchandise; and expanding popular family and student plans to other demographics. Subscription streaming services have become increasingly important to the music industry, at a time when CD sales and downloads are in sharp decline. A total of 91 billion songs were played on Spotify, Apple Music and their competitors last year - the equivalent of 1,300 songs per person in the UK - and streaming now accounts for nearly two thirds (63.6%) of all music consumption in the UK. The ERA's research was commissioned amid concerns that the surge in subscriptions could stagnate. ""Streaming has been the biggest news in the industry for the last 10 years,"" the organisation's CEO, Kim Bayley, told the BBC. ""The younger generation are very firmly in the streaming environment, and saturation point is approaching for under-25s, so we wanted to see where future growth will come from"". The report found that, left to its own devices, the UK streaming market would continue to expand by 5-7% every year, reaching Â£1.1bn in 2023. But finding ways to tempt non-subscribers could result in a Â£500m boost, generating revenues of Â£1.6bn. ""It's fair to say even we were surprised just how positive the results were,"" Bayley said. ""There's lots of potential."" Lessons could also be learned from other entertainment providers, she added. ""Think about the way Sky [television] bundles things together - with different tiers for sport and movies and entertainment. That's the sort of thing you could do with music - create more channels, break it up a bit, and pay for the bits you want."" 'Streaming services are too similar' Can a record store work in a digital age? Is this the end of owning music? The need for a more diverse music streaming experience was recently highlighted by Warner Music CEO Mark Cooper. ""The streaming offerings in music have not been as consumer-friendly as they could have been,"" he said in New York last week. ""Right now, there's a 50 million-track universe and it's either free or $10 [per month], plus or minus. ""My view is that if [streaming services were] organised to allow people to choose by genre, or by number of tracks per day, hi-res sound, global [or] local, whatever it is, the music industry and the tech companies would have been ahead [of where they are now] by way of revenue optimisation."" The ERA's research was released on the same day it was revealed that the UK Music industry had contributed Â£5.2bn to the UK economy in 2018. The success of stars like Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa helped exports soar to Â£2.7bn; while the live music sector made Â£1.1bn - up 10% from Â£991 million in 2017, despite Glastonbury taking a fallow year. However, trade body UK Music warned that the new talent was being threatened by cuts to musical education and the continued closure of small music venues.

"Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson faced off on ITV in the first head-to-head debate of the election campaign Head to head. Mano a mano.Without Jo Swinson or the other party leaders, this was Boris Johnson v Jeremy Corbyn. And the battle online was just as raucous as the debate on screen. While much of UK political Twitter was busysliding uninvited into Arron Banks' DMs, Labour's 280-character cheerleaders were propelling #WinForCorbyn towards the upper echelons of the list of top UK trends. Nothing says ""for the many, not the few"" quite like furiously retweeting a hashtag which implicitly asks you to consider not so much what the country can do for you, but what it might do for Jezza (and, incidentally, the Labour leader's nickname also went briefly viral).

Later, Boris Johnson was asked if the truth mattered in this election. ""I think it does,"" he responded, to laughter from the audience. It wasn't the only time pointed laughter was heard from the studio audience, with Mr Corbyn's failure to spell out his position on Brexit also eliciting snorts. On the Facebook front, a second-screen battle was being waged, with official party pages quickly firing out posts to respond to key points in the debate. ""THE MOMENT OF THE DEBATE SO FAR,"" one Conservative post declared over a video of Johnson responding to questions on the NHS: Minutes later the Labour Party shared a video of its own, declaring: ""You can't trust the Tories with the NHS."" And then, via an odd forced handshake and further sparring, the debate drew to a close - and the rush for supporters to declare their man the winner began. ""Boris Johnson... was the undisputed winner of that debate,""trumpeted Robert Jenrick,external.

"The Green Party of England and Wales has launched its 2019 manifesto, called If Not Now, When? It sets out the polices the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,external, sets out a ""Green New Deal"" - proposing measures from replacing fossil fuels to insulating houses and investing in cycle paths. Greenhouse gas emissions would be cut to zero, to tackle climate change. All major parties promise strong action on the climate, but the Greens are the most radical by far. The Conservatives passed a law obliging the UK to halt virtually all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Labour is aiming for earlier than 2050. The Liberal Democrats are even more ambitious, with a 2045 target. But the Greens say emissions must be eliminated by 2030. It would mean, within a decade, petrol and diesel vehicles being replaced. Gas heating boilers would be switched for, say, hydrogen. All homes would be well insulated and all emissions from industry avoided or captured in rocks. People would eat less meat, drive less in smaller cleaner cars and curb flying. The advisory Committee on Climate Change, which provides independent advice to government, says 2050 is the earliest credible date for achieving net zero emissions for most sectors of the economy. These targets would apply to the whole of the UK. How big an issue is climate change for voters? This video can not be played Jonathan Bartley: ""The green new deal is an an idea whose time has come"" Funding for the NHS would rise by Â£6bn a year until 2030, with a further Â£1bn per year for nursing higher education. The Green Party is earmarking Â£6bn a year of the money raised from its tax policies to increase the NHS budget in England above existing plans. Labour has committed to a similar annual increase by 2023/24, but the Green policy would kick in immediately and run till 2030. But predicting what the NHS will need a decade from now is anyone's guess. The party wants a ""huge"" reduction in private sector involvement without saying quite how much will be retained (for example using private hospitals for routine surgery). There is a push for devolution of healthcare to local communities. But there can be wide variations in quality in different areas ,and removing national level scrutiny may not always be in the best interest of patients. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run their own health services, but they will also benefit from any extra funding. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? Tackle climate change by transforming the economy The Green Party manifesto envisages a significant revolution in how the economy functions, spending over a trillion pounds during the five-year Parliament. The basic philosophy of spending tens of billions on decarbonisation is common to most of the parties standing for election, but the Greens argue that the low interest rates currently charged on government borrowing create ""an unparalleled opportunity for public investment"" to tackle the issue. A carbon tax will apply to all oil and gas extraction and to the use of petrol, diesel and aviation fuels. This will raise consumer prices, and frequent flyers will face a levy. Petrol and diesel cars will be phased out by 2030. The manifesto focuses on the new jobs in new clean and green industries, but clearly under these plans many jobs will be lost in currently existing carbon-intensive sectors - from manufacturing to automotive to aerospace. This will apply to the whole of the UK economy, although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may have some freedom in how they implement the policies. What are the challenges for the UK's economy? How much tax do British people pay? Encourage farmers to adopt greener working practices, and reduce meat in our diet. The Greens want 50% of farms to be doing agro-forestry in a decade - that's growing vegetables or raising livestock between rows of trees. This would change the way the countryside looks, but the farmers' union say it's not impossible. The Greens insist the UK must reduce emissions of methane from cows and sheep, by phasing in a tax on meat and dairy products over 10 years. This will be controversial. But they say they'll use the revenue to help farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods. Much of this will apply to the whole of the UK. How would the Greens fund Â£1tn climate pledge? CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Thousands of new homes for social rent every year. The Greens will give local councils the power to bring empty houses back into use and setting an affordable living rent for all tenants. It is an ambitious and radical vision for housing delivery that, they argue, puts quality of life first - thinking about local green space, access to cycle ways and pedestrian access to shops and transport. However, it sees the state taking a much more prominent role in the delivery and management of housing, particularly in the rental sector, a change of emphasis that will concern some house-builders and landlords. Housing policy and some elements of transport are devolved. No tuition fees for undergraduates and write-off debt for ex-students who paid a Â£9,000-a-year fee. This is a big offer from the Greens to young people. The cost to cover a single undergraduate year group during their whole time at university costs about Â£9bn. The cost of writing off existing debt for graduates who have paid fees of Â£9,000 a year or more is estimated by economists at about Â£33bn. Education is devolved so this will only apply in England. Scottish students already don't pay fees at Scottish universities. Your Questions Answered: Education and tuition fees A Universal Basic Income for all adults, regardless of their income. The Greens say this would simplify the current system, replacing most existing benefits except housing benefit. They say this will free people from job insecurity and help those not reached by the current system. They say that no-one currently on benefits would be worse off under Green UBI, which would roll-out completely by 2025. There would be extra for families with children and pensioners would get Â£178 - nearly Â£10 more than the current state pension. It's expensive - the Greens have costed their proposal at Â£86bn on top of current pension and benefit spending of Â£256bn. It would be paid for by a tax on carbon emissions and other tax changes, such as removing the income tax personal allowance. Opponents say other welfare arrangements would more efficiently help those who need it most. This is likely to apply to the whole of the UK, although devolved nations may have some discretion in implementing it. Get 10 million homes to the top energy rating within 10 years. This is an ambitious goal. Your Energy Performance Certificate, or EPC, is a measure of how energy-efficient your home is. Almost every building has one, andyou can check your rating online,external. The average rating is D. Very few homes get the highest A rating, which is what the Green Party is aiming for. The Greens are particularly interested in fixing existing buildings. They call this plan ""a deep retrofitting"" which, along with better insulation in every home, will cost Â£24.6bn. UK nations have control over their own housing policies so the Green Party would need to coordinate with the devolved administrations. Extend plastic bag tax to bottles, single-use plastics and micro-plastics. All major parties now have plans to curb plastic waste. The Greens want to extend the plastic bag tax to plastic bottles, single-use plastics and microplastics - and to expand plastic bottle deposit schemes. They would ban the production of single-use plastics for use in packaging. But some experts fear that that apparently straightforward policies developed at a time of political stress can lead to the use of other materials which might be worse for the planet in different ways. For instance, glass bottles, for instance, don't typically harm wildlife, but they are much heavier than plastic, so they create higher carbon emissions when they are transported. At the moment these kinds of policies are decided separately by the UK government for England and by the devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Who's in charge during an election? Will this be a Brexit election? Free personal care at home for people aged 65 and over. Older people who need a lot of help with tasks such as washing, dressing and medication would no longer have to pay for that help at home. Such a system has operated for 20 years in Scotland, where a weekly contribution of Â£177 is also made to the cost of residential care. The Green Party manifesto doesn't mention residential care - this might explain their low estimate of the overall cost of free personal care. It says councils in England would get Â£4.5bn a year to provide this support. Experts estimate the cost of free personal care in England in both settings would be Â£6bn a year in 2020/21 rising to Â£8bn by the end of the next decade. Where in England does care cost the most? Also scrap HS2 and electrify the whole rail network. The Greens want the car to be increasingly seen as out-dated. Money for cycle routes would represent a massive increase on previous governments' spending. A rail network which runs solely off electricity is a noble promise, however, at present roughly two thirds of the UK's network is not electrified. And their wish for more train services hits a more basic problem: in a lot places there simply isn't any spare capacity. That takes us to one of their other grabby proposals: scrap HS2. The project hasn't been well-managed and will possibly cost more than Â£100bn. But the scheme is in motion and has already cost more than Â£7bn. Proponents say it's needed to free up capacity for more passengers and freight. The Greens' transport wish-list feels revolutionary, but some of it will be hard to achieve in a quick timeframe and without spending large sums of public money. Transport is partially devolved but overall policies on the UK's rail and road network are dealt with by the UK government. Where are the seats that could turn the election? Replace it with a ""fair and proportional"" alternative. Analysis by Tom Barton, BBC political correspondent:The Greens tell us they want to reform the UK's ""disgustingly unfair"" first-past-the-post voting system. Under it, the candidate with the most votes in a constituency becomes MP, with no benefits from coming a close second. In 2017, the Green Party won more than 500,000 votes, but had just one MP elected. Voting reform is popular among smaller parties and is perhaps the only issue that unites the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party. However, the public has been asked what it thinks about one proposal - introducing the Alternative Vote system under which voters would rank candidates - at a referendum in 2011. And 67% voted against it.

"The Lib Dems have promised to recruit 20,000 more teachers in England and spend billions more on schools if they are elected to government. The party, which will launch its manifesto later, says it will reverse school cuts with an ""emergency cash injection"" of Â£4.6bn next year. The extra funding would rise to Â£10.6bn by 2024/25 compared to 2019/20, under their plan. The party is also promising to widen access to free school lunches. They plan to spend an extra Â£1.1bn per year on meals for every primary school child, and secondary school children whose families receive universal credit (UC). Since 2018, children in school year three or above from families on UC have qualified only if the family's annual employment income is less than Â£7,400. The anti-Brexit party says Â£10bn will be taken from what they claim will be a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" from staying in the EU to increase school funding. Leader Jo Swinson also flagged up another likely manifesto policy in an interview with ITV on Tuesday, saying the party had plans for a frequent flyer tax. ""We've got plans for a frequent flyer lever that would certainly be discouraging many flights but would be raising revenue from that, so it wouldn't be an outright ban or limit but would be an effective measure to change behaviour,"" she said. Labour pledges counsellors for every secondary school A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000 Your Questions: Can fathers get maternity pay? The Liberal Democrats say their extra spending would boost teacher numbers by 20,000 over five years. To attract and retain teachers, the party says it will increase starting salaries to Â£30,000, and guarantee a pay rise of at least 3% a year over five years. The party would also spend Â£7bn on improving school buildings over the next five years. On a visit to Trumpington Park primary school in Cambridge, Ms Swinson said the extra investment in education was essential. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""School leaders that I've spoken to would very much welcome this money, and, yes, we do need to keep spending."" She said her party's prediction that staying in the EU would provide an extra Â£50bn a year for public services was based on ""conservative estimates"" of better economic growth. ""By stopping Brexit there will be an uptick to our economy, there is no independent forecast which doesn't suggest that's true,"" she said. Defending her party's plan to replace Ofsted, she said the school watchdog's brand was ""broken"", and it should be ""entirely scrapped and replaced"". The Lib Dems would set up an ""independent body"" to oversee curriculum changes, she added, which would stop ""political interference"". After a decade of tightening budgets, the political parties in England are competing to offer more cash to England's schools.  Since 2010, the spending per pupil in England has fallen by 8% in real terms, despite being at its highest ever level in cash terms. That's because of rising costs for schools including teachers' pay, employer pension contributions, national insurance and utility bills. These plans by the Lib Dems go further than the commitment already made by the Conservatives. They would reverse the spending cuts, and because there is a commitment further into the future, offer schools the prospect of a real terms increase. Recruiting, and just as importantly keeping, teachers is a big challenge in England. But pay is not the only issue, with many teachers complaining about workload. The Lib Dems, like Labour, say scrapping the end of primary tests and replacing Ofsted would help take the pressure off schools. Labour and the Conservatives have yet to publish their election manifestos. But in August, Tory leader Boris Johnson promised an increase in funding for English schools that would amount to Â£7.1bn more than at present by 2022-23. The independent Institute for Fiscal studies said this would return funding to the levels of 2009. The government also proposed in September to raise starting salaries for teachers to Â£30,000 by 2022-23. Labour plans to increase education spending - and its conference voted in September to abolish private schools and redistribute their assets to the state sector, if Labour wins power on 12 December.
