"This video can not be played ""He didn't have the courage"" An armed officer who stood outside a Florida school where a gunman killed 17 people last week ""certainly did a poor job"", US President Donald Trump says. Deputy Scot Peterson resigned after an investigation found he failed to confront the suspect. Mr Trump said Mr Peterson might be a ""coward"" who ""didn't react properly under pressure"". Florida's governor meanwhile called for law enforcement officers to be placed in every public school in the state. This video can not be played How young conservatives view #NeverAgain Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday morning, President Trump criticised the police officer who did not confront the perpetrator of the 14 February massacre in Parkland, Florida. ""He trained his whole life but when it came time to do something he didn't have the courage,"" he said. Mourning for the shooting victims continued in Parkland on Friday ""He certainly did a poor job."" ""But that's a case where somebody was outside, they're trained, they didn't react properly under pressure or they were coward,"" he added. The Republican president later touted his love for gun rights on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Maryland. He again proposed arming teachers as a solution to school safety, a method long championed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. Facebook 'regret' over shooting game demo Activists target companies tied to NRA NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif This video can not be played What the British think of arming teachers Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel revealed on Thursday that Mr Peterson, the 54-year-old school resource officer, stood outside while the alleged gunman shot students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He said video footage showed Mr Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said. Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' Asked what Mr Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said: ""Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer."" Mr Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. It is unclear if he will face charges. The suspect used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being captured later. School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. Employed by the local police or sheriff's office, they document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education. This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. There are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the US, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper,externalsaid he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (Â£54,137). Concerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about the former student charged with the massacre were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. Calls were also reportedly made to the authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about the suspect, including one saying he was planning to attack the school. A transcript of one call to the FBI was released to US media on Frida,externaly, in which a tipster warns that Mr Cruz ""wants to kill people"" and that ""he's going to explode"". The female caller, whose identification was redacted in the report, said that Mr Cruz once brought a bird inside ""threw it on his mother's kitchen counter and he started cutting it up"". She also warned that Mr Cruz was receiving an inheritance of $25,000 per year, and that he may spend that money on guns. Governor Rick Scott called for ""active shooter training"" for all students and staff at public schools in the state. He said he planned to raise Florida's minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old. Governor Scott also pledged to make it ""virtually impossible for anyone who has mental health issues to use guns."" ""If a court involuntarily commits someone because they are a risk to themselves or others, they would be required to surrender all firearms and not regain the right to purchase or possess a firearm until a court hearing,"" he said during a speech about a new proposal on guns in Tallahassee.

"Activists are putting pressure on companies with ties to the NRA, a powerful gun lobby A growing number of companies have cut ties with the National Rifle Association amid calls for a boycott of businesses linked to the US gun lobby after the Florida school shooting. United and Delta airlines joined car rental giants Hertz and Enterprise in ending discounts for NRA members. The murder of 17 people has prompted renewed calls for tighter gun controls. Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott has backed calls to raise the minimum age for buying a gun from 18 to 21. Mr Scott has been widely seen as an ally of the NRA who has previously opposed stricter laws in the state. However, he has come under mounting pressure to respond to the demands of students who survived the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Activists have tried to put pressure on the NRA since the shooting by targeting firms that offer discounts and other benefits to its members. They have flooded its corporate partners with comments on social media under the hashtag #BoycottNRA. Firms under pressure include delivery company FedEx and tech giants such as Amazon, which distributes NRA television programmes. Trump: Florida school officer 'didn't have the courage' US gun control: What is the NRA and why is it so powerful?

Other companies distanced themselves from the NRA on Friday and Saturday.

This video can not be played How young conservatives view #NeverAgain Insurance firm Chubb also said it had stopped underwriting an NRA-branded insurance policy three months ago. Delta Air Lines and United followed suit on Saturday, saying that they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website. Both airlines had been offering special flight discounts to NRA members travelling to the association's annual meeting in May. In Florida, the president of the Florida Education Association, which represents teachers' unions, also called on the state to look at pension holdings in gun companies ina statement to the Miami Herald newspaper,external. The NRA, which claims five million members, shot back at those corporations on Saturday, saying the moves punished the organisation's members in a ""shameful display of political and civic cowardice"". ""In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve,""the NRA said,external. ""Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world."" The NRA has previously said people upset about the shooting should focus on lapses by law enforcement and mental health professionals.

On Friday, the governor of Florida urged state lawmakers to restrict access to firearms for young people and the mentally ill. Rick Scott said his aim was for Florida to ""require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older,"" adding that the he wanted to make it ""virtually impossible"" for anyone with mental health issues to acquire a gun. Mr Trump earlier said he supported the proposal to raise the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18, and said he believed the NRA would back such a proposal. ""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" In other developments: It has emerged that an unidentified woman called the FBI on 5 January to say she was worried that Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman, would get into a school, ""shooting the place up"". The woman said the information had already been passed to police and she had not heard back Police have released previous recordings of 911 calls reportedly made by Nikolas Cruz,external,, in which he says that someone he was living with at the time was ""going to gut me"" President Trump said an armed officer stationed at the school who did not enter the building where the shooting was taking place was a ""coward"" CNN reports that in addition to the armed officer,three Broward County deputies were waiting outside the school doing nothing to confront the shooter,externalwhen Coral Springs police arrived This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. The campaign comes as US businesses increasingly find themselves entangled in political debates, as activists target them on issues such as LGBTQ rights, as well as ties to the president. Companies such asretailer Nordstromand sportswear brand Under Armour are among the firms that have been subject to calls for boycotts from the left and right. Executives serving on presidential councils, including the formerchief executive of Uber, have resigned from the advisory groups after consumer pressure.The councils eventually disbanded last summer.

"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The UN Security Council is struggling to agree a resolution seeking a ceasefire in Syria and has put back a vote until Saturday. The vote has already been delayed several times since Thursday. Russia wanted changes to a draft that calls for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. Western diplomats have accused Russia, Syria's key ally, of stalling for time. France said failure to act may spell the end of the UN itself. Minds have been focused amid outrage at the plight of civilians in the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave. Activists say 462 people have now been killed there this week. Warplanes maintained the bombardment on Friday, witnesses said. Douma and Hamouriyeh were among areas hit. Western powers suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the rebel-held enclave on the edge of Damascus. The United States, the UK and France had called for the resolution to be approved without delay. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said a truce had to be followed by immediate, unhindered access to the Eastern Ghouta. Commenting on Friday evening, US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. ""What those three countries have done to people over the last, short period of time is a disgrace,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Washington. The draft, put forward by Kuwait and Sweden, calls for a nationwide truce to go into effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. Medical evacuations and aid deliveries would start 48 hours after that. The draft says 5.6 million people in 1,244 communities across the country are in acute need. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Sweden's UN ambassador Olof Skoog told the BBC that getting aid to the Eastern Ghouta, where conditions were described by the UN secretary general as ""hell on earth"", was the main objective. ""I think that without the pressure coming from a united Security Council things are not happening the way they should on the ground,"" he said. ""So I think for the council it's a little bit less about the details and more about giving a political pressure to ensure that this happens."" Already overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties France's UN ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre said the UN's inability to help Syrian civilians would result in a devastating loss of credibility. ""The Syrian tragedy must not also become a graveyard for the United Nations,"" he added. The draft resolution also calls for all parties to avoid establishing military positions in civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. Sieges of populated areas should be lifted. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to back the resolution. Under the terms of the draft resolution, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This could include the two biggest rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. Faylaq al-Rahman has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front. Mr Lavrov told reporters his country would be prepared to vote for the ceasefire under certain conditions. ""There are no guarantees that [the rebels] will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,"" he told a briefing. He said Russia had proposed ""a formula which would make the ceasefire real"". The Su-57, Russia's most advanced fighter plane, has been sent to Syria Meanwhile, two of Russia's most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, have been sent to its coastal Hmeimim airbase, Russian military sources told BBC Russian. The sources said the stealth fighter planes were still undergoing flight tests and there was no confirmation they had yet been used in combat. For the sixth day running, Syrian government forces have pounded the Eastern Ghouta. A witness in Douma speaking to Reuters news agency early on Friday said the bombing there was the most intense so far. Syrian state TV says rebels have shelled Damascus, killing one and injuring dozens more. The US has also accused Russia of attacking Ghouta,external, allegations that Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as ""groundless"". The number killed since Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta has risen to 462, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says, at least 99 of them children. Barrel bombs and shell fire have rained down on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Rescue workers said the town of Douma came under sustained attack on Thursday The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and insisted it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that dominate the enclave.

On Saturday temperatures fell as low as -5.5C in Anglesey, north Wales and the cold spell is expected to intensify from Sunday night into Monday. The Met Office has issued an amber cold weather alert, which warns of increased health risks to vulnerable and elderly people. It has alsoissued two yellow weather warnings for snow,external.

Showers could continue later into the week. Two weather warnings have been issued for Monday and Tuesday The heavier showers are expected on Monday night and Tuesday, she added. Although there is a chance some areas could see between five and ten centimetres of snow, other areas may experience much lighter flurries.

The meteorological start of spring is Thursday, 1 March, when average temperatures are usually 10C in the south east and 9C in Manchester. But this year 1 March will fall right in the middle of the cold spell, which is being caused by an area of high pressure moving north into Scandinavia drawing cold air in from the east. Mr Bowles said: ""It's expected to stay cold all of next week. Spring will come eventually but it will be postponed. Some parts of Scotland have already seen heavy snow this month ""We haven't had temperatures that low in late February since 2013. It's not unheard of. There are records that are lower than that. ""But it is quite unusual, particularly as it's quite late in the season."" Public Health England said it is ""critical"" to keep an eye on anyone over 65, young children or people with heart or lung conditions. Dr Thomas Waite, of the PHE Extreme Events team, said:  ""Cold temperatures, indoors and out, pose real health risks to many and every winter we know that thousands of people get ill and even die following exposure to cold conditions.

The meteorological start of spring is Thursday, 1 March, when average temperatures are usually 10C in the south east and 9C in Manchester. But this year 1 March will fall right in the middle of the cold spell, which is being caused by an area of high pressure moving north into Scandinavia drawing cold air in from the east. Mr Bowles said: ""It's expected to stay cold all of next week. Spring will come eventually but it will be postponed. Some parts of Scotland have already seen heavy snow this month ""We haven't had temperatures that low in late February since 2013. It's not unheard of. There are records that are lower than that. ""But it is quite unusual, particularly as it's quite late in the season."" Public Health England said it is ""critical"" to keep an eye on anyone over 65, young children or people with heart or lung conditions. Dr Thomas Waite, of the PHE Extreme Events team, said:  ""Cold temperatures, indoors and out, pose real health risks to many and every winter we know that thousands of people get ill and even die following exposure to cold conditions. ""Staying warm by heating your home to at least 18C can be crucial to stay well."" Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, said on Friday that he had opened emergency homeless shelters ahead of the drop in temperature. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

"The Weinstein case in the US has inspired many French women to speak out on sexual abuse About four million French women - 12% of the total - have been raped at least once in their lives, a survey suggests. The study for the Fondation Jean JaurÃ¨s, a Paris-based think tank, also says 43% have been subjected to sexual touching without their consent. Like many other countries, France has seen women take to social media to highlight abuse in recent months. Many have shared their experiences under the hashtag ""Balance ton porc"" (""rat on your pig""). The campaign was launched following the rape allegations against Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein last October. Deneuve apologises to sex assault victims France's celebrity pushback against 'MeToo' France plans law on street harassment The aim of the survey (in French) of 2,000 women published on Friday was to assess the extent of sexual sexual harassment,externaland violence in France. In addition to the 12% who say they have been raped, 58% have been subjected to disturbing propositions and 43% to ""sexual touching without consent"", the study says. Most of the women reporting such abuse have experienced it several times, it adds. The report highlights the ""heavy consequences and long-term repercussions suffered by the victims"". But the ""rat on your pig"" movement has generated national debate around what constitutes harassment. Last month French movie star Catherine Deneuve was one of 100 women who signed an open letter claiming the movement had gone too far. It warned of a new type of ""Puritanism"" and insisted men should be ""free to pester women"". ""Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack."" Gender equality minister Marlene Schiappa wants to outlaw harassment Deneuve later clarified her position saying the letter was not meant as a defence of harassment and ""fraternally"" paid tribute to victims of sexual assault. The French minister for gender equality, MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa, has vocally defended ""balance ton porc"", ""Me Too"" and similar movements. Last year Ms Schiappa set out plans for a law cracking down on sexual violence and harassment. The proposals would include on-the-spot fines for catcalling and lecherous behaviour in public. As well as cracking down on harassment, the legislation will also give people who experienced sexual assault as a child more time to make a police complaint, and toughen laws on sex with minors.

"Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel say any cuts to EU programmes could be damaging EU leaders have agreed to spend more on common defence and security policy in their next long-term budget, European Council President Donald Tusk says. Leaders of 27 states were meeting in Brussels to shape the 2021-27 budget. Members have been in disagreement on how to compensate for funding loss after Britain's planned 2019 departure. Germany and France have warned any funding cuts to EU programmes could damage efforts to tackle illegal immigration and terrorism. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Tusk said leaders had agreed to spend more on security, as well as fighting illegal migration in their next long-term budget. He said many of the EU leaders were ready to contribute more to the pot, but acknowledged others were less forthcoming.

"Cabinet committee meeting Minutes after the scheduled end of the cabinet committee meeting at 22:00 GMT we spotted the prime minister speeding out of the back gates of Chequers in her jag, sitting alone in the back seat poring once again over her red boxes. Her colleagues tonight say that in that box there is now a broadly agreed opening pitch to the rest of the European Union - our agenda for the next phase of the talks that will determine the relationship between the UK and the EU for years, if not decades to come. The meeting is over, but the public explanation of the agreement won't come until next week. So what was the deal? One of the ministers in the room said that everyone was ""rather happy"" at the end, another said that the PM had ""played a blinder"". Ministers conclude crunch Brexit talks More realistically, perhaps, one of those senior figures described it as an ""outbreak of unity for now"". Brexit backers are busily spinning that ""divergence has won"", with the claim that the UK will go for so-called mutual recognition with the EU on goods, meaning there is no decision to follow EU rules slavishly for ever. But others say there has been compromise, the prime minister was in fact ""firm with Boris"", forcing the Brexiteers to come round to her way of thinking. As we've discussed before it is a development of the approach of ""managed divergence"", where basically the UK will stick closely to the EU in some areas, but on its own terms. But there is what was described by a key minister as a ""growing realisation"" that thousands of jobs are dependent on us voluntarily following EU rules in key goods sectors, describing the position as a ""pragmatic Brexit."" Surely not both sides trying to claim credit? Even though they are all playing nice-ish tonight, while trying of course to claim their position was the winning one, remember the rest of the cabinet, and then the Tory Party, has to get on board with this. And it wasn't a day of breakthrough. There was, I hear for example, no new detailed discussion of the Customs Union, with its potentially toxic implications for the Irish border. And if and once that is done, the prime minister's job is then to put it to Brussels in the next phase of the talks. One senior minister said they had reached a ""sensible compromise which pitches an ambitious ask but recognises that we will be in a negotiation"". After tonight the prime minister may seem to have permission from her top-ranking colleagues, but it doesn't mean that now she is almost ready to say what she wants next, that it is what she will get.

"Labour's Brexit sub-committee have been going through party policy It had been billed as an away day to thrash out Labour's policy on Brexit - a kind of shadow of the Chequers gathering. In the end when Labour's Brexit sub-committee met this week, it wasn't ""away"" from Westminster and it wasn't a day. A paper was tabled but not formally endorsed. But I'm told that nuances have been ironed out and it has all but got the approval of the party leadership. It will form the basis of Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit speech on Monday. What is he likely to say? Labour insiders favour the word ""evolution"" to describe any change. Contrary to speculation, there won't be a seismic shift in policy but it will move forward. The customs union explained in 45 seconds Downing Street insists UK will leave customs union In the summer, under pressure from some of his MPs, unions and his shadow Brexit secretary Mr Corbyn signed up to a policy of staying both in the single market  and the customs union for any ""transitional"" period after Brexit. The Labour position has been to argue that ""a"" customs union was ""a viable option"" and that the government should ""keep all options open"". What we are likely to see on Monday is wording that makes plain that ""a"" not ""the"" customs union would have distinct benefits and is the most logical way to solve the thorny issue of the Irish border. It won't just be a viable option but a viable end point. And the policy is likely to evolve in another way too. Currently Labour recognises that when we are out of the EU, we are out of the single market. So it is arguing that it wants to retain the same benefits as single market membership - such as tariff-free trade. I'm told the same formulation could be applied to ""a"" customs union, that in the long term a future Labour government could sign up to one, if the UK got the exact same benefits as it gets from ""the"" customs union - frictionless trade and a say over the external tariff on imported goods. This video can not be played Andrew Gwynne asked to explain difference between ""a"" and ""the"" customs union As Labour has talked about the benefits of some form of customs union before, this would be an incremental not dramatic move forward. However party insiders say that Jeremy Corbyn can't guarantee that a future Labour government would definitely be in such a customs union because it would have to be negotiated with the EU. But one insider said that people listening on Monday will have no doubt where Labour is headed: That a customs union is the preferred option. Speaking on LBC radio, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry gave credence to this by saying: ""We have to negotiate a new agreement. That, we think, is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" While this would give the UK the current customs union's benefits, it would also have to take the burdens - including severe limitations on negotiating new non-EU trade deals. However one Labour strategist warned that when it comes to Brexit policy, there are ""many trees in the forest"". The customs union may rise like a redwood in the forthcoming Corbyn speech, but it's worth looking at what else is growing and developing at the same time. If Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer is to be happy with the evolving policy - and I'm told he is - there will have to be words about how close the UK should stick to the EU economically and socially in order to get some of the benefits of the single market. So expect Mr Corbyn to re-emphasise that he would not undercut EU standards. Labour has said it will accept the end of free movement after any ""transitional period"" Diane Abbott this week gave more detail on what Labour meant by a ""jobs first"" Brexit saying: ""Immigration is subordinate to our priorities which favour growth, jobs and prosperity."" In the past, Labour spokespeople have said they will accept the end of free movement when the transitional period finishes, but phrases such as ""easy movement"" have been bandied about - possibly an agreement that citizens could move between the UK and EU with minimum red tape to take up job offers, but not simply to look for work. Although a majority of Labour voters opposed Brexit, a significant minority backed it and so far the party's ambiguity doesn't seem to have dented its position in the polls. So why give more clarity? For some, it is driven primarily by politics not economics. There was speculation that Labour might unequivocally commit to the customs union in order to inflict a government defeat - with Tory rebels' help - in the forthcoming trade and customs bill. While about 50 Labour MPs would vote to stay in ""the"" customs union, most so far haven't upset their leadership and have abstained when the issue has come up. Are some Labour figures aiming to vote down any Brexit deal and destabilise the PM? While a handful of Brexit-supporting Labour MPs would back the government, if the party leadership signalled to MPs to vote against it because Labour was now more sympathetic to a customs union as an end point, then Theresa May would be in danger of losing. For some Labour figures, the real aim of the ""evolution"" in Labour's policy is to prepare the ground for a much bigger issue. It is to create enough space between the government and opposition to allow Labour to credibly to vote down any deal that Theresa May brings back from Brussels and destabilise her in the process. So if she clings on, Labour will make her ""own"" any Brexit fallout. If she is toppled, they would call for an election. But to get there, Labour has to be clearer on the policy divide - and now we are seeing that open up, slowly, before our eyes.

"Eighteen people were jailed for their involvement in the sexual abuse of vulnerable young women in Newcastle Vulnerable women are most likely being ""extensively"" abused across the UK and ministers need to urgently review sex exploitation laws, a report says. David Spicer led a review in the wake of Operation Sanctuary which saw18 people jailedfor the sexual abuse ofyoung women groomed in Newcastle. He said exploitation was not being recognised in adults. The operation identified about 700 victims in total across the Northumbria Police area, 108 in Newcastle. Replay: Reaction to report into grooming The government said it would ""look carefully"" at Mr Spicer's 33 recommendations, which also included a need for research into the cultural background of abusers, many of whom in the case of Sanctuary were from a ""predominantly Asian or British Minority Ethnic culture or background"". Mr Spicer, whocarried out the serious case review,externalfor the Newcastle Safeguarding Adults and Children Boards, said it was clear ""adults were being targeted, groomed and exploited"" as well as children. But he said authorities did not have the powers to intervene with adults to stop them ""making bad choices"" or forming ""inappropriate relationships"". This video can not be played One victim of sexual exploitation in the city says abuse still continues He said: ""Vulnerability is not determined by age and it is likely that extensive abuse of vulnerable adults is taking place across the country unrecognised."" Operation Sanctuary started in 2014 after a 21-year-old woman with a learning disability told police she had been a victim of sexual exploitation over a long period. Further reports from two 19-year-old women ""confirmed"" sexual exploitation was a much larger problem in Newcastle ""than previously recognised"". Mr Spicer said the operation had proved successful but it was only when Northumbria Police and other agencies like Newcastle City Council started looking for the issue they found it. David Spicer led the serious case review He also said the government needs to research the ""profiles, motivations and cultural and background influences of perpetrators of sexual exploitation"". In the Newcastle case, most of the men were British-born but all came from Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian or Turkish communities. The Quillam Foundation think tank, which focuses on counter-extremism, said84% of the 264 offenders it looked at, who were convicted of gang grooming between 2005 and 2017,,externalwere of south Asian heritage. Mr Spicer said the perpetrator he spoke to ""displayed no regret"" and ""spoke in a derogatory manner about a lack of morals in British girls"". The report noted that there was no evidence that police and other agencies had been reluctant to investigate amid ""misplaced"" concerns over political correctness or allegations of racism. Mr Spicer also said confidentiality systems in sexual health services should be reviewed as a lack of information-sharing meant no-one spotted victims who went to multiple clinics. Vulnerable adults were also sexually exploited in Newcastle Medical professionals such as pharmacists should also be trained to spot signs of abuse, he said. Mr Spicer was also critical of the ordeal of victims giving evidence in court saying several complained it caused ""lasting serious mental health problems"". As well as reviewing the way victims are treated during trials, Mr Spicer also said the terminology of charges should be changed to avoid causing further distress. This was after victims complained the charge of ""inciting prostitution"" labelled them as prostitutes. The report also looked at exploitation of boys and men but said it was ""complex and hidden"" and operated differently to female victims. Mr Spicer said: ""The low incidence of identified cases is likely to be a significant under-representation of the abuse occurring."" He also said it was not within the scope of his review to investigateNorthumbria Police's Â£10,000 payment to a convicted child rapistwho acted as an informant. A government spokesman said: ""These are abhorrent crimes that have had a devastating impact on the lives of the victims involved."" Changing Lives, a charity which supports victims of sexual exploitation including 33 associated with Operation Sanctuary, praised the report Director Laura Seebohm said the trauma ""cannot be underestimated"" and she welcomed the recommendations for ""national debate, review and guidance"". Vida Morris of Newcastle's adults safeguarding board said she was ""profoundly and deeply sorry for the emotional and physical trauma"" the victims suffered. She said the women had been ""brave beyond belief"" and thanks to them Newcastle was ""without a doubt a safer place"".

"This video can not be played EC President Donald Tusk rejected any idea of the UK being able to join a ""single market a la carte"" The UK's approach to the next stage of Brexit negotiations seems to be based on ""pure illusion"", Donald Tusk says. The European Council president told a news conference in Brussels that the UK was still trying to ""cherry pick"" its future relationship with the EU. Mr Tusk said he could only go on media reports of Brexit talks at the PM's country retreat Chequers on Thursday. Theresa May is set to deliver a key speech setting out British ambitions on Friday of next week. EU leaders split on spending after Brexit Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? The customs union explained in 45 seconds Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union Mr Tusk, who is due to meet the PM the day before, said media reports suggested that the ""cake philosophy is still alive"" in the UK. He added: ""If the media reports are correct I am afraid that the UK position today is based on pure illusion."" He went on to reject - as he has done before - any notion of the UK ""cherry picking"" aspects of its future relationship with the EU or being able to join a ""single market a la carte"". The BBC understands that the 11 seniorministers at Chequers made a breakthrough on so-called ""managed divergence"", where the UK could select EU rules to stick to post-Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Tusk said the EU would continue to be ""extremely realistic"" during the forthcoming negotiations. The second phase of Brexit negotiations will cover transitional arrangements after the UK leaves and economic and security co-operation in the future. Mr Tusk, who spoke at an informal meeting of 27 European heads of states and governments, said he would present draft guidelines on the future EU-UK relationship at a summit in March. ""Our intention is to adopt these guidelines, whether the UK is ready with its vision of our future relations, or not,"" he said. ""Naturally it would be much better if it were. But we cannot stand by and wait."" He said he hoped to have more clarity when he meets the PM in London next week. The leaders also spoke about the EU's post-2020 budget, the composition of the European Parliament, Turkey and Syria. The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee discussed the government's approach for eight hours at Chequers on Thursday The government is set to pursue a policy which puts the UK outside a customs union with the EU - but matching EU rules in some industries in an attempt to achieve ""frictionless trade"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who did not attend the meeting of senior ministers, said despite ""divergent views"" there was a ""central common understanding"". He said some sectors could align regulations with European regulations, adding: ""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge.""

"Ministers told to urgently review laws on sexual exploitation Victim tells of 'schoolgirls in uniform' being raped NHS Trust review found sexual exploitation 'not considered' Author calls for government review of sexual health clinics Eighteen people were convicted of abusing girls in Newcastle Victims plied with alcohol and drugs before being forced into sex Up to 700 victims in total have now been identified After 700 victims were groomed in one region, ministers are told to urgently review exploitation laws. Our live coverage of today'sSerious Case Review into Operation Sanctuary,externalhas come to an end. The report made a number of findings, including:  You canread more about today's review here. Thank you for joining us. This photo was issued last year by police showing the designer drug M-Cat, which was used to groom girls at ""parties"" across Newcastle. Last August Chief Constable Steve Ashman said dangerous men would not be behind barsif he had not decided to pay a convicted child rapist almost Â£10,000 to spy on these 'sessions', where it was suspected under-age girls were fed drugs and sexually abused. A sexual trauma specialist has addressed victims of sexual abuse following today's Serious Case Review. Zoe Lodrick wants women to ""talk to someone"" and come forward, understanding the conflict victims can feel. Today's report into Operation Sanctuary determined that professionals should only rely on victims' statements to prosecute perpetrators when it is ""unavoidable due to lack of other evidence"". This is said to be to protect victims and stop offenders before damage has been caused. The review was also ""unable"" to gain a true understanding of the offences through communicating with the perpetrators, as they were ""undeterred by involvement of the police and other agencies"". The report adds: ""There is an urgent need for guidance to robustly address these
issues."" David Spicer, the man who wrotetoday's report,external, is a barrister and former chair of the British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. He has worked on more than 30 Serious Case Reviews (SCRs), Child Practice Review Reports and Multi-Agency Vulnerable Adult Review Reports. Recently, he has undertaken more than 16 SCRs, most notably into the death of London girl Victoria Climbie in 2001. The government is being warned it's likely vulnerable women are being abused extensively across the UK, and much of it is unrecognised. The review into Operation Sanctuary found that while there were similarities to grooming networks in other cities, the exploitation of adults was ""unique"" and had to be addressed urgently. Speaking at a news conference, the author of the report, David Spicer, said all agencies, people and officials have to be alert. Dr Spicer said that it may be ""easy to identify if a child is not attending school regularly"" or ""continually going missing"", however that may not always be the case. Some of the victims that were looked at in this Serious Case Review attended school regularly, and teachers were ""certainly"" not aware of what was happening. He added: ""Everybody has to be vigilant about the likelihood of this happening... everywhere."" A safeguarding manager for Newcastle City Council is urging victims of sexual abuse and exploitation to come forward. Sam Keith says she is aware of how hard it can be for victims to share their stories, but insists professionals are ""here to listen"". Chris JacksonBBC Inside Out Sarah (not her real name) was 19, extremely vulnerable and unable to look after herself. Along with other at-risk teenagers she was regularly abused by older men. In the new year of 2014, Sarah told the police she'd been raped by Abdul Minoyee. A police officer took Sarah on a tour of the West End to try identify Minoyee's house and car and other places where these ""parties"" had taken place. Sarah's information was a red flag - the abuse was on a much bigger scale. The detective in charge of Sarah's case told his bosses that what she had said signalled something much bigger. Days later the officer's hunch was given added weight when two girls in care reported that they'd been repeatedly raped by a group of older Asian men. The girls were aged 14 and 15. They described being driven into Newcastle where they were plied with alcohol and cocaine before being raped and beaten by several men. They were given money before being returned home. Operation Shelter was one of a number of spin-offs from Operation Sanctuary. This was launched in late 2013 to investigate claims of sexual abuse against vulnerable women and girls. Police took to the streets handing out leaflets in a publicity drive, as dozens of potential victims came forward. Such was the scale of the inquiry, that it split off into more than a dozen operations, with Shelter focusing on reports of girls being abused at parties at addresses in the West End of Newcastle. The number of defendants led to four separate trials - the first commencing in September 2015 - with reporting restrictions in place until the final one concluded in August last year. The Serious Case Review published today was undertaken by the Newcastle Safeguarding Adults Board and Newcastle Safeguarding Children Board. The main aim of the report was to ""consider and learn"" from sexual exploitation involving children and young adults in Newcastle. Some of thekey points,externalit examined were: The editor of Inside Out in the North East and Cumbria wrote a blog last year about how the BBC fought to report this story: Here's a snippet: Spring 2016. Inside Out Producer Dan Farthing rings from Newcastle Crown Court. âYou will not believe what I have just heardâ¦â and what he went on to describe was indeed pretty extraordinary. Dan was following a series of interlinked trials of more than twenty Asian men, accused of grooming vulnerable young teenagers in the west end of Newcastle. Reporting restrictions banning broadcasts until the conclusion of the final trial meant weâd seen little early evidence of Danâs regular days on the press bench. Then, out of the blue, the prosecution revealed Northumbria Police had used a CHIS - a covert human intelligence source - to supply information on so-called âpartiesâ where teenagers were plied with drink and drugs and sexually assaulted. Read more here. The NSPCC has praised the Serious Case Review into Operation Sanctuary. The charity states that ""significant strides have been made"" in dealing with child exploitation in Newcastle. It added the crimes committed were ""abhorrent"" and highlighted that ""knowledge must continue to be shared across the UK"". Last year it emerged a police officer was sacked for failing to investigate a sex offender's phone linked to Operation Sanctuary. Northumbria Chief Constable Steve Ashman said the officer was dismissed after his actions were found to be ""grossly negligent"". The officer had sight of Bahmani Ahmadi's phone but did not ""interrogate"" it when he dealt with a complaint from a teenage girl in 2012. If the handset had been checked, it could have revealed the extent of his grooming, police said. Two years later Ahmadi was re-arrested and subsequently charged and jailed. Mr Ashman said: ""It was evident that an officer who had had an opportunity to investigate an individual offender hadn't done a very good job at all. ""In fact the standard of investigation fell so far short of what I would expect that we deemed it to be grossly negligent and he was dismissed."" One victim of sexual abuse spoke at length about how the court case badly affected her: I waited a long time for a trial date. There were video interviews, statements, identity parades. I gave full evidence at the trial and was cross examined.  Court was awful, the worst experience ever â spoken down to â felt I was on trial â the defence. The judge intervened a lot to stop it but it still went on.  I was commended for my strength by the police and prosecution. Shortly afterwards, thinking it was over, I was told there was a legal problem with a part of the case, not to do with me or my and evidence. The trial was stopped.  A year later I was asked to give evidence again. I couldnât face reliving it. To stand up in front of all those people - and then told I had to do it again â I had already made statements. If I only had to tell it once that would be brilliant.  The police understood and asked the CPS to consider using evidence from the original trial because of the impact on my mental health. The CPS requested a mental health assessment, which resulted in a brief meeting. I was asked first off to take Diazepam to go through with the trial.  The allegations referred to drugs being used for the purposes of rape and I was now being asked to take a drug to help relive it and put up with another full trial. I couldnât do it and refused.  Two days later I was sectioned under the mental health act for risks to my own life, whilst the men despite all the evidence were set free.  Why couldnât that jury have seen my evidence like they saw my original video evidence? They record everything anyway. If this had been allowed I mightâve got justice for what happened to me. They walked free.  The impact of the crimes and failed court process to the victim and close family is intolerable.â  The chief executive of Newcastle City Council believes that adults are ""being abused as well as young women"". Pat Ritchie has spoken out about today's report, which she says is the first to identify that particular issue. She added that it's important to acknowledged that abuse does not ""automatically stop at 18"". Operation Sanctuary's Serious Case Review demonstrates ""the enormous progress that has been made in Newcastle"" in tackling grooming and exploitation, the Children's Society says. The organisation, which supports, young people in Newcastle affected by child sexual exploitation, is concerned that victims across the UK continue to be let down by professionals. It believes this comes as a result of a failure to recognise ""vulnerable"" people who are at risk. The charity highlights that other areas can ""learn lessons"" from the work done in Newcastle, but insists that there is ""more to do"" in the city. Operation Sanctuary continues to this day, with seven
people arrested over human trafficking offences only a few weeks ago. Police
carried out six warrants at homes in the West End of Newcastle on 30 January as part of an investigation into modern day slavery and said 11 potential victims had been rescued.  The Government must look at ""weaknesses"" in taxi licensing which may allow people to keep driving after their licence is removed, the report says. If someone has licence to operate a taxi revoked they can still continue as a private operator of larger vehicles. A suggestion was also made about creating a national database of licence removals. One of the Operation Sanctuary victims was ""startled"" after being cross examined about the compensation she received. The victim says she was ""accused"" of coming forward only to receive money. She added: When cross-examined I was called a liar â that it was all untrue. It was hard to put up a fight. I knew the police believed me.â  You should not be questioned about stuff outside the time zone for the case. For me, some of it was years ago. For some itâs new and fresh. You can put it at the back of your mind.  I was questioned about a note for school asking for absence when I forged my motherâs signature years before.""  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Twenty-two aid organisations have said they are ""truly sorry"" for the sector's failings in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by workers. In a letter signed by chief executives, charities including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB vowed to do more to protect those they were set up to help. They also promised a series of ""urgent and immediate"" measures, including more resources for safeguarding. ""There can be no tolerance for the abuse of power,"" the letter said. ""We have an absolute duty to our staff, our supporters and, above all, the people we seek to help to ensure we do everything in our power to prevent, detect and eradicate unacceptable behaviour."" The charities admitted recent revelations had caused ""widespread distress and disappointment"" and said the sector needed to ""fundamentally"" change. ""Safeguarding is something that, as a sector, we have long taken very seriously and all our organisations have systems in place to prevent all forms of abuse and misconduct. Nine charts that show what charities do How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? Ex-Save the Children boss Justin Forsyth apologises over texts Oxfam Haiti scandal: Thousands cancel donations to charity ""However, we can never be complacent. We must do even more to protect the very people we were set up to help,"" the letter said. Plan International UK, a charity which signed the letter, said it had ""six confirmed cases of sexual abuse and exploitation of children by staff, volunteers or partner organisations"" between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. In a blog post, the charity said five cases had been reported to the local authorities,externaland that no Plan International UK staff had been involved in any of these cases. During the same period, it said there had been nine incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct by staff against adults. The measures announced by aid organisations in their letter include a review of referencing systems ""so that people found to have abused their power or behaved inappropriately are not re-employed in the sector"". Ex-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth resigned from Unicef on Thursday after the BBC reported he had faced three complaints about his behaviour by Save the Children staff. Unicef confirmed that the charity had not been aware of any of the complaints against Mr Forsythat the time of his recruitment in 2016. The aid organisations have also said they will work with the government ""to ensure that we can overcome the legal and institutional barriers to rigorous background checks in the UK"". This video can not be played Ex-Save the Children worker: 'A really toxic culture grew' The Charity Commission has said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Brendan Cox -  the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - and Mr Forsyth between 2015 and 2016. Mr Cox quit two charities he set up in memory of his wife last weekend after allegations of sexual assault were made public. Mr Cox denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 - but admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. A petition calling for the resignation of international chairman Sir Alan Parker has been signed by some employees at Save the Children. The petition claims Sir Alan, as chairman, was ""ultimately accountable for both [Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth's] cases"" and also calls for ""proactive, full public disclosure, to retain and regain public trust"". In response to the petition, a Save the Children spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns expressed in the petition and believe it's vital that everyone feels safe and secure when going about their work and interacting with colleagues. ""It's precisely for that reason CEO Kevin Watkins has commissioned a thorough review of current practices and workplace culture.""

"Rick Gates said he had ""had a change of heart"" after his initial not-guilty plea US President Donald Trump's former deputy campaign manager has admitted charges of conspiracy and lying to investigators in a plea deal. Rick Gates pledged to co-operate in ""any and all matters"" with the US special counsel's inquiry into alleged Russian political meddling in the US. Mr Gates, 45, had been indicted on more serious criminal counts, including bank fraud and money laundering. Ex-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was hit with new charges on Friday. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words There are no allegations that either man colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, which is the main thrust of the Department of Justice investigation. On Friday, Mr Gates admitted to lying to the FBI about a March 2013 meeting in Washington with a US lawmaker while Mr Manafort was present. Mr Gates falsely claimed Ukraine was not discussed, according to the indictment. Sentencing guidelines for him suggest a prison term of between 57 and 71 months. He could have been locked up for decades under the more serious charges. Special counsel Robert Mueller could petition the court for a reduced sentence depending on how much Mr Gates co-operates. Mr Gates filed a motion requesting permission to take his children to Massachusetts during their spring break from school. ""The purpose of this trip is for Mr Gates to show his children around the Boston area to learn about American history in general, and the Revolutionary War in particular,"" his motion requests. On Friday afternoon, Mr Mueller piled the pressure on Mr Manafort by filing a third indictment against him. He accused Mr Manafort of secretly hiring former senior European politicians to lobby in the US for positions favourable to Ukraine. The ex-politicians, dubbed the Hapsburg Group, were allegedly paid from an offshore account for their lobbying efforts. The indictment says the group was led by a former European chancellor, identified in the charge sheet only as Foreign Politician A. These charges and Mr Gates' plea deal come a day after both men were indicted on 32 additional criminal counts. Mr Manafort - who resigned as Trump campaign chairman in August 2016 after five months amid questions over his business dealings - maintains his innocence. ""I had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence,"" he said in a statement on Friday. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? ""For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. ""This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me."" Mr Manafort has worked on several Republican presidential campaigns, beginning with Gerald Ford's in 1976. In a letter to family and friends, Mr Gates said he had ""had a change of heart"" after his initial not-guilty plea, according to ABC News. He reportedly said he was ready to accept ""public humiliation"" to avoid inflicting prolonged pain on his children. ""The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much,"" he reportedly wrote. ""I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process."" Lawyer admits lying to Russia inquiry The tactics of a Russian troll farm Mr Mueller's team alleged in a 32-count indictment on Thursday that Mr Gates and Mr Manafort concealed more than $30m of income from US tax authorities. Mr Gates was accused of hiding more than $3m of income and using the cash to pay for his mortgage, children's tuition and re-decorating his Virginia home. The court filing charged the pair with a scheme to defraud the US by making false representations to banks and other financial institutions between 2008-17. Both men pleaded not guilty in October when they were first indicted on charges of laundering $75m through an offshore account. They were also accused of illegally lobbying for a foreign government, Ukraine, without first registering in that capacity with the US government. Nineteen people - including Mr Manafort and Mr Gates - have been indicted by the special counsel. Michael Flynn, a former US national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Last week, 13 Russians were charged with tampering in the 2016 US election and a California man, Richard Pinedo, admitted an identity theft charge. This week a London-based lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty in court to making false statements when questioned about his work for Ukraine's Ministry of Justice. Mr Trump has said there was no collusion. Moscow has rejected US intelligence claims of interference.

"Lamarr Chambers was arrested in Harlow in January and has been held in a cell on constant watch ever since A suspected drug dealer who has refused to use the toilet for 37 days is at ""risk of death"", a court has heard. Lamarr Chambers, 24, of Villa Road in Brixton, is believed to have swallowed drugs during a police chase in Harlow, Essex, on 17 January. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard he had rejected laxatives and an X-ray but was eating and drinking. In defence, Andrew Horsall said Mr Chambers had not had privacy for 37 days. The court heard Mr Chambers was being kept in a normal prison cell with two police officers with him at all times. Mr Horsall added: ""There's the potential of something going seriously wrong. We're in an arena of risk of death."" He added that getting the suspected drugs Mr Chambers allegedly has inside him was the ""cherry on the cake"" and was not necessarily crucial evidence. The court heard the situation was ""unprecedented"" and the previous record for preventing the evacuation of the bowels was believed to have been 33 days. Police officers were at court to get an extension to his time in custody. Prosecutor Bob Rowlingson told the court: ""He's in charge of his fate, he only has to co-operate with police"". The magistrates said, after reading a report, they were confident Mr Chambers' life was not at risk and his rights had not been infringed.

"Twenty-two aid organisations have said they are ""truly sorry"" for the sector's failings in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by workers. In a letter signed by chief executives, charities including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB vowed to do more to protect those they were set up to help. They also promised a series of ""urgent and immediate"" measures, including more resources for safeguarding. ""There can be no tolerance for the abuse of power,"" the letter said. ""We have an absolute duty to our staff, our supporters and, above all, the people we seek to help to ensure we do everything in our power to prevent, detect and eradicate unacceptable behaviour."" The charities admitted recent revelations had caused ""widespread distress and disappointment"" and said the sector needed to ""fundamentally"" change. ""Safeguarding is something that, as a sector, we have long taken very seriously and all our organisations have systems in place to prevent all forms of abuse and misconduct. Nine charts that show what charities do How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? Ex-Save the Children boss Justin Forsyth apologises over texts Oxfam Haiti scandal: Thousands cancel donations to charity ""However, we can never be complacent. We must do even more to protect the very people we were set up to help,"" the letter said. Plan International UK, a charity which signed the letter, said it had ""six confirmed cases of sexual abuse and exploitation of children by staff, volunteers or partner organisations"" between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. In a blog post, the charity said five cases had been reported to the local authorities,externaland that no Plan International UK staff had been involved in any of these cases. During the same period, it said there had been nine incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct by staff against adults. The measures announced by aid organisations in their letter include a review of referencing systems ""so that people found to have abused their power or behaved inappropriately are not re-employed in the sector"". Ex-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth resigned from Unicef on Thursday after the BBC reported he had faced three complaints about his behaviour by Save the Children staff. Unicef confirmed that the charity had not been aware of any of the complaints against Mr Forsythat the time of his recruitment in 2016. The aid organisations have also said they will work with the government ""to ensure that we can overcome the legal and institutional barriers to rigorous background checks in the UK"". This video can not be played Ex-Save the Children worker: 'A really toxic culture grew' The Charity Commission has said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Brendan Cox -  the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - and Mr Forsyth between 2015 and 2016. Mr Cox quit two charities he set up in memory of his wife last weekend after allegations of sexual assault were made public. Mr Cox denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 - but admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. A petition calling for the resignation of international chairman Sir Alan Parker has been signed by some employees at Save the Children. The petition claims Sir Alan, as chairman, was ""ultimately accountable for both [Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth's] cases"" and also calls for ""proactive, full public disclosure, to retain and regain public trust"". In response to the petition, a Save the Children spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns expressed in the petition and believe it's vital that everyone feels safe and secure when going about their work and interacting with colleagues. ""It's precisely for that reason CEO Kevin Watkins has commissioned a thorough review of current practices and workplace culture."" Meanwhile,Haiti has suspended Oxfam GB operationsin the country as it investigates claims of sexual misconduct by staff in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Seven Oxfam members of staff left the charity in 2011 following the organisation's own investigation into whether staff hired prostitutes while working overseas.

"The United States is imposing a fresh set of sanctions on North Korea - the ""largest ever"", President Trump says. The measures target more than 50 ships and maritime transport companies in North Korea, but also China and Taiwan. North Korea is already under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests. But it continued tests last year, including tests of a nuclear weapon and a long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the US. The US says the new sanctions are designed to put a further squeeze on North Korea, cutting off sources of revenue and fuel for its nuclear programme and clamping down on evasion of already existing restrictions. The US treasury department lists one individual and 27 companies,external. Sixteen, mainly shipping companies, are based in North Korea, but five are registered in Hong Kong, two on the Chinese mainland, two in Taiwan, one in Panama and one in Singapore. Twenty-eight ships are on the list, again mostly North Korean, but two are Panama-flagged, one from the Comoros and one Tanzania-flagged. Speaking at a new conference on Friday, President Trump warned of serious consequences if the latest round of sanctions did not generate results. ""If the sanctions don't work we'll have to go phase two - and phase two may be a very rough thing, may be very, very unfortunate for the world,"" he said. ""It really is a rogue nation.  If we can make a deal it'll be a great thing and if we can't, something will have to happen."" He did not specify what ""phase two"" would entail. The US has been building sanctions against the regime since 2008 and the latest restrictions could come on top of sanctions announced in November - directed at North Korean shipping operations, as well as Chinese companies trading with Pyongyang. The United Nations followed that up in December with a raft of sanctions, backed by all 15 members of the Security Council, which included measures to cut North Korea's petrol imports by up to 90%. Reality Check: How North Korea does business North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate The missile crisis in 300 words The Trump administration's announcement comes as North Korea conducts what is being seen by Western powers as a charm offensive at the Winter Olympics in South Korea. US leaders have been keen to stress that North Korea still poses a nuclear threat despite warming ties with the South. The president's daughter Ivanka is in South Koreato attend the closing ceremony of the Games and Vice-President Mike Pence was there for the opening. However, no meetings have taken place with senior North Korean officials attending, including Kim Yo-jong, sister of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. North Korea baby rumours fascinate South Sanctions have done nothing to deter North Korea in its development of missiles and nuclear technology. Last year saw the first test of a long-range missile thought capable of reaching Washington, but it is still not clear if North Korea has mastered the technology needed to miniaturise a nuclear device for a warhead. Also on Friday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Mr Trump's administration is working on new sanctions against Russia over alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election and other activities. ""I can assure you that is in the process. I will be back here within the next several weeks to talk about that,"" he said. 30 November 2016:UN sanctions targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it had carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) 6 August 2017:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile. 21 November 2017US unveils more sanctions targeting North Korean shipping and Chinese companies that trade with Pyongyang What happened next?North Korea tested a new long-range missile, Hwasong-15, which it claimed could reach anywhere in the US 22 December 2017The UN Security Council imposed new sanctions, including measures to slash North Korean petrol imports by up to 90% What happened next?On 1 January 2018 Kim Jong-un warned a nuclear launch button ""is always on my table"", but also raised the prospect of sending a team to the Winter Olympics in the South North Korea crisis in 300 words N Korea's nuclear programme Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played EC President Donald Tusk rejected any idea of the UK being able to join a ""single market a la carte"" The UK's approach to the next stage of Brexit negotiations seems to be based on ""pure illusion"", Donald Tusk says. The European Council president told a news conference in Brussels that the UK was still trying to ""cherry pick"" its future relationship with the EU. Mr Tusk said he could only go on media reports of Brexit talks at the PM's country retreat Chequers on Thursday. Theresa May is set to deliver a key speech setting out British ambitions on Friday of next week. EU leaders split on spending after Brexit Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? The customs union explained in 45 seconds Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union Mr Tusk, who is due to meet the PM the day before, said media reports suggested that the ""cake philosophy is still alive"" in the UK. He added: ""If the media reports are correct I am afraid that the UK position today is based on pure illusion."" He went on to reject - as he has done before - any notion of the UK ""cherry picking"" aspects of its future relationship with the EU or being able to join a ""single market a la carte"". The BBC understands that the 11 seniorministers at Chequers made a breakthrough on so-called ""managed divergence"", where the UK could select EU rules to stick to post-Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Tusk said the EU would continue to be ""extremely realistic"" during the forthcoming negotiations. The second phase of Brexit negotiations will cover transitional arrangements after the UK leaves and economic and security co-operation in the future. Mr Tusk, who spoke at an informal meeting of 27 European heads of states and governments, said he would present draft guidelines on the future EU-UK relationship at a summit in March. ""Our intention is to adopt these guidelines, whether the UK is ready with its vision of our future relations, or not,"" he said. ""Naturally it would be much better if it were. But we cannot stand by and wait."" He said he hoped to have more clarity when he meets the PM in London next week. The leaders also spoke about the EU's post-2020 budget, the composition of the European Parliament, Turkey and Syria. The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee discussed the government's approach for eight hours at Chequers on Thursday The government is set to pursue a policy which puts the UK outside a customs union with the EU - but matching EU rules in some industries in an attempt to achieve ""frictionless trade"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who did not attend the meeting of senior ministers, said despite ""divergent views"" there was a ""central common understanding"". He said some sectors could align regulations with European regulations, adding: ""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge.""

"Passenger groups have reacted angrily to news that hundreds of train timetables are likely to be published later than usual. Rail users are normally told about new timetables 12 weeks in advance, enabling them to book cheap tickets. But the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) has announced that over the next six months passengers may get as little as four weeks' notice of new train times. It blamed a huge number of timetable changes coming up in May. The change will happen from this Sunday, 12 weeks ahead of the new Spring timetable, and is likely to affect travellers for at least six months. Passenger groups predicted there would be ""real disbelief and discontent"" about the lack of advance information. ""Passengers have been badly let down and will be deeply frustrated that they can't make plans with certainty,"" said Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus. ""They are also at risk of paying more."" Labour could revive British Rail Network rail puts projects on hold Cheap advance fares usually become available three months before travel, meaning that some passengers could book their tickets, but find that cheaper fares become available nearer the time of travel. ""Leaves on the line"" may be all too familiar. But as excuses go ""running sand"" is new. Network Rail is blaming the flow of sand into excavations in the North West for delays to planned infrastructure upgrades. Such delays upset the rail timetables. The track operator initially expected to complete electrification works between Manchester and Preston by 2016. Two years on there are still 200 foundations waiting to go in to the ground. The route is one of the busiest in the North West. It is this area that is likely to be most affected by changes to train timetables. There have also been delays to the roll-out of new trains in Scotland. Missed targets for track and train operators will see them both hauled over the coals by the rail regulator in the coming months. Whether it would go as far as fining a public body for breaching regulatory obligations remains to be seen. Some train operators are said to be furious about the late publication of timetables. The Office of Rail and Road - the industry regulator - said it would be conducting an informal enquiry into what had gone wrong. In theory it has the power to fine Network Rail, although that would be seen as a measure of last resort. This video can not be played Is nationalisation the answer for Britain's railways? The RDG - which represents both the train operators and Network Rail - said the May timetable change was ""the biggest in living memory"", with the rescheduling of almost four million services, seven times more than usual. It also said there were significant delays with engineering works, such as the electrification of the line between Manchester and Preston. ""We recognise this will be inconvenient for some passengers and can only apologise that we've had to take this step,"" said Jo Kaye a managing director at Network Rail. The RDG said the problems would only affect passengers ""in a small number of instances"". Normally only 2% of passengers book more than six weeks in advance. It is advising rail users to book their tickets as usual, and then claim a refund if a cheaper fare is subsequently available. Those whose train service is cancelled will be eligible for a full refund.

"Eddy Amoo (second left) with The Real Thing Eddy Amoo, one of 1970s soul band The Real Thing - who had hits including You To Me Are Everything and Feel the Force - has died at the age of 73. Amoo was a vocalist and songwriter with the pioneering Liverpool quartet. Friend Simon Sheridan said he had died suddenly in Australia and paid tribute to him as an ""inspirational character"". Sheridan told the BBC The Real Thing were ""huge pioneers of black music in the UK"" and the first all-black British band to have a UK number one single. That was You To Me Are Everything, which topped the charts in 1976. The song returned to the charts in 1986, when it reached number five. Amoo started his career leading Merseybeat a capella group The Chants in the 1960s. John Lennon was said to have championed them, and they were represented by The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein for a short time. 'We auditioned for The Beatles and they loved us' - Eddy Amoo on BBC Radio 2 After their demise, Amoo joined his younger brother Chris in The Real Thing. Their other hits included Can't Get By Without You, while French house duo The Freeloaders took them back into the charts in 2005 by sampling their song Love's Such a Wonderful Thing. Another of their tunes, Children of the Ghetto, was covered by artists including Philip Bailey and Mary J Blige. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sheridan, who has been making a documentary about the group, said Amoo's death was ""a complete shock"". He said: ""These were four working class boys from a tough neighbourhood, from Toxteth, and they completely changed the face of British music in 1976."" A statement from the band said: ""It is with great sadness that we share the passing of our brother and inspiration, Eddy Amoo. ""Eddy was a showman, a songwriter, and a legend in British music.""

"Lamarr Chambers was arrested in Harlow in January and has been held in a cell on constant watch ever since A suspected drug dealer who has refused to use the toilet for 37 days is at ""risk of death"", a court has heard. Lamarr Chambers, 24, of Villa Road in Brixton, is believed to have swallowed drugs during a police chase in Harlow, Essex, on 17 January. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard he had rejected laxatives and an X-ray but was eating and drinking. In defence, Andrew Horsall said Mr Chambers had not had privacy for 37 days. The court heard Mr Chambers was being kept in a normal prison cell with two police officers with him at all times. Mr Horsall added: ""There's the potential of something going seriously wrong. We're in an arena of risk of death."" He added that getting the suspected drugs Mr Chambers allegedly has inside him was the ""cherry on the cake"" and was not necessarily crucial evidence. The court heard the situation was ""unprecedented"" and the previous record for preventing the evacuation of the bowels was believed to have been 33 days. Police officers were at court to get an extension to his time in custody. Prosecutor Bob Rowlingson told the court: ""He's in charge of his fate, he only has to co-operate with police"". The magistrates said, after reading a report, they were confident Mr Chambers' life was not at risk and his rights had not been infringed. They said he should be monitored by police - not only for evidence gathering - but also his own health and that police detention was justified. Mr Chambers was remanded back into police cells before what will be his eighth hearing on Monday.

"The United States is imposing a fresh set of sanctions on North Korea - the ""largest ever"", President Trump says. The measures target more than 50 ships and maritime transport companies in North Korea, but also China and Taiwan. North Korea is already under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests. But it continued tests last year, including tests of a nuclear weapon and a long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the US. The US says the new sanctions are designed to put a further squeeze on North Korea, cutting off sources of revenue and fuel for its nuclear programme and clamping down on evasion of already existing restrictions. The US treasury department lists one individual and 27 companies,external. Sixteen, mainly shipping companies, are based in North Korea, but five are registered in Hong Kong, two on the Chinese mainland, two in Taiwan, one in Panama and one in Singapore. Twenty-eight ships are on the list, again mostly North Korean, but two are Panama-flagged, one from the Comoros and one Tanzania-flagged. Speaking at a new conference on Friday, President Trump warned of serious consequences if the latest round of sanctions did not generate results. ""If the sanctions don't work we'll have to go phase two - and phase two may be a very rough thing, may be very, very unfortunate for the world,"" he said. ""It really is a rogue nation.  If we can make a deal it'll be a great thing and if we can't, something will have to happen."" He did not specify what ""phase two"" would entail. The US has been building sanctions against the regime since 2008 and the latest restrictions could come on top of sanctions announced in November - directed at North Korean shipping operations, as well as Chinese companies trading with Pyongyang. The United Nations followed that up in December with a raft of sanctions, backed by all 15 members of the Security Council, which included measures to cut North Korea's petrol imports by up to 90%. Reality Check: How North Korea does business North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate The missile crisis in 300 words The Trump administration's announcement comes as North Korea conducts what is being seen by Western powers as a charm offensive at the Winter Olympics in South Korea. US leaders have been keen to stress that North Korea still poses a nuclear threat despite warming ties with the South. The president's daughter Ivanka is in South Koreato attend the closing ceremony of the Games and Vice-President Mike Pence was there for the opening. However, no meetings have taken place with senior North Korean officials attending, including Kim Yo-jong, sister of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. North Korea baby rumours fascinate South Sanctions have done nothing to deter North Korea in its development of missiles and nuclear technology. Last year saw the first test of a long-range missile thought capable of reaching Washington, but it is still not clear if North Korea has mastered the technology needed to miniaturise a nuclear device for a warhead. Also on Friday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Mr Trump's administration is working on new sanctions against Russia over alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election and other activities. ""I can assure you that is in the process. I will be back here within the next several weeks to talk about that,"" he said. 30 November 2016:UN sanctions targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it had carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) 6 August 2017:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile. 21 November 2017US unveils more sanctions targeting North Korean shipping and Chinese companies that trade with Pyongyang What happened next?North Korea tested a new long-range missile, Hwasong-15, which it claimed could reach anywhere in the US 22 December 2017The UN Security Council imposed new sanctions, including measures to slash North Korean petrol imports by up to 90% What happened next?On 1 January 2018 Kim Jong-un warned a nuclear launch button ""is always on my table"", but also raised the prospect of sending a team to the Winter Olympics in the South North Korea crisis in 300 words N Korea's nuclear programme Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

The broadcaster, who had his operation in early January, said on his website: ""They took the prostate out,"" adding: ""So far as we know it's all been got."" He said it was an ""aggressive"" cancer but it ""doesn't seem"" to have spread. The former QI host added: ""For the moment I'm fit and well and happy and I just wanted to let you know because rumours had started to swirl."" In thevideo on his site,external, he said: ""You have to recover and that's what I've been doing.""

Fry stepped down as Baftas host last month His condition was given a Gleason Score - a scale used to rate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer - of nine out of 10 before the operation, in which surgeons removed 11 lymph nodes. Fry added that he had to get used to the idea of the diagnosis, saying: ""I went around saying to myself, 'I've got cancer. Good heavens, Stephen, you're not the sort of person who gets cancer.' ""I know it's an old cliche but you don't think it's going to happen to you."" He urged men to get their PSA [prostate specific antigen] levels checked with a doctor.

" Warning: This piece contains details of torture and sexual violence that some readers may find upsetting. It was a family wedding, a happy occasion that was supposed to lift her spirits. Zubeida was badly in need of that. The 23-year old was an inpatient at a Cairo hospital, being treated for recent traumas. Her younger brother collected her and they headed for the family’s former home, in a crowded, gritty neighbourhood.  Some of her best clothes were still at the old flat. He rushed to the chemist to fill a prescription for Zubeida, leaving her at the entrance. When he returned, minutes later, his sister was gone. That was 14:00 on 8 April 2017. She hasn’t been seen since. The attractive young woman with striking hazel-coloured eyes has joined the ranks of Egypt’s “disappeared”. The events of that day are recounted by her mother, a welcoming woman in a black abaya and patterned headscarf. She wants to be known only as “Um Zubeida” - meaning Mother of Zubeida. We meet at the family’s current home, not far from the Pyramids. The flat is sparsely furnished but spotless. It’s in a high-rise block that offers few comforts but does allow anonymity. The family moved here hoping to give Zubeida a fresh start. Instead they lost her. “I have been trying to find Zubeida for 10 months,” she says, her eyes wet with tears. “Every day I die a hundred times. Our entire family has been destroyed, all six of us - her siblings and me - all destroyed. We wish we were dead.” Um Zubeyda has not seen her daughter for 10 months Um Zubeida is in no doubt about who is responsible for her daughter’s disappearance. “We know it’s the police,” she says. “Neighbours told us that armed and masked men came in a police vehicle and took her away in a minibus. They had been to our old house, inquiring about her, several times.” Zubeida had her brother’s mobile and managed a quick call to a relative, according to her mother. “He could hear the officer insulting her and then the phone was switched off.” For mother and daughter the trouble started years earlier. They were just passing by a protest in 2014, says Um Zubeida, and were arrested - in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were convicted of several offences including attending a banned demonstration. Um Zubeida says they spent seven months in jail but were later acquitted. Her account of what happened during their initial interrogation is chilling, but all too familiar to lawyers and human rights campaigners in Cairo. “For 14 hours, they kept beating us, and insulting us,” she says. “They stripped us, and electrocuted us.  They wanted us to confess to things that we had not done like planning to blow up a hotel, and having weapons.  I heard Zubeida’s voice screaming, ‘help me Mother’. I couldn’t see her but I told her, ‘Don’t be afraid’.” Um Zubeida says she refused to confess - though they threatened to rape her daughter in front of her. I found cuts on her body, and marks of electrocution... They had done to her everything that would anger God” After she and her daughter were released from prison, they tried to rebuild their lives.  Zubeida was studying commerce, and dreaming of opening her own small business. She went out to buy shoes on 15 July 2016 and disappeared - for the first time. “The car she was in was stopped at a police checkpoint,” says Um Zubeida, “And everyone was taken out. She gave my mobile number to a bystander and asked him to call me. By the time I arrived the police had gone.” Zubeida was dumped by the roadside on the outskirts of the city 28 days later. Her mother describes her daughter's return in a halting voice - as if each word is swollen with pain. “Someone found her and called us. She was blindfolded and her hands and legs were tied. When we brought her home, her abaya was torn.  She had no underwear underneath it. I went with her to the bathroom to help her change and to wash. “I found cuts on her body, and marks of electrocution.  I was shocked when she told me that they assaulted her. They had done to her everything that would anger God. Everything.” Zubeida was a changed girl - no longer friendly and sociable. “She didn’t want to see people,” her mother says. “She tried to isolate herself. She wasn’t happy like before.  She started hiding under the bed, screaming. We had to take her to a psychiatric hospital.” It was when she left the hospital, for the wedding, that she lost her freedom for the second time. Her mother now seeks comfort in Zubeida’s bedroom, which is like a shrine. Everything is just as she left it last April,  as if the young woman had been gone for a few hours, not almost a year. Her dresser is lined with treasured keepsakes that might belong to a child - a jewellery box in the shape of a tortoise, cuddly toys and small ceramic cats. Zubeida stares out serenely from a framed photograph. There’s a whisper of lipstick on her mouth and her hair is concealed beneath a stylish leopard-print headscarf. The photo was taken just after she and her mother were released from jail in 2014. “She was so happy because they had let us out,” says Um Zubeida. “Unfortunately, the happiness didn’t last.” Um Zubeida shows me a jotter full of drawings and Arabic script. It was her daughter’s prison journal.  There’s one phrase written at the bottom of a page in English that stands out: “Don’t forget me”. She insists the family has no connection with any banned groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Islamist movement was branded a terrorist organisation in 2013, after one of its leaders won the presidency but held it for just a year. Many families of the disappeared - and there are many - are too frightened to speak out.  Despite the risks, Um Zubeida refuses to be silenced, even though her daughter has disappeared not once but twice. “I wish they would take me, and let her go,” she says. “Take me, arrest me instead. What danger might we pose to those in power? If my daughter is disappeared and they’ve taken her and tortured her, how can I not speak out?  Even if my words lead to my hanging, I will still speak.” Does she thinks Zubeida will come back? “I have hope in God Almighty that she will come home,” she says. The trip was a risk.  Ibrahim Metwaly knew it, and so did his family. On 10 September last year, the 52-year-old lawyer set out for Cairo International airport to board a morning flight to Switzerland. He was due to testify before a United Nations working group on enforced disappearances. For Metwaly it was personal - his eldest son, Amr, had vanished more than four years earlier. Ibrahim Metwaly “My mother told him not to travel,” says Abdel Moneim, his youngest son, “because she could not bear anything else. But he had made up his mind. When a son is in danger, a father will do anything.” During the day Metwaly’s family got a text - from his phone - saying he had left for Geneva, and heaved a sigh of relief. The message did not come from Ibrahim. He had joined the ranks of the disappeared, or as Egyptians say, those “hidden behind the sun”. Ibrahim Metwaly’s disappearance made headlines abroad.  Two days later, amid growing international pressure, he was produced in front of prosecutors.  He was charged with “spreading false news” and “forming an illegal organisation”. That referred to a support group for families of the disappeared which he co-founded. Metwaly gave advice and legal assistance to many desperate families. Zubeida’s mother had turned to him for help as she went from one police station to another, begging for information about her daughter. If Metwaly had made it to Geneva he was planning to raise the case of Giulio Regeni, a murdered Italian doctorate student. Regeni vanished from the streets of Cairo in January 2016.  His mutilated body was found in a ditch on the outskirts of the city. Zubeida was later dumped near the same spot. His corpse bore the hallmarks of torture inflicted by a professional. Metwaly had been investigating his killing. Giulio Regeni, an Italian student tortured and murdered in Cairo “My father wanted to protect the remaining young people whose lives were in danger,” says Abdel Moneim, a law student. “He saw himself as a father to all of them.” It now falls to the 22-year-old to speak for him, though he knows he could be next. “I am worried. If I disappear my future will be lost. But I am not doing anything illegal - just being my father’s voice.” The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms has documented at least 1,500 enforced disappearances in the past four years, but some believe the real figure is much higher. In the words of a leading campaigner, Mohamed Lotfy, “making people disappear is a hallmark of the regime of President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi”. Anyone who opposes the regime, or is suspected of doing so, whether rightly or wrongly, is at risk. Sometimes even relatives and friends of suspects can be arrested. Many of the targets are Islamists - people who believe Islamic principles should shape society and the political system. In Egypt, most don’t call for the use of violence to achieve their aims. Campaigners say most of the disappeared are tortured before reappearing in custody weeks or months later, facing terrorism charges. Amr Metwaly has neither been charged nor freed. Abdel Moneim shows me photos of his brother - a smiling young man, enjoying a boat ride on the Nile. When he vanished, he was studying engineering. “Sometimes I can’t breathe when I think I won’t see him again,” says Abdel Moneim. Amr disappeared at a turbulent time. It was 8 July 2013. Egypt’s President Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist, had been ousted by the army just days before. Supporters - including Amr - gathered outside a military base where they thought he was being held. More than 50 protesters were killed, according to Egyptian state media. The army claimed they tried to break into the building. Police and protesters stand off, July 2013 “Clashes broke out,” says Abdel Moneim. “Some people died and some were forcibly disappeared. Amr was among them. He was kidnapped by army and police forces. There were eyewitnesses. A university friend with him was later released, but not Amr.” His brother’s support for the deposed president was a personal position, not a family one, he says. “As a normal family, each family member has a personal point of view in this regard.” The years since his disappearance have been full of searching, and of torment. “My mother is always telling the authorities that if they won’t bring my brother back, they’d better kill him and bring us his body,” says Abdel Moneim. “She is extremely sad because she can neither see him nor know where he is. At least with a dead person, you can visit their grave.” He knows where his father is, though the knowledge brings little comfort.  The human rights lawyer is now a prisoner in Cairo’s notorious Tora prison complex. “He is being held in solitary confinement, in a dark cell,” says Abdel Moneim. “He is getting a very small amount of food - not enough for a 10-year-old child. He found a rat in his cell and had to kill it.  We have only been allowed to visit him once, for three minutes. He is in poor health and the way he is being treated is putting his life in danger.” He says the prison routine involves not just hardship and hunger, but also torture. “My father was electrocuted,” says Abdel Moneim. “He was stripped and he was beaten. He documented the violations when he appeared before the prosecutor.” Lawyers, human rights campaigners and former prisoners in Egypt say this kind of brutality is now routine. As one lawyer put it: “Torture is a must.” Mahmud Mohamed Hussein has first-hand knowledge of current torture techniques.  He’s a slight 22-year-old in a hooded top and skinny jeans. Every step he takes is a reminder of the abuse he suffered. One of his legs is badly bowed. Mahmud was arrested in 2014 - on the third anniversary of the revolution.  He was just 18 and had gone out to celebrate. He says he was detained, and persecuted, only because of the slogan on his T-shirt. It read: “A nation without torture.” Mahmoud after his arrest in 2014 “They deliberately beat my bad leg - which was already injured,” he says. “They hurt me so badly that I could only walk with a stick until a few months ago. And since then I’ve had several operations.” But the beatings were just the beginning. “I was electrocuted in sensitive parts of my body,” he says, gesturing towards his groin. “I was in terrible pain. What happened can never be erased from my memory. I suffer very badly from nightmares.” Mahmud was held for more than two years without trial. He is speaking out in spite of the risks for the sake of many other victims, including some of his relatives and friends. “There are many people suffering what I have been through,” he says. “I saw many people in prison who asked me to convey messages about what they faced. I can only stop talking about torture when it comes to an end.” Mahmud: “I can only stop talking about torture when it comes to an end” Mahmud is not the only torture victim to share his story with me. Another young man  - who asked us not to reveal his identity - described being subjected to every kind of abuse. He provided a detailed and credible account identifying the police station where he was interrogated.  He said he was blindfolded, stripped, beaten, kicked and given electric shocks.  Then - in his words - he found out there was something worse than electrocution. He was raped - with a stick. Alaa Abdel Fattah at his 2015 trial For Manal Hussein and her six-year-old son Khaled, quality time comes once every 15 days - with a visit to a prison complex.  That’s where they are reunited with Alaa Abdel Fattah - the husband and father who is the missing piece of this fractured family. The 36-year-old is one of Egypt’s leading dissidents - charismatic, secular, a blogger and software developer. In the heady days of 2011 he was an icon of the revolution. In the Egypt of today that makes him an enemy of the state. Other leaders of the uprising have also been jailed, or driven into exile - erased from view, like the revolution itself. Alaa Abdel Fattah pictured in 2011 Mother and son set off in bright sunshine. Manal is smartly dressed in a black jacket, trousers and boots.  Her patterned sweater has an owl on the front. She brings food parcels, fresh laundry and cigarettes. Her husband doesn’t smoke, but tobacco is the currency in prison.  Khaled darts along beside her - a blur in a bright blue sweatshirt. I join them for the journey through the choking Cairo traffic. There is a driver behind the wheel so Manal can sit in the back and focus on her son. He bounces in and out of her arms, smiling but silent. The little boy does not speak yet. “That’s one of the problems of Alaa being in prison,” Manal says. “I don't know if Khaled has any memory of his father out of prison.  Alaa has spent almost four years in jail. That’s more than half his age.” Alaa Abed Fattah, quoted in 2014 Her husband was accused of organising a protest against the use of military courts for civilians’ trials. That was in November 2013, just after demonstrations had effectively been banned. Others came forward to say they had planned the protest - including Alaa’s own sister, Mona Seif.  He was convicted anyway. For Manal the uprising of seven years ago is now firmly in the rearview mirror. “There were a lot of possibilities,” she says. “A lot of plans and dreams, and things to do. Now it’s just, ‘Let’s live the day today, and try to survive that’.” When we arrive at Tora prison, Manal and Khaled join a queue of families waiting beneath the watchtowers for a chance to see their loved ones. The gates of Cairo's Tora prison Afterwards she says the visit was rushed, as usual. “It's very cruel for Khaled because he gets very little time with his father and doesn’t have all his attention. We have to do everything in just 60 minutes.” Resistance runs in her husband’s family.  Alaa’s father was the renowned human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif Al Islam. When he was on his deathbed in 2014 both Alaa and his sister Sana’a were behind bars. They were allowed out only to bury him. Their mother, Laila Soueif, has been an activist for decades. The extended family gather for lunch at her book-filled Cairo flat. Laila - a mathematics professor with a shock of grey hair - is busy in the kitchen.  She’s chopping salad and frying thin slices of basterma - the spiced beef beloved of many Egyptians. Several generations gather in the dining room, their voices overlapping in a tapestry of laughter and shared history. But the empty space at the table is keenly felt. “We are sad. We are sorry. We are unhappy,” says Alaa’s aunt, Ahdaf Souief. “But I think that the anger is really paramount.” She is quick to stress they are better off than other families whose sons and daughters have been given life sentences, have vanished, or have been killed. Ahdaf is animated and articulate, with shoulder-length dark hair, and black-rimmed glasses.   She chooses her words with care, like the novelist she is. Her eyes brim with tears when she speaks of her nephew. “This is somebody who could have been amazing, and not just for this country. This is somebody with a really valuable mind and set of skills,” she says. “And it's because of that that he's been put away and deactivated. They wanted him out of the picture.” A whole generation has been crushed, according to Alaa’s sister Mona. The 31-year-old is cut from the same cloth as her brother - the same curly hair, the same commitment to change. So many of her friends are in prison she struggles to keep count. She says that under President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt is bleeding. “I've never seen a regime as bloody as Sisi’s regime,” she says. “I have never seen a regime that belittles the value of life like Sisi’s regime.” Mona Seif: “I have never seen a regime that belittles the value of life like Sisi’s regime” Disappearances, death sentences, and torture have become daily news, she says. “Even people who are silent or are trying to stay away from engaging with the political scene are still being thrown in jail or getting randomly detained.” She says Egyptians are feeling “numb, exhausted and scared” and there's no fight left on the streets. “It's very understandable to be scared with a regime that is not hesitant about using killing.” After her brother finishes his five-year sentence next March, he will be on probation for a further five years.  That may amount to another form of imprisonment. He could be required to sleep at his local police station every night. That has been the fate of other activists. Alaa was temporarily released in 2014 to attend his father's funeral Before Alaa Abdel Fattah was convicted, I met him at his mother’s apartment.  It was 2014 and he was out on bail.  He and Laila chatted and laughed over tea, the conversation ranging from mathematical theories to political strategies. The young revolutionary was clear-eyed about how much worse things were since the revolution. “When you were confronting Mubarak hope was a material thing,” he said. “You could almost touch it. And so it was very easy to feel that it was worth it.  And so people were taking these risks without any kind of despair. Right now it’s very bleak.” His late father had spoken - with regret - of bequeathing him a jail cell.  I asked Alaa what he thought he would leave his son, Khaled. “Almost certainly a prison cell,” he replied. “And I cannot guarantee in any way that he would not be killed by the police, or tortured by the police or broken by the police. I have no hope of offering my son anything unless we change this country.” Tahrir Square, Cairo Now it’s a place to take selfies.  It’s on the tourist trail for foreign visitors - the Pyramids, the Egypt Museum in downtown Cairo and, just a few minutes walk away, Tahrir (or Liberation) Square. Egyptians also come to the centre of the square - from shy young couples to boisterous teenagers. They stand in front of a large monument, topped by the Egyptian flag, or sit for a moment on the steps. They are lured here by memory, not by banners or billboards. The monument is bare.  There is no mention of the more than 800 people killed in the struggle for freedom in Egypt -  no names, no photographs, no tributes. Tahrir Square, May 2011 Tahrir Square, 2018 Tahrir Square, 2011 Tahrir Square, 2018 In fact there is nothing to indicate that Tahrir was the cradle - and crucible - of a revolution. The busy plaza has long since been reclaimed by the twin constants of Egyptian life - the traffic and the police (those in uniforms, and their ubiquitous colleagues in plain clothes). If Tahrir sends any message today the regime would like it to be: “Nothing to see here.” Yet this was where Egyptians converged in January 2011, as calls for change built to a crescendo in the Middle East. It was the early days of the so-called Arab Spring. Given what came later, “Spring” seems a tragic misnomer. General Sisi, later promoted to field marshal, went on to be elected president in 2014. It was a landslide victory marred by a low turnout. Critics accuse Egypt’s latest military strongman of an unprecedented assault on human rights. During my four years as the BBC’s Egypt correspondent I’ve witnessed the security forces turn their guns on peaceful demonstrators. It was the anniversary of the revolution in 2014. We had just arrived at a peaceful protest when heavily armed police pulled up, wearing balaclavas. Without warning they opened fire in the direction of the crowd. I’ve seen unarmed liberal protesters jailed for years.  I’ve covered mass trials for Islamists, where death sentences were recommended for almost 700 men -after a hearing that was over in hours. My BBC colleagues and I have been harassed on the streets by the security forces. A police officer once threatened to shoot us if we did not stop filming. On another occasion we were detained for filming an interview with a woman whose husband was killed at Rabaa mosque. After a few hours at a police station we were released  unharmed, with our interviewee. It was a very small taste from the menu of repression here. Press freedom is under attack. Egypt is in the top three worldwide for jailing journalists. Anyone who challenges the official line can be detained for “spreading false news”. Hundreds of websites have been banned - including independent news sites. It’s not the new Egypt many yearned for when they filled Tahrir Square. We wanted to get the government’s response to allegations of widespread human rights abuses, and to the accounts we have gathered of disappearances and torture by the security forces. We approached the Interior Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and the State Information Service. No-one was prepared to be interviewed. In the past officials have denied there are enforced disappearances and widespread human rights abuses. They have told me there is no systematic torture but if “mistakes” are made, officers are punished. President Sisi seems to regard geography as an excuse. “When it comes to human rights… we are not in Europe. We are in a different region,” he said last October. He also claimed information from rights groups could not be trusted. Take a stroll through the streets here, past the bread ovens and tea carts and cafes with water pipes and you’ll hear noisy complaints. There are gripes about broken pavements and soaring inflation - about 17% in January - but you won’t find a clamour for democratic reform. Many are more concerned about high prices than repression.  Plenty of Egyptians are grateful for relative stability under their hardline leader, especially amid bomb attacks by the local branch of the Islamic State group, based in the Sinai Peninsula. President Sisi still has a bedrock of support, but some who voted for him last time are rueing their choice, posting on Facebook: “I am sorry I elected a dictator.” As for the international community many are turning a blind eye to the president’s human rights record because he is seen as a valued partner in the fight against extremism. Before General Sisi was elected president I asked one liberal activist for his prediction. “He will be our Pinochet,” he said, referring to the Chilean general-turned-dictator. “And he will build a lot more jails.” Human rights campaigners say that - at the last count - 17 new prisons have been built in the Sisi era. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, an Egypt-based group, estimates as many as 60,000 people have become political prisoners. Humour flows through Egypt like the Nile.  It’s woven into the DNA of a great nation that has both suffered and endured. The forthcoming presidential poll is providing fresh material. “Have you heard the latest?” asked a friend.  “The presidential election has now dropped out of the presidential election.” The ballot, on 26-28 March, has been dubbed a contest between Sisi and his shadow. Serious opponents have been disqualified, detained or have dropped out of the race.  When the former army chief of staff Lt Gen Sami Anan declared his candidacy he was promptly arrested.  He has been accused of running for office without the permission of the military. One of Anan’s key backers  - Egypt’s former anti-corruption chief Hisham Genena - was attacked and badly wounded outside his home. His family said it was an attempt on his life.  He, too, was later arrested. President Sisi will have one “challenger” at the polls – an obscure centrist politician called Mousa Mostafa Mousa. He denies mounting a sham campaign at the behest of the regime, though he’s known to be a Sisi supporter. While the president’s victory is guaranteed, critics say his legitimacy will be seriously undermined. Fourteen human rights groups, both international and domestic, have denounced the election as “farcical”. Opposition leaders in Egypt have called for a boycott. The president seems deaf to his critics - increasingly so.  He is adamant that he will not go the way of Hosni Mubarak. “Be warned,” he said recently. “What happened seven or eight years ago will not happen again.” His nation is grappling with an unstable neighbour (Libya) and a stubborn enemy (IS militants based in northern Sinai). The Egyptian leader presents himself as a bulwark against instability. He says he’s waging war on terror. Human rights groups say he’s using that as a pretext to wage war on dissent. Instead of a vibrant new democracy in the heart of the Arab world there is a return to the default setting - fear. In recent years the authorities in Cairo had paid lip service to the need to break with the past and respect individual rights. Now it feels like the mask isn’t just slipping, but being cast aside. That’s a risky strategy. “They think that through repression and draconian laws they can get what they want – namely staying in power,” says the seasoned human rights campaigner Mohammed Lotfy.  “But what this does is to radicalise people  even more against the regime.” Before leaving Egypt in late January, I went to the outskirts of Cairo to take a final trip across the Nile. Along the way I passed a shepherd tending his flock, framed by lofty palm trees.  His little boy wore a traditional long gown - a galabeya - and stood cradling a lamb, not a smartphone. It was like a scene from centuries ago. In many ways this country of 100 million, with its teeming young population - so full of potential - seems locked in the past. I boarded the ferry along with a gaggle of passengers in cars, on motorbikes, and on donkey carts.  There was surprise at the presence of a foreign visitor - a rarer sight these days. There were shouts of “Welcome”. A vegetable seller pressed sweet cherry tomatoes into my hand.   The ferry captain asked if I wanted to take photos from his vantage point high above the deck. This was a slice of the Egypt I will miss - warm-hearted, chaotic, and rich in spirit. I have come away, after four years, with plenty of questions. What lies ahead if Egypt can’t steer a course towards real democracy? How many prisons is the regime going to fill? And just how long will it be before all the repression backfires?

"The Crystals, pictured in 1964, with Barbara Ann Alston far left The Crystals singer Barbara Ann Alston, who recorded hits like Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me, has died at the age of 74. Her band, along with The Ronettes, were among the definitivegirl groups,externalof the 1960s and helped constructPhil Spector,external's Wall of Sound. Alston sang lead vocals on their first three singles, including the US top 20 hitThere's No Other Like My Baby,external. She died on Friday 16 February after contracting flu, her daughter said. ""She lovedThe Crystals,external,"" Donielle Prophete told BBC News. ""She always talked about singing with them, the work they created together. She loved the sisterhood part of it, the travelling."" The Crystals were originally a quintet consisting of Alston, Dee Dee Kennibrew, Mary Thomas, Patricia Wright and La La Brooks - all of whom grew up singing in the church. They were put together by big band sideman Benny Wells - who happened to be Alston's uncle - while they were still at school. They were later discovered by Spector while cutting demos for the publisher Hill & Range. Brooks was seen as the lead singer, but Spector disagreed and championed a reluctant Alston instead. ""I just found out recently [that] she had a real problem with being the lead,"" recalled Prophete. ""They loved her voice and they kept pushing her to the front but she was shy. ""My sister says mum wanted to do the choreography and stuff like that."" Phil Spector, one of the most influential producers of the 1960s, was later jailed for murder Nonetheless, Alston's innocent-but-sensuous vocals propelled their first single, There's No Other Like My Baby, into the charts in 1962. It was followed by the dramatic, flamenco-inflectedUptown,external. However, the band's next singleHe Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss),externaland its depiction of domestic violence led to a public outcry and Spector eventually pulled the song from sale. Speaking to Mojo magazine in 2010, Brooks recalled that Alston had been ""a little uneasy"" about recording the song and the band were ""taken aback"" by the subject matter. Carole King,external, who wrote the music to Gerry Goffin's lyrics, subsequently disowned the composition, saying ""it's the one song I kind of wish I hadn't had any part of writing"". After that, Spector took The Crystals name and gave it to his protegeDarlene Love,external, who sang on the band's next two singles, including the hitHe's A Rebel,external(taking The Crystals by surprise when they first heard it on the radio). In 1963, the original quintet were allowed to sing on their own records again and scored their two biggest hits withDa Doo Ron Ron,externalandThen He Kissed Me,external. By this point, Alston had ceded the limelight to La La Brooks, who took the lead vocal on those and later hits. But Alston remained proud of the band, and stayed involved with their career into her 70s, her daughter said. ""She would always sing around the house, especially around Christmas,"" she recalled. Alston's funeral is being on Friday, with fellow Crystals singer Dee Dee Kennibrew scheduled to be a speaker.

"Flt Lt Sean Cunningham died after being ejected from his aircraft in 2011 An ejection seat manufacturer prosecuted over the death of a Red Arrows pilot thrown from his jet has been fined Â£1.1m. Flt Lt Sean Cunningham, 35, was ejected while conducting pre-flight safety checks at RAF Scampton in 2011. The parachute on the seat did not then deploy and the airman was fatally injured. Martin-Baker Aircraft Ltd previously admitted to breaching safety laws at Lincoln Crown Court. Sentencing the company, Mrs Justice Carr said it was ""an entirely preventable tragedy"". ""A significant number of pilots, and also potential passengers, were exposed to the risk of harm over a lengthy period,"" she added. ""Here the risk of harm was of the highest level - death."" Reading a victim impact statement on behalf of Flt Lt Cunningham's family, the judge said: ""Sean's two biggest fears in life were being ejected from an aircraft and the injuries that would be sustained, and dying at a young age. ""He was to tragically experience both of these. ""He was the perfect son and brother and the pride in him from the family is justifiably immense."" The ejection seat on Flt Lt Cunningham's Hawk T1 fired while he was carrying out pre-flight checks At a previous hearing, prosecutor Rex Tedd QC said there was a risk ""to many pilots over a lengthy period"". ""If the pilot was ejected from the Hawk aircraft, two shackles would not release from one another and would jam together and the main parachute would not deploy,"" he added. ""The pilot would be several hundred feet in the air and there could only be one result of that, and that is the pilot's death."" The court previously heard an assessment by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) was that such an incident would happen only once in more than 100 years. It was also told the firm had a ""good system"" in place and it ""just failed in this instance"". However, the judge said the company fell short of the appropriate standard. Martin-Baker Aircraft Ltd admitted it had failed to provide a written warning to the RAF about over-tightening a bolt on the aircraft Speaking after the sentencing, Flt Lt Sean Cunningham's father Jim Cunningham said his son's death was preventable. He said: ""Martin-Baker were aware of the defect more than 20 years ago, and it took Sean's death for the issue to come to light. ""We can only hope they have learned a lesson and that no-one else goes through this hell because of faulty equipment."" He said his son, who suffered five skull fractures and 40 body fractures, was a wonderful young man with ""a heart as big as the world"", whose life had been cruelly cut short. In a statement issued by Flt Lt Cunningham's sister Nicolette Cunningham, the family added: ""Sean's death was not an accident. It was a preventable death waiting to happen and we don't believe it was an isolated incident."" She said: ""Lastly, I would like to address the MoD and RAF. I have one question for you. Where are you? Not one of you is here to represent my son or my family. ""Sean was so proud to be a member of the armed forces and to serve his country. He was the perfect ambassador for your organisation. He gave you his all and ultimately gave his life."" Sean's father said it took his son's death for a known issue with the ejection seat mechanism to come to light Martin-Baker Aircraft Ltd had already agreed to pay Â£550,000 in prosecution costs. In a statement, the company, which is based in Denham, Buckinghamshire, said: ""Our thoughts remain foremost with the family and friends of Ft Lt Sean Cunningham, to whom the company conveys its sadness, regret and apology."" The firm admitted the health and safety breach on the basis it had failed to provide a written warning to the RAF about over-tightening a bolt on the aircraft. It added its ejection seats were in use by 92 air forces and had saved more than 7,000 lives. Operations manager for the Health and Safety Executive, Harvey Wild, said the death was ""avoidable"" and Martin-Baker ""failed to take all reasonably practicable steps to protect users from the risk of harm"". 8 November 2011:Flt Lt Sean Cunningham died after being ejected from a Hawk T1 jet while on the ground at the Red Arrows base at RAF Scampton 9 November 2011:The day after his death, the MOD suspended training flights of aircraft fitted with the MK10 ejection seats including Hawk T1, Tornado and Tucano 22 November 2011:An inquest, which opened and adjourned in Lincoln, heard the Red Arrows pilot died from multiple injuries after being ejected from an aircraft.

"Twenty-two aid organisations have said they are ""truly sorry"" for the sector's failings in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by workers. In a letter signed by chief executives, charities including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB vowed to do more to protect those they were set up to help. They also promised a series of ""urgent and immediate"" measures, including more resources for safeguarding. ""There can be no tolerance for the abuse of power,"" the letter said. ""We have an absolute duty to our staff, our supporters and, above all, the people we seek to help to ensure we do everything in our power to prevent, detect and eradicate unacceptable behaviour."" The charities admitted recent revelations had caused ""widespread distress and disappointment"" and said the sector needed to ""fundamentally"" change. ""Safeguarding is something that, as a sector, we have long taken very seriously and all our organisations have systems in place to prevent all forms of abuse and misconduct.

Ex-Save the Children boss Justin Forsyth apologises over texts Oxfam Haiti scandal: Thousands cancel donations to charity ""However, we can never be complacent. We must do even more to protect the very people we were set up to help,"" the letter said. Plan International UK, a charity which signed the letter, said it had ""six confirmed cases of sexual abuse and exploitation of children by staff, volunteers or partner organisations"" between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. In a blog post, the charity said five cases had been reported to the local authorities,externaland that no Plan International UK staff had been involved in any of these cases. During the same period, it said there had been nine incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct by staff against adults. The measures announced by aid organisations in their letter include a review of referencing systems ""so that people found to have abused their power or behaved inappropriately are not re-employed in the sector"". Ex-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth resigned from Unicef on Thursday after the BBC reported he had faced three complaints about his behaviour by Save the Children staff. Unicef confirmed that the charity had not been aware of any of the complaints against Mr Forsythat the time of his recruitment in 2016. The aid organisations have also said they will work with the government ""to ensure that we can overcome the legal and institutional barriers to rigorous background checks in the UK"". This video can not be played Ex-Save the Children worker: 'A really toxic culture grew' The Charity Commission has said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Brendan Cox -  the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - and Mr Forsyth between 2015 and 2016. Mr Cox quit two charities he set up in memory of his wife last weekend after allegations of sexual assault were made public. Mr Cox denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 - but admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. A petition calling for the resignation of international chairman Sir Alan Parker has been signed by some employees at Save the Children. The petition claims Sir Alan, as chairman, was ""ultimately accountable for both [Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth's] cases"" and also calls for ""proactive, full public disclosure, to retain and regain public trust"". In response to the petition, a Save the Children spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns expressed in the petition and believe it's vital that everyone feels safe and secure when going about their work and interacting with colleagues. ""It's precisely for that reason CEO Kevin Watkins has commissioned a thorough review of current practices and workplace culture."" Meanwhile,Haiti has suspended Oxfam GB operationsin the country as it investigates claims of sexual misconduct by staff in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Seven Oxfam members of staff left the charity in 2011 following the organisation's own investigation into whether staff hired prostitutes while working overseas. Oxfam denied a cover-up butits handling of the scandal, first reported in the Times earlier this month, is being investigated by the Charity Commission.

"The United States is imposing a fresh set of sanctions on North Korea - the ""largest ever"", President Trump says. The measures target more than 50 ships and maritime transport companies in North Korea, but also China and Taiwan. North Korea is already under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests. But it continued tests last year, including tests of a nuclear weapon and a long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the US. The US says the new sanctions are designed to put a further squeeze on North Korea, cutting off sources of revenue and fuel for its nuclear programme and clamping down on evasion of already existing restrictions. The US treasury department lists one individual and 27 companies,external. Sixteen, mainly shipping companies, are based in North Korea, but five are registered in Hong Kong, two on the Chinese mainland, two in Taiwan, one in Panama and one in Singapore. Twenty-eight ships are on the list, again mostly North Korean, but two are Panama-flagged, one from the Comoros and one Tanzania-flagged. Speaking at a new conference on Friday, President Trump warned of serious consequences if the latest round of sanctions did not generate results. ""If the sanctions don't work we'll have to go phase two - and phase two may be a very rough thing, may be very, very unfortunate for the world,"" he said. ""It really is a rogue nation.  If we can make a deal it'll be a great thing and if we can't, something will have to happen."" He did not specify what ""phase two"" would entail. The US has been building sanctions against the regime since 2008 and the latest restrictions could come on top of sanctions announced in November - directed at North Korean shipping operations, as well as Chinese companies trading with Pyongyang. The United Nations followed that up in December with a raft of sanctions, backed by all 15 members of the Security Council, which included measures to cut North Korea's petrol imports by up to 90%. Reality Check: How North Korea does business North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate The missile crisis in 300 words The Trump administration's announcement comes as North Korea conducts what is being seen by Western powers as a charm offensive at the Winter Olympics in South Korea. US leaders have been keen to stress that North Korea still poses a nuclear threat despite warming ties with the South. The president's daughter Ivanka is in South Koreato attend the closing ceremony of the Games and Vice-President Mike Pence was there for the opening. However, no meetings have taken place with senior North Korean officials attending, including Kim Yo-jong, sister of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. North Korea baby rumours fascinate South Sanctions have done nothing to deter North Korea in its development of missiles and nuclear technology. Last year saw the first test of a long-range missile thought capable of reaching Washington, but it is still not clear if North Korea has mastered the technology needed to miniaturise a nuclear device for a warhead. Also on Friday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Mr Trump's administration is working on new sanctions against Russia over alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election and other activities. ""I can assure you that is in the process. I will be back here within the next several weeks to talk about that,"" he said. 30 November 2016:UN sanctions targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap.

"University bosses say they could reverse changes to lecturers' pensions if economic conditions improve. As strike action continues for a  second day at 57 universities, the employers' group, Universities UK, has written to pension scheme members offering to explore alternative ideas. The University and College Union (UCU) says current plans will leave a typical lecturer Â£10,000 a year worse off. About 90,000 students have now signed petitions asking for fee refunds. Under the existing plans, the Universities Superannuation Scheme will change from a defined benefit scheme, giving members a guaranteed income in retirement, to a defined contribution scheme, where pensions are subject to changes in the stock market.

"This video can not be played ""He didn't have the courage"" An armed officer who stood outside a Florida school where a gunman killed 17 people last week ""certainly did a poor job"", US President Donald Trump says. Deputy Scot Peterson resigned after an investigation found he failed to confront the suspect. Mr Trump said Mr Peterson might be a ""coward"" who ""didn't react properly under pressure"". Florida's governor meanwhile called for law enforcement officers to be placed in every public school in the state. This video can not be played How young conservatives view #NeverAgain Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday morning, President Trump criticised the police officer who did not confront the perpetrator of the 14 February massacre in Parkland, Florida. ""He trained his whole life but when it came time to do something he didn't have the courage,"" he said. Mourning for the shooting victims continued in Parkland on Friday ""He certainly did a poor job."" ""But that's a case where somebody was outside, they're trained, they didn't react properly under pressure or they were coward,"" he added. The Republican president later touted his love for gun rights on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Maryland. He again proposed arming teachers as a solution to school safety, a method long championed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. Facebook 'regret' over shooting game demo Activists target companies tied to NRA NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif This video can not be played What the British think of arming teachers Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel revealed on Thursday that Mr Peterson, the 54-year-old school resource officer, stood outside while the alleged gunman shot students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He said video footage showed Mr Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said. Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' Asked what Mr Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said: ""Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer."" Mr Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. It is unclear if he will face charges. The suspect used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being captured later. School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. Employed by the local police or sheriff's office, they document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education. This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. There are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the US, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper,externalsaid he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (Â£54,137). Concerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about the former student charged with the massacre were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. Calls were also reportedly made to the authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about the suspect, including one saying he was planning to attack the school. A transcript of one call to the FBI was released to US media on Frida,externaly, in which a tipster warns that Mr Cruz ""wants to kill people"" and that ""he's going to explode"". The female caller, whose identification was redacted in the report, said that Mr Cruz once brought a bird inside ""threw it on his mother's kitchen counter and he started cutting it up"". She also warned that Mr Cruz was receiving an inheritance of $25,000 per year, and that he may spend that money on guns. Governor Rick Scott called for ""active shooter training"" for all students and staff at public schools in the state. He said he planned to raise Florida's minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old. Governor Scott also pledged to make it ""virtually impossible for anyone who has mental health issues to use guns."" ""If a court involuntarily commits someone because they are a risk to themselves or others, they would be required to surrender all firearms and not regain the right to purchase or possess a firearm until a court hearing,"" he said during a speech about a new proposal on guns in Tallahassee.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today the government has ruled out staying in a customs union after Brexit Jeremy Hunt has said there is no possibility of the government backing a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The health secretary said the UK wanted ""frictionless trade"" but would ""find a different way"" to achieve that. Tory rebels are attempting to force the government to keep the option of a customs union with the EU on the table and have some cross-party support. Theresa May will make a speech on the UK's future relationship with the EU next Friday. And Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to outline Labour policy on a customs union on Monday, amid reports that his party's position on it is ""evolving"". EU leaders split on spending after Brexit Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? The customs union explained in 45 seconds Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union If he backs membership of a customs union, it could mean Mrs May faces a Commons showdown over the issue - with pro-European Conservative rebels joining forces with Labour MPs. Conservative MP Anna Soubry says there is cross-party support for an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently going through Parliament, urging the government to pursue as a negotiating objective forming a customs union after Brexit. This video can not be played Tony Blair calls for a second referendum A customs union means countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union - but it does not allow members to strike their own trade deals. Supporters of the UK being in a customs union argue it is vital to protect businesses - but opponents fear it would mean ""Brexit in name only"" and the UK should make its own arrangements. Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a customs union was ""one way of getting frictionless trade but it is not the only way"". The government wanted to agree ""frictionless trade by agreement between two sovereign bodies, the United Kingdom and the European Union"", he said. Asked if there was any possibility of the government coming round to the idea of a customs union with the EU after Brexit, he replied: ""No"". The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee discussed the government's approach for eight hours at Chequers on Thursday The health secretary was not at the meeting of senior ministers at Chequers on Thursday but said a broad agreement had been reached ahead of a discussion by the whole cabinet and the prime minister's speech next Friday. Despite ""divergent views"" there was a  ""central common understanding is that there will be areas and sectors of industry where we agree to align our regulations with European regulations, such as the automotive industry. ""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge, and what we won't be doing is accepting changes in rules because the EU unilaterally chooses to make those changes,"" said Mr Hunt. But pro-EU Labour backbencher Chuka Umunna - an ally of Anna Soubry - warned Theresa May her plan to leave the customs union could be defeated by MPs. ""If they are not going to change their position they are going to lose votes in the House of Commons, it's a straightforward as that."" Former prime minister Tony Blair said if there was an ""impasse"" in Parliament on the customs union issue, it made the case stronger for a referendum on the final Brexit deal - something dismissed by Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey as ""ridiculous"". He said a customs union would mitigate the problems of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In an articleon his website,external, he attacked those politicians who, he said, were ""prepared to sacrifice the Good Friday Agreement on the altar of Brexit and declare that the peace agreed in Northern Ireland is not, really, worth having anyway"". ""This is irresponsibility that is frankly sickening,"" he said. Mrs May will meet European Council President Donald Tusk in London on Thursday, the day before her speech. Meanwhilethe Times has reported,externalthat the prime minister is planning a U-turn over the right of EU citizens who arrive in the UK after Brexit, but during the ""transition period"", to remain in the country permanently. Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC that would be ""quite wrong"": ""I'd be astonished if Mrs May would make U-turn of that kind; she is a lady of great backbone and for her to kowtow to the European Union is, I think, unconscionable.""

"This video can not be played Sheriff Scott Israel: ""Peterson never went in"" An armed officer assigned to the Florida school where a gunman killed 17 people last week stood outside the building during the shooting and did not intervene, the local sheriff says. Deputy Scot Peterson has resigned after being suspended, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said. Earlier this week President Trump said arming school teachers could prevent school shootings. The proposal has long been championed by the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. On Thursday, in the NRA's first comments since the massacre, its head accused Democrats and media of ""exploiting"" the attack. Wayne LaPierre said ""opportunists"" were using the tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' Sheriff Israel said Mr Peterson, 54, was the school resource officer of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and was at the site, armed and in uniform, when the shooting took place. Students were evacuated in small groups after the 14 February shooting He said video footage showed Mr Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said. Asked what Mr Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said: ""Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer."" Mr Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. Sheriff Israel said Mr Peterson had not given a reason for why he did not go into the building where the shooter was. It is unclear if he will face charges. Sheriff Israel said he would not be releasing the video showing Mr Peterson and might never do so, ""depending on the prosecution and criminal case"" against the 19-year-old suspect accused of carrying out the shooting, former student Nikolas Cruz. The gunman used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being seen and arrested later. This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. Employed by the local police or sheriff's office, they document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education. There are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the US, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper,externalsaid he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (Â£54,137). Concerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about Nikolas Cruz were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. It has also been reported that calls were made to local authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about Nikolas Cruz, including one saying he was planning to attack the school. Teachers will be allowed back in on Friday. Both students and teachers are invited to a reorientation on Sunday, ahead of classes resuming on Wednesday. The three-storey building that was attacked is to be torn down. In recent days both President Trump and the NRA have spoken about this. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington on Thursday, Mr LaPierre reiterated that his group backed it. Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? He said the NRA would help any US school with their safety and security, free of charge, adding that ""opportunists"" pushing for more gun control ""hate the NRA. They hate the second amendment. They hate individual freedom"". This video can not be played Florida shooting: Why the NRA wields so much power The second amendment in the US constitution protects the ""right to keep and bear arms"". America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump floated the idea of arming teachers at a White House event on Wednesday where he heard from survivors of the Florida school shooting, Discussing school safety with state and local officials on Thursday, he explained why he believed that it would work, saying: ""Shooters won't walk into a school if 20% of people have guns."" This video can not be played Teacher at Florida school where 17 people died says arming some teachers would be wrong Mr Trump added: ""What I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus."" But Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union, disagreed that arming teachers was a suitable solution. ""Anyone who wants guns in schools has no understanding of what goes on inside them - or worse, doesn't care,"" she said. Survivors of last week's deadly shooting have called for stricter gun laws, prompting the nationwide activist movement #NeverAgain. Those survivors are organising a rally against mass shootings in Washington planned for 24 March and are expecting up to 500,000 people,according to the Washington Post,external. Sister rallies for ""March for Our Lives"" are also being planned in cities across the country. This video can not be played Victim's father tells Trump of rage Mr Trump has said he supports raising the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18 to 21 and insists the NRA would back such a proposal. In Florida aftermath, US students say 'Never Again' After Florida, some owners give up guns Six radical ways to stop US school shootings ""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" Mr Trump also took to Twitter on Thursday to push for national background checks for the mentally ill, a policy which the NRA chief later echoed at the conference. ""Anyone adjudicated as mentally incompetent or dangerous to society should be prevented from getting a gun,"" said Mr Trump. The US president has also directed his administration to take steps to ban gun ""bump stocks"". The accessories - which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute - were used by a gunman who killed 58 concert-goers in Las Vegas last October.

"BT must make it easier for rival internet providers to use its telegraph poles, telecoms regulator Ofcom says. Ofcom has published alist of new measures,externalto make it cheaper for companies to install ultrafast full fibre broadband infrastructure. Connecting homes directly to the fibre network delivers much faster internet speeds than copper cables. Rivals Talk Talk and Hyperoptic welcomed the announcement. BT said it was ""considering the implications"". Ofcom says full fibre internet is currently available to 3% of UK homes and offices. It hopes to see 6 million buildings connected by 2020. It said BT must make it easier for rivals to install fibre on its telegraph poles and in its underground tunnels. It wants a clearer map of where there is capacity on the telegraph poles and in the tunnels for rivals to do so. Ofcom suggested streets could be connected to full fibre in ""hours"" rather than days, as companies would no longer have to dig up roads to lay fibre. It estimated that sharing infrastructure would halve the cost of connecting a home to full fibre - from Â£500 to Â£250. Additionally, BT will be banned from reducing its wholesale prices in areas where rival networks are starting to lay infrastructure. Openreach, which maintains most of the UK's telephone lines, will be ordered to repair faulty infrastructure and clear the way for competitors to access its tunnels. ""Openreach must ensure there is space on its telegraph poles for extra fibre cables connecting homes to a competitor's network,"" Ofcom said in a statement. BT said it had ""noted"" the publication of Ofcom's proposals. In astatement,external, it said the changes would have an ""adverse financial impact on Openreach's revenue and profit"" in the region of Â£80m to Â£120m. Addressing the restriction on varying its wholesale prices, BT said it was ""considering the implications for full and fair competition"". Openreach said Ofcom's statement gave the company ""certainty on their approach"". But it said it had already been letting rival companies use its telegraph poles and tunnels. ""Our ducts and poles have been open since 2011 and we have been sharing a digital map of this network for more than a year,"" it said in a statement. It added that telecoms firms needed to ""be certain they can secure a return on their investment"" if a nationwide rollout of full fibre was to be realised. Talk Talk said the announcement was ""good for consumers, competition and investment"". Hyperoptic said the move would strengthen the business case for investment in full fibre networks. ""This will ultimately create a better digital future for the UK, not just serve the interests of BT retail,"" said Hyperoptic chief executive Dana Tobak. Consumer magazine Which? said the changes needed to be made more quickly. ""Consumers are crying out for better broadband... steps to ensure more investment in this vital service can't come soon enough,"" said spokeswoman Alex Neill. by Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent Suddenly everyone has gone full fibre. After years of insisting that laying fibre right to the home was too expensive and a copper connection to a kerbside fibre cabinet was absolutely fine, the government has changed its mind. Now the regulator Ofcom has come in behind the new thinking. To make the sums add up, it is forcing BT to open up its network of tunnels and telegraph poles to its rivals. Cynics will point out that this was supposed to have happened years ago - but at last the regulator is tightening the screw. The really bold move would have been to split Openreach off from BT years ago and turn it into a national ""fibre to the home"" utility. But that ship has sailed. Ofcom now believes that overlapping fast fibre networks built by BT and its rivals will deliver more innovation and a better deal for consumers.

"Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK The UK breaches the rights of women in Northern Ireland by unduly restricting their access to abortion, a UN Committee has found. ""Denial of abortion and criminalisation of abortion amounts to discrimination against women because it is a denial of a service that only women need,"" said the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. ""It puts women in horrific situations."" Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK. An abortion is only allowed if a woman's life is at risk or there is a serious or permanent risk to her mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Abortion law 'matter for NI assembly' Supreme Court rules against Northern Ireland woman The breach of women's rights are ""grave and systematic"" because the existing law means women have to travel outside Northern Ireland to procure a legal abortion or to carry a pregnancy to term, said a report produced by the committee. It concludes that a restriction preventing women from exercising reproductive choice involves mental and physical suffering. The report makes 13 recommendations  - including the repeal of the criminal sanction on abortion contained in the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. One of the recommendations is that terminations should be allowed in cases of sexual crime and fatal foetal abnormality and when there is a threat to a woman's health without ""permanency"" being a condition. The committee consists of 23 experts on women's rights from around the world. Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, called on the government to introduce abortion reform at Westminster ""without delay"". She said: ""The UN Committee is very clear that it is the UK government which is responsible for ensuring that our laws are in line with the state's international human rights obligations. ""Devolution - even if functioning - does not relieve the UK government of their responsibility to uphold human rights in Northern Ireland."" The chief executive of Christian Action Research and Education, Nola Leach, said Northern Ireland's abortion laws should ""be framed in a way that provides the best possible outcome for both the mother and the unborn child,"" but ""we cannot ignore one to the detriment of the other"". ""Northern Ireland's current legislation on abortion provides support for the unborn child; we should not seek to undermine or remove that protection,"" she said. A Supreme Courtjudgment considering whether abortion law in Northern Ireland is incompatible with international human rightsis expected shortly. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) said it would update the Supreme Court on the UN's findings. ""Today's report is timely as the commission is waiting for the outcome of our own legal challenge,"" said NIHRC chief commissioner Les Allamby. 30 November 2015:A High Court judge in Northern Irelandrules Northern Ireland's law breached the European Convention on Human Rightsin cases of fatal foetal abnormality or sexual crime 11 February 2016:Members of theNorthern Ireland Assembly vote against legalising abortionin cases of fatal foetal abnormality (by 59 votes to 40) and cases of sexual crime (by 64 votes to 30) 14 June 2017: Supreme Courtrejects an appeal by an anonymous mother and daughterthat NI women should be able to access free NHS abortions in England. 29 June 2017:Northern Ireland's Department of Justice (DoJ) and Attorney Generalsuccessfully appeal against 2015 High Court human rights ruling, prompting the NIHRC to go to the Supreme Court 29 June 2017:The government announceswomen from Northern Ireland will be entitled to free NHS abortions in England, after a Labour-led campaign Why are NI abortion laws different?

"Twenty-two aid organisations have said they are ""truly sorry"" for the sector's failings in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by workers. In a letter signed by chief executives, charities including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB vowed to do more to protect those they were set up to help. They also promised a series of ""urgent and immediate"" measures, including more resources for safeguarding. ""There can be no tolerance for the abuse of power,"" the letter said. ""We have an absolute duty to our staff, our supporters and, above all, the people we seek to help to ensure we do everything in our power to prevent, detect and eradicate unacceptable behaviour."" The charities admitted recent revelations had caused ""widespread distress and disappointment"" and said the sector needed to ""fundamentally"" change. ""Safeguarding is something that, as a sector, we have long taken very seriously and all our organisations have systems in place to prevent all forms of abuse and misconduct. Nine charts that show what charities do How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? Ex-Save the Children boss Justin Forsyth apologises over texts Oxfam Haiti scandal: Thousands cancel donations to charity ""However, we can never be complacent. We must do even more to protect the very people we were set up to help,"" the letter said. Plan International UK, a charity which signed the letter, said it had ""six confirmed cases of sexual abuse and exploitation of children by staff, volunteers or partner organisations"" between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. In a blog post, the charity said five cases had been reported to the local authorities,externaland that no Plan International UK staff had been involved in any of these cases. During the same period, it said there had been nine incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct by staff against adults. The measures announced by aid organisations in their letter include a review of referencing systems ""so that people found to have abused their power or behaved inappropriately are not re-employed in the sector"". Ex-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth resigned from Unicef on Thursday after the BBC reported he had faced three complaints about his behaviour by Save the Children staff. Unicef confirmed that the charity had not been aware of any of the complaints against Mr Forsythat the time of his recruitment in 2016. The aid organisations have also said they will work with the government ""to ensure that we can overcome the legal and institutional barriers to rigorous background checks in the UK"". This video can not be played Ex-Save the Children worker: 'A really toxic culture grew' The Charity Commission has said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Brendan Cox -  the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - and Mr Forsyth between 2015 and 2016. Mr Cox quit two charities he set up in memory of his wife last weekend after allegations of sexual assault were made public. Mr Cox denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 - but admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. A petition calling for the resignation of international chairman Sir Alan Parker has been signed by some employees at Save the Children. The petition claims Sir Alan, as chairman, was ""ultimately accountable for both [Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth's] cases"" and also calls for ""proactive, full public disclosure, to retain and regain public trust"". In response to the petition, a Save the Children spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns expressed in the petition and believe it's vital that everyone feels safe and secure when going about their work and interacting with colleagues. ""It's precisely for that reason CEO Kevin Watkins has commissioned a thorough review of current practices and workplace culture."" Meanwhile,Haiti has suspended Oxfam GB operationsin the country as it investigates claims of sexual misconduct by staff in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Seven Oxfam members of staff left the charity in 2011 following the organisation's own investigation into whether staff hired prostitutes while working overseas.

"'If she didn't want to be there, I would never have stopped her,' said Paddy Jackson A court has been told that Ulster and Ireland rugby player Paddy Jackson said he was ""shocked and horrified"" when police put a rape allegation to him. In an interview at Musgrave police station two days after the alleged rape, Mr Jackson insisted: ""I didn't rape her."" He claimed the alleged victim had been flirting with him and followed him up to his bedroom on two occasions. He told police: ""I strenuously deny these allegations. ""I am shocked and horrified that these allegations have been made against me."" Mr Jackson and fellow rugby player Stuart Olding deny raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house, in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Mr Jackson said the woman had taken part in consensual sexual activity with him and Stuart Olding This was the first time the trial had heard a full account of Paddy Jackson's version of events. Transcripts of Mr Jackson's police interviews were read out in court. He was interviewed four times on Thursday 30 June, two days after the alleged rape. The woman, who was 19 at the time, had gone back to Mr Jackson's house with a group of others after an evening at Ollie's nightclub in Belfast. Mr Jackson said he had never met her before and did not know her name. He said four young women had come back to the house  but he said: ""I was not intent on having sex that night."" He said he had been drunk but was not ""falling around the place."" He said one woman ""was being quite forward with me"" and added:  ""I think she was flirting with me and I was pretty sure that something was going to happen between us."" He said the alleged victim followed him upstairs on the night in question and they kissed. After she asked him if he knew her name, and he did not know it, nothing more happened and they both went downstairs. Later, he said ""the same thing happened again"" - he went upstairs and she followed him. He said they started kissing again and she performed oral sex on him. He said that a short time later, his friend Mr Olding came into the bedroom. He said the woman performed oral sex on him too. Rory Harrison and Blane McIlroy deny the charges against him At the same time, Mr Jackson also engaged in sexual activity with the woman, but he insisted it was not intercourse. ""She asked me if I had a condom and I didn't,"" he said. He said the woman ""seemed to be enjoying what was happening"". Asked if he thought the sexual activity might be hurting her, Mr Jackson said: ""If it did, I would've stopped, I definitely would've stopped."" Mr Jackson said they had all taken part in sexual activity, but it was consensual and no intercourse took place. He told police: ""If she didn't want to be there, I would never have stopped her or tried to keep her there. No way."" Asked how the woman had seemed during the sexual activity with him and Mr Olding, he said: ""Fine. I didn't force myself on her."" He added: ""She didn't have to stay, she could have left if she wanted to, but she didn't."" In his final police interview on 30 June, the allegations made against him were put to him in detail. Asked about the first time they went upstairs and started kissing, it was put to him that he had tried to undo the woman's trousers. He said he did not remember doing so. The alleged victim claims she was raped the second time she went upstairs. She said she went to retrieve a handbag she had left in the bedroom and Mr Jackson followed her upstairs. When this was put to him, Mr Jackson said: ""No. No. I went upstairs first and she followed me."" At one point during the police interview, one of the officers said to Mr Jackson: ""I can see you're upset."" The alleged victim claims that Blane McIlroy came into the room naked at one stage. Mr Jackson said: ""I don't remember that."" The court was told that three months later, on 4 October, Mr Jackson was interviewed again. He replied ""no comment"" to all of the questions he was asked. Later, the court heard a tape recording of a police interview Stuart Olding gave after being arrested on the same day as Paddy Jackson. He said that on the night in question his alcohol consumption included four pints of Guinness, two gin and tonics, five vodkas and three shots. He said he didn't know what was going on in Paddy Jackson's bedroom before he went in. He told the police: ""I was about to leave and then I ended up staying."" He added: ""She held her hand out."" Mr Olding denies forcing the woman to perform oral sex on him. Two other men have also been charged in connection with the case. Mr Jackson, 26, from Belfast's Oakleigh Park, is charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault. He denies the charges. Mr Olding, 24, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. He too denies the charge. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure. He denies the charge. Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast, is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charge. The 12-person jury has been told by Judge Patricia Smyth to wait until they hear all of the evidence in the case before coming to any final conclusions.

"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The UN Security Council is struggling to agree a resolution seeking a ceasefire in Syria and has put back a vote until Saturday. The vote has already been delayed several times since Thursday. Russia wanted changes to a draft that calls for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. Western diplomats have accused Russia, Syria's key ally, of stalling for time. France said failure to act may spell the end of the UN itself. Minds have been focused amid outrage at the plight of civilians in the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave. Activists say 462 people have now been killed there this week. Warplanes maintained the bombardment on Friday, witnesses said. Douma and Hamouriyeh were among areas hit. Western powers suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the rebel-held enclave on the edge of Damascus. The United States, the UK and France had called for the resolution to be approved without delay. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said a truce had to be followed by immediate, unhindered access to the Eastern Ghouta. Commenting on Friday evening, US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. ""What those three countries have done to people over the last, short period of time is a disgrace,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Washington. The draft, put forward by Kuwait and Sweden, calls for a nationwide truce to go into effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. Medical evacuations and aid deliveries would start 48 hours after that. The draft says 5.6 million people in 1,244 communities across the country are in acute need. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Sweden's UN ambassador Olof Skoog told the BBC that getting aid to the Eastern Ghouta, where conditions were described by the UN secretary general as ""hell on earth"", was the main objective. ""I think that without the pressure coming from a united Security Council things are not happening the way they should on the ground,"" he said. ""So I think for the council it's a little bit less about the details and more about giving a political pressure to ensure that this happens."" Already overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties France's UN ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre said the UN's inability to help Syrian civilians would result in a devastating loss of credibility. ""The Syrian tragedy must not also become a graveyard for the United Nations,"" he added. The draft resolution also calls for all parties to avoid establishing military positions in civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. Sieges of populated areas should be lifted. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to back the resolution. Under the terms of the draft resolution, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This could include the two biggest rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. Faylaq al-Rahman has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front. Mr Lavrov told reporters his country would be prepared to vote for the ceasefire under certain conditions. ""There are no guarantees that [the rebels] will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,"" he told a briefing. He said Russia had proposed ""a formula which would make the ceasefire real"". The Su-57, Russia's most advanced fighter plane, has been sent to Syria Meanwhile, two of Russia's most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, have been sent to its coastal Hmeimim airbase, Russian military sources told BBC Russian. The sources said the stealth fighter planes were still undergoing flight tests and there was no confirmation they had yet been used in combat. For the sixth day running, Syrian government forces have pounded the Eastern Ghouta. A witness in Douma speaking to Reuters news agency early on Friday said the bombing there was the most intense so far. Syrian state TV says rebels have shelled Damascus, killing one and injuring dozens more. The US has also accused Russia of attacking Ghouta,external, allegations that Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as ""groundless"". The number killed since Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta has risen to 462, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says, at least 99 of them children. Barrel bombs and shell fire have rained down on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Rescue workers said the town of Douma came under sustained attack on Thursday The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and insisted it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that dominate the enclave.

"Passenger groups have reacted angrily to news that hundreds of train timetables are likely to be published later than usual. Rail users are normally told about new timetables 12 weeks in advance, enabling them to book cheap tickets. But the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) has announced that over the next six months passengers may get as little as four weeks' notice of new train times. It blamed a huge number of timetable changes coming up in May. The change will happen from this Sunday, 12 weeks ahead of the new Spring timetable, and is likely to affect travellers for at least six months. Passenger groups predicted there would be ""real disbelief and discontent"" about the lack of advance information. ""Passengers have been badly let down and will be deeply frustrated that they can't make plans with certainty,"" said Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus. ""They are also at risk of paying more."" Labour could revive British Rail Network rail puts projects on hold Cheap advance fares usually become available three months before travel, meaning that some passengers could book their tickets, but find that cheaper fares become available nearer the time of travel. ""Leaves on the line"" may be all too familiar. But as excuses go ""running sand"" is new. Network Rail is blaming the flow of sand into excavations in the North West for delays to planned infrastructure upgrades. Such delays upset the rail timetables. The track operator initially expected to complete electrification works between Manchester and Preston by 2016. Two years on there are still 200 foundations waiting to go in to the ground. The route is one of the busiest in the North West. It is this area that is likely to be most affected by changes to train timetables. There have also been delays to the roll-out of new trains in Scotland. Missed targets for track and train operators will see them both hauled over the coals by the rail regulator in the coming months. Whether it would go as far as fining a public body for breaching regulatory obligations remains to be seen. Some train operators are said to be furious about the late publication of timetables. The Office of Rail and Road - the industry regulator - said it would be conducting an informal enquiry into what had gone wrong. In theory it has the power to fine Network Rail, although that would be seen as a measure of last resort. This video can not be played Is nationalisation the answer for Britain's railways? The RDG - which represents both the train operators and Network Rail - said the May timetable change was ""the biggest in living memory"", with the rescheduling of almost four million services, seven times more than usual. It also said there were significant delays with engineering works, such as the electrification of the line between Manchester and Preston. ""We recognise this will be inconvenient for some passengers and can only apologise that we've had to take this step,"" said Jo Kaye a managing director at Network Rail. The RDG said the problems would only affect passengers ""in a small number of instances"". Normally only 2% of passengers book more than six weeks in advance. It is advising rail users to book their tickets as usual, and then claim a refund if a cheaper fare is subsequently available. Those whose train service is cancelled will be eligible for a full refund.

"Electric-powered Mini cars are to be built in China, as well as in Oxford where most Minis are currently made. BMW, the owner of the Mini brand, said it had agreed an outline deal with Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motor. Cars made under that partnership will be for the Chinese market. The deal will not affect BMW's plan,announced last year, to assemble the first electric Minis in Oxford from 2019. Those cars will use electric motors made in Germany. BMW and Great Wall Motor still have to work out the exact location of their production line and how much they will invest. The Chinese governments has set a target that by 20% of cars sold should be electric or rechargeable-hybrid vehicles by 2025. That is spurring all car makers to raise their investment in China. BMW already has a joint venture with Brilliance Auto to build BMW-branded cars in China. As well as two plants assembling cars, the joint venture has an engine plant which includes a battery factory. BMW is an ambitious company. It wants to expand, and it wants a bigger share of the fast-growing market for electric vehicles. China scores highly on both counts - it has a huge number of consumers, and government policies there heavily favour electric cars. BMW thinks that in order to take full advantage, it needs a local production base. So where does this leave Mini's UK factories? Initially at least, the Chinese factory will produce vehicles for the Chinese market. The cars made there there will be a different model from the electric Mini due to be built in Oxford from 2019, and BMW insists the Mini brand can expand internationally without calling into question its commitment to the UK. But the announcement may send another signal to the government - that Mini can survive without the UK, and is more than capable of moving production elsewhere if it finds the business climate after Brexit too uncomfortable.

"BT must make it easier for rival internet providers to use its telegraph poles, telecoms regulator Ofcom says. Ofcom has published alist of new measures,externalto make it cheaper for companies to install ultrafast full fibre broadband infrastructure. Connecting homes directly to the fibre network delivers much faster internet speeds than copper cables. Rivals Talk Talk and Hyperoptic welcomed the announcement. BT said it was ""considering the implications"". Ofcom says full fibre internet is currently available to 3% of UK homes and offices. It hopes to see 6 million buildings connected by 2020. It said BT must make it easier for rivals to install fibre on its telegraph poles and in its underground tunnels. It wants a clearer map of where there is capacity on the telegraph poles and in the tunnels for rivals to do so. Ofcom suggested streets could be connected to full fibre in ""hours"" rather than days, as companies would no longer have to dig up roads to lay fibre. It estimated that sharing infrastructure would halve the cost of connecting a home to full fibre - from Â£500 to Â£250. Additionally, BT will be banned from reducing its wholesale prices in areas where rival networks are starting to lay infrastructure. Openreach, which maintains most of the UK's telephone lines, will be ordered to repair faulty infrastructure and clear the way for competitors to access its tunnels. ""Openreach must ensure there is space on its telegraph poles for extra fibre cables connecting homes to a competitor's network,"" Ofcom said in a statement. BT said it had ""noted"" the publication of Ofcom's proposals. In astatement,external, it said the changes would have an ""adverse financial impact on Openreach's revenue and profit"" in the region of Â£80m to Â£120m. Addressing the restriction on varying its wholesale prices, BT said it was ""considering the implications for full and fair competition"". Openreach said Ofcom's statement gave the company ""certainty on their approach"". But it said it had already been letting rival companies use its telegraph poles and tunnels. ""Our ducts and poles have been open since 2011 and we have been sharing a digital map of this network for more than a year,"" it said in a statement. It added that telecoms firms needed to ""be certain they can secure a return on their investment"" if a nationwide rollout of full fibre was to be realised. Talk Talk said the announcement was ""good for consumers, competition and investment"". Hyperoptic said the move would strengthen the business case for investment in full fibre networks. ""This will ultimately create a better digital future for the UK, not just serve the interests of BT retail,"" said Hyperoptic chief executive Dana Tobak. Consumer magazine Which? said the changes needed to be made more quickly. ""Consumers are crying out for better broadband... steps to ensure more investment in this vital service can't come soon enough,"" said spokeswoman Alex Neill. by Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent Suddenly everyone has gone full fibre. After years of insisting that laying fibre right to the home was too expensive and a copper connection to a kerbside fibre cabinet was absolutely fine, the government has changed its mind. Now the regulator Ofcom has come in behind the new thinking. To make the sums add up, it is forcing BT to open up its network of tunnels and telegraph poles to its rivals. Cynics will point out that this was supposed to have happened years ago - but at last the regulator is tightening the screw. The really bold move would have been to split Openreach off from BT years ago and turn it into a national ""fibre to the home"" utility. But that ship has sailed. Ofcom now believes that overlapping fast fibre networks built by BT and its rivals will deliver more innovation and a better deal for consumers.

"This video can not be played RBS profit 'very symbolic' says RBS chief executive Ross McEwan Royal Bank of Scotland has returned to profit for the first time in a decade as it continues its recovery. Chief executive Ross McEwan told the BBC it was ""a really symbolic moment."" The bank, which is majority-owned by the taxpayer, made an annual profit of Â£752m compared with a Â£6.95bn loss the year before. RBS still faces a potentially massive fine from the US Department of Justice over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. RBS expanded rapidly in the boom years of the 2000s, and in October 2007 led a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for a massive Â£49bn, one of the largest deals in financial services history. However, the timing of this deal turned out to be unfortunate. A crisis swept through the financial sector, property prices plunged, economies fell into recession and banks lost billions. At the height of the crisis, in October 2008, the Treasury had to step in to bail RBS out for Â£45bn. Since the bank has been trying to get itself back into financial health. In 2013, Ross McEwan became chief executive, and he has turned the bank away from investment banking and towards UK High Street banking. By BBC economics editor, Kamal Ahmed After nine years when accumulated losses totalled Â£58bn pounds - today a symbolic profit for RBS. Does it mean the government can start planning more confidently about selling the 71% stake it holds on behalf of the taxpayer? The fact the share price went down this morning by nearly 5% suggests not. Investors are still nervous about the multi-billion pound fine the bank is expecting from the US. At 269p, the RBS share price is still a long way below the 502p a share the government would need to break even on the billions of pounds it spent bailing out the bank a decade ago. It has already sold some of its stake at a loss - and will have to continue on that path for a long period yet, in the hope that eventually the share price will rise above that 502p and, overall, a profit can be made. Ross McEwan told me it would take three to five years before the government would have a ""much smaller"" level of ownership. Selling the taxpayers' stake in RBS has proved a much tougher and longer process than anyone imagined a decade ago. The sub-prime mortgage crisis came about after banks started giving high-risk loans to people with poor credit histories. Risky mortgages would be packaged up with other loans, bonds, or assets, and sold on to investors as so-called mortgage backed securities. 'Secret' report into RBS published RBS boss admits restructuring 'mistake' RBS to close one in four branches RBS was one of the banks accused by the US Department of Justice of mis-selling these securities. The bank had expected to settle the case in 2017, but is now hoping it will reach an agreement this year. On Friday RBS set aside an extra Â£492m for US litigation, taking the total set aside for US court action around the sale of those products to Â£3.2bn. The issue complicates UK government plans to start selling down its stake in RBS. ""We have been constantly hit with the sins of the past with conduct and litigation issues and I've been heavily restructuring the business to bring it back to the UK,"" Mr McEwan said. On Tuesday, after months of wrangling,MPs released a report by the financial regulatorwhich said a unit of RBS mistreated thousands of small firms. The Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was marketed as an expert service that could save a business, but according to the report took ""inappropriate"" action. Mr McEwan said the report ""did make for really tough reading"". ""We did not get it right for customers at the time they needed us when their businesses were struggling,"" he said. ""We just didn't look after them well enough"". The bank has now put in place a complaints process overseen by a former high court judge, Mr McEwan added. For the first time, RBS published the average pay gap between men and women in the bank, which it said was at 37.2%. ""Our gender pay gap reflects an under-representation of women at senior levels,"" the bank said in its annual report. ""That is not a satisfactory position and we know that we still have much to do to narrow the gap.""

"'If she didn't want to be there, I would never have stopped her,' said Paddy Jackson A court has been told that Ulster and Ireland rugby player Paddy Jackson said he was ""shocked and horrified"" when police put a rape allegation to him. In an interview at Musgrave police station two days after the alleged rape, Mr Jackson insisted: ""I didn't rape her."" He claimed the alleged victim had been flirting with him and followed him up to his bedroom on two occasions. He told police: ""I strenuously deny these allegations. ""I am shocked and horrified that these allegations have been made against me."" Mr Jackson and fellow rugby player Stuart Olding deny raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house, in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Mr Jackson said the woman had taken part in consensual sexual activity with him and Stuart Olding This was the first time the trial had heard a full account of Paddy Jackson's version of events. Transcripts of Mr Jackson's police interviews were read out in court. He was interviewed four times on Thursday 30 June, two days after the alleged rape. The woman, who was 19 at the time, had gone back to Mr Jackson's house with a group of others after an evening at Ollie's nightclub in Belfast. Mr Jackson said he had never met her before and did not know her name. He said four young women had come back to the house  but he said: ""I was not intent on having sex that night."" He said he had been drunk but was not ""falling around the place."" He said one woman ""was being quite forward with me"" and added:  ""I think she was flirting with me and I was pretty sure that something was going to happen between us."" He said the alleged victim followed him upstairs on the night in question and they kissed. After she asked him if he knew her name, and he did not know it, nothing more happened and they both went downstairs. Later, he said ""the same thing happened again"" - he went upstairs and she followed him. He said they started kissing again and she performed oral sex on him. He said that a short time later, his friend Mr Olding came into the bedroom. He said the woman performed oral sex on him too. Rory Harrison and Blane McIlroy deny the charges against him At the same time, Mr Jackson also engaged in sexual activity with the woman, but he insisted it was not intercourse. ""She asked me if I had a condom and I didn't,"" he said. He said the woman ""seemed to be enjoying what was happening"". Asked if he thought the sexual activity might be hurting her, Mr Jackson said: ""If it did, I would've stopped, I definitely would've stopped."" Mr Jackson said they had all taken part in sexual activity, but it was consensual and no intercourse took place. He told police: ""If she didn't want to be there, I would never have stopped her or tried to keep her there. No way."" Asked how the woman had seemed during the sexual activity with him and Mr Olding, he said: ""Fine. I didn't force myself on her."" He added: ""She didn't have to stay, she could have left if she wanted to, but she didn't."" In his final police interview on 30 June, the allegations made against him were put to him in detail. Asked about the first time they went upstairs and started kissing, it was put to him that he had tried to undo the woman's trousers. He said he did not remember doing so. The alleged victim claims she was raped the second time she went upstairs. She said she went to retrieve a handbag she had left in the bedroom and Mr Jackson followed her upstairs. When this was put to him, Mr Jackson said: ""No. No. I went upstairs first and she followed me."" At one point during the police interview, one of the officers said to Mr Jackson: ""I can see you're upset."" The alleged victim claims that Blane McIlroy came into the room naked at one stage. Mr Jackson said: ""I don't remember that."" The court was told that three months later, on 4 October, Mr Jackson was interviewed again. He replied ""no comment"" to all of the questions he was asked. Later, the court heard a tape recording of a police interview Stuart Olding gave after being arrested on the same day as Paddy Jackson. He said that on the night in question his alcohol consumption included four pints of Guinness, two gin and tonics, five vodkas and three shots. He said he didn't know what was going on in Paddy Jackson's bedroom before he went in. He told the police: ""I was about to leave and then I ended up staying."" He added: ""She held her hand out."" Mr Olding denies forcing the woman to perform oral sex on him. Two other men have also been charged in connection with the case. Mr Jackson, 26, from Belfast's Oakleigh Park, is charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault. He denies the charges. Mr Olding, 24, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. He too denies the charge. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure. He denies the charge. Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast, is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charge. The 12-person jury has been told by Judge Patricia Smyth to wait until they hear all of the evidence in the case before coming to any final conclusions.

"Justin Forsyth resigned from Unicef on Thursday A complaint made about ex-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth before he left the charity was a formal one, the BBC has learned, but his next employer Unicef was not informed. Mr Forsyth resigned from Unicef on Thursday after the BBC reported he had faced three complaints about his behaviour by Save the Children staff. Save the Children insist the complaints were informal and therefore private. Mr Forsyth has said he ""apologised unreservedly"" to the women at the time. His lawyers have said Mr Forsyth was never aware of any formal complaint against him. The BBC's Manveen Rana said the latest revelation raised further questions about why Unicef had not been told about the complaints when it hired Mr Forsyth. An investigation by BBC Radio 4's PM programme, found the complaints related to women receiving  inappropriate texts, and comments on how they looked, what they were wearing and how he felt about them. If they did not respond, Mr Forsyth would follow up his messages with an email, asking if they had seen the text, and then asking for a ""quick word"", the BBC investigation found. Ex-Save the Children boss apologises over texts Charity boss resigns from Unicef A woman who complained at the time said it did not seem the complaints were being treated with the ""appropriate degree of seriousness"". Save the Children has confirmed that concerns had been raised about ""inappropriate behaviour and comments"" by Mr Forsyth. It has maintained the complaints were informal and were therefore dealt with through confidential mediation. The BBC has seen evidence that one of the original complaints was later also raised as a formal complaint, but that it was withdrawn when the complainant was told of Mr Forsyth's resignation from Save the Children. Responding to this, the charity said: ""One of the complainants raised a grievance against Save the Children UK in August 2015 over its handling of the case."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Speaking earlier this week, a spokesman for Unicef confirmed that the charity had not been aware of any of the complaints against Mr Forsyth at the time of his recruitment in 2016. ""There have been no such complaints concerning Mr Forsyth at Unicef,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Sheriff Scott Israel: ""Peterson never went in"" An armed officer assigned to the Florida school where a gunman killed 17 people last week stood outside the building during the shooting and did not intervene, the local sheriff says. Deputy Scot Peterson has resigned after being suspended, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said. Earlier this week President Trump said arming school teachers could prevent school shootings. The proposal has long been championed by the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. On Thursday, in the NRA's first comments since the massacre, its head accused Democrats and media of ""exploiting"" the attack. Wayne LaPierre said ""opportunists"" were using the tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' Sheriff Israel said Mr Peterson, 54, was the school resource officer of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and was at the site, armed and in uniform, when the shooting took place. Students were evacuated in small groups after the 14 February shooting He said video footage showed Mr Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said. Asked what Mr Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said: ""Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer."" Mr Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. Sheriff Israel said Mr Peterson had not given a reason for why he did not go into the building where the shooter was. It is unclear if he will face charges. Sheriff Israel said he would not be releasing the video showing Mr Peterson and might never do so, ""depending on the prosecution and criminal case"" against the 19-year-old suspect accused of carrying out the shooting, former student Nikolas Cruz. The gunman used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being seen and arrested later. This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. Employed by the local police or sheriff's office, they document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education. There are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the US, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper,externalsaid he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (Â£54,137). Concerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about Nikolas Cruz were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. It has also been reported that calls were made to local authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about Nikolas Cruz, including one saying he was planning to attack the school. Teachers will be allowed back in on Friday. Both students and teachers are invited to a reorientation on Sunday, ahead of classes resuming on Wednesday. The three-storey building that was attacked is to be torn down. In recent days both President Trump and the NRA have spoken about this. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington on Thursday, Mr LaPierre reiterated that his group backed it. Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? He said the NRA would help any US school with their safety and security, free of charge, adding that ""opportunists"" pushing for more gun control ""hate the NRA. They hate the second amendment. They hate individual freedom"". This video can not be played Florida shooting: Why the NRA wields so much power The second amendment in the US constitution protects the ""right to keep and bear arms"". America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump floated the idea of arming teachers at a White House event on Wednesday where he heard from survivors of the Florida school shooting, Discussing school safety with state and local officials on Thursday, he explained why he believed that it would work, saying: ""Shooters won't walk into a school if 20% of people have guns."" This video can not be played Teacher at Florida school where 17 people died says arming some teachers would be wrong Mr Trump added: ""What I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus."" But Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union, disagreed that arming teachers was a suitable solution. ""Anyone who wants guns in schools has no understanding of what goes on inside them - or worse, doesn't care,"" she said. Survivors of last week's deadly shooting have called for stricter gun laws, prompting the nationwide activist movement #NeverAgain. Those survivors are organising a rally against mass shootings in Washington planned for 24 March and are expecting up to 500,000 people,according to the Washington Post,external. Sister rallies for ""March for Our Lives"" are also being planned in cities across the country. This video can not be played Victim's father tells Trump of rage Mr Trump has said he supports raising the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18 to 21 and insists the NRA would back such a proposal. In Florida aftermath, US students say 'Never Again' After Florida, some owners give up guns Six radical ways to stop US school shootings ""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" Mr Trump also took to Twitter on Thursday to push for national background checks for the mentally ill, a policy which the NRA chief later echoed at the conference. ""Anyone adjudicated as mentally incompetent or dangerous to society should be prevented from getting a gun,"" said Mr Trump. The US president has also directed his administration to take steps to ban gun ""bump stocks"". The accessories - which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute - were used by a gunman who killed 58 concert-goers in Las Vegas last October.

"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The UN Security Council is struggling to agree a resolution seeking a ceasefire in Syria and has put back a vote until Saturday. The vote has already been delayed several times since Thursday. Russia wanted changes to a draft that calls for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. Western diplomats have accused Russia, Syria's key ally, of stalling for time. France said failure to act may spell the end of the UN itself. Minds have been focused amid outrage at the plight of civilians in the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave. Activists say 462 people have now been killed there this week. Warplanes maintained the bombardment on Friday, witnesses said. Douma and Hamouriyeh were among areas hit. Western powers suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the rebel-held enclave on the edge of Damascus. The United States, the UK and France had called for the resolution to be approved without delay. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said a truce had to be followed by immediate, unhindered access to the Eastern Ghouta. Commenting on Friday evening, US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. ""What those three countries have done to people over the last, short period of time is a disgrace,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Washington. The draft, put forward by Kuwait and Sweden, calls for a nationwide truce to go into effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. Medical evacuations and aid deliveries would start 48 hours after that. The draft says 5.6 million people in 1,244 communities across the country are in acute need. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Sweden's UN ambassador Olof Skoog told the BBC that getting aid to the Eastern Ghouta, where conditions were described by the UN secretary general as ""hell on earth"", was the main objective. ""I think that without the pressure coming from a united Security Council things are not happening the way they should on the ground,"" he said. ""So I think for the council it's a little bit less about the details and more about giving a political pressure to ensure that this happens."" Already overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties France's UN ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre said the UN's inability to help Syrian civilians would result in a devastating loss of credibility. ""The Syrian tragedy must not also become a graveyard for the United Nations,"" he added. The draft resolution also calls for all parties to avoid establishing military positions in civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. Sieges of populated areas should be lifted. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to back the resolution. Under the terms of the draft resolution, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This could include the two biggest rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. Faylaq al-Rahman has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front. Mr Lavrov told reporters his country would be prepared to vote for the ceasefire under certain conditions. ""There are no guarantees that [the rebels] will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,"" he told a briefing. He said Russia had proposed ""a formula which would make the ceasefire real"". The Su-57, Russia's most advanced fighter plane, has been sent to Syria Meanwhile, two of Russia's most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, have been sent to its coastal Hmeimim airbase, Russian military sources told BBC Russian. The sources said the stealth fighter planes were still undergoing flight tests and there was no confirmation they had yet been used in combat. For the sixth day running, Syrian government forces have pounded the Eastern Ghouta. A witness in Douma speaking to Reuters news agency early on Friday said the bombing there was the most intense so far. Syrian state TV says rebels have shelled Damascus, killing one and injuring dozens more. The US has also accused Russia of attacking Ghouta,external, allegations that Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as ""groundless"". The number killed since Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta has risen to 462, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says, at least 99 of them children. Barrel bombs and shell fire have rained down on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Rescue workers said the town of Douma came under sustained attack on Thursday The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and insisted it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that dominate the enclave.

"This video can not be played Labour MP: What happened to Rebecca could happen to anyone Plans to change the rules on organ donation consent in England, which it is claimed could save up to 500 lives a year, have been backed by MPs. A bill requiring people to ""opt out"" if they do not want their organs used passed its first parliamentary hurdle. Labour's Julie Elliott, whose daughter is receiving dialysis for a serious kidney disease, said it would give hope to thousands of transplant patients. The MP said her experience had made her realise how ""special"" donors were. Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson's private members' bill, which would bring England into line with Wales which already has an opt-out system for consent, passed its second reading on Friday. The government has said it ""wholeheartedly"" supported the bill, which it said would be referred to the changes as Max's Law, after nine-year-old Max Johnson, who benefited from a heart transplant.

There are 25 million people on the organ donation register but 6,500 patients are waiting for a transplant. At the moment in England, organs can only be used if explicit approval is given, either by signing the register or if the deceased had told a family member of their desire to donate. Reality Check: Does organ donation without consent save lives? The UK government is consulting on introducing an opt-out system while Scotland is currently looking at bringing forward similar legislation. Mr Robinson told MPs that while levels of organ donation were considerably higher than a decade ago, the UK had some of the lowest rates of consent in Western Europe and a ""certain inertia"" had set in. According to NHS figures, he said about 500 people were dying every year due to a lack of suitable donors. Geoffrey Robinson said he had been ""guilty"" for some time of thinking of registering but not doing so ""This is not good enough. I believe we can do better and be pioneers in making transplants more effective."" While changing the law would ""not make an immediate difference"", he said if the bill was passed by the end of the year it would increase the availability of organs over time and help give more people ""a new lease of life"". He also said he hoped it would make it easier for families to openly discuss the issue. 'Follow Wales' lead on organ donation' Plan for Scots opt-out organ donations ""None of us likes to think about the worst happening,"" he said. ""It is challenging to have conversations with loved ones about their wishes after death. ""We know that it is at that moment when families are confronted with the awful situation that very often they back off, sometimes over-riding the wishes of the deceased who happens to be a registered donor."" Ms Elliott, the MP for Sunderland Central, said her family's life had been transformed by her previously healthy 36-year old daughter Rebecca's diagnosis with a serious kidney complaint in late 2016. ""What happened to us over the last 18 months could happen to anyone, rich or poor... and highlights the reality of the need to change the law to a position of deemed consent,"" she said. ""From hopefully one day the family member of a recipient, I want to say (to donors) thank you very much from the bottom of my heart - you are very special people."" ""Let us make the change in the law to save more lives of the thousands waiting for transplants."" Under the bill's ""soft opt-out"" proposals, the wishes of families and next of kin would continue to be respected, so removal of organs would not go ahead without their support. There would be exemptions for under-18s and adults not able to make informed decisions. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made a brief appearance in the Commons to urge MPs to support the ""wonderful"" measure which he said would ""save an awful lot of people's lives"". In Wales, where an opt-out system was introduced in December 2015, there has actually been a small dip in the number of deceased donors, from 64 in 2015-16 to 61 in 2016-17. This resulted in a drop in organ transplants from 214 to 187 respectively. Former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said it would be wrong to describe the experience in Wales as a failure. But the Conservative MP said families should have a ""certain latitude"" to change their mind at what was obviously a very sensitive time following the death of a loved-one.

"Reality TV star Kylie Jenner wiped $1.3bn (Â£1bn) off Snap's stock market value after tweeting that she no longer used its Snapchat messaging app. Celebrity Kim Kardashian's half-sister posted: ""sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad."" Snap's shares sank after Ms Jenner's tweet about Snapchat's re-design to her 24.5 million Twitter followers. One million people signed a petitiondemanding Snap roll back the change. After dropping almost 8%, shares in Snap closed 6% down on Wall Street, and are now back near the $17 price at which the shares were listed when the company floated on the stock market in March of last year. Snapchat is facing intense competition from Facebook's Instagram - especially for celebrity users - and Ms Jenner's attack comes at a time when investors are already worried. Even before Ms Jenner's Tweet, shares had been sliding. This week, analysts at Citi also downgraded the stock, pointing to the negative reaction to the redesign. Ms Jenner later tweeted a follow-up: ""still love you tho snap... my first love"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Snap has rejected complaints about November's re-design to its messaging app, with its boss Evan Spiegel saying earlier this month that users just needed time to get used to it. Mr Spiegel had something to soften the blow, though, with news on Thursday that his total pay last year was a staggering $637.8m. It is thought to be the third-highest annual package ever received by a company's chief executive. The market just doesn't know what to think of Snap or its Snapchat service. It is either the future of communication - or a social media fad that will last not much longer than one of the messages its army of young users sends. And that makes a share price which has mostly been built on a very optimistic view of future growth extremely volatile. Earlier this month it soared by nearly 50% on results that were marginally better than expected - now they've taken a minor tumble because a reality star says the new design is ""so sad"". Investors will continue to need strong stomachs - especially when they see how much founder Evan Spiegel is taking home. Kylie Jenner is not the first celebrity to move markets. In October 2015, TV host Oprah Winfrey bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers, endorsing the firm publically at the same time. Investors saw their shares rise by 92% over successive weeks. Michelle Obama was responsible for the ""Michelle mark-up"" When the former First Lady, Michelle Obama, turned up to an event wearing Versace or another designer brand, Wall Street noted the immediate effect on share prices. They dubbed it the ""Michelle mark-up"". Snapchat's shares have been particularly volatile since the company went public last year, with investor profits sometimes evaporating as fast as pictures and messages disappear from the site. The shares plunged by 17% in August, after disappointing results. But in the first weeks of this month shares bounced back by almost 50% after Snapchat reported a 72% rise in sales in the last quarter of 2017, with no fewer than 187 million people using the site every day. ""Part of the problem is Snap isn't profitable at the moment, so there's a fair amount of hope for the future already baked into the share price, making it particularly vulnerable to swings in sentiment,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Snap's future rests on building user numbers, so anything which could undermine that journey is naturally going to unsettle investors.""

"Electric-powered Mini cars are to be built in China, as well as in Oxford where most Minis are currently made. BMW, the owner of the Mini brand, said it had agreed an outline deal with Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motor. Cars made under that partnership will be for the Chinese market. The deal will not affect BMW's plan,announced last year, to assemble the first electric Minis in Oxford from 2019. Those cars will use electric motors made in Germany. BMW and Great Wall Motor still have to work out the exact location of their production line and how much they will invest. The Chinese governments has set a target that by 20% of cars sold should be electric or rechargeable-hybrid vehicles by 2025. That is spurring all car makers to raise their investment in China. BMW already has a joint venture with Brilliance Auto to build BMW-branded cars in China. As well as two plants assembling cars, the joint venture has an engine plant which includes a battery factory. BMW is an ambitious company. It wants to expand, and it wants a bigger share of the fast-growing market for electric vehicles. China scores highly on both counts - it has a huge number of consumers, and government policies there heavily favour electric cars. BMW thinks that in order to take full advantage, it needs a local production base. So where does this leave Mini's UK factories? Initially at least, the Chinese factory will produce vehicles for the Chinese market. The cars made there there will be a different model from the electric Mini due to be built in Oxford from 2019, and BMW insists the Mini brand can expand internationally without calling into question its commitment to the UK. But the announcement may send another signal to the government - that Mini can survive without the UK, and is more than capable of moving production elsewhere if it finds the business climate after Brexit too uncomfortable.

"BT must make it easier for rival internet providers to use its telegraph poles, telecoms regulator Ofcom says. Ofcom has published alist of new measures,externalto make it cheaper for companies to install ultrafast full fibre broadband infrastructure. Connecting homes directly to the fibre network delivers much faster internet speeds than copper cables. Rivals Talk Talk and Hyperoptic welcomed the announcement. BT said it was ""considering the implications"". Ofcom says full fibre internet is currently available to 3% of UK homes and offices. It hopes to see 6 million buildings connected by 2020. It said BT must make it easier for rivals to install fibre on its telegraph poles and in its underground tunnels. It wants a clearer map of where there is capacity on the telegraph poles and in the tunnels for rivals to do so. Ofcom suggested streets could be connected to full fibre in ""hours"" rather than days, as companies would no longer have to dig up roads to lay fibre. It estimated that sharing infrastructure would halve the cost of connecting a home to full fibre - from Â£500 to Â£250. Additionally, BT will be banned from reducing its wholesale prices in areas where rival networks are starting to lay infrastructure. Openreach, which maintains most of the UK's telephone lines, will be ordered to repair faulty infrastructure and clear the way for competitors to access its tunnels. ""Openreach must ensure there is space on its telegraph poles for extra fibre cables connecting homes to a competitor's network,"" Ofcom said in a statement. BT said it had ""noted"" the publication of Ofcom's proposals. In astatement,external, it said the changes would have an ""adverse financial impact on Openreach's revenue and profit"" in the region of Â£80m to Â£120m. Addressing the restriction on varying its wholesale prices, BT said it was ""considering the implications for full and fair competition"". Openreach said Ofcom's statement gave the company ""certainty on their approach"". But it said it had already been letting rival companies use its telegraph poles and tunnels. ""Our ducts and poles have been open since 2011 and we have been sharing a digital map of this network for more than a year,"" it said in a statement. It added that telecoms firms needed to ""be certain they can secure a return on their investment"" if a nationwide rollout of full fibre was to be realised. Talk Talk said the announcement was ""good for consumers, competition and investment"". Hyperoptic said the move would strengthen the business case for investment in full fibre networks. ""This will ultimately create a better digital future for the UK, not just serve the interests of BT retail,"" said Hyperoptic chief executive Dana Tobak. Consumer magazine Which? said the changes needed to be made more quickly. ""Consumers are crying out for better broadband... steps to ensure more investment in this vital service can't come soon enough,"" said spokeswoman Alex Neill. by Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent Suddenly everyone has gone full fibre. After years of insisting that laying fibre right to the home was too expensive and a copper connection to a kerbside fibre cabinet was absolutely fine, the government has changed its mind. Now the regulator Ofcom has come in behind the new thinking. To make the sums add up, it is forcing BT to open up its network of tunnels and telegraph poles to its rivals. Cynics will point out that this was supposed to have happened years ago - but at last the regulator is tightening the screw. The really bold move would have been to split Openreach off from BT years ago and turn it into a national ""fibre to the home"" utility. But that ship has sailed. Ofcom now believes that overlapping fast fibre networks built by BT and its rivals will deliver more innovation and a better deal for consumers.

" Warning: This piece contains details of torture and sexual violence that some readers may find upsetting. It was a family wedding, a happy occasion that was supposed to lift her spirits. Zubeida was badly in need of that. The 23-year old was an inpatient at a Cairo hospital, being treated for recent traumas. Her younger brother collected her and they headed for the family’s former home, in a crowded, gritty neighbourhood.  Some of her best clothes were still at the old flat. He rushed to the chemist to fill a prescription for Zubeida, leaving her at the entrance. When he returned, minutes later, his sister was gone. That was 14:00 on 8 April 2017. She hasn’t been seen since. The attractive young woman with striking hazel-coloured eyes has joined the ranks of Egypt’s “disappeared”. The events of that day are recounted by her mother, a welcoming woman in a black abaya and patterned headscarf. She wants to be known only as “Um Zubeida” - meaning Mother of Zubeida. We meet at the family’s current home, not far from the Pyramids. The flat is sparsely furnished but spotless. It’s in a high-rise block that offers few comforts but does allow anonymity. The family moved here hoping to give Zubeida a fresh start. Instead they lost her. “I have been trying to find Zubeida for 10 months,” she says, her eyes wet with tears. “Every day I die a hundred times. Our entire family has been destroyed, all six of us - her siblings and me - all destroyed. We wish we were dead.” Um Zubeyda has not seen her daughter for 10 months Um Zubeida is in no doubt about who is responsible for her daughter’s disappearance. “We know it’s the police,” she says. “Neighbours told us that armed and masked men came in a police vehicle and took her away in a minibus. They had been to our old house, inquiring about her, several times.” Zubeida had her brother’s mobile and managed a quick call to a relative, according to her mother. “He could hear the officer insulting her and then the phone was switched off.” For mother and daughter the trouble started years earlier. They were just passing by a protest in 2014, says Um Zubeida, and were arrested - in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were convicted of several offences including attending a banned demonstration. Um Zubeida says they spent seven months in jail but were later acquitted. Her account of what happened during their initial interrogation is chilling, but all too familiar to lawyers and human rights campaigners in Cairo. “For 14 hours, they kept beating us, and insulting us,” she says. “They stripped us, and electrocuted us.  They wanted us to confess to things that we had not done like planning to blow up a hotel, and having weapons.  I heard Zubeida’s voice screaming, ‘help me Mother’. I couldn’t see her but I told her, ‘Don’t be afraid’.” Um Zubeida says she refused to confess - though they threatened to rape her daughter in front of her. I found cuts on her body, and marks of electrocution... They had done to her everything that would anger God” After she and her daughter were released from prison, they tried to rebuild their lives.  Zubeida was studying commerce, and dreaming of opening her own small business. She went out to buy shoes on 15 July 2016 and disappeared - for the first time. “The car she was in was stopped at a police checkpoint,” says Um Zubeida, “And everyone was taken out. She gave my mobile number to a bystander and asked him to call me. By the time I arrived the police had gone.” Zubeida was dumped by the roadside on the outskirts of the city 28 days later. Her mother describes her daughter's return in a halting voice - as if each word is swollen with pain. “Someone found her and called us. She was blindfolded and her hands and legs were tied. When we brought her home, her abaya was torn.  She had no underwear underneath it. I went with her to the bathroom to help her change and to wash. “I found cuts on her body, and marks of electrocution.  I was shocked when she told me that they assaulted her. They had done to her everything that would anger God. Everything.” Zubeida was a changed girl - no longer friendly and sociable. “She didn’t want to see people,” her mother says. “She tried to isolate herself. She wasn’t happy like before.  She started hiding under the bed, screaming. We had to take her to a psychiatric hospital.” It was when she left the hospital, for the wedding, that she lost her freedom for the second time. Her mother now seeks comfort in Zubeida’s bedroom, which is like a shrine. Everything is just as she left it last April,  as if the young woman had been gone for a few hours, not almost a year. Her dresser is lined with treasured keepsakes that might belong to a child - a jewellery box in the shape of a tortoise, cuddly toys and small ceramic cats. Zubeida stares out serenely from a framed photograph. There’s a whisper of lipstick on her mouth and her hair is concealed beneath a stylish leopard-print headscarf. The photo was taken just after she and her mother were released from jail in 2014. “She was so happy because they had let us out,” says Um Zubeida. “Unfortunately, the happiness didn’t last.” Um Zubeida shows me a jotter full of drawings and Arabic script. It was her daughter’s prison journal.  There’s one phrase written at the bottom of a page in English that stands out: “Don’t forget me”. She insists the family has no connection with any banned groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Islamist movement was branded a terrorist organisation in 2013, after one of its leaders won the presidency but held it for just a year. Many families of the disappeared - and there are many - are too frightened to speak out.  Despite the risks, Um Zubeida refuses to be silenced, even though her daughter has disappeared not once but twice. “I wish they would take me, and let her go,” she says. “Take me, arrest me instead. What danger might we pose to those in power? If my daughter is disappeared and they’ve taken her and tortured her, how can I not speak out?  Even if my words lead to my hanging, I will still speak.” Does she thinks Zubeida will come back? “I have hope in God Almighty that she will come home,” she says. The trip was a risk.  Ibrahim Metwaly knew it, and so did his family. On 10 September last year, the 52-year-old lawyer set out for Cairo International airport to board a morning flight to Switzerland. He was due to testify before a United Nations working group on enforced disappearances. For Metwaly it was personal - his eldest son, Amr, had vanished more than four years earlier. Ibrahim Metwaly “My mother told him not to travel,” says Abdel Moneim, his youngest son, “because she could not bear anything else. But he had made up his mind. When a son is in danger, a father will do anything.” During the day Metwaly’s family got a text - from his phone - saying he had left for Geneva, and heaved a sigh of relief. The message did not come from Ibrahim. He had joined the ranks of the disappeared, or as Egyptians say, those “hidden behind the sun”. Ibrahim Metwaly’s disappearance made headlines abroad.  Two days later, amid growing international pressure, he was produced in front of prosecutors.  He was charged with “spreading false news” and “forming an illegal organisation”. That referred to a support group for families of the disappeared which he co-founded. Metwaly gave advice and legal assistance to many desperate families. Zubeida’s mother had turned to him for help as she went from one police station to another, begging for information about her daughter. If Metwaly had made it to Geneva he was planning to raise the case of Giulio Regeni, a murdered Italian doctorate student. Regeni vanished from the streets of Cairo in January 2016.  His mutilated body was found in a ditch on the outskirts of the city. Zubeida was later dumped near the same spot. His corpse bore the hallmarks of torture inflicted by a professional. Metwaly had been investigating his killing. Giulio Regeni, an Italian student tortured and murdered in Cairo “My father wanted to protect the remaining young people whose lives were in danger,” says Abdel Moneim, a law student. “He saw himself as a father to all of them.” It now falls to the 22-year-old to speak for him, though he knows he could be next. “I am worried. If I disappear my future will be lost. But I am not doing anything illegal - just being my father’s voice.” The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms has documented at least 1,500 enforced disappearances in the past four years, but some believe the real figure is much higher. In the words of a leading campaigner, Mohamed Lotfy, “making people disappear is a hallmark of the regime of President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi”. Anyone who opposes the regime, or is suspected of doing so, whether rightly or wrongly, is at risk. Sometimes even relatives and friends of suspects can be arrested. Many of the targets are Islamists - people who believe Islamic principles should shape society and the political system. In Egypt, most don’t call for the use of violence to achieve their aims. Campaigners say most of the disappeared are tortured before reappearing in custody weeks or months later, facing terrorism charges. Amr Metwaly has neither been charged nor freed. Abdel Moneim shows me photos of his brother - a smiling young man, enjoying a boat ride on the Nile. When he vanished, he was studying engineering. “Sometimes I can’t breathe when I think I won’t see him again,” says Abdel Moneim. Amr disappeared at a turbulent time. It was 8 July 2013. Egypt’s President Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist, had been ousted by the army just days before. Supporters - including Amr - gathered outside a military base where they thought he was being held. More than 50 protesters were killed, according to Egyptian state media. The army claimed they tried to break into the building. Police and protesters stand off, July 2013 “Clashes broke out,” says Abdel Moneim. “Some people died and some were forcibly disappeared. Amr was among them. He was kidnapped by army and police forces. There were eyewitnesses. A university friend with him was later released, but not Amr.” His brother’s support for the deposed president was a personal position, not a family one, he says. “As a normal family, each family member has a personal point of view in this regard.” The years since his disappearance have been full of searching, and of torment. “My mother is always telling the authorities that if they won’t bring my brother back, they’d better kill him and bring us his body,” says Abdel Moneim. “She is extremely sad because she can neither see him nor know where he is. At least with a dead person, you can visit their grave.” He knows where his father is, though the knowledge brings little comfort.  The human rights lawyer is now a prisoner in Cairo’s notorious Tora prison complex. “He is being held in solitary confinement, in a dark cell,” says Abdel Moneim. “He is getting a very small amount of food - not enough for a 10-year-old child. He found a rat in his cell and had to kill it.  We have only been allowed to visit him once, for three minutes. He is in poor health and the way he is being treated is putting his life in danger.” He says the prison routine involves not just hardship and hunger, but also torture. “My father was electrocuted,” says Abdel Moneim. “He was stripped and he was beaten. He documented the violations when he appeared before the prosecutor.” Lawyers, human rights campaigners and former prisoners in Egypt say this kind of brutality is now routine. As one lawyer put it: “Torture is a must.” Mahmud Mohamed Hussein has first-hand knowledge of current torture techniques.  He’s a slight 22-year-old in a hooded top and skinny jeans. Every step he takes is a reminder of the abuse he suffered. One of his legs is badly bowed. Mahmud was arrested in 2014 - on the third anniversary of the revolution.  He was just 18 and had gone out to celebrate. He says he was detained, and persecuted, only because of the slogan on his T-shirt. It read: “A nation without torture.” Mahmoud after his arrest in 2014 “They deliberately beat my bad leg - which was already injured,” he says. “They hurt me so badly that I could only walk with a stick until a few months ago. And since then I’ve had several operations.” But the beatings were just the beginning. “I was electrocuted in sensitive parts of my body,” he says, gesturing towards his groin. “I was in terrible pain. What happened can never be erased from my memory. I suffer very badly from nightmares.” Mahmud was held for more than two years without trial. He is speaking out in spite of the risks for the sake of many other victims, including some of his relatives and friends. “There are many people suffering what I have been through,” he says. “I saw many people in prison who asked me to convey messages about what they faced. I can only stop talking about torture when it comes to an end.” Mahmud: “I can only stop talking about torture when it comes to an end” Mahmud is not the only torture victim to share his story with me. Another young man  - who asked us not to reveal his identity - described being subjected to every kind of abuse. He provided a detailed and credible account identifying the police station where he was interrogated.  He said he was blindfolded, stripped, beaten, kicked and given electric shocks.  Then - in his words - he found out there was something worse than electrocution. He was raped - with a stick. Alaa Abdel Fattah at his 2015 trial For Manal Hussein and her six-year-old son Khaled, quality time comes once every 15 days - with a visit to a prison complex.  That’s where they are reunited with Alaa Abdel Fattah - the husband and father who is the missing piece of this fractured family. The 36-year-old is one of Egypt’s leading dissidents - charismatic, secular, a blogger and software developer. In the heady days of 2011 he was an icon of the revolution. In the Egypt of today that makes him an enemy of the state. Other leaders of the uprising have also been jailed, or driven into exile - erased from view, like the revolution itself. Alaa Abdel Fattah pictured in 2011 Mother and son set off in bright sunshine. Manal is smartly dressed in a black jacket, trousers and boots.  Her patterned sweater has an owl on the front. She brings food parcels, fresh laundry and cigarettes. Her husband doesn’t smoke, but tobacco is the currency in prison.  Khaled darts along beside her - a blur in a bright blue sweatshirt. I join them for the journey through the choking Cairo traffic. There is a driver behind the wheel so Manal can sit in the back and focus on her son. He bounces in and out of her arms, smiling but silent. The little boy does not speak yet. “That’s one of the problems of Alaa being in prison,” Manal says. “I don't know if Khaled has any memory of his father out of prison.  Alaa has spent almost four years in jail. That’s more than half his age.” Alaa Abed Fattah, quoted in 2014 Her husband was accused of organising a protest against the use of military courts for civilians’ trials. That was in November 2013, just after demonstrations had effectively been banned. Others came forward to say they had planned the protest - including Alaa’s own sister, Mona Seif.  He was convicted anyway. For Manal the uprising of seven years ago is now firmly in the rearview mirror. “There were a lot of possibilities,” she says. “A lot of plans and dreams, and things to do. Now it’s just, ‘Let’s live the day today, and try to survive that’.” When we arrive at Tora prison, Manal and Khaled join a queue of families waiting beneath the watchtowers for a chance to see their loved ones. The gates of Cairo's Tora prison Afterwards she says the visit was rushed, as usual. “It's very cruel for Khaled because he gets very little time with his father and doesn’t have all his attention. We have to do everything in just 60 minutes.” Resistance runs in her husband’s family.  Alaa’s father was the renowned human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif Al Islam. When he was on his deathbed in 2014 both Alaa and his sister Sana’a were behind bars. They were allowed out only to bury him. Their mother, Laila Soueif, has been an activist for decades. The extended family gather for lunch at her book-filled Cairo flat. Laila - a mathematics professor with a shock of grey hair - is busy in the kitchen.  She’s chopping salad and frying thin slices of basterma - the spiced beef beloved of many Egyptians. Several generations gather in the dining room, their voices overlapping in a tapestry of laughter and shared history. But the empty space at the table is keenly felt. “We are sad. We are sorry. We are unhappy,” says Alaa’s aunt, Ahdaf Souief. “But I think that the anger is really paramount.” She is quick to stress they are better off than other families whose sons and daughters have been given life sentences, have vanished, or have been killed. Ahdaf is animated and articulate, with shoulder-length dark hair, and black-rimmed glasses.   She chooses her words with care, like the novelist she is. Her eyes brim with tears when she speaks of her nephew. “This is somebody who could have been amazing, and not just for this country. This is somebody with a really valuable mind and set of skills,” she says. “And it's because of that that he's been put away and deactivated. They wanted him out of the picture.” A whole generation has been crushed, according to Alaa’s sister Mona. The 31-year-old is cut from the same cloth as her brother - the same curly hair, the same commitment to change. So many of her friends are in prison she struggles to keep count. She says that under President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt is bleeding. “I've never seen a regime as bloody as Sisi’s regime,” she says. “I have never seen a regime that belittles the value of life like Sisi’s regime.” Mona Seif: “I have never seen a regime that belittles the value of life like Sisi’s regime” Disappearances, death sentences, and torture have become daily news, she says. “Even people who are silent or are trying to stay away from engaging with the political scene are still being thrown in jail or getting randomly detained.” She says Egyptians are feeling “numb, exhausted and scared” and there's no fight left on the streets. “It's very understandable to be scared with a regime that is not hesitant about using killing.” After her brother finishes his five-year sentence next March, he will be on probation for a further five years.  That may amount to another form of imprisonment. He could be required to sleep at his local police station every night. That has been the fate of other activists. Alaa was temporarily released in 2014 to attend his father's funeral Before Alaa Abdel Fattah was convicted, I met him at his mother’s apartment.  It was 2014 and he was out on bail.  He and Laila chatted and laughed over tea, the conversation ranging from mathematical theories to political strategies. The young revolutionary was clear-eyed about how much worse things were since the revolution. “When you were confronting Mubarak hope was a material thing,” he said. “You could almost touch it. And so it was very easy to feel that it was worth it.  And so people were taking these risks without any kind of despair. Right now it’s very bleak.” His late father had spoken - with regret - of bequeathing him a jail cell.  I asked Alaa what he thought he would leave his son, Khaled. “Almost certainly a prison cell,” he replied. “And I cannot guarantee in any way that he would not be killed by the police, or tortured by the police or broken by the police. I have no hope of offering my son anything unless we change this country.” Tahrir Square, Cairo Now it’s a place to take selfies.  It’s on the tourist trail for foreign visitors - the Pyramids, the Egypt Museum in downtown Cairo and, just a few minutes walk away, Tahrir (or Liberation) Square. Egyptians also come to the centre of the square - from shy young couples to boisterous teenagers. They stand in front of a large monument, topped by the Egyptian flag, or sit for a moment on the steps. They are lured here by memory, not by banners or billboards. The monument is bare.  There is no mention of the more than 800 people killed in the struggle for freedom in Egypt -  no names, no photographs, no tributes. Tahrir Square, May 2011 Tahrir Square, 2018 Tahrir Square, 2011 Tahrir Square, 2018 In fact there is nothing to indicate that Tahrir was the cradle - and crucible - of a revolution. The busy plaza has long since been reclaimed by the twin constants of Egyptian life - the traffic and the police (those in uniforms, and their ubiquitous colleagues in plain clothes). If Tahrir sends any message today the regime would like it to be: “Nothing to see here.” Yet this was where Egyptians converged in January 2011, as calls for change built to a crescendo in the Middle East. It was the early days of the so-called Arab Spring. Given what came later, “Spring” seems a tragic misnomer. General Sisi, later promoted to field marshal, went on to be elected president in 2014. It was a landslide victory marred by a low turnout. Critics accuse Egypt’s latest military strongman of an unprecedented assault on human rights. During my four years as the BBC’s Egypt correspondent I’ve witnessed the security forces turn their guns on peaceful demonstrators. It was the anniversary of the revolution in 2014. We had just arrived at a peaceful protest when heavily armed police pulled up, wearing balaclavas. Without warning they opened fire in the direction of the crowd. I’ve seen unarmed liberal protesters jailed for years.  I’ve covered mass trials for Islamists, where death sentences were recommended for almost 700 men -after a hearing that was over in hours. My BBC colleagues and I have been harassed on the streets by the security forces. A police officer once threatened to shoot us if we did not stop filming. On another occasion we were detained for filming an interview with a woman whose husband was killed at Rabaa mosque. After a few hours at a police station we were released  unharmed, with our interviewee. It was a very small taste from the menu of repression here. Press freedom is under attack. Egypt is in the top three worldwide for jailing journalists. Anyone who challenges the official line can be detained for “spreading false news”. Hundreds of websites have been banned - including independent news sites. It’s not the new Egypt many yearned for when they filled Tahrir Square. We wanted to get the government’s response to allegations of widespread human rights abuses, and to the accounts we have gathered of disappearances and torture by the security forces. We approached the Interior Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and the State Information Service. No-one was prepared to be interviewed. In the past officials have denied there are enforced disappearances and widespread human rights abuses. They have told me there is no systematic torture but if “mistakes” are made, officers are punished. President Sisi seems to regard geography as an excuse. “When it comes to human rights… we are not in Europe. We are in a different region,” he said last October. He also claimed information from rights groups could not be trusted. Take a stroll through the streets here, past the bread ovens and tea carts and cafes with water pipes and you’ll hear noisy complaints. There are gripes about broken pavements and soaring inflation - about 17% in January - but you won’t find a clamour for democratic reform. Many are more concerned about high prices than repression.  Plenty of Egyptians are grateful for relative stability under their hardline leader, especially amid bomb attacks by the local branch of the Islamic State group, based in the Sinai Peninsula. President Sisi still has a bedrock of support, but some who voted for him last time are rueing their choice, posting on Facebook: “I am sorry I elected a dictator.” As for the international community many are turning a blind eye to the president’s human rights record because he is seen as a valued partner in the fight against extremism. Before General Sisi was elected president I asked one liberal activist for his prediction. “He will be our Pinochet,” he said, referring to the Chilean general-turned-dictator. “And he will build a lot more jails.” Human rights campaigners say that - at the last count - 17 new prisons have been built in the Sisi era. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, an Egypt-based group, estimates as many as 60,000 people have become political prisoners. Humour flows through Egypt like the Nile.  It’s woven into the DNA of a great nation that has both suffered and endured. The forthcoming presidential poll is providing fresh material. “Have you heard the latest?” asked a friend.  “The presidential election has now dropped out of the presidential election.” The ballot, on 26-28 March, has been dubbed a contest between Sisi and his shadow. Serious opponents have been disqualified, detained or have dropped out of the race.  When the former army chief of staff Lt Gen Sami Anan declared his candidacy he was promptly arrested.  He has been accused of running for office without the permission of the military. One of Anan’s key backers  - Egypt’s former anti-corruption chief Hisham Genena - was attacked and badly wounded outside his home. His family said it was an attempt on his life.  He, too, was later arrested. President Sisi will have one “challenger” at the polls – an obscure centrist politician called Mousa Mostafa Mousa. He denies mounting a sham campaign at the behest of the regime, though he’s known to be a Sisi supporter. While the president’s victory is guaranteed, critics say his legitimacy will be seriously undermined. Fourteen human rights groups, both international and domestic, have denounced the election as “farcical”. Opposition leaders in Egypt have called for a boycott. The president seems deaf to his critics - increasingly so.  He is adamant that he will not go the way of Hosni Mubarak. “Be warned,” he said recently. “What happened seven or eight years ago will not happen again.” His nation is grappling with an unstable neighbour (Libya) and a stubborn enemy (IS militants based in northern Sinai). The Egyptian leader presents himself as a bulwark against instability. He says he’s waging war on terror. Human rights groups say he’s using that as a pretext to wage war on dissent. Instead of a vibrant new democracy in the heart of the Arab world there is a return to the default setting - fear. In recent years the authorities in Cairo had paid lip service to the need to break with the past and respect individual rights. Now it feels like the mask isn’t just slipping, but being cast aside. That’s a risky strategy. “They think that through repression and draconian laws they can get what they want – namely staying in power,” says the seasoned human rights campaigner Mohammed Lotfy.  “But what this does is to radicalise people  even more against the regime.” Before leaving Egypt in late January, I went to the outskirts of Cairo to take a final trip across the Nile. Along the way I passed a shepherd tending his flock, framed by lofty palm trees.  His little boy wore a traditional long gown - a galabeya - and stood cradling a lamb, not a smartphone. It was like a scene from centuries ago. In many ways this country of 100 million, with its teeming young population - so full of potential - seems locked in the past. I boarded the ferry along with a gaggle of passengers in cars, on motorbikes, and on donkey carts.  There was surprise at the presence of a foreign visitor - a rarer sight these days. There were shouts of “Welcome”. A vegetable seller pressed sweet cherry tomatoes into my hand.   The ferry captain asked if I wanted to take photos from his vantage point high above the deck. This was a slice of the Egypt I will miss - warm-hearted, chaotic, and rich in spirit. I have come away, after four years, with plenty of questions. What lies ahead if Egypt can’t steer a course towards real democracy? How many prisons is the regime going to fill? And just how long will it be before all the repression backfires?

"BT must make it easier for rival internet providers to use its telegraph poles, telecoms regulator Ofcom says. Ofcom has published alist of new measures,externalto make it cheaper for companies to install ultrafast full fibre broadband infrastructure. Connecting homes directly to the fibre network delivers much faster internet speeds than copper cables. Rivals Talk Talk and Hyperoptic welcomed the announcement. BT said it was ""considering the implications"". Ofcom says full fibre internet is currently available to 3% of UK homes and offices. It hopes to see 6 million buildings connected by 2020. It said BT must make it easier for rivals to install fibre on its telegraph poles and in its underground tunnels. It wants a clearer map of where there is capacity on the telegraph poles and in the tunnels for rivals to do so. Ofcom suggested streets could be connected to full fibre in ""hours"" rather than days, as companies would no longer have to dig up roads to lay fibre. It estimated that sharing infrastructure would halve the cost of connecting a home to full fibre - from Â£500 to Â£250. Additionally, BT will be banned from reducing its wholesale prices in areas where rival networks are starting to lay infrastructure. Openreach, which maintains most of the UK's telephone lines, will be ordered to repair faulty infrastructure and clear the way for competitors to access its tunnels. ""Openreach must ensure there is space on its telegraph poles for extra fibre cables connecting homes to a competitor's network,"" Ofcom said in a statement. BT said it had ""noted"" the publication of Ofcom's proposals. In astatement,external, it said the changes would have an ""adverse financial impact on Openreach's revenue and profit"" in the region of Â£80m to Â£120m. Addressing the restriction on varying its wholesale prices, BT said it was ""considering the implications for full and fair competition"". Openreach said Ofcom's statement gave the company ""certainty on their approach"". But it said it had already been letting rival companies use its telegraph poles and tunnels. ""Our ducts and poles have been open since 2011 and we have been sharing a digital map of this network for more than a year,"" it said in a statement. It added that telecoms firms needed to ""be certain they can secure a return on their investment"" if a nationwide rollout of full fibre was to be realised. Talk Talk said the announcement was ""good for consumers, competition and investment"". Hyperoptic said the move would strengthen the business case for investment in full fibre networks. ""This will ultimately create a better digital future for the UK, not just serve the interests of BT retail,"" said Hyperoptic chief executive Dana Tobak. Consumer magazine Which? said the changes needed to be made more quickly. ""Consumers are crying out for better broadband... steps to ensure more investment in this vital service can't come soon enough,"" said spokeswoman Alex Neill. by Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent Suddenly everyone has gone full fibre. After years of insisting that laying fibre right to the home was too expensive and a copper connection to a kerbside fibre cabinet was absolutely fine, the government has changed its mind. Now the regulator Ofcom has come in behind the new thinking. To make the sums add up, it is forcing BT to open up its network of tunnels and telegraph poles to its rivals. Cynics will point out that this was supposed to have happened years ago - but at last the regulator is tightening the screw.

"A fourth British tourist has died following a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon 12 days ago while on his honeymoon. Jonathan Udall, who was in his 30s and from Brighton, had been in hospital in Las Vegas since the accident on 10 February. His family has been told of his death. A spokesperson for his employer Yorkshire Building Society said they were ""deeply shocked"" by the death of a ""well-known and well-loved colleague"". Mr Udall's wife, Ellie Milward, 29, was injured when the aircraft crashed in the remote Quartermaster Canyon and remains in a critical condition. Stuart Hill, 30, and his girlfriend Becky Dobson, 27, and brother Jason, 32, from Worthing, West Sussex, died. Another Briton, Jennifer Barham, 39, and the pilot Scott Booth, 42, were also injured. A message posted on Thursday on a crowdfunding page set up to help Mr Udall and Ms Milward, reads: ""It is with a very heavy heart that I must type this. ""Our good friend Jon Udall has succumb to his injuries. He was strong, brave and I will never forget him. Ellie is critical and is continuing to fight."" Both Mr Udall and Ms Milward were friends with the other Britons in the helicopter. Ms Milward also worked at Yorkshire Building Society and the company's chief executive Mike Regnier said support was being offered to employees. ""We're all deeply shocked and saddened by [Mr Udall's] death,"" said Mr Regnier. ""We are in touch with his and Ellie's families and send them our deepest condolences. We hope to hear positive news about Ellie soon. ""We are offering colleagues, who are obviously shaken by this news, support at this upsetting time."" Stuart (left) and Jason Hill also died in the crash The Eurocopter (now Airbus) EC130 helicopter had spun out of control as it came in to land before crashing and catching fire. The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board but an initial report indicates possible causes could include a mechanical problem and gusty winds. The chief of the Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, had described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He said the rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph (80 km/h). Jason and Stuart Hill and Ms Dobson, who had been in the US for Stuart's 30th birthday, died at the scene. Becky Dobson was on holiday to celebrate her boyfriend's 30th birthday Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths in its Milton Keynes office. Stuart Hill was a salesman at a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Brighton, East Sussex, while his girlfriend Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing. The helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year. The Grand Canyon, which is more than 1.6km (one mile) deep, is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the US.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt discusses deaths caused by drug errors Drug errors in England cause appalling levels of harm and deaths, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says, as data suggests mistakes are being made. GPs, pharmacists, hospitals and care homes may be making 237 million errors a year - the equivalent of one mistake made for every five drugs handed out. The study said most caused no problems, but in more than a quarter of cases the mistakes could have caused harm. Drug errors could be a factor in thousands of deaths a year. The mistakes include: wrong medications being given incorrect doses dispensed delays in medication being administered The researchers - drawn from Manchester, Sheffield and York universities - acknowledge that there is limited data in this area so the figures are very much best estimates based on previous research, some of it going back years. They estimate that drug errors cause 700 deaths a year and could also be a factor in between 1,700 and 22,300 other ones. A fifth of the mistakes related to hospital care, including errors made by doctors administering anaesthetic before surgery. The rest were pretty evenly split between drugs given in the community by GPs and pharmacists, and those handed out in care homes. In total 1.15 billion drug prescriptions are made each year. The drugs for Catherine Young's mother, Irene, were mixed up with another patient's medication One of the people who suffered from a drug error was Catherine Young's mother, Irene. She was living in a care home and was aged 92 when she was given a host of wrong drugs for several weeks after her prescription was mixed up with another patient's. It meant she stopped getting steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica, which causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulder, neck and hips. This caused her to go into withdrawal, while she developed irritation around her eyes because she had started being given eye drops she did not need. Ms Young, from Suffolk, said the mistake had been missed by the GP, pharmacists and care home staff and spotted only when she had questioned the medication after noticing her mother's condition had been deteriorating. ""It was down to me, a layman with no medical training, to sound the alarm. ""Thankfully we were able to act in time, but others have not been so lucky."" The dirtiest place in your kitchen might surprise you Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings Anti-depressants: Major study finds they work Royal College of Nursing chief executive Janet Davies said the study was ""deeply concerning"". She added: ""There is real problems in preserving patient safety when you haven't got enough staff and when we've got the financial pressures we have."" She said human error is ""one of the biggest risks"" and that overstretched nursing staff and agency workers put ""added risk in"" the system, but certainly did not make errors inevitable. Mr Hunt said he was concerned by the findings - although he pointed out that the research showed this was a global problem and not one unique to the NHS. ""It is a far bigger problem than generally recognised, causing appalling levels of harm and death that are totally preventable."" In a speech to a patient safety conference in London on Friday, Mr Hunt is expected to outline steps the NHS is taking to reduce mistakes. These include the continued rollout of the much delayed electronic prescribing - only a third of hospitals have an effective system in place. The Department of Health and Social Care believe the roll out of electronic prescribing systems across more hospitals could reduce errors by 50%. In his speech, Mr Hunt will also say there needs to be greater openness about mistakes, so the NHS can learn from them. A change in the law is being introduced that will mean pharmacists will not be prosecuted for owning up to genuine mistakes. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said doctors ""work hard to avoid making mistakes"" but were only human. The ""intense pressures"" on the front line would also be contributing to the problem, she added. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter,external Pharmacy warned after fatal mix-up.

"Harvey Weinstein produced a string of films that starred Meryl Streep Harvey Weinstein has apologised to Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence after his lawyers used their names in his defence against a legal action. His lawyers want a class action lawsuit dismissed for being too broad and used favourable quotes from the two stars. But Streep described the way they used the fact he did not abuse her as ""pathetic"", while Lawrence said he had taken things ""out of context"". Weinstein,externalhas been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. Six women are suing Mr Weinstein and what they dub the ""Weinstein Sexual Enterprise"", which they say includes his brother Bob and their film studio The Weinstein Company. The plaintiffs argue the ""enterprise"" conspired to conceal Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct. Many Weinstein Company board members, including Bob Weinstein, have said they did not previously know about allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against Harvey Weinstein. Streep hits back over McGowan criticism Streep bemoans Hollywood inequality How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded In seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed, his lawyers argued in a motion that it was far too broad and ""would include all women who ever met with Weinstein, regardless of whether they claimed to have suffered any identifiable harm as a result of that meeting."" They quoted Lawrence as saying in a media interview that the Hollywood mogul had ""only ever been nice to me"". However, they did not mention her adding, ""except for the moments that he wasn't"" - times when she said she would confront him verbally. In a statement, Lawrence said: ""Harvey Weinstein and his company are continuing to do what they have always done which is to take things out of context and use them for their own benefit. This is what predators do, and it must stop."" Jennifer Lawrence and Gwyneth Paltrow were named in the Weinstein legal team's defence A spokeswoman for Weinstein said he ""acknowledges the valuable input both Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence have contributed to this conversation and apologises"". Weinstein had directed that in the future no specific names of ""former associates"" be used by his lawyers, the spokeswoman said. Weinstein's legal team also used the name of Gwyneth Paltrow in papers filed in New York in an attempt to get the case dismissed. Paltrow has previously saidshe feared she would be fired after her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt confronted Weinstein in the 1990s. But the film producer's lawyers, Phyllis Kupferstein and Mary E Flynn, wrote: ""Paltrow was not so offended that she refused to work with Weinstein again, nor did her career suffer as a result of her rebuffing his alleged advances."" Weinstein's lawyers cited quotes Streep gave when theHollywood sexual harassment scandal,externalunfolded, saying he was ""respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally"". The lawyers did not mention that the actress also said the women who had spoken out against him were ""heroes"" and his alleged behaviour was ""inexcusable"" and an ""abuse of power"". In a new statement, Streep said: ""Harvey Weinstein's attorneys use of my (true) statement - that he was not sexually transgressive or physically abusive in our business relationship - as evidence that he was not abusive with many other women is pathetic and exploitative. ""The criminal actions he is accused of conducting on the bodies of these women are his responsibility, and if there is any justice left in the system he will pay for them - regardless of how many good movies, made by many good people, Harvey was lucky enough to have acquired or financed.""

"This video can not be played The truth about fruit tea Sipping acidic drinks such as fruit teas and flavoured water can wear away teeth and damage the enamel, an investigation by scientists has shown. The King's College London team found that drinking them between meals and savouring them for too long increased the risk of tooth erosion from acid. The research, in the British Dental Journal, looked at the diets of 300 people with severe erosive tooth wear. It said the problem was increasing as people snacked more. Fruit squashes, cordials, fruit teas, diet drinks, sugared drinks and flavoured water are all acidic and can cause wear and tear to teeth, the researchers said. And continuously sipping or holding these drinks in the mouth before swallowing increased the risk of tooth erosion. Dr Saoirse O'Toole, the lead study author, from King's College London Dental Institute, said: ""If you drink things for long periods of time, greater than five minutes, or if you play with things in your mouth or if you nibble on fruit over a few minutes rather than eating them as a whole fruit - these are things that can really damage your teeth. ""If you're going to have an apple as a snack at lunchtime, then try not to have anything acidic later on in the evening. ""If you are going to have a glass of wine in the evening, then don't have your fruit tea in the morning. ""Just balance things in your diet."" Brushing only partly protects children's teeth Rotten teeth: The North-South divide Footballers have 'worryingly poor' teeth Roman gums 'healthier than ours' The researchers found people who had drinks such as water with a slice of lemon or hot fruit-flavoured teas twice a day between meals were more than 11 times more likely to have moderate or severe tooth erosion. But this figure was halved when the drinks were taken with meals. Sugar-free soft drinks were as erosive as sugar-sweetened ones, the report said. And vinegars and pickled products could also lead to tooth erosion. alcohol fruit teas flavoured water squashes diet drinks sweetened drinks water tea coffee milk Russ Ladwa, who chairs the British Dental Association's health and science committee, said of acidic drinks: ""Having them with a meal helps to minimise the damage because chewing meal food increases the production of saliva, which is alkaline and acts a buffer to dilute acidic foods and drinks. ""We would promote the chilling of drinks, consuming them in one go - don't sip over long periods - and limiting soft drinks to meal times."" And using a straw would avoid the acid in drinks making contact with the teeth. Mr Ladwa added that consuming water, nutritious drinks such as milk and having neutralising food such as cheese after acidic food or drink was a good idea. It is progressive loss of the hard substance of a tooth by chemical processes that do not involve bacterial action The acidity of the food or drinks is critical rather than the sugar content (bacteria, along with sugar, cause tooth decay not erosion) Diet, lifestyle choices, the environment and in some cases medication can increase the risk Using fluoride toothpastes or rinses and modifying your diet can reduce the risk of erosion Source:British Dental Association,external The latest research shows that most children and adolescents in Britain have tooth-surface loss due to dental erosion. It is also recognised as a major cause of tooth damage in older generations.

"This video can not be played Labour MP: What happened to Rebecca could happen to anyone Plans to change the rules on organ donation consent in England, which it is claimed could save up to 500 lives a year, have been backed by MPs. A bill requiring people to ""opt out"" if they do not want their organs used passed its first parliamentary hurdle. Labour's Julie Elliott, whose daughter is receiving dialysis for a serious kidney disease, said it would give hope to thousands of transplant patients. The MP said her experience had made her realise how ""special"" donors were. Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson's private members' bill, which would bring England into line with Wales which already has an opt-out system for consent, passed its second reading on Friday. The government has said it ""wholeheartedly"" supported the bill, which it said would be referred to the changes as Max's Law, after nine-year-old Max Johnson, who benefited from a heart transplant.

There are 25 million people on the organ donation register but 6,500 patients are waiting for a transplant. At the moment in England, organs can only be used if explicit approval is given, either by signing the register or if the deceased had told a family member of their desire to donate. Reality Check: Does organ donation without consent save lives? The UK government is consulting on introducing an opt-out system while Scotland is currently looking at bringing forward similar legislation. Mr Robinson told MPs that while levels of organ donation were considerably higher than a decade ago, the UK had some of the lowest rates of consent in Western Europe and a ""certain inertia"" had set in. According to NHS figures, he said about 500 people were dying every year due to a lack of suitable donors. Geoffrey Robinson said he had been ""guilty"" for some time of thinking of registering but not doing so ""This is not good enough. I believe we can do better and be pioneers in making transplants more effective."" While changing the law would ""not make an immediate difference"", he said if the bill was passed by the end of the year it would increase the availability of organs over time and help give more people ""a new lease of life"". He also said he hoped it would make it easier for families to openly discuss the issue. 'Follow Wales' lead on organ donation' Plan for Scots opt-out organ donations ""None of us likes to think about the worst happening,"" he said. ""It is challenging to have conversations with loved ones about their wishes after death. ""We know that it is at that moment when families are confronted with the awful situation that very often they back off, sometimes over-riding the wishes of the deceased who happens to be a registered donor."" Ms Elliott, the MP for Sunderland Central, said her family's life had been transformed by her previously healthy 36-year old daughter Rebecca's diagnosis with a serious kidney complaint in late 2016. ""What happened to us over the last 18 months could happen to anyone, rich or poor... and highlights the reality of the need to change the law to a position of deemed consent,"" she said. ""From hopefully one day the family member of a recipient, I want to say (to donors) thank you very much from the bottom of my heart - you are very special people."" ""Let us make the change in the law to save more lives of the thousands waiting for transplants."" Under the bill's ""soft opt-out"" proposals, the wishes of families and next of kin would continue to be respected, so removal of organs would not go ahead without their support. There would be exemptions for under-18s and adults not able to make informed decisions. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made a brief appearance in the Commons to urge MPs to support the ""wonderful"" measure which he said would ""save an awful lot of people's lives"". In Wales, where an opt-out system was introduced in December 2015, there has actually been a small dip in the number of deceased donors, from 64 in 2015-16 to 61 in 2016-17. This resulted in a drop in organ transplants from 214 to 187 respectively. Former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said it would be wrong to describe the experience in Wales as a failure. But the Conservative MP said families should have a ""certain latitude"" to change their mind at what was obviously a very sensitive time following the death of a loved-one.

A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murdering two menwho were stabbed to death in Camdenon Tuesday. The 18-year-old has also been linked to another attack on the same evening in which the victim survived. Four other men, aged 24, 23, 20 and 21, were arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and have been released while inquiries continue. The Met Police is linking three stabbings - two of which were fatal The first stabbing occurred near a block of flats on Aldenham Street in Somers Town at about 20:00 GMT. The 16-year-old victim, who remains in hospital, and another youth are believed to have been chased by at least three men. Half an hour later Abdikarim Hassan, 17, was found with fatal injuries in Bartholomew Road, Kentish Town, then at 22:13 Sadiq Adan Mohamed, 20, died in the third stabbing of the night. The Metropolitan Police say Mr Mohammed and a friend were ""chased by a group of four men"" before the stabbing on Malden Road in Belsize Park.

"This video can not be played Barnaby's battles: Dogs and dual citizenship Barnaby Joyce says he will resign as Australia's deputy prime minister following a politically damaging saga that began with his affair with a former staffer. Mr Joyce said he would step down on Monday as leader of the Nationals, the junior government partner. He had previously resisted calls to quit amid intense scrutiny over his ministerial conduct. The scandal has dominated Australian politics for more than two weeks. He described his decision on Friday as a ""circuit-breaker"" for his family and new partner, with whom he is expecting a baby in April. Barnaby Joyce: Fall of an 'authentic' leader The scandal that unseated Australia's deputy PM ""This current cacophony of issues has to be put aside,"" he told reporters. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull issued a statement shortly after thanking Mr Joyce for being ""a fierce advocate for rural and regional Australia"". Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Rumours of an affair started to spread after Mr Joyce and Vikki Campion, his former media adviser, were photographed together at a bar in Sydney in February 2017. In April, Mr Joyce's estranged wife Natalie reportedly confronted Ms Campion about the rumours. In the following months, Mr Joyce was described by his Nationals colleagues as becoming ""a mess"". Mr Joyce finally admitted to the affair with Ms Campion earlier this month but initially refused to resign, insisting that ""private matters remain private"". Mr Joyce has repeatedly denied breaching ministerial standards In an interview with Australia's Fairfax Media newspaper on Wednesday, the couple called for scrutiny of their relationship to stop, appealing to the media and the public to ""move on"". Mr Joyce also said he was concerned and ""deeply annoyed"" at the thought that their child might be perceived as ""somehow less worthy than other children"". He has previously apologised to Natalie, their four daughters and Ms Campion for the public manner in which the scandal has played out. He has described the breakdown of his marriage as one of ""the greatest failures of my life"", while Mrs Joyce described the situation as ""devastating"". On Friday, Mr Joyce said he hoped his decision would help his family. ""This has got to stop. It's not fair on them,"" he said. The revelation of the affair led to questions over whether Mr Joyce had misused his position in parliament to conduct his relationship with Ms Campion. He said he faced a ""litany of allegations"" in the weeks after a newspaper exposed the affair. Political opponents also questioned him after two unadvertised jobs within his party were taken up by Ms Campion last year, and over whether he sought a gift of free housing from a businessman. He has repeatedly denied breaching ministerial standards. Malcolm Turnbull banned sex between ministers and staff following the Joyce scandal Last week, he sparred publicly with Mr Turnbull after the PM criticised his ""shocking error of judgement"" and declared thatministers would be banned from having sex with their staff. The prime minister ordered his deputy, who later accused him of being ""inept"", to take leave in order to concentrate on his personal life. Mr Joyce said Mr Turnbull's comments had ""caused further harm"" but insisted the pair could still work together. Meanwhile, Mr Joyce also vigorously denied a sexual harassment complaint that was made against him by another woman. Australia PM's comments ""inept"", deputy says Mr Joyce has built a prominent profile during a parliamentary career that began in 2004. The outspoken politician is perhapsbest-known for once threatening to kill Johnny Depp's dogsover a quarantine violation, and forbriefly losing his job over his New Zealand dual citizenshiplast year. A leading conservative, he represented rural voters as leader of the National party. Joyce wins back seat after citizenship row How a dual citizenship saga befell Australia Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent Fighting a barrage of bad headlines, Barnaby Joyce knew his position had become untenable. Sometimes strenuous denials and combative rebuttals just aren't enough to win back the news agenda. More importantly, they didn't succeed in maintaining the trust and credibility he has enjoyed for most of his career. Although Mr Joyce is known as a battler who enjoys a big personal vote, support amongst his colleagues had started to ebb away. And so, rather than face the potential humiliation of a leadership contest, Mr Joyce took matters into his own hands and put himself on the backbench.

"Reality TV star Kylie Jenner wiped $1.3bn (Â£1bn) off Snap's stock market value after tweeting that she no longer used its Snapchat messaging app. Celebrity Kim Kardashian's half-sister posted: ""sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad."" Snap's shares sank after Ms Jenner's tweet about Snapchat's re-design to her 24.5 million Twitter followers. One million people signed a petitiondemanding Snap roll back the change. After dropping almost 8%, shares in Snap closed 6% down on Wall Street, and are now back near the $17 price at which the shares were listed when the company floated on the stock market in March of last year. Snapchat is facing intense competition from Facebook's Instagram - especially for celebrity users - and Ms Jenner's attack comes at a time when investors are already worried. Even before Ms Jenner's Tweet, shares had been sliding. This week, analysts at Citi also downgraded the stock, pointing to the negative reaction to the redesign. Ms Jenner later tweeted a follow-up: ""still love you tho snap... my first love"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Snap has rejected complaints about November's re-design to its messaging app, with its boss Evan Spiegel saying earlier this month that users just needed time to get used to it. Mr Spiegel had something to soften the blow, though, with news on Thursday that his total pay last year was a staggering $637.8m. It is thought to be the third-highest annual package ever received by a company's chief executive. The market just doesn't know what to think of Snap or its Snapchat service. It is either the future of communication - or a social media fad that will last not much longer than one of the messages its army of young users sends. And that makes a share price which has mostly been built on a very optimistic view of future growth extremely volatile. Earlier this month it soared by nearly 50% on results that were marginally better than expected - now they've taken a minor tumble because a reality star says the new design is ""so sad"". Investors will continue to need strong stomachs - especially when they see how much founder Evan Spiegel is taking home. Kylie Jenner is not the first celebrity to move markets. In October 2015, TV host Oprah Winfrey bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers, endorsing the firm publically at the same time. Investors saw their shares rise by 92% over successive weeks. Michelle Obama was responsible for the ""Michelle mark-up"" When the former First Lady, Michelle Obama, turned up to an event wearing Versace or another designer brand, Wall Street noted the immediate effect on share prices. They dubbed it the ""Michelle mark-up"". Snapchat's shares have been particularly volatile since the company went public last year, with investor profits sometimes evaporating as fast as pictures and messages disappear from the site. The shares plunged by 17% in August, after disappointing results. But in the first weeks of this month shares bounced back by almost 50% after Snapchat reported a 72% rise in sales in the last quarter of 2017, with no fewer than 187 million people using the site every day. ""Part of the problem is Snap isn't profitable at the moment, so there's a fair amount of hope for the future already baked into the share price, making it particularly vulnerable to swings in sentiment,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Snap's future rests on building user numbers, so anything which could undermine that journey is naturally going to unsettle investors.""

"RBS chief executive Ross McEwan told MPs a 2014 claim was 'not right' RBS boss Ross McEwan has admitted a statement he made claiming that bank's Global Restructuring Group helped most of its business customers was wrong. He made the admission to MPs on the Treasury Select Committee on Tuesday. They were taking evidence on a leaked regulator's report that found an ""intentional, co-ordinated strategy"" to put RBS's interests ahead of customers. Mr McEwan said RBS ""successfully turns round the vast majority of businesses that it works with"". He added:  ""The bank, through its restructuring team, helped minimise those losses where it could, successfully turning round thousands of businesses, safeguarding hundreds of thousands of jobs."" However, Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan forced an admission from Mr McEwan that his statement was wrong in the light of an official report leaked to the BBC. ""You made a statement in 2014 about GRG turning around the vast majority of businesses that it works with and I'm asking you - that statement was not true?"" she asked. ""In 2014, absolutely when you look at the stats that have come through - that is not right,"" Mr McEwan said. The 2014 statement drew from findings by solicitors Clifford Chance, appointed by RBS to conduct what it claimed was an ""independent inquiry"" into allegations of mistreatment of business customers. Mr McEwan claimed at the time: ""Our first priority then and now is to try and help our customers recover."" That statement was contradicted by the central finding of an inquiry commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which concluded in 2016 and was leaked to the BBC last August. The inquiry, conducted by consultants Promontory and Mazars, found the bank had twin objectives: its own commercial interests on the one hand, and helping business customers turn their fortunes around on the other. It concluded there there were conflicts of interest between those objectives. The leaked report also found that only 10% of business customers put into the Global Restructuring Group were subsequently returned to normal banking. It also found 86% were subject to some form of inappropriate treatment - which in important respects should be viewed as ""systematic"". More small businesses get access to Financial Ombudsman Santander boss named in RBS scandal Following the hearing, the FCA said it was happy to release the report into GRG in full after Mr McEwan indicated that the bank would not object. However, it said publication would require the consent of those who provided the information as well as any individuals identified. ""We will approach these individuals, once the work on the focused investigation is completed, to ask for their consent to publish,"" the FCA said. Tony Boorman, managing director of Promontory consultants who authored the FCA report, told MPs that the effect of their actions on small business customers was not ""uppermost in the minds"" of GRG staff. ""We were very conscious in speaking to many of the customers in our sample of the very considerable distress that was caused by some of the events that we witnessed,"" he said. Mr McEwan repeated apologies first made in 2016 that RBS ""didn't get everything right"", but refused to accept that staff had been ""insensitive and aggressive"". That drew an angry response from Alister Jack MP, who cited his own experience as a business owner in conflict with the bankers from the GRG division in 2009. ""The manager who came to see me with his assistant â¦ was not only aggressive, he was thuggish. He shouted at his assistant because she couldn't make her numbers stand up, reduced her to tears, and as he left my office and headed down the stairs, he was still shouting at her. ""So don't tell anyone that you don't for a minute think that your staff were not aggressive, please. It's just offensive.""

"Academy trusts will be told the chief executives' pay should depend on how well schools perform The bosses of academy trusts running large chains of schools in England are going to be challenged by education ministers over ""fat-cat"" pay. Lord Agnew says the government's school funding agency is to write to multi-academy trusts asking how pay over Â£150,000 relates to school performance. The chief executive of Harris Federation became the first in the state sector to earn over Â£500,000. Head teachers say the public needs to be ""reassured"" over school spending. Lord Agnew, in a letter to academy trusts, has warned that the funding agency would soon be contacting multi-academy trusts paying above Â£150,000 - and that if performance is going down, pay for chief executives should also be cut. The education minister says that pay for academy bosses should not increase faster than the pay award for teachers. ""I believe that not all boards are being rigorous enough on this issue,"" writes Lord Agnew. ""My view is that we should see a reduction in CEO pay where the educational performance of the schools in the trust declines over several years."" Dame Glynis Breakwell stepped down as vice-chancellor when universities were criticised over high pay Schools have protested about worsening funding shortages, and Lord Agnew says academies must show they ""deliver the best value for money"". ""This is particularly important when looking at the pay of your senior leadership teams."" Education ministers gave tough warnings to universities paying vice-chancellors more than Â£150,000 per year and threatened intervention over excessive pay. But more than 120 academy trusts have been paying at least one member of staff more than this - and some many more. At Harris Federation there were 10 staff earning above the Â£150,000 threshold, including chief executive Sir Dan Moynihan's pay package of up to Â£500,000. The trust says that the pay reflects high performance, with Harris operating 44 schools - all rated by Ofsted as either outstanding or good. Before Christmas, the Department for Education said it would be raising concerns about pay with academy trusts - but wrote to only small, one-school trusts, rather than large academy chains. It is now going to contact the big multi-academy trusts. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, has called for a more transparent pay framework for all staff working the state school sector. ""It is crucial that we set a national framework that defines the roles and sets out the pay and conditions of all those employed in our national, publicly funded education system. ""The public have a right to be reassured that public funds are being used well."" But he warned against creating ""an exaggerated debate about leadership pay"" and a focus on a ""very few high salaries that are not representative of the sector"". The Education Funding and Skills Funding Agency will now write to multi-academy trusts. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the letter from Lord Agnew ""recognises the vital role that chairs of academy trusts play, and will ensure we can continue to work with multi-academy trusts to improve standards for all children, wherever they are growing up"".

"Ex-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth has resigned from Unicef saying he does not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities. Mr Forsythfaced three complaints of inappropriate behaviourtowards female staff before leaving Save the Children, the BBC reported this week. He was accused of sending inappropriate texts and commenting on what young female staff were wearing. He said he ""apologised unreservedly"" to the three workers at the time. Mr Forsyth said the reason for his resignation as Unicef's deputy director was not because of what he described as the mistakes he made in his former role at Save the Children. ""They were dealt with through a proper process many years ago,"" he said in a statement. ""There is no doubt in my mind that some of the coverage around me is not just to (rightly) hold me to account, but also to attempt to do serious damage to our cause and the case for aid."" Meanwhile,Haiti has suspended Oxfam GB operationsin the country, as it investigates claims of sexual misconduct by staff in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Conservative MP Pauline Latham, a member of the House of Commons' International Development committee, welcomed Mr Forsyth's resignation. ""But what I'm more concerned about is the fact he has been able to work for as long as he did,"" she told the BBC. ""It is shocking. The more I hear about it the more shocked I am. It's terrible for the UK charity sector. It will take a lot of getting over."" This video can not be played Ex-Save the Children worker: 'A really toxic culture grew' Brie O'Keefe, a former employee at Save the Children, said a number of staff were aware of Mr Forsyth's behaviour but were afraid of the consequences of speaking out for the charity. She told the BBC's Newsnight: ""One of the things that kept many of us from speaking out earlier was a desire to protect the organisation that we loved."" She said Mr Forsyth had been brought in to ""shake things up"" at the charity but it had resulted in ""certain toxic leadership behaviours"" being tolerated, including temper tantrums, yelling and disrespectful behaviour, and that those who raised concerns would be sidelined from projects. Ms O'Keefe welcomed Mr Forsyth's apology for the ""incidences he created"" but added: ""He hasn't taken any responsibility for the culture he fostered at Save the Children."" A statement from Unicef said it was grateful to Mr Forsyth for his work over the past two years. An investigation by BBC Radio 4's PM programme found that the complaints against Mr Forsyth included women receiving a series of inappropriate texts and comments on how they looked, what they were wearing and how he felt about them. If they did not respond, Mr Forsyth would follow up his messages with an email, asking if they had seen the text. If they still did not respond, he would ask someone to send them to him for a ""quick word"". Save the Children said it had commissioned ""a root and branch review of the organisational culture"" at the charity ""addressing any behavioural challenges among senior leadership"". The charity said concerns were raised about ""inappropriate behaviour and comments"" by Mr Forsyth in 2015. It said two trustees carried out separate investigations into a total of three complaints made by female employees, but there was no finding of misconduct against Mr Forsyth or any formal sanction against him. ""Both reviews resulted in unreserved apologies from the CEO. All the parties agreed to this and the former CEO apologised to the women in question. At that time the matters were closed."" Speaking earlier this week, a spokesman for Unicef said the charity had not been aware of any of the complaints against Mr Forsyth at the time of his recruitment in 2016. ""There have been no such complaints concerning Mr Forsyth at Unicef,"" he added. The allegations come after Brendan Cox - the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox - quit two charities he set up in memory of his wifeamid allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Charity Commission said it had ""extensive regulatory engagement"" with Save the Children after allegations of misconduct and inappropriate behaviour were made against Mr Cox and Mr Forsyth between 2015 and 2016.

"This video can not be played Sheriff Scott Israel: ""Peterson never went in"" An armed officer assigned to the Florida school where a gunman killed 17 people last week stood outside the building during the shooting and did not intervene, the local sheriff says. Deputy Scot Peterson has resigned after being suspended, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said. Earlier this week President Trump said arming school teachers could prevent school shootings. The proposal has long been championed by the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. On Thursday, in the NRA's first comments since the massacre, its head accused Democrats and media of ""exploiting"" the attack. Wayne LaPierre said ""opportunists"" were using the tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' Sheriff Israel said Mr Peterson, 54, was the school resource officer of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and was at the site, armed and in uniform, when the shooting took place. Students were evacuated in small groups after the 14 February shooting He said video footage showed Mr Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said. Asked what Mr Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said: ""Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer."" Mr Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. Sheriff Israel said Mr Peterson had not given a reason for why he did not go into the building where the shooter was. It is unclear if he will face charges. Sheriff Israel said he would not be releasing the video showing Mr Peterson and might never do so, ""depending on the prosecution and criminal case"" against the 19-year-old suspect accused of carrying out the shooting, former student Nikolas Cruz. The gunman used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being seen and arrested later. This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. Employed by the local police or sheriff's office, they document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education. There are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the US, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper,externalsaid he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (Â£54,137). Concerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about Nikolas Cruz were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. It has also been reported that calls were made to local authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about Nikolas Cruz, including one saying he was planning to attack the school. Teachers will be allowed back in on Friday. Both students and teachers are invited to a reorientation on Sunday, ahead of classes resuming on Wednesday. The three-storey building that was attacked is to be torn down. In recent days both President Trump and the NRA have spoken about this. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington on Thursday, Mr LaPierre reiterated that his group backed it. Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? He said the NRA would help any US school with their safety and security, free of charge, adding that ""opportunists"" pushing for more gun control ""hate the NRA. They hate the second amendment. They hate individual freedom"". This video can not be played Florida shooting: Why the NRA wields so much power The second amendment in the US constitution protects the ""right to keep and bear arms"". America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump floated the idea of arming teachers at a White House event on Wednesday where he heard from survivors of the Florida school shooting, Discussing school safety with state and local officials on Thursday, he explained why he believed that it would work, saying: ""Shooters won't walk into a school if 20% of people have guns."" This video can not be played Teacher at Florida school where 17 people died says arming some teachers would be wrong Mr Trump added: ""What I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus."" But Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union, disagreed that arming teachers was a suitable solution. ""Anyone who wants guns in schools has no understanding of what goes on inside them - or worse, doesn't care,"" she said. Survivors of last week's deadly shooting have called for stricter gun laws, prompting the nationwide activist movement #NeverAgain. Those survivors are organising a rally against mass shootings in Washington planned for 24 March and are expecting up to 500,000 people,according to the Washington Post,external. Sister rallies for ""March for Our Lives"" are also being planned in cities across the country. This video can not be played Victim's father tells Trump of rage Mr Trump has said he supports raising the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18 to 21 and insists the NRA would back such a proposal. In Florida aftermath, US students say 'Never Again' After Florida, some owners give up guns Six radical ways to stop US school shootings ""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" Mr Trump also took to Twitter on Thursday to push for national background checks for the mentally ill, a policy which the NRA chief later echoed at the conference. ""Anyone adjudicated as mentally incompetent or dangerous to society should be prevented from getting a gun,"" said Mr Trump. The US president has also directed his administration to take steps to ban gun ""bump stocks"". The accessories - which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute - were used by a gunman who killed 58 concert-goers in Las Vegas last October.

"The number of EU citizens leaving the UK is at its highest level for a decade with 130,000 emigrating in the year to September,figures show.,external But far more EU nationals (220,000) moved to the UK in the same period, the Office for National Statistics found. It means net EU migration - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000, the lowest for five years. The ONS said Brexit could be a factor in people's decisions to move. Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said migration was complicated and could be influenced by lots of different reasons. The figures also show that more British people are emigrating than are returning to live in the UK. Of those EU nationals arriving in the UK, fewer were coming for ""work-related reasons"", in particular to ""look for work"". By contrast, immigration from countries outside the European Union is going up which means the UK population is continuing to grow at a similar level to early 2014. Some 285,000 non-EU citizens arrived in the UK in the 12-month period to September, and 80,000 departed. This gives a net increase of 205,000, the highest for six years. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was largely driven by more people coming to study in the UK and an uncharacteristic dip in the previous year's figures that may have been corrected. He also speculated whether firms were starting to struggle to recruit or retain people from the EU, forcing them to look outside the EU. Overall, net migration is estimated to have fallen by 29,000 to 244,000 in the same period. This includes 73,000 British people coming back to the UK and 125,000 Britons leaving. The overall net migration figure is still well short of the government's target to reduce net migration to below 100,000, a pledge made in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What explanation could there be for the decline in EU migration other than Brexit?  In the two years before the June 2016 referendum, the number of EU nationals arriving in Britain was stable at about 240,000 to 280,000. But every quarter since then has recorded falls, from 284,000 to 220,000. At the same time, the number of EU leavers, which hadn't risen higher than 100,000 since 2010, began to rise, from 95,000 to 130,000. Whether it's a feeling that EU citizens aren't wanted in the UK, uncertainty about their future or the growing relative strength of other EU economies, there has been a notable shift away from Britain's shores. Nevertheless, overall net migration remains at historically high levels, well above the government's controversial target, with a rise in migration from outside Europe. Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said the latest figures demonstrated that the UK was still attracting the ""brightest and best people"" to come to work and study and described the increase in the number of overseas students as a ""huge positive"". ""We are a country that is open for business,"" she added. ""We want to have great relations with our European neighbours going forward but at the same time we need to have a sustainable migration system,"" she said. Asked whether falling numbers would adversely affect some sectors, in particular the NHS, Ms Nokes said the independent migration advisory committee was due to report its findings on EU patterns to the government in September so decisions could be made based on evidence.

""This deficit hurts us all and highlights the immigration mess the government has created,"" she said. The ONS figures also show that in 2017, the UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection or resettlement to almost 15,000 people, 40% of whom were under 18. Separate figures from the Home Office showedmore than 10,500 people have been granted refuge in the UK after fleeing the conflict in Syria, under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in Lebanon near the Syrian border, said the government was considering extending its commitment to rehome 20,000 people by 2020. This video can not be played ""The UK has given us everything... but we miss our country"" Other figures from the Home Office,externalshow there were 141,302 applications made for British citizenship in 2017, an increase of 8% on the previous year. This was 39% lower than the peak of 232,262 in 2013. There is evidence that more EU citizens, who have settled in the UK, are applying for citizenship, with applications more than doubling from 15,460 in 2016 to 38,528 in 2017.
