"Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, returns in The Rise of Skywalker The next Star Wars movie, episode IX, will be titled The Rise of Skywalker, it has been announced. The title was revealed at a Star Wars celebration event in Chicago, while a teaser trailer was posted on Twitter with the words: ""Every generation has a legend."" Director JJ Abrams said the movie is set some time after previous instalment The Last Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker is due to be released later this year. Despite his apparent death at the end of Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, Emperor Palpatine seems to be making a comeback. His sinister cackle is heard at the end of the trailer and Ian McDiarmid, who plays the character, strolled on stage to loud applause at the announcement. Allow Twitter content?

The two-minute trailer, the first footage seen from the new film, also features a brief glimpse of Princess Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher. She embraces Rey (Daisy Ridley), while Luke Skywalker's voice is heard saying: ""We'll always be with you. No one's ever really gone."" Fisher died in 2016 but the filmmakers were able to use previously unseen footage from The Force Awakens. Abrams told a US ""Star Wars Celebration"" event in Chicago it was a ""weird miracle"" to be able to continue Princess Leia's story. ""Every day it hits me that she's not here, but it's so surreal because we're working with her still,"" he said. ""She's so alive in the scenes and the craziest part is how not crazy it feels. Princess Leia lives in this film in a way that's kind of mind-blowing for me."" The Rise of Skywalker is the third episode of the third set of Star Wars films, which were started by filmmaker George Lucas in 1977. Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm - a subsidiary of Disney that makes the Star Wars films - agreed with the event's panel host Stephen Colbert it was ""unprecedented"" to tell a story in a nine-film arc. ""What's also fascinating is it's over 40 years,"" she told the event. ""To keep this relevant and meaningful to the characters and to the people experiencing this story, it has to feel like its of its time. ""We've taken to heart everything that inspired George [Lucas] and then I think the inspiration that JJ's [Abrams] brought to this has given it even more depth."" Carrie Fisher and Richard E Grant among Episode IX cast Fans welcomed the reappearance of Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, who is seen piloting the Millennium Falcon. The movie also features the return of John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron. The trailer opens with Rey on a desert planet as Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, says in a voiceover: ""We've passed on all we know. A thousand generations live in you now. But this is your fight."" She activates her lightsaber as a TIE fighter bears down on her, flying close to the ground. As it reaches her, she backflips over it. Then we see Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver, slicing through enemies in a blood-red forest. Lando Calrissian appears at the controls of the Millennium Falcon, putting it into hyperdrive as a title card says: ""The saga comes to an end."" Lando Calrissian is back after appearances in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Heroes including C-3PO are seen being chased across the desert planet in a low-flying craft before the trailer cuts to the shot of Rey hugging Leia. Then we see Rey, Finn, Poe, C-3PO, BB-8 and Chewbacca walking to the edge of a cliff by the sea. Across the water appears to be the wreckage of a Death Star. The trailer's final shot appears to show a wrecked Death Star The film is due to be released on 20 December.

"Assange was found guilty of a British charge, but he could be extradited to the US to face a separate charge Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange could face a renewed investigation into an allegation of rape in Sweden. Assange, 47, who had been granted asylum in Ecuador's London embassy for seven years, was arrested on Thursday. Swedish prosecutors said they were examining the case at the request of the alleged victim's lawyer. The US also wants to extradite him from the UK over his alleged role in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets in 2010. Australian-born Assange facesa charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US,externalfor his alleged role in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets in 2010, which could result in a prison term of up to five years. Lawyer Elizabeth Massi Fritz said she would do ""everything we possibly can"" to get the investigation reopened in Sweden. Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world Why Julian Assange is a wanted man Assange sought refuge in the Knightsbridge embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of sexual assault. But Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum and invited the police to arrest him on Thursday. Afterhis dramatic arrest,he was taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court and found guilty of a British charge of breaching bail. He spent Thursday night in custody and is facing up to 12 months in prison for that conviction. The United Nations has called for his right to a fair trial to be respected during any extradition process. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Assange was accused of rape and other sexual offences, against two women, following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual. Swedish prosecutors dropped the rape investigation in 2017because they were unable to proceed while he remained in the Ecuadorean embassy. Assange also faced investigation for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out. Prosecutors will now re-examine the rape case to decide whether to resume it before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2020. Ms Massi Fritz, lawyer for the alleged victim, said the arrest came as a shock,externalbut ""what we have been waiting and hoping for since 2012 has now finally happened"". She said: ""No rape victim should have to wait nine years to see justice be served."" Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in embassy Who is Julian Assange? Timeline of the Assange saga Assange is due to face a hearing over his possible extradition to the US on 2 May. The US Department of Justice has accused him of conspiring with former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to commit ""one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States"". Manning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, including a video of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq.She was recently jailed for a second timefor refusing to testify in an investigation into Wikileaks. Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" for journalists publishing information about the US. This video can not be played Does Trump still love Wikileaks... or what? Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, saidthe charges had been crafted to avoid free speech concernsby accusing Assange of participating in the theft of information. But he said the indictment was ""thin on evidence"". During a briefing at the White House following Assange's arrest, US President Donald Trump was asked by reporters if he stood by his election campaign remark that he loved Wikileaks, which released damaging information on his opponent Hillary Clinton. ""I know nothing about Wikileaks,"" said Mr Trump. ""It's not my thing."" With Assange facing extradition proceedings and up to five years in federal prison on the US computer hacking charge, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK should resist handing him over. She said: ""This is all about Wikileaks and all of that embarrassing information about the activities of the American military and security services that was made public."" Ecuador arrest man 'close' to Assange How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Initially Ms Abbott dismissed the Swedish allegations, saying three times that Assange was never charged, but she later said he should face the criminal justice system if the Swedish government does charge him. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also saidthe UK should oppose Assange's extradition, ""for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan"". The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said backing Assange is not without political risk and will not find universal favour among Labour MPs - but it means ""the battle over Assange's future will now be as much political as it is legal"". Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the arrest, saying it showed that ""in the UK, no one is above the law"". Lawyer Rebecca Niblock said the extradition decision lies primarily with the courts and that only a judge can decide whether an extradition breaches an individual's human rights. The home secretary can consider a limited number of issues when deciding whether or not to order an extradition, including whether the person is at risk of the death penalty. However, if Sweden also made an extradition request, Ms Niblock said it would be for the home secretary to decide which request would take precedence, considering factors such as the seriousness of the offence and which request was made first. Nick Vamos, former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, said the UK proceedings should not take more than 18 months. Considering Assange's potential objections to extradition, Mr Vamos said that he did not think courts would accept the US case was politically motivated. But he said Assange may be able to argue that his likely treatment in the US prison system would breach his human rights and that could not receive a fair trial due to his notoriety and links to political scandals.

"The water at Polmadie Burn turned bright green Glasgow City Council has agreed to test for soil samples contamination after a burn turned bright green due to high levels of toxic chemicals. Residents were concerned that hexavalent chromium from the burn in Richmond Park, Oatlands may have spread to a nearby playground. The element, which has been linked with cancer, is largely banned in manufacturing in the EU. However, the council insisted contamination was ""unlikely"". Council chief executive Annemarie O'Donnell confirmed to councillors that testing would be carried out on soil samples from the play area, allotments and three gardens. A council spokeswoman said: ""To reassure residents and the local community it's been agreed that soil samples will be carried out."" High levels of hexavalent chromium were found in the water by Sepa It is estimated approximately 100 people attended a public meeting on Thursday to raise issues over the burn with a panel of community and city councillors. Locals said they were concerned as the burn runs near to a children's play park and residential gardens. Councillor for Southside Central Soryia Siddique backed calls for testing and wrote to Ms O'Donnell urging her to address public concerns. Ms Siddique aid: ""There was clear anxiety at last night's meeting and concerns regarding public health in Oatlands due to the presence of hexavalent chromium. ""I support the communities request for testing the local environment. Representative sampling and analysis will allow evidence-based information to be presented to the local community and a potential reassurance that the Hexavalent Chromium is at a safe level. ""If the evidence proves any concerns regarding the levels of hexavalent chromium, Glasgow City Council must take action to detoxify immediately. ""Public health and safety is paramount."" Hexavelent chromium is a heavy metal with a number of uses across industries including textile dyes, paints and plastics. While metallic chromium is inert and safe, in certain chemical compounds chromium forms ions with a plus-six positive charge. If this hexavalent form of chromium then gets into the body - eaten, or dissolved in water, or vaporised by a welding torch and then inhaled - it can cause cancer. It was restricted from use in electronics manufacturing in EU countries in 2003 under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive. It was listed alongside nine other elements including lead and mercury. In the early 1990s, US legal clerk Erin Brockovich brought a successful case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company for allowing the substance to contaminate drinking water in Hinkley, California. The source of the chemical in the burn, according to Sepa (the Scottish Environment Protection Agency), was from historical chemical works which existed in the area from the 1800s until the late 1960s. Many of the waste by-products were used to backfill the former clay pits, near the West Burn in Shawfield. The council said chemicals then contaminated the West Burn before seeping into the Polmadie Burn. To tackle the link, the West Burn was diverted into the River Clyde on 21 January and was sealed up earlier this week. Temporary fencing was erected to restrict public access to the Polmadie Burn. Glasgow City Council proposed allowing additional water to flow into the affected stretch to dilute and flush the chemical into the River Clyde. However, the council altered the flushing plan so that only natural rainwater would be used to dilute the burn. A council spokeswoman said: ""There was significant rainfall which was deemed sufficient for the flushing process."" Sepa will continue to test the water, but say it is ""too early"" to detect a drop in hexavalent chromium levels. A spokesman said: ""We would expect to see a drop in Chromium VI over the next couple of months.""

"Boris Johnson was wrong to claim there was polling evidence that a no-deal Brexit was the public's preferred option, the press regulator has ruled. Ipso ordered the Daily Telegraph to print a correction after finding the MP's column was inaccurate. The claim was made in a piece headlined ""The British people won't be scared into backing a woeful Brexit deal nobody voted for"" in January. The Telegraph had argued it was ""clearly comically polemical"". The column,externalappeared a week before MPsrejected Theresa May's Brexit deal for the first time, by a historic margin. The Commons went on to reject the withdrawal agreement in a further two votes. Brexit: What happens now? Brexit jargon explained In his piece, prominent Brexiteer Mr Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary over Mrs May's Brexit strategy last July, wrote:  ""Of all the options suggested by pollsters - staying in the EU, coming out on Theresa May's terms, or coming out on World Trade terms - it is the last, the so-called no-deal option, that is gaining in popularity. ""In spite of - or perhaps because of - everything they have been told, it is this future that is by some margin preferred by the British public."" According to Ipso, the newspaper argued that it was clearly an opinion piece and readers would understand that it was not invoking specific polling - and that the Conservative MP's column was ""clearly comically polemical"" and would not be read as a ""serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters"". And it argued that various combinations of results in four polls reflected support for a no-deal scenario over Theresa May's deal or remaining in the EU. But following a complaint that it was inaccurate,Ipso said,externalthe article, published on 7 January, failed to provide accurate information with ""a basis in fact"" and ordered a correction to be printed. In its ruling, Ipso said that while columnists were free to use ""hyperbole, melodrama and humour"", they must take care ""over the accuracy of any claims of fact"". It said the Telegraph had not provided data to back up the claims and had ""construed the polls as signalling support for a no deal, when in fact, this was the result of the publication either amalgamating several findings together or interpreting an option beyond what was set out by the poll, as being a finding in support of a no-deal Brexit"". It found it was a ""significant inaccuracy, because it misrepresented polling information"" and upheld a complaint that it had breached clause 1 of the Editors' Code of Practice.

"Folau has the fourth highest total of Test tries for Australia The Rugby Football Union says it does not support Billy Vunipola's views after the England forward defended Israel Folau's social media post claiming ""hell awaits"" gay people. Folaulooks certain to be sackedby Australia for the comments. Vunipola, who was criticised for liking the post, called for people to ""live their lives how God intended"" and said ""man was made for woman to procreate"". The RFU said on Friday it intends to hold a meeting with Vunipola next week. ""Rugby is an inclusive sport, and we do not support these views,"" it said in a statement. ""We will be meeting with Billy to discuss his social media posts."" In a statement, Vunipola's club side Saracens said: ""We recognise that people have different belief systems and we expect everyone to be treated equally with respect and humility. ""As representatives and role models, Saracens players have a responsibility not only to themselves but to the club and wider society. ""Billy Vunipola's recent social media posts are inconsistent with this and we take this matter very seriously. It will be handled internally."" Folau posted aphoto on Instagram,externalearlier this week, with the message: ""Warning. Drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolators. Hell awaits you. Repent! Only Jesus saves."" Rugby Australia and New South Wales Rugby Union held a private meeting with the full-back in Sydney on Friday, having previously been unable to contact him and said afterwards their position on the 30-year-old's future was unchanged. 'Folau may never play rugby again' This video can not be played Folau comments ânot tolerated in societyâ Social media users criticised Vunipola after noticing he had liked the post, and the Australia-born 26-year-old responded in an Instagram statement on Friday. ""So this morning I got three phone calls from people telling me to 'unlike' the Izzy Folau post,"" he wrote. ""This is my position on it. I don't HATE anyone, neither do I think I'm perfect. ""There just comes a point when you insult what I grew up believing in that you just say enough is enough - what he's saying isn't that he doesn't like or love those people. ""He's saying how we live our lives needs to be closer to how God intended them to be. Man was made for woman to procreate, that was the goal no? ""I'm not perfect - I'm at least everything on that list at least at one point in my life. It hurts to know that. But that's why I believe there's a God. To guide and protect us and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."" Vunipola has been named on the bench for Saracens' Premiership fixture with Bristol at Ashton Gate on Saturday. Rugby Australia is set to terminate Folau's contract, just months away from a World Cup at which he would have been a central figure for the Wallabies. ""Israel has failed to understand the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality,"" read a statement. Folau, who signed a four-year deal with the Waratahs in March and had a deal with Rugby Australia until 2022, escaped punishment for similar comments last year.

"Stand-up comedian Ian Cognito was performing at a comedy club in Bicester when he fell ill on-stage Veteran stand-up comedian Ian Cognito has died on stage during a performance. The 60-year-old comic sat down on a stool while breathing heavily, before falling silent for five minutes during his show on Thursday. Compere Andrew Bird said the crowd at the The Atic bar in Bicester had thought it was a joke, and continued to laugh, unaware something was wrong.

Mr Bird, who runs the Lone Wolf Comedy Club event at the venue, said Cognito had not been feeling well before the gig started, but insisted on going on stage. ""He was like his old self, his voice was loud. I was thinking 'he's having such a good gig',"" Mr Bird said. Mr Bird said Cognito had even joked about his health during his set, telling the audience: ""Imagine if I died in front of you lot here."" It was Mr Bird who first went on stage to check if his fellow comedian was ok. ""Everyone in the crowd, me included, thought he was joking,"" he said. ""Even when I walked on stage and touched his arm I was expecting him to say 'boo'."" Once it became clear something was wrong, two off-duty A&E nurses and a police officer began chest compressions and an ambulance was called. Audience member John Ostojak said: ""Only 10 minutes before he sat down he joked about having a stroke. ""He said, 'imagine having a stroke and waking up speaking Welsh'."" Mr Ostojak said: ""We came out feeling really sick, we just sat there for five minutes watching him, laughing at him."" Mr Bird said dying on stage would have been the way the veteran comic ""would have wanted to go"", ""except he'd want more money and a bigger venue"". Cognito, whose real name was Paul Barbieri, was born in London in 1958, and had been performing since the mid-1980s. Fellow comedians have paid tribute, describing him as a ""proper comic"" and praising his support for up-and-coming acts.

"Police blamed ""infiltrators"" for violence in Algeria's continuing protests Police and protesters have clashed in Algeria as marches against the ruling elite show no sign of ending. Police used water cannon and tear gas in the capital Algiers as demonstrators called for the removal of new interim President Abdelkader Bensalah. Largely peaceful protests have been held every Friday in cities across Algeria for the past two months. Police arrested 108 ""infiltrators"" towards end of the march after 27 officers were injured, officials say. Former leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned last week. He was replaced by Mr Bensalah, who has pledged to hold free elections on 4 July but many see him as too close to the former president. Goodbye to the only leader they ever knew How Algeria's army sacrificed a president to keep power Hundreds of thousands reportedly marched in Algiers on Friday, many chanting ""No to Bensalah"" and using the slogan ""They will all leave"" on social media. Mr Bensalah will be in office for a 90-day period as set out by the constitution and is barred from running in the upcoming poll, but demonstrators are still demanding his resignation. Protests started in February with anger focused on the country's ruling elite, not just Mr Bouteflika, Placards and online posts have been demanding an end to ""le pouvoir"", or the establishment. Demonstrators carried signs protesting against the ruling elite on Friday, including one saying ""We are going to continue to victory without you"" About 70% of the country's population is under 30, and youth unemployment is high. On Wednesday, the country's army chief, Lt Gen Gaid Salah, made his first public address since Mr Bensalah's appointment. In a televised speech, he cautioned protesters about demands that could undermine the country's constitution. What's Algeria like? Algeria's Bouteflika asks 'forgiveness' He also said the judiciary should investigate ""the whole gang"" - a term used for the former president's inner circle. Mr Bouteflika was considered by many as being a front for a group of businessmen, politicians and military officials who were said to really control the country. Protests so far have largely been peaceful, although tear gas and water cannon were used by security forces on Tuesday and Wednesday.

"The World Health Organization says the spread of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not yet a global health emergency. The Ebola outbreak is the second biggest in history - infecting 1,206 people and killing 764. It shows no sign of being contained soon. Efforts by healthcare workers have been hampered by conflict and rebel attacks. And experts have warned it will be ""very difficult to bring it under control"". But Prof Robert Steffen, chairman of the WHO's emergency committee on Ebola, said declaring an emergency would not change anything on the ground. He said: ""It does not mean we can lean back and relax. ""Funds are now needed to avoid a public health emergency of international concern."" The World Health Organization said it had received only half the money it needed to tackle the disease. The outbreak started in August 2018 and is still contained within two provinces in DRC - North Kivu and Ituri. However, the WHO has warned a ""rising number of security incidents"" has been making it hard to monitor the spread of the virus, vaccinate people and contact anyone who has been in contact with an Ebola patient. Cases have been increasing in recent weeks and the WHO says the risk of the virus spreading to neighbouring countries is ""very high"". It says the risk of the virus spreading globally is low. Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding. People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola. Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure. Most Ebola outbreaks are over quickly and affect small numbers of people. Only once before has there been an outbreak that was still expanding - and with such a high number of cases - more than eight months after it began. That was theepidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016which killed 11,310 people. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome charity, said: ""The teams in DRC need all our support and resources, including finance, healthcare workers, enhanced security and infrastructure, as well as more international political support. ""This epidemic is at a very dangerous phase in an incredibly difficult environment, and we urgently need the response to evolve to help stop Ebola spreading and save lives."" Unlike the West Africa outbreak, a vaccine has been available which is being used to protect people at risk - including doctors and people who come into contact with an Ebola patient. However, there have still been 85 cases and 30 deaths among healthcare workers, which further reduces the ability to deal with the outbreak. There is also a trial of experimental drugs taking place in Ebola centres in the country. A ""public health emergency of international concern"" was declared for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the Zika virus outbreak in 2016. Dr Rebecca Katz, the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, said the decision not to declare an emergency was disappointing. She said: ""This is a deeply concerning event, due to the pathogen itself, the total number of cases, the increase in cases just this week, and the difficulty of co-ordinating the response due to conflict - that needs to receive the appropriate level of attention.""

protesters to achieve their aspirations, but would not tolerate chaos. Samahir toldFocus on Africathat protests would continue until they achieve their goals: The sit in, itâs gonna be the same tonight and every night. The statements [by the army], the decisions that have been set are absolutely unsatisfactory. Itâs just a change of faces so nothing changed.  Everything is still the same for us. Right now the faces involved in the security council â theyâre still the same people that have been involved in killing the protestersâ¦ and theyâre part of the regime.  The fact that the president is not in place anymore and they bring his vice president to become our new president is not satisfactory. The council that has been formed is of all the members who have been attacking the protesters on the streets for the past few months.  They must go. From day one the demands have been clear â they must go. They cannot be inclusive.  Theyâre the people who have destroyed Sudan and they cannot fix it.  What weâve heard is thereâs a split inside the military. A lot of officers are on the side of the protesters but the head officers are still part of the regime. The regime is still in places. They just replaced al-Bashir so itâs still not satisfactory.""

Jumia is listing 17.6% of the company at $14.50 a share, giving the company ""unicorn"" status - which is the term used for a technology start-up worth $1bn-plus.

Kalkidan YibeltalBBC Amharic Service, Addis Ababa Ethiopia has foiled a planned attack by suspects backed by Islamist militant group al-Shabab in the capital, Addis Ababa, its attorney general has said. Berhanu Tsegaye said that suspects were targeting popular areas in the capital. He told journalists that the suspects, whose number he didn't disclose, had been arrested and that investigations were ongoing. The Somalia-based al-Shabab militants has previously threatened to attack Ethiopia following the countryâs military involvement in Somalia. But unlike neighbouring countries, terror attacks are rare in Ethiopia. Ashagre HailuBBC News Amharic, Editor Ethiopia's authorities have asked for help from South Africa and
Kenya to put out a fire that has been burning for days in the Simien Mountain
National Park in the country's northern Amhara region. The 220 sq-km (84 sq-miles) park, in Ethiopia's highlands, is sometimes called the ""Roof of Africa"" as it forms the
largest continuous area of elevation on the continent. The park is listed as a World Heritage Site, and according to Unesco is home to some rare animals such as ""the Gelada baboon, the Simien fox and the Walia ibex, a goat found nowhere else in the world"". Tadesse Yigzaw, one of the officials at the park, told BBC the
fire was spreading to gorges and difficult terrain, and they were struggling to
control it. Volunteers and residents have also joined in the effort to put out the blaze. Another fire broke out in the park last month, destroying 340
hectares (840 acres) of forest and grass. It is not known how either of the fires started. This is a promotional video of the park shared on YouTube. Allow YouTube content?

The ouster of Sudan President Omar al-Bashir is the latest successful coup in that country. Mr Bashir himself took power following a military coup in 1989 and prior to that there had been 13 coup attempts in Sudan, some successful and some not. BBC's Reality Check team has been looking back at Sudan's history of military interventions, and the wider picture across the African continent. Read the full story on the BBC website. The Africa Cup of Nations draw takes place on Friday 19:00 GMT with many fans waiting to discover their countries' fate. The tournament, which is in Egypt, is the biggest yet with 24 teams and the first to be held in Europe's summer rather than January or February. It will take place from 21 June to 19 July, meaning European-based players will not need to miss club games. Cameroon are the defending champions, beating Egypt in the 2017 final. More on this story on theBBC African football page. Wilfried Zaha, Riyad Mahrez, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are among the players likely to play at Afcon 2019 Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague The toppling of 75-year-old man
Omar al-Bashir as Sudanâs president has raised the possibility of him standing
trial before the International Criminal Court (ICC), where heâs wanted on
charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed
in Darfur. He was the first sitting president
of a country to be indicted by the ICC and the first person to be charged with
genocide. Mr Bashir, who denies the
allegations, has been wanted by the ICC in The Hague for more than a decade. The fact heâs continued to travel
extensively throughout Africa and the Middle East has served to highlight the
impotence of a court, which depends upon countries co-operation to actually
arrest and surrender suspects. So what hope
of that happening now? Lt-Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin, the head
of the political military committee, addressing a press conference said,
""Bashir will be tried in our judicial systemâ. âNo Sudanese will be extradited to
face trial in a foreign court.â You can understand their logic
based on self-interest, some of the people still in power might be implicated
in the crimes attributed to Mr Bashir, including attempts to destroy two ethnic
groups loyal to rebels opposed to the Sudanese regime. But the
military did acknowledge a future civilian government might choose to deal with
the matter differently. Backdoor discussions will be taking
place with various international stakeholders to obtain some international
support - and the extradition of this courtâs most high-profile fugitive might be
a powerful negotiation card. The African Union could be a key
player here - which has consistently ""defended"" the former president
and sought to undermine the legitimacy of the ICC. Itâs too
early, and situation still too volatile, to say with any certainty whether a
man whose iron grip on power was until relatively recently considered un-removable
will ever find himself facing international justice. The court is for now staying silent - in public at least. The prosecutor is undoubtedly
dusting off case files and trying to ascertain whether investigators will, for
the first time ever, actually be able to visit the region to try to gather
evidence of crimes that were allegedly committed years ago. A radio station run by the United Nations' mission in South Sudan reports that commercial flights in and out of the main airport in the capital, Juba, have been suspended or delayed following Thursday's coup in Sudan. The military council that toppled Sudan President Omar al-Bashir announced the closure of the airspace. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Deposed Sudan President Omar al-Bashir is the latest leader to be forced out of power because of an economic crisis, Bloomberg reports. Mr Bashir's inability to manage a shortage of foreign exchange that sent inflation soaring and hammered living standards was the cause for his downfall, the report says. Protests against his government began in December and were mostly about economic issues but later morphed into pressure to remove him from office. The same issues forced long-standing rulers from Algeria to Zimbabwe to leave office. Sudanâs economic woes can be traced back to the secession of South Sudan in 2011, which saw it lose almost all its oil fields and 60% of fiscal revenue. Allow Twitter content?

A pub in London has become a hotspot for Sudanese activists and protesters have a special chant for it. Sudanese activists have been demonstrating in solidarity with people in Khartoum since December 2018. Long-time President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown and arrested on Thursday after months of street protests. But thousands of protesters have vowed to stay out on the streets in defiance of a curfew imposed by the country's new military council, which demonstrators say is part of the same regime. This video can not be played BBC World Service Reports from Kenya say that suspected Islamist militants have killed a police officer and abducted two Cuban doctors working in Mandera County - a volatile area in the north-east of the country. Kenyan media reports say the gunmen, who are suspected to be al-Shabab militants, are believed to have taken their hostages to neighbouring Somalia. Al-Shabab has conducted frequent assaults in Mandera, which borders Somalia, to put pressure on the Kenyan government to withdraw its troops from Somalia. BBC World Service There's increased security in the Algerian capital, Algiers, where mass protests are again planned. Demonstrators, who have gathered every Friday for the past two months, want the removal of the interim head of state, Abdelkader Bensalah. He was appointed earlier this week after the resignation of the veteran leader, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Mr Bensalah, 77, has promised not to contest elections scheduled for early July.  But the protesters say he can't be trusted. Lt Gen Omar Zain al-Abdin, the head of the political military committee, addressing a press conference ""Bashir will be tried in our judicial system,"" Lt Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin has told a just concluded media briefing. ""We will have zero tolerance for those who kill citizens,"" he said. He added that no Sudanese will be extradited to face trial in a foreign court as long as the military council was in power, but added that a future civilian government might choose to deal with the matter differently. Mr Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur, in the west of the country. The conflict began in 2003 after rebels took up arms alleging the government was discriminating people from the region. Hundreds of thousands were killed in the crisis. ""Former Sudan President Omar al-Bashir is in custody"", Lt Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin, from the military council, has told a press conference, answering a question about the whereabouts of the longtime ruler. A Twitter user has shared a video of protesters chanting in the early hours of Friday as they defied a 22:00 to 04:00 local time curfew that was imposed by military authorities who deposed President Omar al-Bashir.

"This video can not be played Sudan protests: So what's going on? Sudan's deposed President Omar al-Bashir is under arrest after being overthrown by the military following months of protests - and the coup leader himself announced his resignation just 24 hours after taking charge. Here's what you need to know. In December 2018, the government tried to stave off economic collapse brought on by years of US sanctions and loss of oil revenue by imposingemergency austerity measures and a sharp currency devaluation. Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparkeddemonstrations in the east over living standards, but the anger soon spread to the capital, Khartoum. The lifting of most sanctions in 2017failed to help the country, which had lost most of its oil fields when South Sudan became independent in 2011. Initially, they focused on rising costs but quickly widened into demands for the removal ofPresident Bashir, in charge for nearly 30 years, and his government. The protests reached a climax on the symbolic date of 6 April - the anniversary of a 1985 non-violent uprising that removed then dictator Jaafar Nimeiri. Protesters adopted slogans of regime change that echoed the Arab Spring of 2011. They gathered outside the headquarters of the military in the capital and refused to move. The economic problems brought Sudanese from all walks of life on to the streets but the organisation of demonstrations was taken on by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA),a collaboration of doctors, health workers and lawyers. The proportion of women among the protesters has been put as high as 70%and they come from all ages and backgrounds. They say they are alsodemonstrating against Sudan's sexist attitudesin a conservative Muslim society where Sharia law is practised. Video of a woman dubbed ""Kandaka"" (Nubian queen) leading chantswas shared hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter. The protesters are mostly young, reflecting the country's demographics, but people of all ages have been seen in the crowds. At one point some individual soldiers were seen protecting those in the demonstrations but there was no mass transfer of allegiance. In a word, no. In the immediate aftermath of the announcement that President Bashir had been replaced by a military council the SPA called on people to maintain the sit-in outside the military HQ. This was in defiance of a curfew. The SPA said the coup was led by a handful of military officials who were close to the former president and implicated in the problems that people were demonstrating about. When he announced the ""uprooting of the regime"" on Thursday, Lt Gen Awad Ibn Auf said there would be a three-month state of emergency and a two-year transition period to prepare for civilian rule. He appeared to side with the protesters saying: ""For a long time, examining what's going on in the state and the corruption... the poor are poorer and the rich are still rich, and there are no equal chances for the same people."" On Friday, in the face of continued protests, Mr Ibn Auf himself stood down, as did the feared security chief, Gen Salah Gosh. Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council, to become Sudan's third leader in as many days. According to the foreign ministry, Gen Burhan is ""committed to having a complete civilian government"". The military council has said that Mr Bashir is in custody. He has not been seen in public since the coup and his whereabouts are unknown. He is wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court  in connection with the conflict in Sudan's Darfur province. But he may be put on trial inside Sudan, according to the military rulers.

"The military authorities want to avoid rival security forces clashing in the capital Thursday's coup in Sudan may have seen the overthrow of an unpopular president but those close to Omar al-Bashir are determined to stay in power, writes Sudan expert Alex de Waal. For the first time in almost 30 years, Sudan is not ruled by President Omar al-Bashir. But when Sudanese listened to Lt Gen Awad Ibn Auf announcing a transitional military council, they would have heard his master's voice. Gen Ibn Auf is a career soldier, cut from the same cloth as Mr Bashir. He was head of military intelligence during the conflict and atrocities in Darfur, for which he was put on a US list for targeted financial sanctions. There was no mention of the involvement of civilians in the two-year transition He was defence minister and after President Bashir declared a state of emergency on 22 February, Gen Ibn Auf was also promoted to serve as vice-president, with the implication that he would step into the president's shoes when the his constitutional term expired in April 2020. The trigger for the removal of Mr Bashir was a five-day round-the-clock peaceful protest in which tens of thousands of people surrounded the army headquarters in Khartoum, demanding that the president step down. But what happened next was determined by hard bargaining within those buildings, among the military oligarchs who sat just beneath the president in the security hierarchy. During the course of Thursday, there was a protracted silence from the military headquarters while Gen Ibn Auf, the senior commanders of the Sudan Armed Forces and other key security figures such as Gen Salah Abdalla Gosh, head of the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), haggled over the political dispensation that would follow Mr Bashir's removal. Fights in Egyptian army in 1973 Arab-Israeli war Seizes power in Sudan in 1989 in an Islamist-backed coup Gives asylum to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 1990s First head of state indicted by ICC in 2009, but denies accusations of war crimes in Darfur Makes peace with southern rebels in 2005 Oversees secession of the south in 2011, leading to Sudan losing three-quarters of its oil wealth Ousted by military in April 2019 Little is known about his private life. He has no children When Gen Ibn Auf finally addressed the nation, he announced the removal of President Bashir, the abolition of the constitution, the formation of a transitional military council, a state of emergency and a two-year transition. But he did not invite opposition representatives into government. In fact, he did not even offer to talk to them. The details of the pact among the security cabal are not public. But the outline is clear. First, the army, NISS and the paramilitary leaders (such as Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemeti"", commander of the Rapid Support Forces) want to share power among themselves. They want to avoid a repeat of clashes that occurred earlier in the week, when army units fired on NISS militiamen who were trying to disperse the crowd of protesters by force, let alone an internecine war on the streets of the capital. Second, the cabal is aligned with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Qatar and Turkey have lost out. The new leadership dissolved the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and reportedly arrested many veteran Muslim Brothers. President Omar al-Bashir (centre) came to power after a coup in 1989 They are busy telling Western countries that the Islamists had planned a coup, which needed to be forestalled by the army takeover, and that the protesters demanding democracy are also Muslim Brothers in disguise. It's not a very convincing story, but it points to future tensions because the Islamists still have a strong following in Sudan. Third, the coup leaders will protect the ousted president, even while they blame him publicly for the country's ills. The official announcement spoke of him being kept in a ""safe place"". They will not hand him over to the International Criminal Court, where he is wanted for crimes in relation to the Darfur conflict. Partly this is because they are no less responsible than Mr Bashir for the atrocities in Darfur and elsewhere. You may also be interested in: Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? 'We are here for the night shift' 'Why Sudan is shooting medics' It is also because that they know that one of his biggest assets was his reputation for loyalty to the officer corps, and they hope that some of that legacy will rub off on them. Keeping the current security coalition intact will be impossible if any one of them starts fearing he may be handed to a foreign power or court. And fourth, they have not decided how to handle the challenge posed by the demonstrators, who are still massed on the streets. This video can not be played A woman dubbed 'Kandaka', which means Nubian queen, has become a symbol for protesters Gen Ibn Auf and his collaborators cannot have been so naÃ¯ve as to assume that their gambit would satisfy the opposition. Rather, they are buying time so that they can decide whether to follow the path of repression or co-option, or more likely a bit of both. Sudan has taken one step back from the precipice of bloodshed on the streets of the capital, but only one. If the 11 April coup turns out to be a step towards democracy, it will be despite what the coup makers wanted, not because of them.

"The bearded figure being dragged from his home, into a waiting police van, was a far cry from the man who had entered the building seven years previously. Julian Assange - who co-founded website Wikileaks - had sought sanctuary in Ecuador's embassy from extradition to Sweden and, he feared, to the US. Ecuador withdrew his asylum on Thursday, leading to his arrest and thenconviction for failing to surrender to the court. But who exactly is Assange and what has he been accused of? This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Julian Assange was born in Townsville, Australia, in 1971. His parents ran a touring theatre and his childhood was filled with upheaval. He became a father at 18, later becoming entangled in custody battles. He showed an aptitude for computers and was fined several thousand Australian dollars in 1995 after pleading guilty to hacking activities. Assange avoided jail on the condition that he would not reoffend. He went on to help write a book about the internet, before studying physics and maths at Melbourne University. In 2006, Assange co-founded the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks, along with a group of like-minded people from across the internet. Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention-seeker? iA timeline of the Julian Assange saga The site published thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and war. One of its most high-profile releases came in 2010,when it published a video from a US military helicopter that showed the killing of 18 civilians in Baghdad, Iraq,external. Helicopter footage was posted on Wikileaks In the same year, Wikileaks published hundreds of thousands of documents leaked by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. They revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan. Files from the Iraq war showed that 66,000 civilians had been killed and that prisoners had been tortured by Iraqi forces. At the time, the US governmentmade it clearit hoped to prosecute Assange over the leak of the secret files. Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange over allegations of sexual assault in 2010.  He was detained in the UK, and later bailed over the allegations. It followed claims that while on a visit to Stockholm to give a lecture, Assange had raped one woman and sexually molested and coerced another. Assange says both encounters were entirely consensual and the Swedish efforts against him are part of a smear campaign. This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Following a long legal battle, the Wikileaks founder took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in 2012 to avoid being taken to Sweden to be questioned. He argued that he could also be extradited to the US and put on trial for publishing the secret US documents The Ecuadorian embassy was an obvious choice, since the South American country's then-president, Rafael Correa, was a strong advocate for Wikileaks, Swedish prosecutors dropped the rape investigation into Assange in 2017because they were unable to formally notify him of the allegations while he stayed in the embassy. The two other charges of molestation and unlawful coercion had to be dropped in 2015 because time had run out. But even after Sweden dropped the charges, Assange stayed in the embassy as he still faced a UK charge of failing to surrender to a court. Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in its embassy Relations between Assange and Ecuador's government worsened under President LenÃ­n Moreno, who took office in 2017. Before withdrawing Assange's asylum, Ecuador accused him of improper behaviour, interference in the affairs of other countries and spying. Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed Assange's arrest, saying it showed that ""no one is above the law"" in the UK. ButLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Assange had revealed ""evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan""and that his extradition to the US ""should be opposed by the British government"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Assange should face the criminal justice system if Swedish authorities decide to charge him. Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would fight the US extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" where any journalist could face US charges for ""publishing truthful information about the United States"". Pamela Anderson visiting Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy Actress Pamela Anderson - a friend of Assange - has said the UK is ""America's bitch"" in response to the arrest. Assange faces legal action in three countries - the UK, Sweden and the US. Westminster Magistrates' Court found him guilty of a British charge of breaching bail on Thursday. He faces up to 12 months in prison for that conviction. Meanwhile, Swedish authorities have said they are considering reopening their investigation into sexual assault allegations against him. The US has already charged the 47-year-old with a single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers to reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. But he is likely to face more charges if he is extradited to the US - a decision that will be taken by a judge and the UK home secretary. If Sweden also makes an extradition request,one legal experthas said it would be for the home secretary to decide which request would take precedence. Who is Julian Assange?

"The arrest and expected extradition of Julian Assange has set into motion what could prove to be the most important free speech and free press case in our history. Or not. Assange has been charged with a single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers with Chelsea Manning to reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. For many, Assange is a journalist, a whistleblower, a hero. Yet for others in Washington, he is the man who embarrassed the establishment in Congress, the intelligence community and even the media. Those powerful foes are likely to bring considerable pressure to deny Assange a platform for highlighting the operations that led to massive civilian losses and undisclosed military strikes, the very type of information disclosed in the celebrating ""Pentagon Papers"" case involving the New York Times in the Vietnam War. For historians in both Great Britain and the United States, there should be something eerily familiar in this controversy. Almost 300 years ago, the foundations for American protections of the free press were laid in the trial of John Peter Zenger. The case has striking similarities to the pending prosecution of the Wikileaks founder. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London In the case, the recently installed British governor William Cosby was the subject of an anonymous pamphlet that detailed his many abusive and corrupt practices in New York and New Jersey, from stealing Indian lands to pilfering the Treasury to rigging elections. Cosby ordered four editions of the Zenger's New York Weekly Journal publicly burned and arrested Zenger. He then installed a biased judge who held Zenger's defence lawyer in contempt. Despite using every means to punish Zenger for what Cosby called ""scandalous, virulent, false and seditious reflections"", the colonial jurors balked and acquitted him. The trial of Peter Zenger in New York in 1734 in which the printer was accused of libel It was the defining moment for the colonies and ultimately led to far stronger protections of journalists in the United States than in Britain, as embodied in the first amendment to the US constitution declaring that ""Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom... of the press."" Much has changed in the United States for the press, but perhaps not as much as we claim. The Justice Department crafted the charge to evade the constitutional concerns over the prosecution - and the unresolved status of Assange. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga By alleging that Assange was given a password and helped set up a cloud for Manning to share the data, the government is charging him not with the distribution of the material but actively participating in its theft. However, the unsealed indictment in Alexandria, Virginia, is remarkably thin on evidence that Assange played such an active role or used the password in question. Setting up a cloud for sharing information can easily be viewed as simply facilitating the anonymous disclosure from a source. Where reporters once arranged for drop spots, there are now digital equivalents for such exchanges. Assange gave a thumbs-up as he was taken to a London courthouse Rather than exploring reasons and effort to reveal controversial intelligence operations, Assange could be forced to confine his defence to the more mundane charge of ""computer intrusion"". Yet, the indictment is conspicuously thin on the evidence of that role. The government alleges that Manning gave ""a portion"" of a password ""to crack"" which ""was stored as a 'hash value' in a computer file that was accessible only by users with administrative-level privileges"". However, the government then says not that Assange arranged to crack the code but only that ""cracking the password would have allowed Manning to log onto the computers under a username that did not belong to her"". Such a measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source of disclosures of classified information. A van supporting Manning and Assange seen in London last week. Assange is likely to face more charges once he is in the United States. A superseding indictment might encompass the role Wikileaks played in publishing emails stolen from the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their part in the hack and alluded to Wikileaks in those indictments, although not by name. However, thus far, no Americans have been indicted for any alleged conspiracy with the Russians and, putting aside the narrative, Assange is so far being prosecuted for the same type of conduct as people messing with Netflix passwords. But for now, the US only wants to show under extradition laws that there is a reasonable basis for believing that Assange committed a crime in the United States. The government also wants to avoid any criminal charge that could result in the death penalty. Nevertheless, the Justice Department is likely to do what the British government failed to do with Zenger. It will focus its charges on insular acts like sharing passwords or hacking. By doing so, the government can file a motion (what's called a motion in limine) to prevent Assange from raising his motivations or the disclosure of the secret operations. It could be declared immaterial. The jury will not hear the type of evidence that Zenger's lawyers forced into his trial. Assange would look simply like some slightly creepy-looking Australian hacker. Activists at a 2011 rally to free Manning US Attorney Tracey McCormick in Virginia could succeed if she keeps any counts focused on such technical and narrow acts. It would be like reducing the whole of Macbeth to the final scene where Macduff beheads the King, and therefore revealing nothing about his motivation or history. Reduced to Act V, Macduff simply looks like a blood-soaked regicidal maniac, rather than an avenging hero saving the country from a tyrannical leader. To paraphrase Shakespeare, Wikileaks could not be vanquished until the Great Assange came to Capitol Hill. He is now likely on his way and the trial could make the Zenger trial look like a model of transparency and accuracy.

"This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? For seven years, Julian Assange took refuge in a small office that was converted into a bedroom in Ecuador's embassy in an upmarket neighbourhood of central London, where he lived with his cat, James. It had a bed, sun lamp, computer, kitchenette, shower and treadmill. During his time there, the 47-year-old Wikileaks co-founder welcomed guests including Lady Gaga and Pamela Anderson and, from a tiny balcony, addressed supporters and held news conferences. But, apparently, not everyone was happy. Relations between him and Ecuador's government worsened after President LenÃ­n Moreno took office in 2017. This became evident last year when Assange was given a set of house rules, including paying for internet use, food and laundry, taking better care of his cat and keeping the bathroom clean. That fuelled speculation that Ecuador had finally had enough. On Thursday,President Moreno said Ecuador's patience had ""reached its limit"",externalwith Assange's ""discourteous and aggressive behaviour"". Accusing him of ""repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols"", he announced on Twitter the abrupt end of Assange's diplomatic asylum. More details emerged later, when Foreign Minister JosÃ© Valencia told Congress that Assange had been using a mobile phone not registered with the embassy, repeatedly insulted the mission's workers - reportedly calling them US spies - and damaged the facilities by riding his skateboard and playing football, despite being told not to do so. Cleaning staff, Mr Valencia said, had described ""improper hygienic conduct"" throughout Assange's stay, an issue that a lawyer had attributed to ""stomach problems"". One unnamed senior Ecuadorean official told AP news agency that other issues included ""weeks without a shower"" and a ""dental problem born of poor hygiene"". Profile: Julian Assange How likely is a conviction in US? Interior Minister MarÃ­a Paula Romo then complained that Assange had been allowed to do things like ""put faeces on the walls of the embassy and other behaviours of that nature"". Vaughan Smith, a friend who visited Assange last week, told Reuters that he rejected this claim. ""Julian has been under stress but seemed in a balanced frame of mind every time I have seen him. It doesn't seem in character."" Mr Valencia added that the decision was taken to prevent a further deterioration of Assange's health, without giving details. Quoting an unnamed friend, the New York Times saidAssange had become deeply depressed,externaland that diplomats - many of them recently appointed by the Moreno administration - were tired of his behaviour. President Moreno, who ordered Assange to cut back his online activity soon after taking office, also said Assange had ""violated the norm of not intervening in the internal affairs of other states"", most recently in January 2019 when Wikileaks released documents from the Vatican. He said that, and other cases, confirmed suspicions that Assange was still linked to Wikileaks. The president also accused Assange of having installed forbidden ""electronic and distortion equipment"" and of accessing the embassy's security files. There was also the suspicion that Wikileaks was linked to an anonymous website that said the president's brother had created an offshore company, and leaked material included private pictures of President Moreno and his family. Mr Moreno denies any wrongdoing. Mr Valencia added that, in January, Assange told Ecuador's ambassador he had installed panic buttons that he would activate if he considered his life to be in danger. It was not clear what he meant by that but British authorities who arrested him on Thursday were careful to prevent Assange from returning to his room during the operation, according to AP. The whistle-blower also allegedly played loud music - in at least one occasion this reportedly happened during office hours, disturbing staff who were working - and deliberately blocked the embassy's security cameras. Assange's stay at the embassy cost Ecuador some $6.5m (Â£5m) from 2012 to 2018, Mr Valencia said. Assange's Ecuadorean citizenship was also suspended. The Australian national had been in the Ecuadorean embassy since 2012, after seeking asylum there to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation, which he has always denied. He was given protection by then President Rafael Correa, a strong advocate of Wikileaks. Timeline of Assange's legal saga It is unclear what has happened to James.His own Instagram account has not offered any clues,,externalwith the last picture posted in 2017. Reports suggest he was given to a shelter by the Ecuadorean embassy some time ago whileItalian newspaper La Repubblica said last year Assange had himself freed him.,external Ecuador arrests man 'close' to Assange Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention seeker?

Vunipola, who was criticised for liking the post, called for people to ""live their lives how God intended"" and said ""man was made for woman to procreate"". The RFU said on Friday it intends to hold a meeting with Vunipola next week. ""Rugby is an inclusive sport, and we do not support these views,"" it said in a statement. ""We will be meeting with Billy to discuss his social media posts."" In a statement, Vunipola's club side Saracens said: ""We recognise that people have different belief systems and we expect everyone to be treated equally with respect and humility. ""As representatives and role models, Saracens players have a responsibility not only to themselves but to the club and wider society. ""Billy Vunipola's recent social media posts are inconsistent with this and we take this matter very seriously. It will be handled internally.""

"Emma Appleby with her daughter Teagan in the Netherlands Medicinal cannabis that was confiscated from the mother of a girl with severe epilepsy is to be returned. Emma Appleby was stopped at Southend Airport as she tried to bring a three-month supply of THC oil and cannabidiol (CBD) into the UK. The drugs are now ready to be collected after nine-year-old Teagan was issued a prescription by specialist doctors. The family travelled to the Netherlands after doctors in the UK refused to sign off Teagan's use of the drug. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: ""Happy to say that Teagan Appleby's cannabis-based medicine... is ready to be collected. ""We are working hard across government to ensure we get these medicines to those who need them."" Mrs Appleby, from Aylesham, Kent, said it was ""really good news"" and she would collect the drugs in London tomorrow. She hopes it will give her daughter a ""new lease of life"". Teagan has a rare chromosomal disorder called Isodicentric 15, as well as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which causes her to experience up to 300 seizures a day. Doctors have been able toissue prescriptions for medicinal cannabis since 2018, but Teagan was not given one. Mrs Appleby used money raised through crowdfunding to visit a pharmacy in The Hague, Netherlands. She said that it was ""wrong that it's taken me to do this to get it"" and vowed to continue ""fighting"" for other parents whose children are awaiting prescriptions for medicinal cannabis.

"Prosecutors described how the cricketer ""took advantage"" of the woman Cricketer Alex Hepburn has been found guilty of rape after attacking a sleeping woman. The ex-Worcestershire player assaulted the victim at his Worcester flat after she had consensual sex with his then teammate Joe Clarke on 1 April 2017. Prosecutors at Worcester Crown Court said Hepburn ""dehumanised"" women, rating them in text messages. Hepburn, 23, who was cleared of another count of rape, will be sentenced at Hereford Crown Court on 30 April. Jurors deliberated for 10 hours and 53 minutes before delivering a unanimous verdict of guilty on one count of oral rape. Hepburn sighed and then slumped into his seat, covered his face with his hands and sobbed after the verdict was returned by the foreman. Bailing Hepburn, Judge Jim Tindal said: ""There is only one sentence that can properly be handed down in this case, and a custodial sentence is inevitable."" Latest news from the West Midlands Prosecutors described how the cricketer""took advantage"" of the woman. She woke up and wrongly believed she was having sex with Mr Clarke, before realising it was actually Hepburn, jurors heard. The jury was shown a video interview in which the complainant said she woke to find a man who she thought was Mr Clarke straddling her. She told police that after 10 minutes of sexual activity with Hepburn, he spoke in a ""thick"" Australian accent and she realised he was not Mr Clarke. Giving evidence during his retrial, Hepburn said: ""She was engaging in the act so I presumed she was enjoying it."" Jurors were told Mr Clarke left his bedroom to be sick in a bathroom, where he passed out, leaving the woman asleep on a mattress in his room. Asked when the woman is alleged to have realised she was not with Mr Clarke, Mr Hepburn added: ""She said 'what are you doing?' ""I was confused. It was no different to a normal sexual encounter."" On Wednesday, Hepburn admitted he had sent""disgusting, horrible and embarrassing""WhatsApp messages while setting the rules of a sexual conquest competition. He also admitted the conquest ""game"" led to him sleeping with 20 women during a similar competition in 2016. Prosecutor Ms Miranda Moore QC said earlier in the retrial: ""A sleeping girl cannot consent. She would not have countenanced sexual activity with Hepburn. ""He would have known she was with his mate. She was in Joe's bed, not his. On the evidence, his bed was empty."" Worcestershire County Cricket Club (WCCC) said it was ""appalled"" by the details in the case, while the the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) said the case served as a ""stark reminder"" of the standards it expects. Det Chief Insp Ian Wall of West Mercia Police said: ""We welcome the conviction and I hope it will offer some comfort to the victim, who has shown great courage and strength in coming forward. ""At the time of the offence Hepburn was in a position of trust and power as a professional sportsman...and I hope this conviction will provide reassurance to other victims of sexual offences.""

"This video can not be played Trump: 'We'll send illegals to sanctuary cities' President Donald Trump has acknowledged planning to free immigration detainees in Democratic urban strongholds as a political retaliation ploy. The Republican president tweeted that his antagonists should be ""very happy"" about the idea given their ""open borders, open arms policy"". He said he was targeting so-called sanctuary cities, which have policies to aid undocumented immigrants. But there was scepticism on the left and right about Mr Trump's idea. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump tweeted on Friday: ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only."" The president's declaration undercut his own White House, which had denied in a statement that the plan was still being considered. Mr Trump's comments followed reports in US media that he had wanted the Department of Homeland Security to release detained migrants in sanctuary cities. The White House had asked agencies last November and again in February this year whether Central American immigrants detained in the US could be sent to ""small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities"",the Washington Post first reported,external. This video can not be played Sanctuary cities under threat by Donald Trump Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had reportedly rebuffed the idea, citing budget and liability issues. The agency also expressed concern over how the public might view the move, according to emails viewed by the Post. On Thursday, the White House said in a statement to the Post that the idea was ""just a suggestion that was floated and rejected"". The most powerful elected Democrat, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, railed against the plan as un-presidential. US immigration officials detained an undocumented man in Brooklyn, New York City She told reporters on Friday: ""It's just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful of the challenges that we face as a country, as a people, to address who we are: a nation of immigrants."" Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions - such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago - that have municipal policies to limit their co-operation with federal immigration enforcement. Chicago's outgoing Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement: ""What President Trump fails to understand is that America is a sanctuary country."" San Francisco Mayor London Breed poured scorn on the idea. What is a US sanctuary city? ""Like so many issues we are forced to talk about during this presidency,"" she said, ""this isn't a real idea or a real proposal, it's just another scare tactic."" A vocal hardline conservative on immigration was also doubtful the plan would ever become a reality. Ann Coulter tweeted: ""What is the one thing we know will NOT happen at any time in the future? ""Answer: The Trump administration will place Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities Only."" This video can not be played Where do America's undocumented immigrants live? Mr Trump has previously ordered federal funding to be withheld from sanctuary cities, but that plan was torpedoed by a federal judge in California in August last year. He has amplified his criticism of illegal immigration since Congress denied funding for his long-promised border wall earlier this year. The president - who often depicts those crossing the US-Mexico border without papers as criminals - recently retreated from a threat to close the international boundary. Meanwhile, his plan to make asylum applications more difficult was thwarted by a federal judge only this week.

"Pregnancy club Bounty UK has been givena Â£400,000 fine for illegally sharing,externalthe personal information of more than 14 million people. The fine was issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in what it said was an ""unprecedented"" case. Bounty compiled personal data but did not tell people that it was shared with 39 other organisations, said the ICO. Bounty said it ""acknowledged"" the ICO's findings and had now made changes to how it handled member data. The Bounty pregnancy and parenting club offers free samples, vouchers and guides to prospective and new parents via packs given out in hospitals or sent to people who use its apps. Bounty gathered information from apps, its website, cards in merchandise packs and from new mothers in hospital. The ICO said that while many knew Bounty as a pregnancy club, few knew that it was also a data broker supplying information to third parties that would use it to fine-tune direct marketing. Bounty breached the 1998 Data Protection Act by not being ""open and transparent"" with people about what would be done with their personal data. Bounty took data in hospitals and from apps and merchandise packs It shared 34.3 million records from June 2017 to April 2018 with 39 organisations including marketing agencies Acxiom, Equifax and Indicia. The data shared was of ""potentially vulnerable"" people including new mothers and very young children, said the ICO. ""The number of personal records and people affected in this case is unprecedented in the history of the ICO's investigations into the data broking industry and organisations linked to this,"" said Steve Eckersley, the watchdog's director of investigations. Mr Eckersley said the ""careless"" data-sharing was likely to have caused distress to many people because they did not know it was being shared so widely. Jim Kelleher, Bounty's managing director, said: ""In the past, we did not take a broad enough view of our responsibilities and as a result our data-sharing processes, specifically with regards to transparency, were not robust enough."" He added that the ICO had recognised that Bounty had changed its data-handling policies and that it now kept fewer records for less time. It had also ended relationships with all data brokers. Staff had also been trained to handle data to comply with the latest legislation. In addition, said Mr Kelleher, Bounty planned to appoint an independent data expert to carry out an annual survey to ensure it did not breach data protection laws.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond at the IMF/World Bank spring meetings It is time to get Brexit ""off the table"" so that Britain can focus on other issues, the chancellor has said. Philip Hammond told the BBC that getting a deal done soon would release the ""bandwidth"" needed to take key economic decisions facing the country. He called the UK's involvement in May's European elections ""pointless"" and hoped a deal would be done before then. Mr Hammond was speaking in Washington, where he is attending World Bank and IMF meetings. The chancellor said talking to the Labour Party about finding a way forward to resolve the Parliamentary impasse was not his ""preferred route"". But it offered a new way forward to achieve a Brexit deal, after which he could concentrate on issues such spending and ""where our economy is going over the next few years"". ""I would like us to spend more of our bandwidth focused on growing our economy,"" he told the BBC's economics correspondent Dharshini David. ""Until a deal is done we cannot make decisions about the spending review."" How new Brexit delay has hit four firms Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' If a deal on leaving the EU cannot be agreed by the end of May, the UK is committed to fighting the European elections. ""Clearly nobody wants to fight the European elections. It feels like a pointless exercise, and the only way we can avoid that is by getting a deal agreed and done quickly. ""If we can do that by 22 May, we can avoid fighting the European parliamentary elections. ""In any case, we want to ensure any British MEPs that are elected never have to take their seats in the European Parliament by ensuring this is all done well before the new European Parliament convenes,"" he said. The chancellor is in Washington at the World Bank and IMF spring meetings. He rejected suggestions that the handling of Brexit negotiations was being seen overseas as a national humiliation. ""Britain is known as a bastion of democracy, and how we manage a challenging and complex issue like this is of huge interest,"" he said.

"Michael Gove and John McDonnell have been involved in the talks The government and Labour have held further talks aimed at breaking the deadlock in Parliament over Brexit. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said discussions with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove had been ""positive"" and ""constructive"". He added that a timetable was being worked out for more meetings over the next seven to 10 days. EU leaders have agreed to delay the UK's departure date from 12 April to 31 October, to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK can still leave before 22 May, if Parliament backs the withdrawal agreement she reached with the EU. This would avoid the UK having to take part in European Parliament elections, currently scheduled for 23 May. Analysis: Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Theresa May defends 31 October delay Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party What happens next? The UK was originally due to leave the EU on 29 March, but its departure date has been delayed twice, after the Commons rejected the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU by large margins. The meeting between Mr McDonnell, members of Jeremy Corbyn's staff and Mr Gove and Mr Lidington lasted just over an hour. Asked if the government had moved on its ""red lines"", Mr McDonnell told reporters: ""I'm not going into the detail of it. ""We are trying to be as constructive as we possibly can on all sides... but we will see by the end of next week how far we have got."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson has been told that the Conservative and Labour delegations have discussed some of the fine detail of the potential changes to the ""political declaration"" - the non-legally binding part of the Brexit deal, which sets out a blueprint for future relations between the EU and UK. But he said the two sides were still some way apart on customs arrangements. Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods. The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU's customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. How UK is gearing up for European elections How do European elections work? Under EU rules, the UK will have to hold European Parliament elections in May, or face leaving on 1 June without a deal. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Clearly nobody wants to fight the European elections. ""It feels like a pointless exercise and the only way we can avoid that is by getting a deal agreed and done quickly, and if we can do that by 22 May, we can avoid fighting the European parliamentary elections. ""In any case we want to ensure any British MEPs that are elected never have to take their seats in the European Parliament by ensuring this is all done well before the new European Parliament convenes."" Meanwhile, the government says it will ""continue to make all necessary preparations"" for a no-deal Brexit. A government source said ""plans will evolve and adapt"", but would not stop while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remained. The source said that a leaked message which reportedly referred to the ""winding down"" of no-deal preparation related only to Operation Yellowhammer - the contingency planning programme based on worst-case scenarios - and not no-deal planning in general. But the government has confirmed it is stopping Operation Brock -the contraflow put on the London-bound carriageway of the M20 in Kent,external- ""in light of the reduced threat of disruption to services across the English Channel in the coming weeks"".

"This video can not be played Sudanese women reject 'regime coup' Sudan's military coup leaders have warned protesters still on the streets that there will be ""zero tolerance"" for disturbances. A spokesman insisted the army did not seek power and Sudan's future would be decided by the protesters - but said the army would maintain public order. Protesters are still out in Khartoum, fearing the coup leaders are too close to ousted ruler Omar al-Bashir. The military says it will not extradite Mr Bashir on war crimes charges. Mr Bashir is the subject of two international arrest warrants,externalissued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). He is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's Darfur region between 2003 and 2008, allegations he denies. However, he may be put on trial inside Sudan, according to the military council set up after the coup. Africa Live: Latest updates amid turmoil Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Mr Bashir, one of the world's longest-serving leaders until he was ousted on Thursday, is now in custody. His downfall followed months of unrest that began in December over rising prices. At least 38 people have died in the protests. The army has said it will oversee a transitional period followed by elections. As part of this, it is imposing a three-month state of emergency, with the constitution suspended. The military council will be in place for a maximum of two years, it says, but could last only a month if the transition to civilian rule is managed smoothly. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? Lt-Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin, who heads the military council's political committee, said on Friday: ""The solutions will be devised by those in protest. ""You, the people, will provide the solutions for all economic and political issues. We have come with no ideology, we have come here to maintain order and security to provide the opportunity for the people of Sudan to achieve the change they aspire to. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Sudanese women reject 'regime coup' Sudan's military coup leaders have warned protesters still on the streets that there will be ""zero tolerance"" for disturbances. A spokesman insisted the army did not seek power and Sudan's future would be decided by the protesters - but said the army would maintain public order. Protesters are still out in Khartoum, fearing the coup leaders are too close to ousted ruler Omar al-Bashir. The military says it will not extradite Mr Bashir on war crimes charges. Mr Bashir is the subject of two international arrest warrants,externalissued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). He is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's Darfur region between 2003 and 2008, allegations he denies. However, he may be put on trial inside Sudan, according to the military council set up after the coup. Africa Live: Latest updates amid turmoil Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Mr Bashir, one of the world's longest-serving leaders until he was ousted on Thursday, is now in custody. His downfall followed months of unrest that began in December over rising prices. At least 38 people have died in the protests. The army has said it will oversee a transitional period followed by elections. As part of this, it is imposing a three-month state of emergency, with the constitution suspended. The military council will be in place for a maximum of two years, it says, but could last only a month if the transition to civilian rule is managed smoothly. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? Lt-Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin, who heads the military council's political committee, said on Friday: ""The solutions will be devised by those in protest. ""You, the people, will provide the solutions for all economic and political issues. We have come with no ideology, we have come here to maintain order and security to provide the opportunity for the people of Sudan to achieve the change they aspire to. Allow Twitter content?

"Boris Johnson was wrong to claim there was polling evidence that a no-deal Brexit was the public's preferred option, the press regulator has ruled. Ipso ordered the Daily Telegraph to print a correction after finding the MP's column was inaccurate. The claim was made in a piece headlined ""The British people won't be scared into backing a woeful Brexit deal nobody voted for"" in January. The Telegraph had argued it was ""clearly comically polemical"". The column,externalappeared a week before MPsrejected Theresa May's Brexit deal for the first time, by a historic margin. The Commons went on to reject the withdrawal agreement in a further two votes. Brexit: What happens now? Brexit jargon explained In his piece, prominent Brexiteer Mr Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary over Mrs May's Brexit strategy last July, wrote:  ""Of all the options suggested by pollsters - staying in the EU, coming out on Theresa May's terms, or coming out on World Trade terms - it is the last, the so-called no-deal option, that is gaining in popularity. ""In spite of - or perhaps because of - everything they have been told, it is this future that is by some margin preferred by the British public."" According to Ipso, the newspaper argued that it was clearly an opinion piece and readers would understand that it was not invoking specific polling - and that the Conservative MP's column was ""clearly comically polemical"" and would not be read as a ""serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters"". And it argued that various combinations of results in four polls reflected support for a no-deal scenario over Theresa May's deal or remaining in the EU. But following a complaint that it was inaccurate,Ipso said,externalthe article, published on 7 January, failed to provide accurate information with ""a basis in fact"" and ordered a correction to be printed. In its ruling, Ipso said that while columnists were free to use ""hyperbole, melodrama and humour"", they must take care ""over the accuracy of any claims of fact"". It said the Telegraph had not provided data to back up the claims and had ""construed the polls as signalling support for a no deal, when in fact, this was the result of the publication either amalgamating several findings together or interpreting an option beyond what was set out by the poll, as being a finding in support of a no-deal Brexit"". It found it was a ""significant inaccuracy, because it misrepresented polling information"" and upheld a complaint that it had breached clause 1 of the Editors' Code of Practice.

"The court was told Atkinson had failed to come to terms with their relationship ending A man who repeatedly stabbed his former girlfriend in a jealous rage as she tried to fight him off has been jailed for life for her murder. Joe Atkinson attacked 24-year-old Poppy Devey Waterhouse with a kitchen knife at the flat they shared in Leeds. Described as a ""prodigiously gifted mathematician"", she had more than 100 injuries, Leeds Crown Court was told. Atkinson, 25, who admitted murder, was told he will serve a minimum of 15 years and 310 days. In a victim impact statement, her mother Julie Devey said: ""I kept stroking my hands across the floorboards where she had been left screaming and dying. ""I just wanted to scoop her up and save her."" She added: ""I now live my life with a split screen. One half I can see the now, and on the other half that horrific scene."" Poppy Devey Waterhouse worked as an analyst for William Hill Describing the impact of her death, Miss Devey Waterhouse's father Rupert Waterhouse told the court that his daughter and son were the two ""greatest gifts"" of his life. He added: ""How can a picture of my daughter, smiling at me with her brown eyes, hurt me so deeply? ""This is my life sentence. Ours is a family of four minus one."" Latest news and stories from Yorkshire The court was told the pair, who met at Nottingham University, had been together for three years but by late 2018 they had broken up at the request of Miss Devey Waterhouse, who was originally from Frome in Somerset. Both were seeing other people but prosecutors said Atkinson had failed to come to terms with the separation. While Atkinson was on a Christmas night out with colleagues on 13 December, maths graduate Miss Devey Waterhouse remained at the flat they still shared on The Avenue, chatting to her new boyfriend on the telephone. The court was told how, in the early hours of 14 December, Atkinson returned to the flat and attacked her. Forensic evidence showed Miss Devey Waterhouse tried to fight him off, but collapsed in the hallway. She had suffered about 70 knife injuries all over her body. Afterwards, Atkinson attempted to clean the scene and dispose of his clothes, only contacting the emergency services hours later. Jason Pitter, prosecuting, said: ""Poppy Devey Waterhouse was a prodigiously talented mathematician - who was described as brilliant and beautiful - who, at the age of 24, had her whole life ahead of her. ""It was a life cruelly taken away from her just before Christmas last year, because this defendant realised he was not going to be a part of this future."" Det Supt Nicola Bryar, of West Yorkshire Police, said Atkinson's claim that the killing had been self-defence had soon unravelled. ""We established that he had spent some significant time disposing of evidence and attempting to alter the crime scene over the hours before the ambulance service and police were called to the flat. ""He has never explained why he did what he did, but he will now have a significant period of time in prison to reflect on what he has done and the hurt that has caused to so many people who knew and loved Poppy.""

"Andrew Fisher (centre) accompanied Mr McDonnell to the talks Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May's Brexit deal. So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement? Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from ""constructive"" and ""serious"" to the slightly more negative: ""We have some way to travel."" Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible. There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month's European elections. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Theresa May defends new Brexit delay Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't want to give a platform toparties such as Nigel Farage's new projectwhich could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives. And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote. For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign. So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant. Michael Gove is one of the Conservatives taking part in negotiations The Labour leader's policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday. But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain. Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed. But sequencing is a problem. Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader. Broadly speaking, the government would rather do ""the easy bit"" first - discussing legislation to protect  workers' rights. Resolving this tension is key to a deal. Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union. It is flexible on what it would be called - an ""arrangement"", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this. But they are not yet close enough. The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side. But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn's parties, rather than their negotiators. Many Labour members want another referendum if agreement is reached If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers. For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal. So far, the prime minister isn't budging on this. One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall. But some of the Labour leader's shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal. So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time. I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package. If, in the end, these difficulties can't be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.

"UKIP topped the polls in 2014 but a lot has changed since then The UK's political parties are gearing up to fight elections to the European Parliament in six weeks' time. The planning needed to stage the polls on 23 May is under way, even though Theresa May still hopes the UK will have left the EU by then and they won't need to happen. As recently as the end of March, the prime minister said the public would find it ""unacceptable"" to have to elect a new group of 72 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU. But things have changed since then. Under terms agreed with EU leaders in Brussels, the UK has been given a Brexit extension until 31 October. Change UK approved for European elections UK MEPs could sit for 'months or longer' The UK ""must hold the elections to the European Parliament"" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June without a deal. Given the political backdrop, they could turn out to be the most controversial and unpredictable European elections in UK history. In short, in something of a hurry. The parties have to submit the names of the candidates representing them to the elections watchdog by 25 April or, in the case of the South West region, 24 hours earlier. MEPs are elected on a regional list basis, representing Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and nine English regions, using a system of proportional representation. If you want to know more about the European Parliament, the UK electoral process and the cost of staging the elections,read our Reality Check guide. While many Brexiteers are angry about the UK having to participate at all, believing it is a waste of time and money, the likelihood of any kind of boycott seems remote. Many now regard the poll as a proxy referendum on Brexit and the UK's future in the EU. UKIP, whose party topped the 2014 poll, has launched a crowdfunding campaignand announced its slate of two leading candidates in each of the regions,external. The leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament has said he will stand again Given the lack of time, the selection process is likely to be more truncated than usual. Labour is giving its existing MEPs preferential treatment by guaranteeing them spots at the top of each regional candidate list. As it stands, 16 of the 20 Labour MEPs elected in 2014 have applied to stand. Would-be Conservative candidates had until Tuesday 9 April to put themselves forward. The Conservative Home website,externalsaid it was very unlikely all 18 incumbents would try again as many have been planning for life after Brexit. It queried whether the party would be able to fill all 70 spots on its respective lists with ""candidates' WhatsApp groups full of jokes about the futility of taking part"". The current leader of the Conservative group in the European Parliament, Ashley Fox, has confirmed he will be taking part and joked about the likely reception he could get on the doorsteps.

The estimated cost of taking part in European Parliamentary elections has been given as up to Â£109m. This is based on thecost in 2014 which was Â£108.7m,external. The political landscape was very different the last time the European elections were held in 2014. The Conservatives and Lib Dems were governing in coalition and even though David Cameron had signalled his desire to hold an EU referendum if he won an overall majority, the prospect still seemed far off. But, with hindsight, the result could be seen to have been harbinger of things to come as UKIP topped the polls for the first ever time, winning nearly 27% of the vote and 24 seats. The party made its first proper electoral breakthrough a decade earlier when it won 15% of the vote and 12 seats in 2004's polls. European elections have historically been more fertile territory for anti-establishment parties, which have struggled to translate votes into seats in general elections because of the first-past-the-post system. The Conservatives and Labour are understandably nervous that this trend will continue if the polls go ahead. Same message, different party: Nigel Farage is heading the new Brexit Party after leaving UKIP For the past 20 years, UKIP has been the insurgent party in British politics but now it is facing a challenge from its former leader Nigel Farage, who has launched a rival outfit called the Brexit Party. Mr Farage, who will be standing as a candidate in the South East region, has vowed to ""teach the establishment a lesson"". The party,which has launched its campaign, is positioning itself as the real alternative to the Conservatives and Labour which it says have betrayed the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen is leading The Independent Group into the elections There is little love lost between Mr Farage and Mr Batten after the latter appointed anti-Islam campaigner Tommy Robinson as an adviser. There are reports the ex-English Defence League leader could play some kind of role in UKIP's campaign. Eurosceptic voters are likely to have a plethora of choice in May's polls, with other parties set to stand including Our Nation, an entity formed last year by the short-lived UKIP leader Henry Bolton. The prospect of a possible realignment is not confined to the right of British politics. The breakaway Independent Group of former Labour and Tory MPs say they will be fielding a substantial number of candidates after their application to become a political party was accepted by the Electoral Commission. They will fight the election as Change UK - The Independent Group, on a platform of seeking another referendum on the terms of Brexit, with the option to remain. Interim leader, ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen, has said the poll is a ""real opportunity"" to build a new political movement, suggesting the public is crying out ""for someone to lead and say we can just stay"". How long any UK MEPs get to stay in Brussels and Strasbourg is anyone's guess at this stage. The new European Parliament is set to reassemble in early July, and the Brexit extension is due to run up to 31 October. It is no longer beyond the realms of possibility that UK politicians and their staff, who only recently were contemplating a future outside the European Parliament, will find themselves there.

"The European Union (EU) has agreed a Brexit delay until the end of October and preparations have started to take part in the European elections on 23 May. Prime Minister Theresa May says if a deal gets through Parliament before that date, the UK will not participate. But it seems likely that the UK will still be in the EU at that point. The European Parliament is directly elected by EU voters. It is responsible, along with the Council of Ministers from member states, for making laws (proposed by the European Commission) and approving budgets. It also plays a role in the EU's relations with other countries, including those wishing to join the bloc. Its members represent the interests of different countries and different regions within the EU. Every five years, EU countries go to the polls to elect members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Each country is allocated a set number of seats, roughly depending on the size of its population. The smallest, Malta (population: around half a million) has six members sitting in the European Parliament while the largest, Germany (population: 82 million) has 96. At the moment there are 751 MEPs in total and the UK has 73. How can Article 50 be extended? Has anything changed in the Brexit deal? Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? Candidates can stand as individuals or they can stand as representatives of one of the UK's political parties. Once elected, they represent different regions of the country, again according to population. The north-east of England and Northern Ireland have three MEPs each while the south-east of England, including London, has 18. While most UK MEPs are also members of a national party, once in the European Parliament they sit in one of eight political groups which include MEPs from across the EU who share the same political affiliation. Member states can run elections to the European Parliament according to their own national laws and traditions, but they must stick to some common rules. MEPs must be elected using a system of proportional representation - so, for example, a party which gains a third of the votes wins a third of the seats. Turnout in the UK for European Parliament elections is low both by EU standards and by the standards of other UK elections. The last time they were held in 2014, 36% of those eligible to vote did so, compared with 43% in the EU as a whole. That compares with 66% turnout at the following year's general election. In 2016, 56% of the electorate voted in the Scottish Parliament elections, 45% in the Welsh Assembly and 54% in the Northern Ireland Assembly. In local elections in England, turnout varies depending largely on what other elections are taking place on the same day, sometimes dipping as low as the European elections turnout and sometimes rising close to the level of general elections. The last time European elections were held in 2014, the UK spent Â£109m on them. The main costs were running the poll itself (securing polling stations and venues to run counts) and mailing out candidate information and polling cards. The government has said that if the UK does not end up participating in the 2019 elections, it will reimburse local returning officers - the people responsible for running elections - for any expenses already paid. The EU is planning to reduce the overall number of seats in the parliament from 751 to 705 when the UK leaves. There will be a reallocation of 27 of the UK's seats to 14 other member states that are currently underrepresented. And the rest will be set aside with the possibility of being allocated to any new member states that join in the future. The EU has already passed legislation to do this, but it does not take effect until the UK leaves. The number of seats is capped in law at 751. The European Commission had advised that as long as the UK made a decision to take part in the European elections by mid-April, this reallocation would be reversed. But what if the UK elects MEPs and then passes a deal to leave the EU? In that case, the UK MEPs would not take their seats, leaving vacancies. The House of Commons Library says that extra MEPs could potentially be elected on ""stand-by"" in some member states but not take up their seats until the UK leaves the EU.

"Andrew Fisher (centre) accompanied Mr McDonnell to the talks Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May's Brexit deal. So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement? Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from ""constructive"" and ""serious"" to the slightly more negative: ""We have some way to travel."" Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible. There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month's European elections. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Theresa May defends new Brexit delay Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't want to give a platform toparties such as Nigel Farage's new projectwhich could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives. And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote. For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign. So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant. Michael Gove is one of the Conservatives taking part in negotiations The Labour leader's policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday. But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain. Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed. But sequencing is a problem. Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader. Broadly speaking, the government would rather do ""the easy bit"" first - discussing legislation to protect  workers' rights. Resolving this tension is key to a deal. Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union. It is flexible on what it would be called - an ""arrangement"", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this. But they are not yet close enough. The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side. But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn's parties, rather than their negotiators. Many Labour members want another referendum if agreement is reached If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers. For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal. So far, the prime minister isn't budging on this. One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall. But some of the Labour leader's shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal. So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time. I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package. If, in the end, these difficulties can't be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.

The current leader of the Conservative group in the European Parliament, Ashley Fox, has confirmed he will be taking part and joked about the likely reception he could get on the doorsteps.

The estimated cost of taking part in European Parliamentary elections has been given as up to Â£109m. This is based on thecost in 2014 which was Â£108.7m,external. The political landscape was very different the last time the European elections were held in 2014. The Conservatives and Lib Dems were governing in coalition and even though David Cameron had signalled his desire to hold an EU referendum if he won an overall majority, the prospect still seemed far off. But, with hindsight, the result could be seen to have been harbinger of things to come as UKIP topped the polls for the first ever time, winning nearly 27% of the vote and 24 seats. The party made its first proper electoral breakthrough a decade earlier when it won 15% of the vote and 12 seats in 2004's polls. European elections have historically been more fertile territory for anti-establishment parties, which have struggled to translate votes into seats in general elections because of the first-past-the-post system. The Conservatives and Labour are understandably nervous that this trend will continue if the polls go ahead. Same message, different party: Nigel Farage is heading the new Brexit Party after leaving UKIP For the past 20 years, UKIP has been the insurgent party in British politics but now it is facing a challenge from its former leader Nigel Farage, who has launched a rival outfit called the Brexit Party. Mr Farage, who will be standing as a candidate in the South East region, has vowed to ""teach the establishment a lesson"". The party,which has launched its campaign, is positioning itself as the real alternative to the Conservatives and Labour which it says have betrayed the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen is leading The Independent Group into the elections There is little love lost between Mr Farage and Mr Batten after the latter appointed anti-Islam campaigner Tommy Robinson as an adviser. There are reports the ex-English Defence League leader could play some kind of role in UKIP's campaign. Eurosceptic voters are likely to have a plethora of choice in May's polls, with other parties set to stand including Our Nation, an entity formed last year by the short-lived UKIP leader Henry Bolton. The prospect of a possible realignment is not confined to the right of British politics. The breakaway Independent Group of former Labour and Tory MPs say they will be fielding a substantial number of candidates after their application to become a political party was accepted by the Electoral Commission. They will fight the election as Change UK - The Independent Group, on a platform of seeking another referendum on the terms of Brexit, with the option to remain. Interim leader, ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen, has said the poll is a ""real opportunity"" to build a new political movement, suggesting the public is crying out ""for someone to lead and say we can just stay"". How long any UK MEPs get to stay in Brussels and Strasbourg is anyone's guess at this stage. The new European Parliament is set to reassemble in early July, and the Brexit extension is due to run up to 31 October. It is no longer beyond the realms of possibility that UK politicians and their staff, who only recently were contemplating a future outside the European Parliament, will find themselves there.

"Prosecutors described how the cricketer ""took advantage"" of the woman Cricketer Alex Hepburn has been found guilty of rape after attacking a sleeping woman. The ex-Worcestershire player assaulted the victim at his Worcester flat after she had consensual sex with his then teammate Joe Clarke on 1 April 2017. Prosecutors at Worcester Crown Court said Hepburn ""dehumanised"" women, rating them in text messages. Hepburn, 23, who was cleared of another count of rape, will be sentenced at Hereford Crown Court on 30 April. Jurors deliberated for 10 hours and 53 minutes before delivering a unanimous verdict of guilty on one count of oral rape. Hepburn sighed and then slumped into his seat, covered his face with his hands and sobbed after the verdict was returned by the foreman. Bailing Hepburn, Judge Jim Tindal said: ""There is only one sentence that can properly be handed down in this case, and a custodial sentence is inevitable."" Latest news from the West Midlands Prosecutors described how the cricketer""took advantage"" of the woman. She woke up and wrongly believed she was having sex with Mr Clarke, before realising it was actually Hepburn, jurors heard. The jury was shown a video interview in which the complainant said she woke to find a man who she thought was Mr Clarke straddling her. She told police that after 10 minutes of sexual activity with Hepburn, he spoke in a ""thick"" Australian accent and she realised he was not Mr Clarke. Giving evidence during his retrial, Hepburn said: ""She was engaging in the act so I presumed she was enjoying it."" Jurors were told Mr Clarke left his bedroom to be sick in a bathroom, where he passed out, leaving the woman asleep on a mattress in his room. Asked when the woman is alleged to have realised she was not with Mr Clarke, Mr Hepburn added: ""She said 'what are you doing?' ""I was confused. It was no different to a normal sexual encounter."" On Wednesday, Hepburn admitted he had sent""disgusting, horrible and embarrassing""WhatsApp messages while setting the rules of a sexual conquest competition. He also admitted the conquest ""game"" led to him sleeping with 20 women during a similar competition in 2016. Prosecutor Ms Miranda Moore QC said earlier in the retrial: ""A sleeping girl cannot consent. She would not have countenanced sexual activity with Hepburn. ""He would have known she was with his mate. She was in Joe's bed, not his. On the evidence, his bed was empty.""

"Laleh Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai when she arrived with her teenage daughter Paris for her ex-husband's funeral A British woman who faced prison in Dubai over a jibe she posted on Facebook has embraced her daughter after landing back in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, had faced up to two years in jail aftercalling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"". Her case was settled with a AED3,000 (Â£625) fine on Thursday, the campaign group which represented her said. Ms Shahravesh told reporters at Heathrow airport: ""I'm really, really happy to be reunited."" Her daughter Paris, 14, had pleaded with United Arab Emirates authorities to release her mother, earlier this week. The mother-of-one, from Richmond in south-west London, also thanked Radha Stirling, the chief executive of campaigners Detained in Dubai, who she said had ""worked tirelessly to get me home to my daughter"". Ms Stirling said the incident was a ""grave warning"" to social media users over visiting Dubai, with the ""vast majority"" of similar cases going unheard. She told BBC News: ""I think without the spotlight from the international press and the raising of awareness to the UAE authorities this would have gone on for at least six months."" Ms Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai, part of the UAE, on 10 March. She had travelled there for her Portuguese ex-husband's funeral following his death from a heart attack at the age of 51. She had been married to Pedro Correia Dos Santos for 18 years. The couple lived together in Dubai for eight months - where Mr Correia Dos Santos worked for HSBC - before Ms Shahravesh returned alone to the UK with the couple's daughter. In 2016, she received divorce papers and discovered on Facebook that he was remarrying. Writing in Farsi on Facebook, Ms Shahravesh said: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse."" In another post, she wrote: ""You married a horse you idiot."" How to avoid being jailed abroad UAE 'fines' suspicious phone-check wife UAE spy-accused recovery will 'take years' Detained in Dubai said Ms Shahravesh's ex-husband's new wife, who lives in Dubai, had reported the comments. Under the UAE's cyber-crime laws, a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media.

"This video can not be played Gina Martin campaigned for the law to be changed after a man took a picture up her skirt Upskirting is now a criminal offence in England and Wales after a campaign by a woman targeted at a music festival. Offenders will face up to two years in prison for taking an image or video under somebody's clothing in order to see their genitals or underwear. Gina Martin, who led the calls for change, said she hoped the change in law would help people ""feel comfortable"" to report such crimes. It is already a specific crime in Scotland butnot in Northern Ireland. Speaking on the day the law came into effect, Ms Martin called on people to report upskirting when they see it happen. She told BBC News: ""If a new law's there, great - but if we don't know about it or aren't reporting it, [then] it doesn't do anything. ""We have to build a picture of how much this happens, because it happens a lot."" Prime Minister Theresa May described upskirting,externalas ""degrading and humiliating"" and said offenders should ""feel the full force of the law"". I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Upskirting ban 'also protects men in kilts' Ms Martin, 27, was waiting to watch The Killers perform at the British Summer Time music festival in London's Hyde Park in July 2017 when a man put his phone between her legs and took pictures. After informing the police, she was shocked to discover upskirting was not a specific offence and the case had been closed. A few days later she wrote about what had happened on Facebook. Her post went viral with other women sharing similar experiences. Soon an online petition calling for police to reopen the case had received 50,000 signatures. She alsowrote a feature for the BBC News website explaining her battle, recalling the dramatic moment she chased after the man who had taken the unwanted photo. Gina Martin could not believe upskirting was not already a criminal offence It wasn't long before the campaign was picked up by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse. Encouraged by government ministers, she brought a private members' bill backing the creation of an upskirting offence. Her bill was expected to sail through the Commons, but parliamentary rules meant it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. The bill was initially blocked by a Tory backbench MP, in a move which was widely criticised. This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill However, Ms Martin's campaign secured government backing on 15 July last year and the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill was put before Parliament days later. The new legislation was approved in the House of Lords and has now passed the formality of Royal Assent to become law. At the time, Ms Martin said: ""To the outsider, the ordinary person, law and politics are complex and daunting. But both are penetrable if you believe in yourself and find the right support."" She said the experience had been a ""steep learning curve"" in how the political system works - but that the decision was ""politics and society at its best"". By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Until now offenders could only be prosecuted for voyeurism or outraging public decency. But voyeurism only applies to filming in ""private"" while outraging public decency usually requires a witness - and upskirting often goes unobserved. So, following tireless campaigning by Gina Martin, the government has created a specific offence of upskirting where the purpose is to obtain sexual gratification, or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm. It covers culprits who say images were just taken ""for a laugh"", and paparazzi who take intrusive images. The new offences apply in instances when: Without consent, a person takes pictures beneath a person's clothing to observe their genitals or buttocks, whether covered or uncovered by underwear The offender has a motive of either gaining sexual gratification or causing humiliation, distress or alarm to the victim TheVoyeurism (Offences) Act 2019,externalalso ensures that the most serious offenders, where the purpose of the offence is for sexual gratification, are made subject to notification requirements (often referred to as being placed on the sex offenders' register). New police figures show that more people are reporting upskirting. Data obtained by the Press Association shows that the number of reported incidents rose from a total of 78 between April 2015 and April 2017 to 94 for the whole of 2018. The vast majority of cases involve female victims and male perpetrators, according to the data released by police forces under Freedom of Information laws. The police forces gave details of the incidents reported to them last year, with victims including pensioners and schoolchildren. One case involved a 70-year-old woman, Essex Police said. The same force was involved in a case where a suspect was charged with indecency after upskirt images of a child aged between seven and nine were discovered in his possession. Campaigners from a children's charity, Plan International UK, suggest that the problem could be more widespread than official figures show. The charity says its own research, which surveyed 1,004 girls in the UK aged between 14-21, found that one in 10 girls have experienced upskirting, and 52% didn't tell anyone about what happened to them. Lucy Russell, head of girls' rights and youth at the charity, said: ""The government is recognising that street harassment is not OK, which is a huge step forward. ""However, street harassment has become so normalised that girls are telling us they aren't speaking out about it because they're too embarrassed or think they won't be taken seriously."" She suggested more action should be taken at local level to encourage women to report offences. This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Before the law was passed victims and police in England and Wales were only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism. Unlike other sexual offences, victims of those crimes do not have automatic anonymity. The Ministry of Justice said the new law ""bans the degrading practice to deter perpetrators, better protect victims, and bring more offenders to justice"". Justice Minister Lucy Frazer added: ""We have always been clear - there are no excuses for this behaviour and offenders should feel the full force of the law. From today, they will. ""By taking decisive action and working closely with Gina Martin and other campaigners, we have ensured more people are protected from this degrading and humiliating practice."" In Northern Ireland, upskirting is still not a specific offence although the Department of Justice (DoJ) haslaunched a consultation on potential changes to legislation.

"The Coca Cola can was found on Cramond beach A Coca Cola can from 1988 has been found on a beach near Edinburgh by volunteers clearing up rubbish. The 31-year-old can, which features a promotion for the Seoul Olympics, was one of more than 400 items picked up at Cramond Beach. Half the litter found was made from plastic, while 100 wet wipes were also discovered, tangled in seaweed. Campaigners said the can showed the potential benefits of a deposit return scheme for drinks bottles and cans. They are also calling for clearer labelling on the wipes to stop them being flushed down the toilet. The can features a promotion for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul in South Korea The clean-up was carried out by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) and resulted in 86kg (13.5 stone) of waste being cleared from the beach. MCS Scotland Conservation Officer Catherine Gemmell, who organised the event, said wet wipe numbers were regularly high at Cramond. More than 30 volunteers took part in the clean-up at Cramond beach She added: ""One of the most startling finds was a Coca Cola can from 1988 - supporting the Olympics, held that year in Seoul, South Korea. ""This really unusual find shows that when it comes to litter there is no 'away' and we need to ensure that anything we are using today is not being picked up by volunteers in 30 or more years' time."" ""This can is the very reason that we're calling on the Scottish government to implement an 'all in' deposit return scheme for drinks bottles and cans.""

"Laleh Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai when she arrived with her teenage daughter Paris for her ex-husband's funeral A British woman who faced prison in Dubai over a jibe she posted on Facebook has embraced her daughter after landing back in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, had faced up to two years in jail aftercalling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"". Her case was settled with a AED3,000 (Â£625) fine on Thursday, the campaign group which represented her said. Ms Shahravesh told reporters at Heathrow airport: ""I'm really, really happy to be reunited."" Her daughter Paris, 14, had pleaded with United Arab Emirates authorities to release her mother, earlier this week. The mother-of-one, from Richmond in south-west London, also thanked Radha Stirling, the chief executive of campaigners Detained in Dubai, who she said had ""worked tirelessly to get me home to my daughter"". Ms Stirling said the incident was a ""grave warning"" to social media users over visiting Dubai, with the ""vast majority"" of similar cases going unheard. She told BBC News: ""I think without the spotlight from the international press and the raising of awareness to the UAE authorities this would have gone on for at least six months."" Ms Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai, part of the UAE, on 10 March. She had travelled there for her Portuguese ex-husband's funeral following his death from a heart attack at the age of 51. She had been married to Pedro Correia Dos Santos for 18 years. The couple lived together in Dubai for eight months - where Mr Correia Dos Santos worked for HSBC - before Ms Shahravesh returned alone to the UK with the couple's daughter. In 2016, she received divorce papers and discovered on Facebook that he was remarrying. Writing in Farsi on Facebook, Ms Shahravesh said: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse."" In another post, she wrote: ""You married a horse you idiot."" How to avoid being jailed abroad UAE 'fines' suspicious phone-check wife UAE spy-accused recovery will 'take years' Detained in Dubai said Ms Shahravesh's ex-husband's new wife, who lives in Dubai, had reported the comments. Under the UAE's cyber-crime laws, a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media. Detained in Dubai has called on the Foreign Office to provide more explicit guidance about the risks of travelling to the UAE. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Gina Martin campaigned for the law to be changed after a man took a picture up her skirt Upskirting is now a criminal offence in England and Wales after a campaign by a woman targeted at a music festival. Offenders will face up to two years in prison for taking an image or video under somebody's clothing in order to see their genitals or underwear. Gina Martin, who led the calls for change, said she hoped the change in law would help people ""feel comfortable"" to report such crimes. It is already a specific crime in Scotland butnot in Northern Ireland. Speaking on the day the law came into effect, Ms Martin called on people to report upskirting when they see it happen. She told BBC News: ""If a new law's there, great - but if we don't know about it or aren't reporting it, [then] it doesn't do anything. ""We have to build a picture of how much this happens, because it happens a lot."" Prime Minister Theresa May described upskirting,externalas ""degrading and humiliating"" and said offenders should ""feel the full force of the law"". I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Upskirting ban 'also protects men in kilts' Ms Martin, 27, was waiting to watch The Killers perform at the British Summer Time music festival in London's Hyde Park in July 2017 when a man put his phone between her legs and took pictures. After informing the police, she was shocked to discover upskirting was not a specific offence and the case had been closed. A few days later she wrote about what had happened on Facebook. Her post went viral with other women sharing similar experiences. Soon an online petition calling for police to reopen the case had received 50,000 signatures. She alsowrote a feature for the BBC News website explaining her battle, recalling the dramatic moment she chased after the man who had taken the unwanted photo. Gina Martin could not believe upskirting was not already a criminal offence It wasn't long before the campaign was picked up by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse. Encouraged by government ministers, she brought a private members' bill backing the creation of an upskirting offence. Her bill was expected to sail through the Commons, but parliamentary rules meant it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. The bill was initially blocked by a Tory backbench MP, in a move which was widely criticised. This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill However, Ms Martin's campaign secured government backing on 15 July last year and the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill was put before Parliament days later. The new legislation was approved in the House of Lords and has now passed the formality of Royal Assent to become law. At the time, Ms Martin said: ""To the outsider, the ordinary person, law and politics are complex and daunting. But both are penetrable if you believe in yourself and find the right support."" She said the experience had been a ""steep learning curve"" in how the political system works - but that the decision was ""politics and society at its best"". By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Until now offenders could only be prosecuted for voyeurism or outraging public decency. But voyeurism only applies to filming in ""private"" while outraging public decency usually requires a witness - and upskirting often goes unobserved. So, following tireless campaigning by Gina Martin, the government has created a specific offence of upskirting where the purpose is to obtain sexual gratification, or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm. It covers culprits who say images were just taken ""for a laugh"", and paparazzi who take intrusive images. The new offences apply in instances when: Without consent, a person takes pictures beneath a person's clothing to observe their genitals or buttocks, whether covered or uncovered by underwear The offender has a motive of either gaining sexual gratification or causing humiliation, distress or alarm to the victim TheVoyeurism (Offences) Act 2019,externalalso ensures that the most serious offenders, where the purpose of the offence is for sexual gratification, are made subject to notification requirements (often referred to as being placed on the sex offenders' register). New police figures show that more people are reporting upskirting. Data obtained by the Press Association shows that the number of reported incidents rose from a total of 78 between April 2015 and April 2017 to 94 for the whole of 2018. The vast majority of cases involve female victims and male perpetrators, according to the data released by police forces under Freedom of Information laws. The police forces gave details of the incidents reported to them last year, with victims including pensioners and schoolchildren. One case involved a 70-year-old woman, Essex Police said. The same force was involved in a case where a suspect was charged with indecency after upskirt images of a child aged between seven and nine were discovered in his possession. Campaigners from a children's charity, Plan International UK, suggest that the problem could be more widespread than official figures show. The charity says its own research, which surveyed 1,004 girls in the UK aged between 14-21, found that one in 10 girls have experienced upskirting, and 52% didn't tell anyone about what happened to them. Lucy Russell, head of girls' rights and youth at the charity, said: ""The government is recognising that street harassment is not OK, which is a huge step forward. ""However, street harassment has become so normalised that girls are telling us they aren't speaking out about it because they're too embarrassed or think they won't be taken seriously."" She suggested more action should be taken at local level to encourage women to report offences. This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Before the law was passed victims and police in England and Wales were only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism. Unlike other sexual offences, victims of those crimes do not have automatic anonymity. The Ministry of Justice said the new law ""bans the degrading practice to deter perpetrators, better protect victims, and bring more offenders to justice"". Justice Minister Lucy Frazer added: ""We have always been clear - there are no excuses for this behaviour and offenders should feel the full force of the law. From today, they will. ""By taking decisive action and working closely with Gina Martin and other campaigners, we have ensured more people are protected from this degrading and humiliating practice."" In Northern Ireland, upskirting is still not a specific offence although the Department of Justice (DoJ) haslaunched a consultation on potential changes to legislation.

"The court was told Atkinson had failed to come to terms with their relationship ending A man who repeatedly stabbed his former girlfriend in a jealous rage as she tried to fight him off has been jailed for life for her murder. Joe Atkinson attacked 24-year-old Poppy Devey Waterhouse with a kitchen knife at the flat they shared in Leeds. Described as a ""prodigiously gifted mathematician"", she had more than 100 injuries, Leeds Crown Court was told. Atkinson, 25, who admitted murder, was told he will serve a minimum of 15 years and 310 days. In a victim impact statement, her mother Julie Devey said: ""I kept stroking my hands across the floorboards where she had been left screaming and dying. ""I just wanted to scoop her up and save her."" She added: ""I now live my life with a split screen. One half I can see the now, and on the other half that horrific scene."" Poppy Devey Waterhouse worked as an analyst for William Hill Describing the impact of her death, Miss Devey Waterhouse's father Rupert Waterhouse told the court that his daughter and son were the two ""greatest gifts"" of his life. He added: ""How can a picture of my daughter, smiling at me with her brown eyes, hurt me so deeply? ""This is my life sentence. Ours is a family of four minus one."" Latest news and stories from Yorkshire The court was told the pair, who met at Nottingham University, had been together for three years but by late 2018 they had broken up at the request of Miss Devey Waterhouse, who was originally from Frome in Somerset. Both were seeing other people but prosecutors said Atkinson had failed to come to terms with the separation. While Atkinson was on a Christmas night out with colleagues on 13 December, maths graduate Miss Devey Waterhouse remained at the flat they still shared on The Avenue, chatting to her new boyfriend on the telephone. The court was told how, in the early hours of 14 December, Atkinson returned to the flat and attacked her. Forensic evidence showed Miss Devey Waterhouse tried to fight him off, but collapsed in the hallway. She had suffered about 70 knife injuries all over her body. Afterwards, Atkinson attempted to clean the scene and dispose of his clothes, only contacting the emergency services hours later. Jason Pitter, prosecuting, said: ""Poppy Devey Waterhouse was a prodigiously talented mathematician - who was described as brilliant and beautiful - who, at the age of 24, had her whole life ahead of her. ""It was a life cruelly taken away from her just before Christmas last year, because this defendant realised he was not going to be a part of this future."" Det Supt Nicola Bryar, of West Yorkshire Police, said Atkinson's claim that the killing had been self-defence had soon unravelled. ""We established that he had spent some significant time disposing of evidence and attempting to alter the crime scene over the hours before the ambulance service and police were called to the flat. ""He has never explained why he did what he did, but he will now have a significant period of time in prison to reflect on what he has done and the hurt that has caused to so many people who knew and loved Poppy.""

"Stand-up comedian Ian Cognito was performing at a comedy club in Bicester when he fell ill on-stage Veteran stand-up comedian Ian Cognito has died on stage during a performance. The 60-year-old comic sat down on a stool while breathing heavily, before falling silent for five minutes during his show on Thursday. Compere Andrew Bird said the crowd at the The Atic bar in Bicester had thought it was a joke, and continued to laugh, unaware something was wrong. South Central Ambulance Service confirmed Cognito was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Bird, who runs the Lone Wolf Comedy Club event at the venue, said Cognito had not been feeling well before the gig started, but insisted on going on stage. ""He was like his old self, his voice was loud. I was thinking 'he's having such a good gig',"" Mr Bird said. Mr Bird said Cognito had even joked about his health during his set, telling the audience: ""Imagine if I died in front of you lot here."" It was Mr Bird who first went on stage to check if his fellow comedian was ok. ""Everyone in the crowd, me included, thought he was joking,"" he said. ""Even when I walked on stage and touched his arm I was expecting him to say 'boo'."" Once it became clear something was wrong, two off-duty A&E nurses and a police officer began chest compressions and an ambulance was called. Audience member John Ostojak said: ""Only 10 minutes before he sat down he joked about having a stroke. ""He said, 'imagine having a stroke and waking up speaking Welsh'."" Mr Ostojak said: ""We came out feeling really sick, we just sat there for five minutes watching him, laughing at him."" Mr Bird said dying on stage would have been the way the veteran comic ""would have wanted to go"", ""except he'd want more money and a bigger venue"". Cognito, whose real name was Paul Barbieri, was born in London in 1958, and had been performing since the mid-1980s. Fellow comedians have paid tribute, describing him as a ""proper comic"" and praising his support for up-and-coming acts.

"This video can not be played Sudanese women reject 'regime coup' Sudan's military coup leaders have warned protesters still on the streets that there will be ""zero tolerance"" for disturbances. A spokesman insisted the army did not seek power and Sudan's future would be decided by the protesters - but said the army would maintain public order. Protesters are still out in Khartoum, fearing the coup leaders are too close to ousted ruler Omar al-Bashir. The military says it will not extradite Mr Bashir on war crimes charges. Mr Bashir is the subject of two international arrest warrants,externalissued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). He is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's Darfur region between 2003 and 2008, allegations he denies. However, he may be put on trial inside Sudan, according to the military council set up after the coup. Africa Live: Latest updates amid turmoil Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Mr Bashir, one of the world's longest-serving leaders until he was ousted on Thursday, is now in custody. His downfall followed months of unrest that began in December over rising prices. At least 38 people have died in the protests. The army has said it will oversee a transitional period followed by elections. As part of this, it is imposing a three-month state of emergency, with the constitution suspended. The military council will be in place for a maximum of two years, it says, but could last only a month if the transition to civilian rule is managed smoothly. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? Lt-Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin, who heads the military council's political committee, said on Friday: ""The solutions will be devised by those in protest. ""You, the people, will provide the solutions for all economic and political issues. We have come with no ideology, we have come here to maintain order and security to provide the opportunity for the people of Sudan to achieve the change they aspire to. Allow Twitter content?

""We have no ambition to hold the reins of power. We are here to provide an all-inclusive umbrella. ""Our key responsibility is to maintain public order,"" he added. ""We will have zero tolerance for any misdeed in any corner of the country."" Later on Friday state media said the military had asked political parties to name representatives for a meeting with coup leaders at a later date. Thousands remained camped out near military headquarters in the capital on Friday, ignoring a curfew declared by the military. They are demanding a transition to civilian rule before they return home. The new military council is headed by Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, who was previously regarded as being well placed to succeed Mr Bashir. This video can not be played Thursday's coup announcement was made by the defence minister Awad Ibn Auf During the Darfur conflict, he was head of military intelligence.The US imposed sanctions on him in 2007,externalin relation to his alleged support for militia blamed for atrocities in Darfur. On Thursday Sara Abdeljalil, a member of the Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA) which has spearheaded the protests, called the new military council a ""continuation of the same regime"". ""So what we need to do is to continue the fight and the peaceful resistance,"" she said. This video can not be played Anti-Bashir protesters celebrate Reacting to the military's statement on Friday, Khartoum resident Tagreed Abdin told the BBC: ""We don't know who's behind the military council. ""We are used to hearing government double-speak but we need to see if they're really interested in dialogue and listening to the voices of the people."" The army said it had ruled out a violent response to the protests before Mr Bashir was overthrown because they didn't want the loss of life. It will be difficult (of course not impossible) to walk back on that. There is then the question of the dynamics within the army. Younger officers and rank and file will have been emboldened by their role and public reception during the protests. Will they be content to allow the Mr Bashir generation monopolise military power? And there's the economic crisis brought about by misrule, corruption and loss of oil revenues. Even the regime's friends in the Middle East and Asia will think twice about rescue packages if it looks like a new version of the old venality and brutality. That's an important pressure. This is an exciting moment. Just think about the role of women in all of this, of social media and civil society. It's happening in Sudan but the significance of these forces working peaceful for change is universal. Yes it's very precarious, but also full of possibility. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres appealed for ""calm and utmost restraint by all"" and urged a transition that would meet the ""democratic aspirations"" of the people. The UN Security Council is to discuss the situation in a closed-door meeting on Friday. UK Foreign SecretaryJeremy Hunt said that a two-year military council was ""not the answer"",externaland called for a ""swift move to an inclusive, representative, civilian leadership"". This video can not be played Sudan protests: So what's going on? The African Union condemned the military takeover, saying it was not an appropriate response to the challenges facing Sudan and the aspirations of its people. Russia, which twice hosted Mr Bashir despite the international travel ban he faced, called for calm. Have you been taking part in protests?

"Stand-up comedian Ian Cognito was performing at a comedy club in Bicester when he fell ill on-stage Veteran stand-up comedian Ian Cognito has died on stage during a performance. The 60-year-old comic sat down on a stool while breathing heavily, before falling silent for five minutes during his show on Thursday. Compere Andrew Bird said the crowd at the The Atic bar in Bicester had thought it was a joke, and continued to laugh, unaware something was wrong. South Central Ambulance Service confirmed Cognito was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Bird, who runs the Lone Wolf Comedy Club event at the venue, said Cognito had not been feeling well before the gig started, but insisted on going on stage. ""He was like his old self, his voice was loud. I was thinking 'he's having such a good gig',"" Mr Bird said. Mr Bird said Cognito had even joked about his health during his set, telling the audience: ""Imagine if I died in front of you lot here."" It was Mr Bird who first went on stage to check if his fellow comedian was ok. ""Everyone in the crowd, me included, thought he was joking,"" he said. ""Even when I walked on stage and touched his arm I was expecting him to say 'boo'."" Once it became clear something was wrong, two off-duty A&E nurses and a police officer began chest compressions and an ambulance was called. Audience member John Ostojak said: ""Only 10 minutes before he sat down he joked about having a stroke. ""He said, 'imagine having a stroke and waking up speaking Welsh'."" Mr Ostojak said: ""We came out feeling really sick, we just sat there for five minutes watching him, laughing at him."" Mr Bird said dying on stage would have been the way the veteran comic ""would have wanted to go"", ""except he'd want more money and a bigger venue"". Cognito, whose real name was Paul Barbieri, was born in London in 1958, and had been performing since the mid-1980s.

"Passengers are stranded in India and around the world after Jet Airways suspended all international flights. Flights from London, Paris and Amsterdam are among those grounded amid fears about the survival of India's largest private airline. The airline cancelled all international flights until Monday when, according to reports, it will meet its lenders again to try to secure funding. Jet Airways is saddled with more than $1bn (Â£765m) of debt. It is seeking a financial lifeline to avoid collapse and, on Thursday,grounded 10 planes over unpaid fees to leasing firms,external. These were the latest flights to be grounded and it was not clear how many of its fleet of more than 100 planes was still in operation. Local reports suggested that it was barely a dozen. The airline flies on 600 domestic and 380 international routes - but carriers in India must maintain a fleet of least 20 aircraft to continue to operate international services. Jet Airways founder steps down amid crisis The riches to rags story of Jet Airways From London, the airline initially confirmed it had cancelled its flights between London, Paris and Amsterdam and India for 12 April, but later said that all international flights would be cancelled between 12 and 15 April. It said it ""regrets the inconvenience caused"" to its passengers and was ""working to minimise guest inconvenience"". ""In parallel, the airline's management and its key stakeholders including its consortium of lenders, continue to work closely towards resolving the current situation,"" it said. There was no statement about the status of domestic flights. Sandeep Kooner and her three children had been expecting to be on a flight from London to India on Friday evening to attend her niece's wedding in Punjab. But the 40 year-old who lives in Walsall will now miss the first few days of the week-long celebrations after her Jet Airways flight was cancelled. ""I had just sat down in the nail salon when I got a text message to say my flight had been cancelled,"" she told the BBC. She has now arranged to fly with Air India, but that will be days later and to Delhi - an eight hour drive to her destination - rather than a local one. ""I'm not 100% sure my problem is 100% sorted,"" she says. Television channels in India reported that the prime minister's office had called for an urgent meeting to discuss the airline. They also reported remarks by government officials saying Jet Airways only had  funds to operate six to seven aircraft over the weekend. India's Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, had tweeted that his ministry would ""review issues related to Jet Airways"" and ""take necessary steps to minimise passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety"".

Jet Airways owes money to employees and suppliers andin recent weeks it has grounded aircraftand cancelled thousands of flights as its financial strains worsened.

By Sameer Hashmi, India business correspondent In March, when the crisis at Jet Airways led to thousands of flights being cancelled, the government immediately stepped in and asked public sector banks to rescue the private carrier. It was a rare move. With India holding a national election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government did not want the airline to be grounded as that would have affected 23,000 jobs. The lenders which took control of the airline have only released a fraction of the amount they had promised so the airline has not been able to pay aircraft leasing companies. This means its fleet has shrunk further from the 100-plus it had at the start of the year. The lenders have started accepting bids from potential investors, but that process will take a couple of months to complete. And many analysts fear that Jet Airways will not survive even a week if immediate cash is not provided to keep the operations running. The airline was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago and he and his family currently own 52% of the airline, although that majority stake is expected to be lost as lenders' restructure the debt. A consortium of investors led by the State Bank of India (SBI) took control of the airline in March. The group is searching for a new investor to acquire a stake of up to 75% in Jet Airways.  The deadline for bids had been extended to Friday, according to reports. Ellis Taylor, deputy Asia editor of Flight Global, told the BBC the airline was in a ""precarious position"". ""The interim lifeline that the carrier talked about two weeks ago looks like it won't materialise any time soon, and that really leaves its future looking bleak,"" he said. There were reports in local media that India's aviation ministry might review the regulations setting the fleet cap, which could allow the airline to resume international services.

"High-end fashion chain LK Bennett has been bought out of administration, saving 325 jobs. However, 15 of the retailer's stores are not included in the deal and will close, leading to the loss of 110 jobs. LK Bennett has been bought by Byland UK which was set up by Rebecca Feng, who runs the company's Chinese franchises. The sale includes the company's headquarters, 21 stores and all of its concessions. The amount paid has not been disclosed. Ms Feng said: ""Under our plan, the business will continue to operate out of the UK, looking to maintain the long-standing and undoubted heritage of the brand. ""This will be achieved through a combination of working with quality British design, and the business's existing supply chain."" The UK stores not included in the sale and which will now close are: Bath Belfast Birmingham Bridgewater, Banbridge City, Royal Exchange, London Glasgow Gloucester King's Road, London Knightsbridge, London Long Acre, London Northcote Road, London St Albans Westgate Oxford York York Outlet The administrators said the company's international subsidiaries were also not included in the sale and would remain in administration. LK Bennett was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990, and counts the Duchess of Cambridge as a customer. Ms Bennett sold her majority stake in the chain to private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners in 2008, but in 2017 returned to advise the business after the retailer started to struggle. She bought the company back a short time later. The chain reported an operating loss of nearly Â£6m in the year to the end of July 2017, the most recent results available for the firm. The accounts show that on her return, Ms Bennett invested about Â£11.2m into the business. LK Bennett called in the administrators last month, and five stores - Sheffield Meadowhall, Bristol, Liverpool, London Brent Cross and London Westbourne Grove - were closed. Shortly before the business fell into administration, Ms Bennett emailed staff saying she had ""fought as hard as I can, with all your help, to turn the business into the success that I know it deserves to be"". ""These are difficult and unstable times, and we are doing everything we can to identify the best way forward,"" she had said.

"Brunei said the aim of implementing Sharia, or Islamic law, was to ""educate and deter"" Brunei's foreign ministry has said implementing Sharia law is about prevention rather than punishment, after intense criticism of its decision to implement the strict Islamic code. Under the new laws, adultery and sex between men is punishable by stoning to death. Brunei said there would be a high threshold for evidence in those cases, suggesting punishment would be rare. It comes after the UN called the punishments ""cruel and inhuman"". Brunei has sent a response from Erywan Yusof, the minister of foreign affairs, to the United Nation's (UN) criticism,externalsaying Sharia law ""focuses more on prevention than punishment. Its aim is to educate, deter, rehabilitate and nurture rather than to punish"". It also said Sharia does not criminalise based on sexual orientation or belief, including same-sex relations. The criminalisation of ""adultery and sodomy is to safeguard the sanctity of family lineage and marriage of individual Muslims, particularly women"", according to the statement. Brunei is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah The statement also clarified that for the maximum punishments of amputation or death to be carried out in the case of certain crimes, at least two men of ""high moral standing and piety"" would have to bear witness. It added that these men would have to live up to ""extremely high"" standards, making it ""[extremely] difficult to find one in this day and age"". UK Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt also said on Thursday he had spoken to the Bruneian foreign minister who had suggested that Sharia prosecutions were, in practice, unlikely. Brunei: What you need to know How people in Brunei are reacting to anti-LGBT laws The statement from Brunei's foreign ministry comes in response to the UN's criticism of the country's decision to implement the second phase of Sharia law on 3 April. This video can not be played ""As a kid... we were taught the stones should not be too big"" The first phase of Sharia law, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights sent a letter on 1 April to the Brunei mission,externalin Geneva warning that the planned implementation of the new laws contravened international human rights standards set out in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights - which was ratified by Brunei in 2006. Regardless, Brunei went ahead with the implementation of the new laws, under the continued phasing in of Sharia alongside common law. Under the new laws, individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present. Offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad will carry the maximum penalty of death. Lesbian sex carries a different penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail. The maximum punishment for theft is amputation. The decision to implement the strict Islamic laws sparked global condemnation, with celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and others calling for a boycott of the Dorchester Collection group of hotels owned by Brunei's investment agency.

"Brunei said the aim of implementing Sharia, or Islamic law, was to ""educate and deter"" Brunei's foreign ministry has said implementing Sharia law is about prevention rather than punishment, after intense criticism of its decision to implement the strict Islamic code. Under the new laws, adultery and sex between men is punishable by stoning to death. Brunei said there would be a high threshold for evidence in those cases, suggesting punishment would be rare. It comes after the UN called the punishments ""cruel and inhuman"". Brunei has sent a response from Erywan Yusof, the minister of foreign affairs, to the United Nation's (UN) criticism,externalsaying Sharia law ""focuses more on prevention than punishment. Its aim is to educate, deter, rehabilitate and nurture rather than to punish"". It also said Sharia does not criminalise based on sexual orientation or belief, including same-sex relations. The criminalisation of ""adultery and sodomy is to safeguard the sanctity of family lineage and marriage of individual Muslims, particularly women"", according to the statement. Brunei is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah The statement also clarified that for the maximum punishments of amputation or death to be carried out in the case of certain crimes, at least two men of ""high moral standing and piety"" would have to bear witness. It added that these men would have to live up to ""extremely high"" standards, making it ""[extremely] difficult to find one in this day and age"". UK Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt also said on Thursday he had spoken to the Bruneian foreign minister who had suggested that Sharia prosecutions were, in practice, unlikely. Brunei: What you need to know How people in Brunei are reacting to anti-LGBT laws The statement from Brunei's foreign ministry comes in response to the UN's criticism of the country's decision to implement the second phase of Sharia law on 3 April. This video can not be played ""As a kid... we were taught the stones should not be too big"" The first phase of Sharia law, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights sent a letter on 1 April to the Brunei mission,externalin Geneva warning that the planned implementation of the new laws contravened international human rights standards set out in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights - which was ratified by Brunei in 2006. Regardless, Brunei went ahead with the implementation of the new laws, under the continued phasing in of Sharia alongside common law. Under the new laws, individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present. Offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad will carry the maximum penalty of death. Lesbian sex carries a different penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail. The maximum punishment for theft is amputation. The decision to implement the strict Islamic laws sparked global condemnation, with celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and others calling for a boycott of the Dorchester Collection group of hotels owned by Brunei's investment agency. The decision threw the tiny oil-rich South East Asian nation into the global spotlight and sparked international outrage.

"Folau has the fourth highest total of Test tries for Australia The Rugby Football Union says it does not support Billy Vunipola's views after the England forward defended Israel Folau's social media post claiming ""hell awaits"" gay people. Folaulooks certain to be sackedby Australia for the comments. Vunipola, who was criticised for liking the post, called for people to ""live their lives how God intended"" and said ""man was made for woman to procreate"". The RFU said on Friday it intends to hold a meeting with Vunipola next week. ""Rugby is an inclusive sport, and we do not support these views,"" it said in a statement. ""We will be meeting with Billy to discuss his social media posts."" In a statement, Vunipola's club side Saracens said: ""We recognise that people have different belief systems and we expect everyone to be treated equally with respect and humility. ""As representatives and role models, Saracens players have a responsibility not only to themselves but to the club and wider society. ""Billy Vunipola's recent social media posts are inconsistent with this and we take this matter very seriously. It will be handled internally."" Folau posted aphoto on Instagram,externalearlier this week, with the message: ""Warning. Drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolators. Hell awaits you. Repent! Only Jesus saves."" Rugby Australia and New South Wales Rugby Union held a private meeting with the full-back in Sydney on Friday, having previously been unable to contact him and said afterwards their position on the 30-year-old's future was unchanged. 'Folau may never play rugby again' This video can not be played Folau comments ânot tolerated in societyâ Social media users criticised Vunipola after noticing he had liked the post, and the Australia-born 26-year-old responded in an Instagram statement on Friday. ""So this morning I got three phone calls from people telling me to 'unlike' the Izzy Folau post,"" he wrote. ""This is my position on it. I don't HATE anyone, neither do I think I'm perfect. ""There just comes a point when you insult what I grew up believing in that you just say enough is enough - what he's saying isn't that he doesn't like or love those people. ""He's saying how we live our lives needs to be closer to how God intended them to be. Man was made for woman to procreate, that was the goal no? ""I'm not perfect - I'm at least everything on that list at least at one point in my life. It hurts to know that. But that's why I believe there's a God. To guide and protect us and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."" Vunipola has been named on the bench for Saracens' Premiership fixture with Bristol at Ashton Gate on Saturday. Rugby Australia is set to terminate Folau's contract, just months away from a World Cup at which he would have been a central figure for the Wallabies. ""Israel has failed to understand the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality,"" read a statement. Folau, who signed a four-year deal with the Waratahs in March and had a deal with Rugby Australia until 2022, escaped punishment for similar comments last year.

"Stand-up comedian Ian Cognito was performing at a comedy club in Bicester when he fell ill on-stage Veteran stand-up comedian Ian Cognito has died on stage during a performance. The 60-year-old comic sat down on a stool while breathing heavily, before falling silent for five minutes during his show on Thursday. Compere Andrew Bird said the crowd at the The Atic bar in Bicester had thought it was a joke, and continued to laugh, unaware something was wrong. South Central Ambulance Service confirmed Cognito was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Bird, who runs the Lone Wolf Comedy Club event at the venue, said Cognito had not been feeling well before the gig started, but insisted on going on stage. ""He was like his old self, his voice was loud. I was thinking 'he's having such a good gig',"" Mr Bird said. Mr Bird said Cognito had even joked about his health during his set, telling the audience: ""Imagine if I died in front of you lot here."" It was Mr Bird who first went on stage to check if his fellow comedian was ok. ""Everyone in the crowd, me included, thought he was joking,"" he said. ""Even when I walked on stage and touched his arm I was expecting him to say 'boo'."" Once it became clear something was wrong, two off-duty A&E nurses and a police officer began chest compressions and an ambulance was called. Audience member John Ostojak said: ""Only 10 minutes before he sat down he joked about having a stroke. ""He said, 'imagine having a stroke and waking up speaking Welsh'."" Mr Ostojak said: ""We came out feeling really sick, we just sat there for five minutes watching him, laughing at him."" Mr Bird said dying on stage would have been the way the veteran comic ""would have wanted to go"", ""except he'd want more money and a bigger venue"". Cognito, whose real name was Paul Barbieri, was born in London in 1958, and had been performing since the mid-1980s. Fellow comedians have paid tribute, describing him as a ""proper comic"" and praising his support for up-and-coming acts.

"Assange was found guilty of a British charge, but he could be extradited to the US to face a separate charge Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK government should not extradite Julian Assange to the US, where he faces a computer hacking charge. The Wikileaks co-founder was arrested for a separate charge at Ecuador's London embassy on Thursday, where he had been granted asylum since 2012. Mr Corbyn said Assange should not be extradited ""for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan"". Meanwhile, Ecuador's leader expressed anger at how Assange had behaved. Ecuador arrest man 'close' to Assange How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in embassy Who is Julian Assange? Timeline of the Assange saga Australian-born Assange, 47, sought refuge in the Knightsbridge embassy seven years ago, to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped. But Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum and invited the police to arrest Assange on Thursday. Afterhis dramatic arrest,he was taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court and found guilty of a British charge of breaching bail. He spent Thursday night in custody and is facing up to 12 months in prison for that conviction. The Met said it cost an estimated Â£13.2m to police Ecuador's London embassy between June 2012 and October 2015, when the force withdrew the physical presence of officers. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London The Swedish authorities are now considering whether to reopen an investigation into the allegations of sexual assault, which Assange denies. The US government has alsocharged him with allegations of conspiracy to break into a computer,,externalrelating to a massive leak of classified US government documents. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, and if he was convicted, he could face up to five years in jail. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""this is all about Wikileaks and all of that embarrassing information about the activities of the American military and security services that was made public"". But she said Assange should also face the criminal justice system if the Swedish government charged him. Swedish prosecutors dropped a rape investigation into Assange into 2017because they were unable to formally notify him of the allegations - a necessary step in proceeding with the case - while he remained in the Ecuadorian embassy. In a tweet, Mr Corbyn shared a video said to be of Pentagon footage - which had been released by Wikileaks - of a 2007 air strike which implicated US military in the killing of civilians and two journalists.

The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said backing Assange is not without political risk and will not find universal favour among Labour MPs - but Mr Corbyn's intervention ""means the battle over Assange's future will now be as much political as it is legal"". Australian-born Assange at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday The editor of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, has expressed fears that the US could file more serious charges against Assange, and that if he was convicted he could be behind bars for ""decades"". Mr Hrafnsson added that Assange had been thrown ""overboard"" by Ecuador - and the country was ""horrible"" to treat him like that. Meanwhile in Ecuador, President Lenin Moreno criticised Assange, claiming that after spending seven years in the country's embassy he had dismissed Ecuador by describing it as an insignificant country. ""We had treated him as a guest,"" he said. ""But not anymore."" Ecuador's ambassador to the UK, Jaime Marchan, also previously said Assange had been ""continually a problem"" while he was living in the embassy. Meanwhile, a man who is alleged to have links with Assange has been arrested while trying to leave Ecuador, the country's officials said. The man - who has been identified by supporters as a Swedish software developer called Ola Bini - had been trying to board a flight to Japan. This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? Assange is due to face a hearing over his possible extradition to the US on 2 May. During a briefing at the White House following Assange's arrest, US President Donald Trump was asked by reporters if he stood by remarks that he made during his election campaign when he said he loved Wikileaks. ""I know nothing about Wikileaks,"" said Mr Trump. ""It's not my thing."" This video can not be played Does Trump still love Wikileaks... or what? He added: ""I've been seeing what happened with Assange and that will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who's doing an excellent job."" Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" where any journalist could face US charges for ""publishing truthful information about the United States"". She said she had visited Assange in the police cells where he thanked supporters and said: ""I told you so."" Assange had predicted that he would face extradition to the US if he left the embassy. Meanwhile, Australia said it had received a request for consular assistance after Assange was taken from the embassy. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Assange will not get ""special treatment"" and will have to ""make his way through whatever comes his way in terms of the justice system"". Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson and Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson say the arrest sets a dangerous precedent The arrest was welcomed by the government on Thursday. Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons: ""This goes to show that in the UK, no-one is above the law."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the arrest was the result of ""years of careful diplomacy"" and that it was ""not acceptable"" for someone to ""escape facing justice"". Assange set up Wikileaks in 2006 with the aim of obtaining and publishing confidential documents and images. The organisation hit the headlines four years later when it released footage of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website. She said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, but US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was found guilty by a court martial in 2013 of charges including espionage. However, her jail sentence was later commuted. Manning was recently jailed for refusing to testifybefore an investigation into Wikileaks' role in revealing the secret files.

Initially Ms Abbott dismissed the Swedish allegations, saying three times that Assange was never charged, but she later said he should face the criminal justice system if the Swedish government does charge him. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also saidthe UK should oppose Assange's extradition, ""for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan"". The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said backing Assange is not without political risk and will not find universal favour among Labour MPs - but it means ""the battle over Assange's future will now be as much political as it is legal"". Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the arrest, saying it showed that ""in the UK, no one is above the law"". Lawyer Rebecca Niblock said the extradition decision lies primarily with the courts and that only a judge can decide whether an extradition breaches an individual's human rights. The home secretary can consider a limited number of issues when deciding whether or not to order an extradition, including whether the person is at risk of the death penalty. However, if Sweden also made an extradition request, Ms Niblock said it would be for the home secretary to decide which request would take precedence, considering factors such as the seriousness of the offence and which request was made first. Nick Vamos, former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, said the UK proceedings should not take more than 18 months. Considering Assange's potential objections to extradition, Mr Vamos said that he did not think courts would accept the US case was politically motivated. But he said Assange may be able to argue that his likely treatment in the US prison system would breach his human rights and that could not receive a fair trial due to his notoriety and links to political scandals.

"The Orange Order said the application for the parade was an annual process The Catholic Church has called for a planned Orange Order parade to be re-routed as it would pass the spot where a priest was spat on last year. Parish priest Canon Tom White was assaulted outside St Alphonsus' Church in Glasgow's London Road during the annual Boyne march in July 2018. Bradley Wallace, 24, from Uddingston, wasconvicted of the attack in January. The decision on whether to allow the march on 6 July rests with Glasgow City Council. The Orange Order hasapplied for marchers to take part in 6 July parades across the city,external- with members from the Orange And Purple District 37, Orange And Purple District 40 and Rutherglen Orange And Purple District 20 groups due to pass St Alphonsus' Church as part of the route. However, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Glasgow said the application was inappropriate. Canon Tom White was spat on by Bradley Wallace during the annual Boyne march in July 2018 He told the BBC Scotland news website: ""It seems extraordinarily insensitive to plan such controversial marches past churches which will be full of people, knowing the anxiety and fear which will be caused to worshippers and the wider community. ""After the distressing scenes of last year in this precise location, sensitivities are high. ""Many regard the planned marches as unduly provocative. We would trust that the police will take these issues into consideration when offering advice to the city council on how to proceed."" In a statement, the council said the application was still being considered and that a final decision on the route's path was still to be taken. A spokeswoman added: ""As with any other procession, the council will consult with Police Scotland on whether it has any concerns regarding public order, public safety, damage to property or disruption to the life of the community as a consequence of this notification. ""Local authorities do not have the power to ban or prevent parades on the basis that some citizens may dislike or be offended by them; or that they pass a place of worship."" St Alphonsus Church is on London Road in the east end of Glasgow Orange marchers were forced tore-route last year's Remembrance Day parade away from a church in Glasgow's east end amid fears of violent clashes. Glasgow City Council's public processions committee told organisers they must avoid St Mary's Church in Calton. The move followed the attack on Canon White four months previously. A spokesman for the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland said the latest application was an annual process. He added: ""The Grand Lodge looks forward to a meaningful dialogue with the police on this issue.""

"Thames Valley and Hampshire Police are the first forces to use the mobile detection technology Mobile phone detectors are to be used by police to find drivers using devices at the wheel. The Thames Valley and Hampshire forces are rolling out the technology to show when motorists are using their phones. A sign will flash at the driver telling them to stop using their mobile - but the detectors cannot tell if it is a driver or passenger using the phone. The mother of Aimee Goldsmith, 11, killed by a driver using a phone, said it was a ""step in the right direction"". The detectors are the first of their kind to be used by police in the UK though a similar system has been tried by councils The technology will not be used as an ""enforcement tool"", the forces said, but was instead aimed at educating motorists and identifying offending ""hotspots"". Kate Goldsmith's daughter was one offour people killed in the crash when lorry driver Tomasz Kroker was using his phone at the wheel in 2016. She said Aimee's death was ""completely avoidable"". ""Most mothers look forward to planning their daughter's weddings. I had to plan Aimee's funeral,"" she said. Ms Goldsmith said she had confronted drivers using their phones behind the wheel since her daughter's death. ""I have stopped a few people and said, 'you're using a mobile phone - it's actually a driver like you that killed my daughter',"" she said. She said the detectors were ""not a perfect solution"" to convict offenders but were ""a step in the direction"". Aimee Goldsmith with her mum Kate and brother Jake Kroker killed Aimee, her stepbrothers Ethan Houghton, 13, Joshua, 11, and their mother Tracy, 45,when he ploughed into stationary traffic at 50mph on 10 August 2016. He was jailed for 10 years after admitting four counts of causing death by dangerous driving and footage showed him on his phone at the moment of impact. A judge said the 30-year-old's attention had been so poor he ""might as well have had his eyes closed"" before the crash on the A34 near Newbury. Tracy Houghton, her son Ethan, stepdaughter Aimee Goldsmith and younger son Josh were all killed in a crash Thames Valley Police and Hampshire Constabulary have developed the technology with Westcotec Ltd. The system, which cannot record footage,was initially tested in Norfolk last year. The detector picks up 2G, 3G and 4G signals and will therefore flash to alert people in cars who are using phones to call, text or data. If people are using a Bluetooth hands-free device, the detector will recognise this and not flash. The technology cannot distinguish if a passenger or a driver of a vehicle is using a phone and so the sign will be activated regardless of who is using the mobile. The forces say the two detectors, which cost Â£6,000 each, will be located on the A34 in Oxfordshire but will be posted at different locations throughout the Thames Valley and Hampshire to start - but more could be rolled out. Drivers caught using a mobile phone while driving are currently fined Â£200 and given six points on their licence. Matt Barber, deputy police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, said the system was ""not fool-proof"", but added the police needed to ""make it as socially unacceptable to use your mobile whilst driving as it is to drink and drive"". PC Liz Johnson, a roads safety officer, said research suggested a driver was four times more likely to crash if they were using a phone and twice as likely to be involved in a fatal collision when texting compared with drink-driving. ""It is vital that people take notice and stop using their mobile phones whilst driving,"" she added.

"Experts at Cardiff University said the rise of 'high harm' crimes amid falling overall violence was 'difficult to explain' Overall levels of violence in England and Wales are on the decline, in spite of an increase in knife crime, a study of A&E data suggests. Analysis by Cardiff University found admissions of patients injured in violent attacks dropped 1.7% in 2018. It indicates a rise inknife crime,gun crimeandhomiciderecorded by police is not part of a wider upsurge. The study's authors said the rise of ""high harm"" crimes amid falling overall violence was ""difficult to explain"". Reality Check: Is there more crime? Are more teenagers carrying knives? The National Violence Surveillance Network (NVSN) survey has recorded a near consistent downward trend in violent crime since it was launched in 2002, although levels have remained relatively stable in recent years. Experts analysed data collected from a sample of 126 A&E departments, minor injury units and walk-in centres across Wales and all nine regions of England. They estimate 187,584 people attended A&E with injuries sustained in violence in 2018 - 3,162 fewer than the previous year. Motives and circumstances behind killings have varied - as have the age and gender of the victims. Faces of the dead 10 charts that help explain the rise in knife crime The National Violence Surveillance Network also suggested fewer younger people sought hospital treatment, which they said was ""contrary"" to public perceptions of a violent crime ""epidemic"" among teenagers. However, there was a small increase in the number of women who were attacked and injured and a rise of more than 5% among both men and women aged 51 and over. The figures give a different impression to police data,which suggests violent crime recorded by police in England and Wales rose 19% in the 12 months to the end of September. The picture on violent crime in England and Wales can be confusing, with so many different sets of figures apparently telling us lots of different things. The police statistics partly depend on the public's willingness to report offences - and to a larger extent on how accurately forces record them. Since 2014, police forces have improved their recording processes, which in turn has contributed to an apparently significant rise in offending. The increase has also been driven by the inclusion within the category of ""violent crime"" of offences such as harassment. The police figures are a reliable indicator of high-harm violence, such as robbery, knife crime and murder - these are less affected by recording changes. But for overall trends, it's better to use data from the official Crime Survey of England and Wales - whose methods haven't altered - and Cardiff University's study. They both tell the same story - a sustained reduction in violence over many years. Reality Check: Is there more crime?

"The arrest and expected extradition of Julian Assange has set into motion what could prove to be the most important free speech and free press case in our history. Or not. Assange has been charged with a single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers with Chelsea Manning to reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. For many, Assange is a journalist, a whistleblower, a hero. Yet for others in Washington, he is the man who embarrassed the establishment in Congress, the intelligence community and even the media. Those powerful foes are likely to bring considerable pressure to deny Assange a platform for highlighting the operations that led to massive civilian losses and undisclosed military strikes, the very type of information disclosed in the celebrating ""Pentagon Papers"" case involving the New York Times in the Vietnam War. For historians in both Great Britain and the United States, there should be something eerily familiar in this controversy. Almost 300 years ago, the foundations for American protections of the free press were laid in the trial of John Peter Zenger. The case has striking similarities to the pending prosecution of the Wikileaks founder. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London In the case, the recently installed British governor William Cosby was the subject of an anonymous pamphlet that detailed his many abusive and corrupt practices in New York and New Jersey, from stealing Indian lands to pilfering the Treasury to rigging elections. Cosby ordered four editions of the Zenger's New York Weekly Journal publicly burned and arrested Zenger. He then installed a biased judge who held Zenger's defence lawyer in contempt. Despite using every means to punish Zenger for what Cosby called ""scandalous, virulent, false and seditious reflections"", the colonial jurors balked and acquitted him. The trial of Peter Zenger in New York in 1734 in which the printer was accused of libel It was the defining moment for the colonies and ultimately led to far stronger protections of journalists in the United States than in Britain, as embodied in the first amendment to the US constitution declaring that ""Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom... of the press."" Much has changed in the United States for the press, but perhaps not as much as we claim. The Justice Department crafted the charge to evade the constitutional concerns over the prosecution - and the unresolved status of Assange. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga By alleging that Assange was given a password and helped set up a cloud for Manning to share the data, the government is charging him not with the distribution of the material but actively participating in its theft. However, the unsealed indictment in Alexandria, Virginia, is remarkably thin on evidence that Assange played such an active role or used the password in question. Setting up a cloud for sharing information can easily be viewed as simply facilitating the anonymous disclosure from a source. Where reporters once arranged for drop spots, there are now digital equivalents for such exchanges. Assange gave a thumbs-up as he was taken to a London courthouse Rather than exploring reasons and effort to reveal controversial intelligence operations, Assange could be forced to confine his defence to the more mundane charge of ""computer intrusion"". Yet, the indictment is conspicuously thin on the evidence of that role. The government alleges that Manning gave ""a portion"" of a password ""to crack"" which ""was stored as a 'hash value' in a computer file that was accessible only by users with administrative-level privileges"". However, the government then says not that Assange arranged to crack the code but only that ""cracking the password would have allowed Manning to log onto the computers under a username that did not belong to her"". Such a measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source of disclosures of classified information. A van supporting Manning and Assange seen in London last week. Assange is likely to face more charges once he is in the United States. A superseding indictment might encompass the role Wikileaks played in publishing emails stolen from the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their part in the hack and alluded to Wikileaks in those indictments, although not by name. However, thus far, no Americans have been indicted for any alleged conspiracy with the Russians and, putting aside the narrative, Assange is so far being prosecuted for the same type of conduct as people messing with Netflix passwords. But for now, the US only wants to show under extradition laws that there is a reasonable basis for believing that Assange committed a crime in the United States. The government also wants to avoid any criminal charge that could result in the death penalty. Nevertheless, the Justice Department is likely to do what the British government failed to do with Zenger. It will focus its charges on insular acts like sharing passwords or hacking. By doing so, the government can file a motion (what's called a motion in limine) to prevent Assange from raising his motivations or the disclosure of the secret operations. It could be declared immaterial. The jury will not hear the type of evidence that Zenger's lawyers forced into his trial. Assange would look simply like some slightly creepy-looking Australian hacker. Activists at a 2011 rally to free Manning US Attorney Tracey McCormick in Virginia could succeed if she keeps any counts focused on such technical and narrow acts. It would be like reducing the whole of Macbeth to the final scene where Macduff beheads the King, and therefore revealing nothing about his motivation or history. Reduced to Act V, Macduff simply looks like a blood-soaked regicidal maniac, rather than an avenging hero saving the country from a tyrannical leader. To paraphrase Shakespeare, Wikileaks could not be vanquished until the Great Assange came to Capitol Hill. He is now likely on his way and the trial could make the Zenger trial look like a model of transparency and accuracy.

"This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? For seven years, Julian Assange took refuge in a small office that was converted into a bedroom in Ecuador's embassy in an upmarket neighbourhood of central London, where he lived with his cat, James. It had a bed, sun lamp, computer, kitchenette, shower and treadmill. During his time there, the 47-year-old Wikileaks co-founder welcomed guests including Lady Gaga and Pamela Anderson and, from a tiny balcony, addressed supporters and held news conferences. But, apparently, not everyone was happy. Relations between him and Ecuador's government worsened after President LenÃ­n Moreno took office in 2017. This became evident last year when Assange was given a set of house rules, including paying for internet use, food and laundry, taking better care of his cat and keeping the bathroom clean. That fuelled speculation that Ecuador had finally had enough. On Thursday,President Moreno said Ecuador's patience had ""reached its limit"",externalwith Assange's ""discourteous and aggressive behaviour"". Accusing him of ""repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols"", he announced on Twitter the abrupt end of Assange's diplomatic asylum. More details emerged later, when Foreign Minister JosÃ© Valencia told Congress that Assange had been using a mobile phone not registered with the embassy, repeatedly insulted the mission's workers - reportedly calling them US spies - and damaged the facilities by riding his skateboard and playing football, despite being told not to do so. Cleaning staff, Mr Valencia said, had described ""improper hygienic conduct"" throughout Assange's stay, an issue that a lawyer had attributed to ""stomach problems"". One unnamed senior Ecuadorean official told AP news agency that other issues included ""weeks without a shower"" and a ""dental problem born of poor hygiene"". Profile: Julian Assange How likely is a conviction in US? Interior Minister MarÃ­a Paula Romo then complained that Assange had been allowed to do things like ""put faeces on the walls of the embassy and other behaviours of that nature"". Vaughan Smith, a friend who visited Assange last week, told Reuters that he rejected this claim. ""Julian has been under stress but seemed in a balanced frame of mind every time I have seen him. It doesn't seem in character."" Mr Valencia added that the decision was taken to prevent a further deterioration of Assange's health, without giving details. Quoting an unnamed friend, the New York Times saidAssange had become deeply depressed,externaland that diplomats - many of them recently appointed by the Moreno administration - were tired of his behaviour. President Moreno, who ordered Assange to cut back his online activity soon after taking office, also said Assange had ""violated the norm of not intervening in the internal affairs of other states"", most recently in January 2019 when Wikileaks released documents from the Vatican. He said that, and other cases, confirmed suspicions that Assange was still linked to Wikileaks. The president also accused Assange of having installed forbidden ""electronic and distortion equipment"" and of accessing the embassy's security files. There was also the suspicion that Wikileaks was linked to an anonymous website that said the president's brother had created an offshore company, and leaked material included private pictures of President Moreno and his family. Mr Moreno denies any wrongdoing. Mr Valencia added that, in January, Assange told Ecuador's ambassador he had installed panic buttons that he would activate if he considered his life to be in danger. It was not clear what he meant by that but British authorities who arrested him on Thursday were careful to prevent Assange from returning to his room during the operation, according to AP. The whistle-blower also allegedly played loud music - in at least one occasion this reportedly happened during office hours, disturbing staff who were working - and deliberately blocked the embassy's security cameras. Assange's stay at the embassy cost Ecuador some $6.5m (Â£5m) from 2012 to 2018, Mr Valencia said. Assange's Ecuadorean citizenship was also suspended. The Australian national had been in the Ecuadorean embassy since 2012, after seeking asylum there to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation, which he has always denied. He was given protection by then President Rafael Correa, a strong advocate of Wikileaks. Timeline of Assange's legal saga It is unclear what has happened to James.His own Instagram account has not offered any clues,,externalwith the last picture posted in 2017. Reports suggest he was given to a shelter by the Ecuadorean embassy some time ago whileItalian newspaper La Repubblica said last year Assange had himself freed him.,external Ecuador arrests man 'close' to Assange Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention seeker?

"Eilidh MacLeod was among the 22 people killed in 2017's terrorist attack A sculpture is being created in memory of a teenager from the island of Barra who died in the Manchester Arena attack in 2017. Eilidh MacLeod, 14, was one of the 22 people killed by a terrorist's bomb following an Ariana Grande concert. Her friend Laura MacIntyre survived but was badly injured. Eilidh was a member Sgoil Lionacleit Pipe Band and the life-size bronze sculpture will feature a young female bagpiper with her pipes at rest. The young woman will be reaching out a hand to a young boy who is also learning to play the instrument. Charity set up in attack girl's name Manchester attack: Remembering Eilidh The design, created by Sussex-based artist Jenna Gearing in consultation with Eilidh's family, is intended to reflect the teenager's ""love of music and her willingness to support others in the island community where she grew up"". The sculpture is to be placed in a newly-created memorial garden overlooking Vatersay in Barra next year. The design for the sculpture was created in consultation with Eilidh's family London-based Ardonagh Community Trust donated funding to the memorial, which forms part of the work being done by the Eilidh MacLeod Memorial Trust. Eilidh's father, Roddy, said: ""As a family losing Eilidh in such a cruel way was truly horrific. ""We could never adequately thank all the individuals, the communities and Eilidh's friends who gave us so much love and support in our time of need and indeed continue to do so, especially when they were hurting too. ""Forming Eilidh's Trust and working together with Jenna along with family and friends on Barra has been an uplifting and positive experience for us all."" Work has started on the life-size bronze Suzanne White, of the Eilidh MacLeod Memorial Trust, said: ""Our intention for the sculpture of a young female piper is to ensure that Eilidh's life and her legacy are celebrated appropriately. ""The design has really captured her spirit and created a striking memorial to a very special young girl."" Artist Ms Gearing said she felt ""incredibly privileged"" to be part of the efforts to remember Eilidh and the ""strength, unity and resilience"" shown by all the families and communities caught up in the Manchester attack. The memorial will celebrate Eilidh's love of music She said: ""I endeavour to do Eilidh's family justice and my hope is that the sculpture created will provide a place for reflection and to serve an endless reminder of the wonderful girl that remains so fondly in our hearts. ""The young lady looking down at the young boy kind of symbolises adults passing on their wisdom to children, and the child looking out to sea is almost like looking at one's future. ""It came about from a story the MacLeods told me of how Eilidh was meant to be teaching her young sister to play the bagpipes that year. That story really resonated with me and I wanted to encapsulate some of that."" Eilidh and her friend Laura both attended Castlebay Community School in Barra.

"This video can not be played Sudanese women reject 'regime coup' Sudan's military coup leaders have warned protesters still on the streets that there will be ""zero tolerance"" for disturbances. A spokesman insisted the army did not seek power and Sudan's future would be decided by the protesters - but said the army would maintain public order. Protesters are still out in Khartoum, fearing the coup leaders are too close to ousted ruler Omar al-Bashir. The military says it will not extradite Mr Bashir on war crimes charges. Mr Bashir is the subject of two international arrest warrants,externalissued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). He is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's Darfur region between 2003 and 2008, allegations he denies. However, he may be put on trial inside Sudan, according to the military council set up after the coup. Africa Live: Latest updates amid turmoil Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Mr Bashir, one of the world's longest-serving leaders until he was ousted on Thursday, is now in custody. His downfall followed months of unrest that began in December over rising prices. At least 38 people have died in the protests. The army has said it will oversee a transitional period followed by elections. As part of this, it is imposing a three-month state of emergency, with the constitution suspended. The military council will be in place for a maximum of two years, it says, but could last only a month if the transition to civilian rule is managed smoothly. Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? Lt-Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin, who heads the military council's political committee, said on Friday: ""The solutions will be devised by those in protest. ""You, the people, will provide the solutions for all economic and political issues. We have come with no ideology, we have come here to maintain order and security to provide the opportunity for the people of Sudan to achieve the change they aspire to. Allow Twitter content?

""We have no ambition to hold the reins of power. We are here to provide an all-inclusive umbrella. ""Our key responsibility is to maintain public order,"" he added. ""We will have zero tolerance for any misdeed in any corner of the country."" Later on Friday state media said the military had asked political parties to name representatives for a meeting with coup leaders at a later date. Thousands remained camped out near military headquarters in the capital on Friday, ignoring a curfew declared by the military. They are demanding a transition to civilian rule before they return home. The new military council is headed by Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, who was previously regarded as being well placed to succeed Mr Bashir. This video can not be played Thursday's coup announcement was made by the defence minister Awad Ibn Auf During the Darfur conflict, he was head of military intelligence.The US imposed sanctions on him in 2007,externalin relation to his alleged support for militia blamed for atrocities in Darfur. On Thursday Sara Abdeljalil, a member of the Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA) which has spearheaded the protests, called the new military council a ""continuation of the same regime"". ""So what we need to do is to continue the fight and the peaceful resistance,"" she said. This video can not be played Anti-Bashir protesters celebrate Reacting to the military's statement on Friday, Khartoum resident Tagreed Abdin told the BBC: ""We don't know who's behind the military council. ""We are used to hearing government double-speak but we need to see if they're really interested in dialogue and listening to the voices of the people."" The army said it had ruled out a violent response to the protests before Mr Bashir was overthrown because they didn't want the loss of life. It will be difficult (of course not impossible) to walk back on that. There is then the question of the dynamics within the army. Younger officers and rank and file will have been emboldened by their role and public reception during the protests. Will they be content to allow the Mr Bashir generation monopolise military power? And there's the economic crisis brought about by misrule, corruption and loss of oil revenues. Even the regime's friends in the Middle East and Asia will think twice about rescue packages if it looks like a new version of the old venality and brutality. That's an important pressure. This is an exciting moment. Just think about the role of women in all of this, of social media and civil society. It's happening in Sudan but the significance of these forces working peaceful for change is universal. Yes it's very precarious, but also full of possibility. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres appealed for ""calm and utmost restraint by all"" and urged a transition that would meet the ""democratic aspirations"" of the people. The UN Security Council is to discuss the situation in a closed-door meeting on Friday. UK Foreign SecretaryJeremy Hunt said that a two-year military council was ""not the answer"",externaland called for a ""swift move to an inclusive, representative, civilian leadership"". This video can not be played Sudan protests: So what's going on? The African Union condemned the military takeover, saying it was not an appropriate response to the challenges facing Sudan and the aspirations of its people. Russia, which twice hosted Mr Bashir despite the international travel ban he faced, called for calm. Have you been taking part in protests?

"Stormzy's cancelled his gig at Snowbombing festival in Austria after claiming members of his team had been racially profiled. He was expected to perform on Thursday night, but organisers announced he would no longer be appearing. In an Instagram story the rapper claimed his team were targeted while security were looking for a weapon. Organisers of the gig said they were sad that he had cancelled and that they had acted in accordance to protocol. Stormzy explained on his Instagram story why he pulled out of the gig The grime artist told his fans he had to cancel the gig to make a point about racism and racial profiling. He accused the security team of being aggressive while searching some of his team. ""My manager and all my friends who were at the festival were racially profiled, targeted and aggressively handled because they had reason to believe someone was carrying a weapon."" He added: ""The security targeted them (despite no one fitting the description), were physically aggressive when handling them and there's been no effort from the festival to actually deal and address the problem."" The festival confirmed to Radio 1 Newsbeat that his team were not escorted off the premises and Stormzy was not on-site at the time of the incident. In a statement on its website,externalthe festival said they were alerted to a possible security threat that an individual might have been carrying a weapon. Organisers explain that: ""A small number of attendees, including Stormzy's manager were escorted to the nearest exit, searched and no weapon was found."" Allow Twitter content?

The festival apologised to Stormzy and his team and added: ""We are doing everything we can to understand the full situation and are treating this with the utmost seriousness to ensure this does not happen again."" People at the festival were only told about the cancellation a few hours before Stormzy was due to perform, via an app that cost attendees Â£3 to download. ""To be honest, if what Stormzy says is true, I kind of see his reasoning for pulling out. No-one wants to tolerate racial abuse,"" says Chris, who's been in Mayrhofen for Snowbombing since Monday. ""Obviously it's bad for his fans that he left it until the day to pull out, but if he had no other choice, he's got to stand by what he believes in at the end of the day."" Stormzy also told his fans he was sorry for wasting their time and money. ""Again, deeply sorry to everyone who came but I need you to understand why this is necessary in the grand scheme of trying to fight back against racism."" Stormzy was due to headline Snowbombing alongside The Prodigy and Groove Armada. The Prodigy were replaced by a Chase & Status tribute show to The Prodigy, followingthe death of frontman Keith Flint.

"Disney+ will be accessible through smart TVs as well as smartphones and tablets Can an almost century-old company learn from its glorious past and create itself a brave new future? Coming to a small screen near youâ¦ eventually. Disney has finally announced its long-anticipated streaming service, but it wonât be available until November in North America - and in some markets, it will take much longer. Thatâs due to several factors, but mostly because Disney is still in the process of clawing back the rights to its content, sold to other streaming platforms before it had platform aspirations of its own. It will take as long as four years before all of the deals have expired, the firm said. The delay could hobble Disneyâs chances to succeed in the streaming market, described by chief executive Bob Iger as his âbiggest priorityâ. When it does eventually launch, however, Disney+ will be a streaming juggernaut. The service will bundle together some of the firmâs major franchises, including the work of Pixar, Marvel, National Geographic and Star Wars, for a monthly subscription price of $6.99, or $69.99 a year. Disney's Captain Marvel And because the firm has had its chequebook out lately - spending $70bn on 20th Century Fox - Disney+ will also incorporate content from recently acquired companies, such as the first 30 seasons of The Simpsons. More widely, Disney also owns sports network ESPN, which now has more than 2 million paid digital subscribers, and Indiaâs Hotstar - which enjoys 300m subscribers in a market predicted to continue to grow extremely quickly. Disney is also a majority owner in Hulu, the US streaming service that has plans to expand globally soon, the firm said. These are all big moves that place Disney right at the heart of a crowded but increasingly lucrative streaming market - one where being distinct is vital. Netflix expects to spend $15bn on new content this year to achieve this aim. Apple, last month, launched its Apple TV+ service, with help of Oprah and friends who will be creating exclusive content. Disneyâs strategy to reassure its investors, it seems, is to state that obvious: its been doing this for a very long time indeed. The launch of Disney+ took place in a fitting location that has seen plenty of transformation over the past few decades: Sound Stage 2, on the firmâs iconic, sprawling Los Angeles campus. Built in 1949, the studio was the space where the original Mary Poppins was filmed, as well as, decades later, Pirates of the Caribbean. Both heralded new technologies in filmmaking. Disney+ will be the exclusive home of Star Wars films and other spin-off content But, Disneyâs illustrious past could end up being a hindrance. It sold 900m movie tickets last year, bringing in more than $7bn in box office revenue. It canât afford to lose the core of its business, and so it will keep its big name content off Disney+ until well after its traditional run-out in the cinema and home entertainment sales (as in, buying it on Blu-Ray, or downloading it). Disney+ subscribers will instead get additional content, mini-series based on characters in the new films, or behind the scenes footage. There will be straight-to-Disney+ films available when the service goes live, such as Christmas film Noelle, starring Anna Kendrick, and a remake of Lady and the Tramp. These films will be made with âall the careâ of typical Disney movies, the company promised, but as with straight-to-video in years gone by, consumers will surely not see them as being in the same league. Higher hopes will be pinned on exclusive series made for Disney+, such as The Mandalorian, a the first live-action Star Wars TV series - which will be on the service from launch. This is an expensive endeavour for Disney. It doesnât expect Disney+ to turn a profit until 2023 at the earliest, and in the meantime it is losing out on revenue it was getting by selling on its content to other streaming providers - it was getting $150m from Netflix alone, according to reports. The company already has a streaming service in the UK called Disney Life. It has not announced whether this service will close when Disney+ arrives. At $6.99 a month, Disney is laying down a huge challenge to Apple, which hasn't yet told customers how much its service will cost when it too launches later this year. Above all, though, the unanswered question remains: just how many subscription services can the public take? A generation of delighted âcord cuttersâ, who cancelled traditional TV subscriptions in favour of streaming, might soon start to wonder how much it might cost just to, you know, plug the cord back in.

"This video can not be played Nigel Farage: ""No more Mr Nice Guy."" Ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage has launched his new Brexit Party, saying he wants a ""democratic revolution"" in UK politics. Speaking in Coventry, he said May's expected European elections were the party's ""first step"" but its ""first task"" was to ""change politics"". ""I said that if I did come back into the political fray it would be no more Mr Nice Guy and I mean it,"" he said. But UKIP dismissed the Brexit Party as a ""vehicle"" for Mr Farage. The launch comes after Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament. This means the UK is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. PM defends Brexit delay to MPs How the UK is gearing up for European elections How do European elections work? UKIP leader defends hiring Tommy Robinson Mr Farage said the Brexit Party had an ""impressive list"" of 70 candidates for the elections. Among those revealed at the launch was Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of leading Conservative Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Mr Farage said: ""This party is not here just to fight the European elections... this party is not just to express our anger - 23 May is the first step of the Brexit Party. We will change politics for good."" He said he was ""angry, but this is not a negative emotion, this is a positive emotion"". The party had already received Â£750,000 online over 10 days, he said, made up of small donations of up to Â£500. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of leading Conservative Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, was revealed as a Brexit Party candidate Ms Rees-Mogg said she had stuck with the Conservatives ""through thick and thin"", but added: ""We've got to rescue our democracy, we have got to show that the people of this country have a say in how we are run."" Annunziata Rees-Mogg joined the Conservative Party, at the age of five, in 1984. She says she canvassed for the party from the age of eight. The sister of Conservative Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, Ms Rees-Mogg stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate in the 2005 and 2010 general elections. The freelance journalist has written for the Daily Telegraph, MoneyWeek and the European. Earlier, Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""In terms of policy, there's no difference (to UKIP), but in terms of personnel there is a vast difference. ""UKIP did struggle to get enough good people into it but unfortunately what it's chosen to do is allow the far right to join it and take it over and I'm afraid the brand is now tarnished."" He promised the Brexit Party would be ""deeply intolerant of all intolerance"" and would represent a cross-section of society. UKIP leader Gerard Batten said the Brexit Party was ""just a vehicle"" for Nigel Farage UKIP leader Gerard Battentweeted,externalthat Mr Farage's suggestion that there was no difference in policy between UKIP and the Brexit Party was ""a lie"". He said: ""UKIP has a manifesto and policies. Farage's party is just a vehicle for him."" He said the Brexit Party's ""only purpose is to re-elect him (Mr Farage)"" and was a ""Tory/Establishment safety valve"".

"Local authorities are paying for places for children in settings that are not even registered, Ofsted is warning. England's education watchdog has called for tougher rules on tackling illegal ""schools"" with risks of poor conditions and a lack of safeguarding. Inspectors suggest 6,000 children are taught in such unregulated settings. But the watchdog said councils were subsidising these unregistered alternatives to school, paying up to Â£27,000 a year for places. Ofsted has published its most detailed breakdown of the problem of children being taught in uninspected and unregistered settings. Sue Will, senior officer for unregistered schools, said some had ""quite appalling"" conditions, with unsafe accommodation and unqualified staff. She said inspectors had come across places with rat traps, holes in the wall and exposed electrics. Since 2016, inspectors have investigated more than 530 unregistered settings - with the biggest number being so-called ""alternative provision"". Two convicted of running illegal schools Action against illegal schools promised by ministers Ofsted warns of 'squalid' illegal schools Abuse concerns over unregistered schools Is there a problem with unregistered schools? These can be for pupils who have been taken out of mainstream schools or who have been excluded. Ofsted says almost 150 investigations have been in alternative provision settings which were without any registration. These can be very poor quality, say inspectors - and instead of getting an education, teenagers ""languish, wasting their time"" playing on computer games. These are private operations, but inspectors say some places are funded with public money. Ofsted would not name the location, but its inspectors have issued a formal warning to an alternative provision centre receiving Â£27,000 a year per child from the local authority. Last autumn, in a landmark court case, two people in London becamethe first to be convicted of running an illegal school. But inspectors said that many children were still being taught in this ""murky world"", with the biggest number in London and the West Midlands. Ofsted inspectors found ""appalling"" conditions in some classrooms Councils funding unregistered schools Victor Shafiee, in charge of Ofsted's efforts to tackle unregistered schools, says it was often the ""least capable looking after the most vulnerable"". ""These are not well-run, well-organised places. It's hapless people who don't know what they're doing - and that puts children at risk,"" said Mr Shafiee. About one in five of the places under investigation had links to religious groups - and among these the most common were Muslim, with a smaller number of Jewish and Christian settings. Inspectors warned that some parents were misusing the label of ""home schooling"", when they were really sending their children to these unregistered centres each day. From the 530 places under investigation, there have been 71 warnings issued - and Mr Shafiee said there were two more court cases expected. While councils might have paid for some places in alternative provision centres, most settings were collecting fees from parents, often of about Â£2,500 per year. Inspectors said this was ""unfathomable"" considering families could get free places at local state schools. But Ofsted officials warned of the difficulties of enforcing school registration, when there was ambiguity about the definition of what constituted a school. The guidelines suggest that anywhere teaching five or more school-age children for more than 18 hours per week should be seen as schools and as such, required to be registered. Ofsted's Victor Shafiee said it was often hard for inspectors to gain access to unregistered premises But inspectors said some of these ""tuition centres"", or ""alternative provision"" classes or other settings, might say they teach for only 17 hours and 50 minutes and so seek to remain exempt from registration. Proving whether these are really operating as full-time schools is very difficult, the Ofsted inspectors argued. When Ofsted tries to check, Mr Shafiee said there can be a ""rigmarole"" of trying to gain entry, giving schools time to conceal what they are doing. They also had no right to seize documents or registers that would indicate that these premises were open longer than the 18-hour-a-week mark. Sean Harford, Ofsted's national director of education, said inspectors were hampered by ""significant limitations on our powers to search, to take evidence and to close them down"". ""The problem here is first and foremost about safeguarding. Many of these places are unsafe - with poor facilities and hygiene, badly trained or untrained staff,"" said Mr Shafiee. ""These settings deny children a proper education and can leave them at risk of harm,"" he said. A Department for Education spokesman said Ofsted had been given Â£3m to tackle unregistered schools and to ""make sure illegal activity is uncovered and justice is delivered"". He said Ofsted's report showed the importance of plans to introduce a register of children not being taught in school. Unregulated schools ""present a danger to both the quality of education and the welfare of those children who attend them"", said the DfE spokesman.

"The 83-year-old was admitted to the Max hospital in Delhi and treated for a chest infection The Dalai Lama has been discharged from a Delhi hospital, three days after being admitted with a chest infection. The Tibetan spiritual leader, 83, had suffered from a ""light cough"" but was ""doing very well"", his spokesman said. The Dalai Lama fled to India 60 years ago as Chinese troops crushed an attempted uprising in Tibet. He lives in exile in the city of Dharamsala. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his opposition to violence in his quest for Tibetan self-rule. ""He was discharged from the hospital at eight o'clock in the morning (02:30 GMT),"" his spokesman Tenzin Taklha told AFP news agency on Friday. The Dalai Lama is expected to spend several days resting in Delhi before returning to Dharamsala. A glimpse into the private life of the Dalai Lama China, which took control of Tibet in 1950, views the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist. The question of who will succeed him when he dies is highly contentious. China says its leaders have the right to choose his successor. But last month, the Dalai Lama reiterated that any leader named by China would not be accepted by Tibetans. In Tibetan Buddhist belief, the soul of its most senior lama is reincarnated into the body of a child.

"Brunei said the aim of implementing Sharia, or Islamic law, was to ""educate and deter"" Brunei's foreign ministry has said implementing Sharia law is about prevention rather than punishment, after intense criticism of its decision to implement the strict Islamic code. Under the new laws, adultery and sex between men is punishable by stoning to death. Brunei said there would be a high threshold for evidence in those cases, suggesting punishment would be rare. It comes after the UN called the punishments ""cruel and inhuman"". Brunei has sent a response from Erywan Yusof, the minister of foreign affairs, to the United Nation's (UN) criticism,externalsaying Sharia law ""focuses more on prevention than punishment. Its aim is to educate, deter, rehabilitate and nurture rather than to punish"". It also said Sharia does not criminalise based on sexual orientation or belief, including same-sex relations. The criminalisation of ""adultery and sodomy is to safeguard the sanctity of family lineage and marriage of individual Muslims, particularly women"", according to the statement. Brunei is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah The statement also clarified that for the maximum punishments of amputation or death to be carried out in the case of certain crimes, at least two men of ""high moral standing and piety"" would have to bear witness. It added that these men would have to live up to ""extremely high"" standards, making it ""[extremely] difficult to find one in this day and age"". UK Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt also said on Thursday he had spoken to the Bruneian foreign minister who had suggested that Sharia prosecutions were, in practice, unlikely. Brunei: What you need to know How people in Brunei are reacting to anti-LGBT laws The statement from Brunei's foreign ministry comes in response to the UN's criticism of the country's decision to implement the second phase of Sharia law on 3 April. This video can not be played ""As a kid... we were taught the stones should not be too big"" The first phase of Sharia law, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights sent a letter on 1 April to the Brunei mission,externalin Geneva warning that the planned implementation of the new laws contravened international human rights standards set out in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights - which was ratified by Brunei in 2006. Regardless, Brunei went ahead with the implementation of the new laws, under the continued phasing in of Sharia alongside common law. Under the new laws, individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present. Offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad will carry the maximum penalty of death. Lesbian sex carries a different penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail. The maximum punishment for theft is amputation. The decision to implement the strict Islamic laws sparked global condemnation, with celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and others calling for a boycott of the Dorchester Collection group of hotels owned by Brunei's investment agency. The decision threw the tiny oil-rich South East Asian nation into the global spotlight and sparked international outrage.

"Passengers are stranded in India and around the world after Jet Airways suspended all international flights. Flights from London, Paris and Amsterdam are among those grounded amid fears about the survival of India's largest private airline. The airline cancelled all international flights until Monday when, according to reports, it will meet its lenders again to try to secure funding. Jet Airways is saddled with more than $1bn (Â£765m) of debt. It is seeking a financial lifeline to avoid collapse and, on Thursday,grounded 10 planes over unpaid fees to leasing firms,external. These were the latest flights to be grounded and it was not clear how many of its fleet of more than 100 planes was still in operation. Local reports suggested that it was barely a dozen. The airline flies on 600 domestic and 380 international routes - but carriers in India must maintain a fleet of least 20 aircraft to continue to operate international services. Jet Airways founder steps down amid crisis The riches to rags story of Jet Airways From London, the airline initially confirmed it had cancelled its flights between London, Paris and Amsterdam and India for 12 April, but later said that all international flights would be cancelled between 12 and 15 April. It said it ""regrets the inconvenience caused"" to its passengers and was ""working to minimise guest inconvenience"". ""In parallel, the airline's management and its key stakeholders including its consortium of lenders, continue to work closely towards resolving the current situation,"" it said. There was no statement about the status of domestic flights. Sandeep Kooner and her three children had been expecting to be on a flight from London to India on Friday evening to attend her niece's wedding in Punjab. But the 40 year-old who lives in Walsall will now miss the first few days of the week-long celebrations after her Jet Airways flight was cancelled. ""I had just sat down in the nail salon when I got a text message to say my flight had been cancelled,"" she told the BBC. She has now arranged to fly with Air India, but that will be days later and to Delhi - an eight hour drive to her destination - rather than a local one. ""I'm not 100% sure my problem is 100% sorted,"" she says. Television channels in India reported that the prime minister's office had called for an urgent meeting to discuss the airline. They also reported remarks by government officials saying Jet Airways only had  funds to operate six to seven aircraft over the weekend. India's Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, had tweeted that his ministry would ""review issues related to Jet Airways"" and ""take necessary steps to minimise passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety"".

By Sameer Hashmi, India business correspondent In March, when the crisis at Jet Airways led to thousands of flights being cancelled, the government immediately stepped in and asked public sector banks to rescue the private carrier. It was a rare move. With India holding a national election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government did not want the airline to be grounded as that would have affected 23,000 jobs. The lenders which took control of the airline have only released a fraction of the amount they had promised so the airline has not been able to pay aircraft leasing companies. This means its fleet has shrunk further from the 100-plus it had at the start of the year. The lenders have started accepting bids from potential investors, but that process will take a couple of months to complete. And many analysts fear that Jet Airways will not survive even a week if immediate cash is not provided to keep the operations running. The airline was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago and he and his family currently own 52% of the airline, although that majority stake is expected to be lost as lenders' restructure the debt. A consortium of investors led by the State Bank of India (SBI) took control of the airline in March. The group is searching for a new investor to acquire a stake of up to 75% in Jet Airways.  The deadline for bids had been extended to Friday, according to reports. Ellis Taylor, deputy Asia editor of Flight Global, told the BBC the airline was in a ""precarious position"". ""The interim lifeline that the carrier talked about two weeks ago looks like it won't materialise any time soon, and that really leaves its future looking bleak,"" he said. There were reports in local media that India's aviation ministry might review the regulations setting the fleet cap, which could allow the airline to resume international services.

"Royal Birkdale has hosted some of golf's biggest events A man has died after a powered paraglider crashed near to the Royal Birkdale Golf Club. The aircraft crashed on land next to the famous course -  which has hosted 10 Open Championships -  at about 19:00 BST on Thursday and burst in to flames. Merseyside Police said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. ""We are still establishing the facts and the identity of the person and inquiries are ongoing,"" a police spokesman said. Police confirmed the aircraft involved was a paramotor. It consists of a motor-driven propeller, worn like a backpack under a paraglider wing, according to the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association. Royal Birkdale said the crash happened on council-owned land adjacent to the club, in Southport, and the course was unaffected.

"Online grocery shopping in the UK is set to grow more slowly, with customers worried about order problems and delivery charges, research indicates. Last year, 45% of consumers said they shopped for groceries online, down from 49% in 2016, said analysts Mintel. Mintel also found 42% of older people said they had never bought groceries online and had no interest in doing so. The survey of 2,000 internet users found that 63% said they had had an issue with an order in the past year. Mintel's associate director of retail research, Nick Carroll, said: ""Online grocery is, alongside the food discounters, one of the fastest-growing segments within the wider grocery sector. ""However, growth is slowing and the number of users is plateauing as retailers struggle to encourage new customers to try their services."" Last year, online grocery deliveries made up 7% of the whole sector, with a value of Â£12.3bn. Mintel said this was forecast to hit 10% by 2023, with sales rising to Â£19.8bn. The survey found evidence of a disparity between enthusiastic younger people and sceptical older shoppers who were suspicious of online grocery shopping. Only 35% of those aged 45 and over had used such services. Of those who refused to shop online, 73% said they preferred to choose fresh products themselves. Nearly a quarter - 24% - of reluctant online shoppers thought delivery charges were too high, while 18% did not like being subject to minimum spending levels. Among those who had used online grocery services, complaints included missing products, late deliveries, incorrect substitutions and receiving goods that were damaged or close to their expiry dates. Online grocery shopping is an increasingly important factor in the strategies of big food retailers, notably with Marks & Spencer spending Â£750m to acquirea 50% share of online firm Ocado's retail business. However, Mintel's Mr Carroll also pointed out that not all shopping trends were working in favour of the internet. He said: ""Most importantly, online services are still best suited to the traditional big-basket weekly shop, at a time when consumers are increasingly shopping on a top-up or when-needed basis.""

"One of the last photos taken by Beresheet of the moon's surface before it crashed The first privately funded mission to the Moon has crashed on the lunar surface after the apparent failure of its main engine. The Israeli spacecraft - called Beresheet - attempted a soft touchdown, but suffered technical problems on its descent to the lunar surface. The aim of the mission was to take pictures and conduct experiments. Only government space agencies from the former Soviet Union, the US and China have achieved soft lunar landings. Israel hoped to become the fourth country to do this. ""We didn't make it, but we definitely tried,"" said project originator and major backer Morris Kahn. ""I think that the achievement of getting to where we got is really tremendous; I think we can be proud,"" he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, watching from the control room near Tel Aviv, said: ""If at first you don't succeed, you try again."" After a seven-week  journey to the Moon, the robotic spacecraft approached a final orbit at 15km (9 miles) from the surface. Tensions were high in the command centre as communications were lost before Opher Doron, the general manager of Israel Aerospace Industries' space division, announced there had been a failure in the spacecraft. ""We unfortunately have not managed to land successfully,"" he said. There was disappointment in the crowd following events from outside the control room in Yehud The audience outside had been through a turbulent journey themselves as they watched the first part of the landing go to plan. As Mr Doron announced that the engine had cut out, groans filled the room. ""We are resetting the spacecraft to try to enable the engine,"" he said. The engine came on seconds later and the audience applauded, only for communication with the spacecraft to be lost shortly after. The mission was over. The project has cost about $100m (Â£76m) and has paved the way for future low-cost lunar exploration. Dr Kimberly Cartier, an astronomer and science news reporter, tweeted that she was ""sad about how #Beresheet ended"" but ""proud of the entire @TeamSpaceIL"". Allow Twitter content?

Beresheet, which is Hebrew for ""in the beginning"", was a joint project between SpaceIL, a privately funded Israeli non-profit organisation, and Israel Aerospace Industries. In space terms, the Moon is a mere hop from the Earth, and most missions take a few days to get there. But the Beresheet mission, which launched on 22 February from Cape Canaveral in Florida, spent weeks reaching its destination. Its journey took it on a series of ever-widening orbits around the Earth, before being captured by the Moon's gravity and moving into lunar orbit on 4 April. The spacecraft launched on a SpaceX rocket in February The average distance to the Moon is 380,000km (240,000 miles) - Beresheet travelled more than 15 times that distance. And the main thing driving this was cost. Instead of sitting alone on a rocket that would put it on the perfect trajectory to the Moon, it blasted off on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket along with a communications satellite and an experimental aircraft. Sharing the ride into space significantly reduced its launch costs - but it meant the spacecraft had to take a more convoluted route. The spacecraft enlarged its path around Earth until it was captured by the Moon's gravity A controlled landing on the lunar surface was the major challenge for the Israeli spacecraft. The engine was British-built, developed by Nammo in Westcott, Buckinghamshire. It provided the power to get the spacecraft all the way to the Moon, but it also took Beresheet on its final descent. The 1.5m-tall spacecraft had to rapidly reduce its speed, so a final firing of the engine in effect slammed on the brakes, hoping to take the spacecraft to a gentle stop. Before the landing, Rob Westcott, senior propulsion engineer at Nammo, said ""We've never used an engine in this kind of application before"". He said the big challenge would be ""the fact that the engine is going to have to be switched on and get very hot, then switched off for a short period of time when all that heat is remaining in its thermal mass, and then fired up again, very accurately and very precisely such that it slows the craft down and lands very softly on the surface on the Moon"". That landing process took around 20 minutes. All of the controls for this were uploaded and performed autonomously with mission control watching on. Its first job was to use its high-resolution cameras to take some photos - including a selfie - which it did manage before the crash. It was then going to measure the magnetic field of the spot it landed in, an area known as Mare Serenitatis. Monica Grady, professor of planetary and space science at Open University, said it would be ""looking at the landing site really closely"". This would help ""work out how the magnetic measurements of the Moon fit in with the geology and geography of the Moon, which is really important to understand how the Moon formed"". The lander also carried a reflector from Nasa to help scientists make accurate measurements of the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Temperatures on the Moon are extreme, and as the Sun rose the spacecraft would have been unlikely to survive the heat. The spacecraft was due to study the Moon's magnetism while on the lunar surface Over 60 years of space exploration, only a few nations have made it down on to the Moon. The former Soviet Union achieved the first soft landing with its spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966. Nasa followed this by getting the first humans to the Moon in 1969.  In 2008, India's space agency fired an impact probe, which intentionally crashed into the Moon's south pole. Then, China's Change-4 spacecraft touched down on the farside of the Moon earlier this year. If their landing had worked, Israel would have been the latest nation to join this elite club. But it was the low-price tag - and the fact that the mission was not funded by a major space agency - that was significant. A photo taken by the spacecraft of the earth from a distance of 37,600 km (23400m) Beresheet was not alone in pursuing low-cost lunar exploration. Its origins lie in the Google Lunar XPrize, an international challenge offering $20m for the first privately developed spacecraft to land on the Moon. And while the competition ended last year after no-one was able to meet its deadline (the foundation has subsequently announced they will award the Beresheet collaboration $1m for their achievement), other teams involved are also continuing with their efforts to get to the Moon. Both Nasa and Esa have also announced their intention to use commercial landers to deliver scientific payloads to the lunar surface.

"Local authorities are paying for places for children in settings that are not even registered, Ofsted is warning. England's education watchdog has called for tougher rules on tackling illegal ""schools"" with risks of poor conditions and a lack of safeguarding. Inspectors suggest 6,000 children are taught in such unregulated settings. But the watchdog said councils were subsidising these unregistered alternatives to school, paying up to Â£27,000 a year for places. Ofsted has published its most detailed breakdown of the problem of children being taught in uninspected and unregistered settings. Sue Will, senior officer for unregistered schools, said some had ""quite appalling"" conditions, with unsafe accommodation and unqualified staff. She said inspectors had come across places with rat traps, holes in the wall and exposed electrics. Since 2016, inspectors have investigated more than 530 unregistered settings - with the biggest number being so-called ""alternative provision"". Two convicted of running illegal schools Action against illegal schools promised by ministers Ofsted warns of 'squalid' illegal schools Abuse concerns over unregistered schools Is there a problem with unregistered schools? These can be for pupils who have been taken out of mainstream schools or who have been excluded. Ofsted says almost 150 investigations have been in alternative provision settings which were without any registration. These can be very poor quality, say inspectors - and instead of getting an education, teenagers ""languish, wasting their time"" playing on computer games. These are private operations, but inspectors say some places are funded with public money. Ofsted would not name the location, but its inspectors have issued a formal warning to an alternative provision centre receiving Â£27,000 a year per child from the local authority. Last autumn, in a landmark court case, two people in London becamethe first to be convicted of running an illegal school. But inspectors said that many children were still being taught in this ""murky world"", with the biggest number in London and the West Midlands. Ofsted inspectors found ""appalling"" conditions in some classrooms Councils funding unregistered schools Victor Shafiee, in charge of Ofsted's efforts to tackle unregistered schools, says it was often the ""least capable looking after the most vulnerable"". ""These are not well-run, well-organised places. It's hapless people who don't know what they're doing - and that puts children at risk,"" said Mr Shafiee. About one in five of the places under investigation had links to religious groups - and among these the most common were Muslim, with a smaller number of Jewish and Christian settings. Inspectors warned that some parents were misusing the label of ""home schooling"", when they were really sending their children to these unregistered centres each day. From the 530 places under investigation, there have been 71 warnings issued - and Mr Shafiee said there were two more court cases expected. While councils might have paid for some places in alternative provision centres, most settings were collecting fees from parents, often of about Â£2,500 per year. Inspectors said this was ""unfathomable"" considering families could get free places at local state schools. But Ofsted officials warned of the difficulties of enforcing school registration, when there was ambiguity about the definition of what constituted a school. The guidelines suggest that anywhere teaching five or more school-age children for more than 18 hours per week should be seen as schools and as such, required to be registered. Ofsted's Victor Shafiee said it was often hard for inspectors to gain access to unregistered premises But inspectors said some of these ""tuition centres"", or ""alternative provision"" classes or other settings, might say they teach for only 17 hours and 50 minutes and so seek to remain exempt from registration. Proving whether these are really operating as full-time schools is very difficult, the Ofsted inspectors argued. When Ofsted tries to check, Mr Shafiee said there can be a ""rigmarole"" of trying to gain entry, giving schools time to conceal what they are doing. They also had no right to seize documents or registers that would indicate that these premises were open longer than the 18-hour-a-week mark. Sean Harford, Ofsted's national director of education, said inspectors were hampered by ""significant limitations on our powers to search, to take evidence and to close them down"". ""The problem here is first and foremost about safeguarding. Many of these places are unsafe - with poor facilities and hygiene, badly trained or untrained staff,"" said Mr Shafiee. ""These settings deny children a proper education and can leave them at risk of harm,"" he said. A Department for Education spokesman said Ofsted had been given Â£3m to tackle unregistered schools and to ""make sure illegal activity is uncovered and justice is delivered"". He said Ofsted's report showed the importance of plans to introduce a register of children not being taught in school. Unregulated schools ""present a danger to both the quality of education and the welfare of those children who attend them"", said the DfE spokesman.

"Abortion services in England must provide a more consistent service to women, the NHS says. The call comes from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - the official NHS advisory body - in its first abortion guidance. The draft proposal says women should be offered an appointment within a week and a termination a week after that. All services should also accept self-referrals rather than expecting women to see a GP first, it adds. NICE said most services do this, but some hospitals still expect women to get a GP referral too, whereas private clinics that carry out abortions for the NHS tend to accept self-referrals. This requirement does not change the need to get two doctors to agree to the termination - that is still required, but can be done by the clinic's own doctors. All services should be able to offer women the option of surgical or medical abortions and if they cannot, they should refer women to a service that can. The guidance also reflects the change in the rules - announced last year -that women who have a medical abortion before 10 weeks should be able to have the second of the two pills at home, to avoid the risk of women miscarrying while on the journey home. Paul Chrisp, of NICE, said: ""Choosing to terminate a pregnancy is an important part of reproductive health for many women, which is why it's essential that providers are able to offer consistent support and advice."" Prof Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which helped to draw up the guidance, added it should ""help address significant barriers that women experience"". But Clare McCarthy, of the campaign group Right to Life, said the guidance would have the effect of ""rushing"" women through a termination which could cause ""post-abortion regret"". The proposals are out for consultation until the end of May.

"Royal Birkdale has hosted some of golf's biggest events A man has died after a powered paraglider crashed near to the Royal Birkdale Golf Club. The aircraft crashed on land next to the famous course -  which has hosted 10 Open Championships -  at about 19:00 BST on Thursday and burst in to flames. Merseyside Police said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. ""We are still establishing the facts and the identity of the person and inquiries are ongoing,"" a police spokesman said. Police confirmed the aircraft involved was a paramotor. It consists of a motor-driven propeller, worn like a backpack under a paraglider wing, according to the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.

"This video can not be played Gina Martin campaigned for the law to be changed after a man took a picture up her skirt Upskirting is now a criminal offence in England and Wales after a campaign by a woman targeted at a music festival. Offenders will face up to two years in prison for taking an image or video under somebody's clothing in order to see their genitals or underwear. Gina Martin, who led the calls for change, said she hoped the change in law would help people ""feel comfortable"" to report such crimes. It is already a specific crime in Scotland butnot in Northern Ireland. Speaking on the day the law came into effect, Ms Martin called on people to report upskirting when they see it happen. She told BBC News: ""If a new law's there, great - but if we don't know about it or aren't reporting it, [then] it doesn't do anything. ""We have to build a picture of how much this happens, because it happens a lot."" Prime Minister Theresa May described upskirting,externalas ""degrading and humiliating"" and said offenders should ""feel the full force of the law"". I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Upskirting ban 'also protects men in kilts' Ms Martin, 27, was waiting to watch The Killers perform at the British Summer Time music festival in London's Hyde Park in July 2017 when a man put his phone between her legs and took pictures. After informing the police, she was shocked to discover upskirting was not a specific offence and the case had been closed. A few days later she wrote about what had happened on Facebook. Her post went viral with other women sharing similar experiences. Soon an online petition calling for police to reopen the case had received 50,000 signatures. She alsowrote a feature for the BBC News website explaining her battle, recalling the dramatic moment she chased after the man who had taken the unwanted photo. Gina Martin could not believe upskirting was not already a criminal offence It wasn't long before the campaign was picked up by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse. Encouraged by government ministers, she brought a private members' bill backing the creation of an upskirting offence. Her bill was expected to sail through the Commons, but parliamentary rules meant it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. The bill was initially blocked by a Tory backbench MP, in a move which was widely criticised. This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill However, Ms Martin's campaign secured government backing on 15 July last year and the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill was put before Parliament days later. The new legislation was approved in the House of Lords and has now passed the formality of Royal Assent to become law. At the time, Ms Martin said: ""To the outsider, the ordinary person, law and politics are complex and daunting. But both are penetrable if you believe in yourself and find the right support."" She said the experience had been a ""steep learning curve"" in how the political system works - but that the decision was ""politics and society at its best"". By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Until now offenders could only be prosecuted for voyeurism or outraging public decency. But voyeurism only applies to filming in ""private"" while outraging public decency usually requires a witness - and upskirting often goes unobserved. So, following tireless campaigning by Gina Martin, the government has created a specific offence of upskirting where the purpose is to obtain sexual gratification, or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm. It covers culprits who say images were just taken ""for a laugh"", and paparazzi who take intrusive images. The new offences apply in instances when: Without consent, a person takes pictures beneath a person's clothing to observe their genitals or buttocks, whether covered or uncovered by underwear The offender has a motive of either gaining sexual gratification or causing humiliation, distress or alarm to the victim TheVoyeurism (Offences) Act 2019,externalalso ensures that the most serious offenders, where the purpose of the offence is for sexual gratification, are made subject to notification requirements (often referred to as being placed on the sex offenders' register). New police figures show that more people are reporting upskirting. Data obtained by the Press Association shows that the number of reported incidents rose from a total of 78 between April 2015 and April 2017 to 94 for the whole of 2018. The vast majority of cases involve female victims and male perpetrators, according to the data released by police forces under Freedom of Information laws. The police forces gave details of the incidents reported to them last year, with victims including pensioners and schoolchildren. One case involved a 70-year-old woman, Essex Police said. The same force was involved in a case where a suspect was charged with indecency after upskirt images of a child aged between seven and nine were discovered in his possession. Campaigners from a children's charity, Plan International UK, suggest that the problem could be more widespread than official figures show. The charity says its own research, which surveyed 1,004 girls in the UK aged between 14-21, found that one in 10 girls have experienced upskirting, and 52% didn't tell anyone about what happened to them. Lucy Russell, head of girls' rights and youth at the charity, said: ""The government is recognising that street harassment is not OK, which is a huge step forward. ""However, street harassment has become so normalised that girls are telling us they aren't speaking out about it because they're too embarrassed or think they won't be taken seriously."" She suggested more action should be taken at local level to encourage women to report offences. This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Before the law was passed victims and police in England and Wales were only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism. Unlike other sexual offences, victims of those crimes do not have automatic anonymity. The Ministry of Justice said the new law ""bans the degrading practice to deter perpetrators, better protect victims, and bring more offenders to justice"". Justice Minister Lucy Frazer added: ""We have always been clear - there are no excuses for this behaviour and offenders should feel the full force of the law. From today, they will. ""By taking decisive action and working closely with Gina Martin and other campaigners, we have ensured more people are protected from this degrading and humiliating practice."" In Northern Ireland, upskirting is still not a specific offence although the Department of Justice (DoJ) haslaunched a consultation on potential changes to legislation.

"One of the last photos taken by Beresheet of the moon's surface before it crashed The first privately funded mission to the Moon has crashed on the lunar surface after the apparent failure of its main engine. The Israeli spacecraft - called Beresheet - attempted a soft touchdown, but suffered technical problems on its descent to the lunar surface. The aim of the mission was to take pictures and conduct experiments. Only government space agencies from the former Soviet Union, the US and China have achieved soft lunar landings. Israel hoped to become the fourth country to do this. ""We didn't make it, but we definitely tried,"" said project originator and major backer Morris Kahn. ""I think that the achievement of getting to where we got is really tremendous; I think we can be proud,"" he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, watching from the control room near Tel Aviv, said: ""If at first you don't succeed, you try again."" After a seven-week  journey to the Moon, the robotic spacecraft approached a final orbit at 15km (9 miles) from the surface. Tensions were high in the command centre as communications were lost before Opher Doron, the general manager of Israel Aerospace Industries' space division, announced there had been a failure in the spacecraft. ""We unfortunately have not managed to land successfully,"" he said. There was disappointment in the crowd following events from outside the control room in Yehud The audience outside had been through a turbulent journey themselves as they watched the first part of the landing go to plan. As Mr Doron announced that the engine had cut out, groans filled the room. ""We are resetting the spacecraft to try to enable the engine,"" he said. The engine came on seconds later and the audience applauded, only for communication with the spacecraft to be lost shortly after. The mission was over. The project has cost about $100m (Â£76m) and has paved the way for future low-cost lunar exploration. Dr Kimberly Cartier, an astronomer and science news reporter, tweeted that she was ""sad about how #Beresheet ended"" but ""proud of the entire @TeamSpaceIL"". Allow Twitter content?

Beresheet, which is Hebrew for ""in the beginning"", was a joint project between SpaceIL, a privately funded Israeli non-profit organisation, and Israel Aerospace Industries. In space terms, the Moon is a mere hop from the Earth, and most missions take a few days to get there. But the Beresheet mission, which launched on 22 February from Cape Canaveral in Florida, spent weeks reaching its destination. Its journey took it on a series of ever-widening orbits around the Earth, before being captured by the Moon's gravity and moving into lunar orbit on 4 April. The spacecraft launched on a SpaceX rocket in February The average distance to the Moon is 380,000km (240,000 miles) - Beresheet travelled more than 15 times that distance. And the main thing driving this was cost. Instead of sitting alone on a rocket that would put it on the perfect trajectory to the Moon, it blasted off on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket along with a communications satellite and an experimental aircraft. Sharing the ride into space significantly reduced its launch costs - but it meant the spacecraft had to take a more convoluted route. The spacecraft enlarged its path around Earth until it was captured by the Moon's gravity A controlled landing on the lunar surface was the major challenge for the Israeli spacecraft. The engine was British-built, developed by Nammo in Westcott, Buckinghamshire. It provided the power to get the spacecraft all the way to the Moon, but it also took Beresheet on its final descent. The 1.5m-tall spacecraft had to rapidly reduce its speed, so a final firing of the engine in effect slammed on the brakes, hoping to take the spacecraft to a gentle stop. Before the landing, Rob Westcott, senior propulsion engineer at Nammo, said ""We've never used an engine in this kind of application before"". He said the big challenge would be ""the fact that the engine is going to have to be switched on and get very hot, then switched off for a short period of time when all that heat is remaining in its thermal mass, and then fired up again, very accurately and very precisely such that it slows the craft down and lands very softly on the surface on the Moon"". That landing process took around 20 minutes. All of the controls for this were uploaded and performed autonomously with mission control watching on. Its first job was to use its high-resolution cameras to take some photos - including a selfie - which it did manage before the crash. It was then going to measure the magnetic field of the spot it landed in, an area known as Mare Serenitatis. Monica Grady, professor of planetary and space science at Open University, said it would be ""looking at the landing site really closely"". This would help ""work out how the magnetic measurements of the Moon fit in with the geology and geography of the Moon, which is really important to understand how the Moon formed"". The lander also carried a reflector from Nasa to help scientists make accurate measurements of the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Temperatures on the Moon are extreme, and as the Sun rose the spacecraft would have been unlikely to survive the heat. The spacecraft was due to study the Moon's magnetism while on the lunar surface Over 60 years of space exploration, only a few nations have made it down on to the Moon. The former Soviet Union achieved the first soft landing with its spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966. Nasa followed this by getting the first humans to the Moon in 1969.  In 2008, India's space agency fired an impact probe, which intentionally crashed into the Moon's south pole. Then, China's Change-4 spacecraft touched down on the farside of the Moon earlier this year. If their landing had worked, Israel would have been the latest nation to join this elite club. But it was the low-price tag - and the fact that the mission was not funded by a major space agency - that was significant. A photo taken by the spacecraft of the earth from a distance of 37,600 km (23400m) Beresheet was not alone in pursuing low-cost lunar exploration. Its origins lie in the Google Lunar XPrize, an international challenge offering $20m for the first privately developed spacecraft to land on the Moon. And while the competition ended last year after no-one was able to meet its deadline (the foundation has subsequently announced they will award the Beresheet collaboration $1m for their achievement), other teams involved are also continuing with their efforts to get to the Moon. Both Nasa and Esa have also announced their intention to use commercial landers to deliver scientific payloads to the lunar surface.

"Disney+ will be accessible through smart TVs as well as smartphones and tablets Can an almost century-old company learn from its glorious past and create itself a brave new future? Coming to a small screen near youâ¦ eventually. Disney has finally announced its long-anticipated streaming service, but it wonât be available until November in North America - and in some markets, it will take much longer. Thatâs due to several factors, but mostly because Disney is still in the process of clawing back the rights to its content, sold to other streaming platforms before it had platform aspirations of its own. It will take as long as four years before all of the deals have expired, the firm said. The delay could hobble Disneyâs chances to succeed in the streaming market, described by chief executive Bob Iger as his âbiggest priorityâ. When it does eventually launch, however, Disney+ will be a streaming juggernaut. The service will bundle together some of the firmâs major franchises, including the work of Pixar, Marvel, National Geographic and Star Wars, for a monthly subscription price of $6.99, or $69.99 a year. Disney's Captain Marvel And because the firm has had its chequebook out lately - spending $70bn on 20th Century Fox - Disney+ will also incorporate content from recently acquired companies, such as the first 30 seasons of The Simpsons. More widely, Disney also owns sports network ESPN, which now has more than 2 million paid digital subscribers, and Indiaâs Hotstar - which enjoys 300m subscribers in a market predicted to continue to grow extremely quickly. Disney is also a majority owner in Hulu, the US streaming service that has plans to expand globally soon, the firm said. These are all big moves that place Disney right at the heart of a crowded but increasingly lucrative streaming market - one where being distinct is vital. Netflix expects to spend $15bn on new content this year to achieve this aim. Apple, last month, launched its Apple TV+ service, with help of Oprah and friends who will be creating exclusive content. Disneyâs strategy to reassure its investors, it seems, is to state that obvious: its been doing this for a very long time indeed. The launch of Disney+ took place in a fitting location that has seen plenty of transformation over the past few decades: Sound Stage 2, on the firmâs iconic, sprawling Los Angeles campus. Built in 1949, the studio was the space where the original Mary Poppins was filmed, as well as, decades later, Pirates of the Caribbean. Both heralded new technologies in filmmaking. Disney+ will be the exclusive home of Star Wars films and other spin-off content But, Disneyâs illustrious past could end up being a hindrance. It sold 900m movie tickets last year, bringing in more than $7bn in box office revenue. It canât afford to lose the core of its business, and so it will keep its big name content off Disney+ until well after its traditional run-out in the cinema and home entertainment sales (as in, buying it on Blu-Ray, or downloading it). Disney+ subscribers will instead get additional content, mini-series based on characters in the new films, or behind the scenes footage. There will be straight-to-Disney+ films available when the service goes live, such as Christmas film Noelle, starring Anna Kendrick, and a remake of Lady and the Tramp. These films will be made with âall the careâ of typical Disney movies, the company promised, but as with straight-to-video in years gone by, consumers will surely not see them as being in the same league. Higher hopes will be pinned on exclusive series made for Disney+, such as The Mandalorian, a the first live-action Star Wars TV series - which will be on the service from launch. This is an expensive endeavour for Disney. It doesnât expect Disney+ to turn a profit until 2023 at the earliest, and in the meantime it is losing out on revenue it was getting by selling on its content to other streaming providers - it was getting $150m from Netflix alone, according to reports. The company already has a streaming service in the UK called Disney Life. It has not announced whether this service will close when Disney+ arrives. At $6.99 a month, Disney is laying down a huge challenge to Apple, which hasn't yet told customers how much its service will cost when it too launches later this year. Above all, though, the unanswered question remains: just how many subscription services can the public take? A generation of delighted âcord cuttersâ, who cancelled traditional TV subscriptions in favour of streaming, might soon start to wonder how much it might cost just to, you know, plug the cord back in.

"The arrest and expected extradition of Julian Assange has set into motion what could prove to be the most important free speech and free press case in our history. Or not. Assange has been charged with a single count of participating in the hacking of intelligence computers with Chelsea Manning to reveal controversial intelligence operations in the United States. For many, Assange is a journalist, a whistleblower, a hero. Yet for others in Washington, he is the man who embarrassed the establishment in Congress, the intelligence community and even the media. Those powerful foes are likely to bring considerable pressure to deny Assange a platform for highlighting the operations that led to massive civilian losses and undisclosed military strikes, the very type of information disclosed in the celebrating ""Pentagon Papers"" case involving the New York Times in the Vietnam War. For historians in both Great Britain and the United States, there should be something eerily familiar in this controversy. Almost 300 years ago, the foundations for American protections of the free press were laid in the trial of John Peter Zenger. The case has striking similarities to the pending prosecution of the Wikileaks founder. This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London In the case, the recently installed British governor William Cosby was the subject of an anonymous pamphlet that detailed his many abusive and corrupt practices in New York and New Jersey, from stealing Indian lands to pilfering the Treasury to rigging elections. Cosby ordered four editions of the Zenger's New York Weekly Journal publicly burned and arrested Zenger. He then installed a biased judge who held Zenger's defence lawyer in contempt. Despite using every means to punish Zenger for what Cosby called ""scandalous, virulent, false and seditious reflections"", the colonial jurors balked and acquitted him. The trial of Peter Zenger in New York in 1734 in which the printer was accused of libel It was the defining moment for the colonies and ultimately led to far stronger protections of journalists in the United States than in Britain, as embodied in the first amendment to the US constitution declaring that ""Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom... of the press."" Much has changed in the United States for the press, but perhaps not as much as we claim. The Justice Department crafted the charge to evade the constitutional concerns over the prosecution - and the unresolved status of Assange. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga By alleging that Assange was given a password and helped set up a cloud for Manning to share the data, the government is charging him not with the distribution of the material but actively participating in its theft. However, the unsealed indictment in Alexandria, Virginia, is remarkably thin on evidence that Assange played such an active role or used the password in question. Setting up a cloud for sharing information can easily be viewed as simply facilitating the anonymous disclosure from a source. Where reporters once arranged for drop spots, there are now digital equivalents for such exchanges. Assange gave a thumbs-up as he was taken to a London courthouse Rather than exploring reasons and effort to reveal controversial intelligence operations, Assange could be forced to confine his defence to the more mundane charge of ""computer intrusion"". Yet, the indictment is conspicuously thin on the evidence of that role. The government alleges that Manning gave ""a portion"" of a password ""to crack"" which ""was stored as a 'hash value' in a computer file that was accessible only by users with administrative-level privileges"". However, the government then says not that Assange arranged to crack the code but only that ""cracking the password would have allowed Manning to log onto the computers under a username that did not belong to her"". Such a measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source of disclosures of classified information. A van supporting Manning and Assange seen in London last week. Assange is likely to face more charges once he is in the United States. A superseding indictment might encompass the role Wikileaks played in publishing emails stolen from the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their part in the hack and alluded to Wikileaks in those indictments, although not by name. However, thus far, no Americans have been indicted for any alleged conspiracy with the Russians and, putting aside the narrative, Assange is so far being prosecuted for the same type of conduct as people messing with Netflix passwords. But for now, the US only wants to show under extradition laws that there is a reasonable basis for believing that Assange committed a crime in the United States. The government also wants to avoid any criminal charge that could result in the death penalty. Nevertheless, the Justice Department is likely to do what the British government failed to do with Zenger. It will focus its charges on insular acts like sharing passwords or hacking. By doing so, the government can file a motion (what's called a motion in limine) to prevent Assange from raising his motivations or the disclosure of the secret operations. It could be declared immaterial. The jury will not hear the type of evidence that Zenger's lawyers forced into his trial. Assange would look simply like some slightly creepy-looking Australian hacker. Activists at a 2011 rally to free Manning US Attorney Tracey McCormick in Virginia could succeed if she keeps any counts focused on such technical and narrow acts. It would be like reducing the whole of Macbeth to the final scene where Macduff beheads the King, and therefore revealing nothing about his motivation or history. Reduced to Act V, Macduff simply looks like a blood-soaked regicidal maniac, rather than an avenging hero saving the country from a tyrannical leader. To paraphrase Shakespeare, Wikileaks could not be vanquished until the Great Assange came to Capitol Hill. He is now likely on his way and the trial could make the Zenger trial look like a model of transparency and accuracy.

"Interior Minister MarÃ­a Paula Romo said a person ""close to Wikileaks"" had been arrested A man with close ties to Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange has been arrested while trying to leave Ecuador, the country's interior ministry says. Interior Minister MarÃ­a Paula Romo did not name the man but said he had been arrested for ""investigative purposes"". An unnamed government official told the Associated Press that the man is Ola Bini, a Swedish software developer. It comes just hours after Assange was himself arrested at the Ecuadorean embassy in London. ""A person close to Wikileaks, who has been residing in Ecuador, was arrested this afternoon when he was preparing to travel to Japan,"" Ecuador's interior ministry tweeted late on Thursday. The man has lived in Ecuador for several years and has frequently travelled to the country's London embassy where Assange had been staying, Ms Romo told CNN's Spanish language service. ""He has been detained simply for investigation purposes,"" she said. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga Why Ecuador ended Assange's stay in embassy An Ecuadorean official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that Mr Bini had been arrested at Quito Airport. As news of the arrest broke, friends and colleagues of Mr Bini expressed their concern on social media. ""I'm very concerned to hear that [he] has been arrested,"" Martin Fowler, a US-based computer programmer, tweeted. ""He is a strong advocate and developer supporting privacy and has not been able to speak to any lawyers."" Earlier on Thursday, Ms Romo held a press conference and said a person with close links to Wikileaks was living in Ecuador. In response, Mr Bini said on Twitter that her comments showed a ""witch hunt"" was under way.

"This video can not be played Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy in London Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange has been arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Assange took refuge in the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped. At Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday he was found guilty of failing to surrender to the court. He now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, in response to allegations by the Department for Justice that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in US prison if convicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga 'Reckless hacktivist' or campaigner for truth? How likely is a conviction in US? Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" where any journalist could face US charges for ""publishing truthful information about the United States"". She said she had visited Assange in the police cells where he thanked supporters and said: ""I told you so."" Assange had predicted that he would face extradition to the US if he left the embassy. After his arrest, the 47-year-old Australian national was initially taken to a central London police station before appearing in court. Dressed in a black suit and black polo shirt, he waved to the public gallery and gave a thumbs up. He pleaded not guilty to the 2012 charge of failing to surrender to the court. Finding him guilty of that charge, District Judge Michael Snow said Assange's behaviour was ""the behaviour of a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest"". He sent him to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing, where he faces up to 12 months in prison. The court also heard that during his arrest at the embassy he had to be restrained and shouted: ""This is unlawful, I am not leaving."" Assange gave a thumbs up as he was taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court in a police van Assange set up Wikileaks in 2006 with the aim of obtaining and publishing confidential documents and images. The organisation hit the headlines four years later when it released footage of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website. She said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, but US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was found guilty by a court martial in 2013 of charges including espionage. However, her jail sentence was later commuted. Manning was recently jailed for refusing to testifybefore an investigation into Wikileaks' role in revealing the secret files. This video can not be played Who is Julian Assange? The indictment against Assange, issued last year in the state of Virginia, alleges thathe conspired in 2010 with Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers,external. He faces up to five years in jail. Manning downloaded four databases from US departments and agencies between January and May 2010, the indictment says. This information, much of which was classified, was provided to Wikileaks. The US Justice Department described it as ""one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States"". Cracking a password stored on the computers, the indictment alleges, would have allowed Manning to log on to them in such a way as to make it harder for investigators to determine the source of the disclosures. It is unclear whether the password was actually broken. Correspondents say the narrowness of the charge seems intended to avoid falling foul of the US Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press. The Wikileaks co-founder had been in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012, after seeking asylum there to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation. The investigation into the alleged rape, which he denied, was later dropped because he had evaded the arrest warrant. The Swedish Prosecution Authority has said it is now considering whether to resume the inquiry before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2020. Scotland Yard said it was invited into the embassy on Thursday by the ambassador, following the Ecuadorian government's withdrawal of asylum. Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno said the country had ""reached its limit on the behaviour of Mr Assange"". Mr Moreno said: ""The most recent incident occurred in January 2019, when Wikileaks leaked Vatican documents. ""This and other publications have confirmed the world's suspicion that Mr Assange is still linked to WikiLeaks and therefore involved in interfering in internal affairs of other states."" His accusations against Assange also included blocking security cameras at the embassy, accessing security files and confronting guards. Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson and Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson say the arrest sets a dangerous precedent Mr Moreno said the British government had confirmed in writing that Assange ""would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty"". The arrest comes a day after Wikileaks said it had uncovered an extensive spying operation against its co-founder at the Ecuadorian embassy. There has been a long-running dispute between the Ecuadorian authorities and Assange about what he was and was not allowed to do in the embassy. Ecuador court throws out Assange lawsuit BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that over the years they had removed his access to the internet and accused him of engaging in political activities - which is not allowed when claiming asylum. He said: ""Precisely what has happened in the embassy is not clear - there has been claim and counter claim."" Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons: ""This goes to show that in the UK, no one is above the law."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the arrest was the result of ""years of careful diplomacy"" and that it was ""not acceptable"" for someone to ""escape facing justice"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed ""evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan"" andhis extradition ""should be opposed by the British government"",external. Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders said that the UK should resist extradition, because it would ""set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future"". Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne said he would continue to receive ""the usual consular support"" and that consular officers will try to visit him. And actress Pamela Anderson, who has visited the embassy to support Assange, saidthe arrest was a ""vile injustice"",external.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""If we want to get on with leaving, we need to start this process soon."" Theresa May has told MPs it remains her ""priority"" to deliver Brexit, defending the decision to delay the UK's exit from the EU. The new deadline of 31 October means the UK is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections in May. The prime minister said that if the deal agreed with the EU was passed, the UK could leave the EU ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the latest delay a ""diplomatic failure"". The prime minister promised to pursue an ""orderly"" Brexit, adding that the ""whole country"" was ""frustrated"". Brexit was originally set to happen on 29 March. But after MPs repeatedly rejected Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, the deadline was put back to 12 April. The new 31 October deadline averts the prospect of the UK having to leave the EU without a deal this Friday. Delay puts Brexit storm on pause - for now What happens next? Brexit: A really simple guide Delay puts Brexit storm on pause - for now The government said on Thursday it would ""continue to make all necessary preparations"" for a no-deal Brexit, after it was reported that departments had stood down their planning. A government source said ""plans will evolve and adapt"" but would not stop, while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remained. The source added that a leaked message referring to the ""winding down"" of no deal preparation related only to Operation Yellowhammer, the contingency planning operation based on worst-case scenarios - and not no-deal planning in general. Under EU rules, the UK will have to hold European Parliament elections in May, or face leaving on 1 June without a deal. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said she ""profoundly"" regretted her deal not being agreed to by MPs. She said: ""The whole country is intensely frustrated that this process of leaving the European Union has not been completed."" On the latest delay, she said: ""The choices we face are stark and the timetable is clear. I believe we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest."" And she told MPs that the UK would hold full EU membership rights during the extension, saying the country ""would continue to be bound by all our ongoing obligations as a member state, including the duty of sincere co-operation"". The government is continuing to hold talks with Labour aimed at achieving a consensus on how to break the deadlock in Parliament. Mrs May and Mr Corbyn had a ""short meeting"" on Thursday, Labour said. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says the Article 50 delay is a ""diplomatic failure"" In Parliament, Mrs May said: ""Reaching an agreement will not be easy, because to be successful it will require both sides to make compromises. ""But however challenging it may be politically, I profoundly believe that in this unique situation where the House is deadlocked, it is incumbent on both front benches to seek to work together to deliver what the British people voted for."" In response, Mr Corbyn said: ""The second extension in the space of a fortnight represents not only a diplomatic failure but is another milestone in the government's mishandling of the entire Brexit process."" Can the UK revoke Article 50? How could another Brexit referendum work? What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement? How UK is gearing up for European elections How do European elections work? He added: ""The prime minister has stuck rigidly to a flawed plan and now the clock has run down, leaving Britain in limbo and adding to the deep uncertainty of business, workers and people all across this country."" Mr Corbyn said cross-party talks were ""serious, detailed and ongoing"", but warned that the government would ""have to compromise"". If no agreement was possible, he said: ""We believe all options should remain on the table, including the option of a public vote."" Shortly- Talks continue between the Conservatives and Labour on how to end the Brexit impasse 23 April- MPs return from Parliament's Easter recess 2 May- Local elections take place in England and Northern Ireland 23 May- European Parliament elections are scheduled to happen in the UK, if MPs do not back Theresa May's agreement with the EU in time to avert them 31 October- The UK leaves the EU, unless MPs back the withdrawal agreement in advance of this deadline Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, urged Mrs May to use the extra time to hold a second EU referendum. This video can not be played After Bill Cash calls on her to resign, Theresa May replies: ""I think you know the answer to that."" ""It's now a very real possibility that we can remain in the European Union,"" he said. ""As of today, there are 204 days until the new Brexit deadline on the 31 October, so will the prime minister now remove the ridiculous excuse that there isn't enough time to hold a second referendum with remain on the ballot paper?"" And Brexiteer Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash accused the prime minister of ""abject surrender"" to the EU in allowing the delay and said she should resign. Before the Brussels summit, Mrs May had told leaders she wanted to move the UK's exit date from this Friday to 30 June, with the option of leaving earlier if Parliament ratified her agreement. A Brexit extension ""only as long as necessary"" and ""no longer than 31 October"" to allow for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement The UK ""must hold the elections to the European Parliament"" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June The European Council reiterates there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement negotiations Read the EU's conclusions here.,external European Council President Donald Tusk said future developments were ""entirely in the UK's hands"", adding: ""They can still ratify the withdrawal agreement, in which case the extension can be terminated."" Mr Tusk said the UK could also rethink its strategy or choose to ""cancel Brexit altogether"", but urged: ""Please do not waste this time.""
