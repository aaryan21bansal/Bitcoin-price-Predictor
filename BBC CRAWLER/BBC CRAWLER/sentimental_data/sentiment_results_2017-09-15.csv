"The UK terror threat has been increased to its highest level as police continue the hunt for the person behind the Tube bombing in south-west London. The prime minister said the threat was now critical, meaning an attack is expected imminently, after a device was detonated at Parsons Green station. Police said some 1,000 armed officers would be seen across the country after military assistance was requested. So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the attack, which injured 29. Mrs May said the military would be providing support to police and would replace officers on guard duty at national infrastructure sites that are not accessible to the public. Police Scotland said it would be increasing the number of armed officers on patrol, particularly at key locations and crowded places. This video can not be played Parsons Green: PM says terror threat raised to critical The use of the military to assist police has been done under the first phase of Operation Temperer, a government plan to deploy troops to help police following major terrorist attacks, which was activated for the first time on 23 May following the Manchester Arena attack. Mrs May said: ""The public will see more armed police on the transport network and on our streets, providing extra protection. ""This is a proportionate and sensible step which will provide extra reassurance and protection while the investigation progresses."" Twenty-nine people have been treated in hospitals, mostly for burns, following the attack at 08:20 BST on Friday on the eastbound District Line train from Wimbledon. Latest updates: Incident at Parsons Green What do we know about the bomb? May rebukes Trump for terror tweets Witnesses describe what happened What powers do police have to deal with terrorism? In pictures: Parsons Green blast This video can not be played Parsons Green: Police asked about suspect Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police were ""chasing down suspects"". He said the assistance from the military would ""provide reassurance"" across the country. Mr Rowley said hundreds of police officers had been ""trawling"" through CCTV to find those responsible for the attack. He said detectives were only aware of one device and refused to be drawn on details of the suspects because of the ""covert"" nature of the operation. Mr Rowley also said it was ""very routine"" in incidents of this kind for IS to say it carried out the attack ""whether or not they've had any previous engagement with the individuals involved"". By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent A word of caution about ""imminence"". The terror threat level was previously raised to critical in May after Manchester. Then it was lowered again days later after it became clear to intelligence assessors in the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre that an attack wasn't imminent. Then we had two more incidents - Borough Market/London Bridge and Finsbury Park. What does this tell us? Intelligence is usually fragmentary. Analysts sometimes only have glimpses or impressions of what they think is going on. It's an imperfect world. Pictures taken of the train showed a white bucket on fire inside a supermarket bag, with wires trailing on to the carriage floor. The BBC understands the device had a timer. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off properly. Had it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said. This video can not be played Witnesses describe the explosion at Parsons Green Earlier, US President Donald Trump spoke to Prime Minister Theresa May to convey his sympathies for those injured in the terrorist attack, the White House said. President Trump pledged to continue close collaboration with the UK to stop attacks and combat extremism, the statement added. US President Donald Trump hadtweeted,externalthat the ""sick and demented"" people behind the attack had been in the sights of the Metropolitan Police,prompting Mrs May to say it was not helpful to ""speculate""on an ongoing investigation. There have been a ""number of people"" injured, police said Chelsea and Westminster Hospital is treating 14 people, with a ""small number"" of them taken to its specialist burns unit. Four people are being treated by Imperial College Healthcare and three at St George's Hospital. St Thomas' Hospital in London said it had treated eight patients but they had been discharged. Mr Rowley asked the public to remain ""vigilant"", but said people should ""not be alarmed"". He said anyone who took pictures or videos at the scene could upload them toukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk,external. Anna Gorniak, who was in the same Tube carriage as the explosion, told the BBC: ""I could see a fireball filling the carriage and coming our way. At that moment, I started to run. ""In my mind I was praying, I probably thought for a second, 'That's it, my life is over.'"" Anna Gorniak said she could see a fireball ""filling the carriage"" This video can not be played Peter Crowley: ""There was a fireball above my head"" Passenger Peter Crowley was sitting in the carriage, travelling from Wimbledon, when the explosion happened. He said his head was burned by a ""really hot intense fireball above my head"" and added: ""There were people a lot worse than me."" Chris Wildish told BBC Radio 5 live he saw a bucket in a supermarket bag with ""low-level flames coming out of it"" by the door of the rear carriage. Are you at Parsons Green station?

"A manhunt is under way to find the person behind Friday's Tube bombing Police are 'chasing down suspects' and trawling CCTV after Parsons Green attack Terror threat level raised to 'critical' - meaning an attack is expected 'imminently' The station reopened in the early hours of Saturday 29 people have been treated in hospital - police say 'most' had 'flash burns' The explosion on the District Line train is being treated as terrorism Police say it was caused by an 'improvised explosive device' Anyone with information, photos or video should call 0800 789 321 Dearbail Jordan and Claire Heald Photos from the scene after an explosion on a London Underground carriage. What does the device used on the District Line tell us about the attacker? British police have arrested an 18-year old man in the Dover area in connection with the bombing on a Tube train at Parsons Green. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent This is the fourth time the UK
national terror threat level has been raised to 'critical' since the system was
made public in 2006. The last time was in May this
year, following the Manchester Arena bombing, when it was wrongly thought that
the bomb-maker was still at large and could strike again. In the case of Parsons Green
it is perhaps surprising that it took the government so long - more than 12 hours -
to raise the threat level to critical, under advice from the Joint Terrorism
Analysis Centre, when it was obvious the perpetrator had neither died nor been
caught. Each time the level has gone
to critical, it has only stayed at this highest level of alertness for three to
four days - this is partly as it involves an unsustainably high tempo for the
police, intelligence and security services. Read the full analysis here. The Daily Telegraph Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the defence think tank Rusi, says attacks on public transport strike at the heart of cities and damage the economy. While it is impossible to guarantee complete security, he says initiatives such as public awareness campaigns, as well as authorities staying on top of the terrorist threat, mean the UK is seeing only relatively limited impact events. The Guardian The Guardian suggests,externalthe incompetence of terrorists has spared hundreds of lives in recent years. Before the improvised explosive device that failed to detonate fully on the tube train at Parsons Green, there have been many other bungled attempts to kill or maim people - including a world-be suicide bomber who set off his own device in a toilet. Eliminating key individuals with high levels of expertise will help stop knowledge of destruction passing to potential attackers, the paper says. The Times Writing inThe Times,,externalcrime and security editor Fiona Hamilton says that the Tube bombing at Parsons Green station is an important reminder of how vulnerable the transport network is. While security has been improved since the 7 July in 2005, ""a network with huge numbers of passengers can never be made 100% safe"". BBC Radio 5 live Former chairman of the intelligence and security committee
and Tory MP Dominic Grieve said he âaccepted the argumentâ that cuts to the
police have led to less community officers âpicking up tipsâ. He told Radio 5 Live that the government should âlisten carefullyâ
to critics of the cuts, as âanything which can increase our resilience against
terrorism needs to be consideredâ. However, he warned against âjumping to conclusionsâ that
more police on the beat would have stopped such attacks from happening. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 More must be done by
internet companies to tackle the spread of information online which inspires
attacks, Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the Today programme. That includes taking down manuals on how to build bombs like the one used in Parsons
Green. We take a lot down, but sometimes, very quickly, these things reappear, so we go at them again.""  We have to find a way to build pressure on internet companies to get them to invest some of their vast profits into the technologies to make sure we take down content very quickly or don't even let it surface.""

Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The MI5 websitedescribes what each terrorism threat level means,external. The last time it was raised to ""critical"" was following the Manchester terror attack in May. But Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the BBC Today programme that the Parsons Green attack is different. Unlike Manchester, where the bomber obviously killed himself along with all the innocent people he murdered, there was no obvious bomber attached to this and so there is effectively a manhunt.  We are trying to track down who did it. Whether itâs a bomber, or bombers, and all those other issues we need to answer. In this case, thatâs what imminent means.""  Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The national terror alert level was raised to critical later on Friday evening, hours after Friday morning's bombing. Asked why it took hours to increase the level, Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the BBC's Today programme: The threat level in this country is set independently of politicians by the Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre.  They look at a range of things. They look at the intelligence at their fingertips. They look at changes in people we are currently watching - and see if they are inspired by an attack to maybe copy things - and they look at the pace of the investigation.  If they feel as a result of all those factors that an attack is likely to become imminent then that's why they raise it to critical as they then did later in the day.""  Extra police officers are on duty on Saturday after the bombing, including from the British Transport Police. And the police have asked asked the Prime Minister Theresa May for authorisation to enact part of the first phase of Operation Temperer  - which provides military support to police force operations.

"Martin Crighton says he will buy his own home with the money A gardener who scooped a Â£1m National Lottery prize did not realise he was a winner for a month - because he forgot to check his ticket. Forgetful Martin Crighton, 44, said his memory was jogged by an article about a ""missing millionaire"" from his area. The groundsman, from Boxford, Suffolk, found a ticket tucked between receipts and cards in his wallet. When he compared it with the information in his local paper, he realised he had won. ""I guess I really still cannot believe it,"" he said. ""Life will just be so much easier now.""

"Bright Future - led by Ottarr Proppe (left) - has now exited its nine-month coalition with Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson's Independence Party and Benedikt Johannesson's Reform party A furore over a paedophile's links to PM Bjarni Benediktsson has led to the collapse of Iceland's ruling coalition. The Bright Future party said it was leaving the three-party coalition after nine months in office, blaming a ""serious breach of trust"". Mr Benediktsson said the country should hold elections as soon as possible, preferably in November. Earlier it emerged the PM's father wrote a letter recommending a convicted paedophile have his ""honour restored"". This old Icelandic system permits convicts to have certain civil rights restored - enabling them to run for public office, qualify for certain government jobs or serve as an attorney or solicitor, for example - if three letters of recommendation from persons of good character are provided. Iceland country profile Iceland to end capital controls from 2008 financial crisis But Icelanders have been horrified by the secret backing for Hjalti SigurjÃ³n Hauksson - convicted in 2004 of raping his stepdaughter almost every day for 12 years from when she was five. He served a five-and-a-half-year jail term. The Reykjavik Grapevine news site quotes the survivor of Hauksson's abuse as saying it was ""surreal"" that he should receive restored honour. The government has also been accused of an attempted cover-up after it refused to disclose who had written the letter of recommendation. It only emerged on Thursday that it was Benedikt Sveinsson, Prime Minister Benediktsson's father, but the prime minister is said to have been informed about his involvement in July. In a statement, Mr Sveinsson apologised for providing the recommendation for Hauksson, an old friend of his. Iceland's justice minister has said she is preparing a bill to reform the restored honour system in response to the furore. Later Mr Benediktsson accepted that the government could not continue and that an election would need to be held for the second time in less than a year. ""We have lost the majority and I don't see anything that indicates we can regain that... I am calling an election,"" he told reporters. Public trust in politicians has been eroded by the 2008 financial crash and last year's revelations of hidden offshore assets, which brought down Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and inspired days of ""red card"" protests Icelandic journalist Hjortur Gudmundsson says the coalition's position was already fragile, as it had a majority of only one parliamentary seat before Bright Future withdrew its support. ""Since the economic crash of 2008 there has been a lot of suspicion towards politicians and a huge onus on honesty,"" Gudmundsson says. ""This is not the first time controversy has been linked to the PM - he wasimplicated in the Panama Papers[which brought down the previous government, in which he was finance minister]. There isn't much public patience for this kind of thing."" In his statement of apology, Mr Sveinsson tried to explain his actions, saying that Hauksson had brought him an already drafted letter which he signed. ""I have never considered the restored honour as anything except a legal procedure making it possible for convicted criminals to regain some civil rights,"" Mr Sveinsson said. ""I did not think of it as something that would justify Hjalti's position towards his victim. I told Hjalti to face his action and to repent."" ""What was supposed to be a small gesture of good will towards a convicted criminal has instead turned into a continuation of the tragedy for the victim. For this I again apologise.""

"This video can not be played Footage shows a burning bag on board the Tube carriage at Parsons Green station This is the fifth terror attack of 2017. And it's the only one this year in which nobody has died. Earlier this summer, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick said police believed they had stopped six other significant plots - and there has been at least one more since then. So, put plainly, this is the most sustained period of terror activity in England since the IRA bombing campaign of the 1970s. The amount of work that confronts detectives on a day like this is enormous. Hundreds of officers were immediately put on the investigation, with clear goals. These are: Who did it? Are there more devices? Who else, if anyone, was involved? How was the device made? So let's start with that fourth question and work backwards. The people in charge of the investigation into the bomb are scientists from the Forensic Explosives Laboratory. They investigate every explosive device recovered in the UK. In 2005 they had to look at the devices left behind from the botched attacks of 21 July. The bomb at Parsons Green was an improvised explosive device (IED) and, like those on 21/7, it didn't work as planned. One commuter took a picture of the device, which appeared to have wires protruding from a white canister The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. One of the 21 July 2005 devices that failed to explode TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year. The recipe is in wide circulation in publications produced by what remains of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the separate self-styled Islamic State group. But don't go looking for it: there have been dozens of ""Section 58"" prosecutions and jailings for possession of this material. It's a long-standing strategy to restrict the flow of this information. There are other similarities to previous incidents, including a failed attack on the London Underground last year. Damon Smith put his homemade device into a rucksack and left it on a Jubilee Line train in October 2016. Here he is getting off the train and leaving the bag behind: Damon Smith - now jailed He got the bomb recipe from a jihadist manual, used a cheap clock for a timer, and modified fairy lights acted as an initiator. The Parsons Green device is also understood to have had some kind of timer and the fairy lights are apparent from the pictures. Some of them have what looks like a white plug at the end which could be wax. This approach has been previously used to seal bulbs after they have been modified to be part of a bomb. Zahid Hussain, a Birmingham man convicted in May of trying to make a crude device, did exactly this. A device with a timer obviously suggests someone left it behind - although it is entirely possible the attacker intended to stay with the bomb until the end. Another would-be attacker who's now languishing in jail, Haroon Syed, wanted a bomb with a timer in case he messed it up himself. (He didn't know he was talking toan undercover investigator). Haroon Syed: Wanted bomb with a timer Working on the assumption that the attacker left before the detonation, specialist CCTV search officers will have since spent hours trying to ascertain who was carrying the distinctive Lidl freezer bag and its bulky contents onto the Tube. The London Underground is smothered with CCTV. If the attacker got on south of Parsons Green, rather than doubling back from the north, there are five stations that could have been the entrance point. Their image would have been captured on scores of cameras during their journey. Simultaneously, a specialist team of detectives will be following any money trail they can - an increasingly important part of any investigation. They'll be looking at the payment cards used to enter and leave the London Underground - and whether there is any match to a suspicious purchase of precursor chemicals. Officers will also have to work out if the attacker was alone. There may even be clues left at the scene. Latest updates: Arrest in hunt for Tube attacker Witnesses describe what happened What powers do police have to deal with terrorism? In pictures: Parsons Green blast Very often, it is the sheer incompetence of the would-be terrorist that provides the breakthrough, asthe Guardian's Jason Burke has documented,externalin this excellent piece on Friday. But thearrest of two individualswill not bring an end to the investigation. Investigators need the evidence that completes a chain from the carriage to a bomb factory (assuming again that they can find it) and a lot of that will come from the work of the Forensic Explosives Laboratory. One priority will be gathering evidence to prove that the individual intended the device to explode. In the 21/7 trial the defendants claimed it was all a hoax. So, in the months to come, scientists may construct an exact replica of the device to see how it would have behaved in controlled and safe conditions. Before that, they need to be able to safely remove the device for further analysis. That is far harder than it sounds. They can't just scoop it up and drive it through London. During 21/7, the science team carefully took small samples for analysis - but when what remained kept bubbling away, they were forced to destroy it out of fear it could still explode.

"This video can not be played PM: Trump speculation 'not helpful' Prime Minister Theresa May has rebuked US President Donald Trump for suggesting suspects in Friday's London train blast were known to police. ""I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,"" she said. In a tweet, Mr Trump described the attackers as ""loser terrorists"" and ""sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard"". The bomb rocked a London Underground train, injuring 29 people. Latest updates: Incident at Parsons Green Witnesses describe what happened What powers do police have to deal with terrorism? In pictures: Parsons Green blast In a phone call with Mrs May on Friday, Mr Trump ""pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism"", the White House said. A Downing Street spokesman said he also offered ""his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London"", which he described to reporters earlier as ""a terrible thing"". This video can not be played President Trump says 'we've got to be much tougher' The call followed Mrs May's critical remarks about the US president. In one of his tweets, Mr Trump appeared to chide UK authorities: ""Must be proactive!"" London police said of his comments, ""any speculation is unhelpful"". Allow Twitter content?

In other tweets on Friday, the Republican president claimed his administration had ""made more progress in the last nine months"" against the Islamic State group than his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""Must be proactive & nasty!""he tweeted,external. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington Last month Donald Trump defended his delay in ascribing blame for the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville by saying: ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement."" That is advice the president seemed uninterested in heeding on Friday morning, as he fired off a series of tweets reacting to the London train incident. In fact, with few exceptions, Mr Trump is happy to quickly react to international incidents he suspects are perpetrated by Islamic militants, even when - in the case of the Philippines casino robbery - that's not the case. Besides his London remarks on Friday morning, the president again blasted Senate procedural rules, called for his Muslim travel ban to be ""tougher"", said the fight against the so-called Islamic State should be ""nasty"", and slammed ESPN, a US sports cable network, for being too political. Given that Mr Trump was under fire from his base on Thursday for reaching out to Democrats and being too conciliatory on immigration, it is hard not to think that his actions on Friday may be an effort to change the subject. Mr Trump also renewed a call to shut down internet capabilities, which he said were a main recruitment tool for terrorists. During the Republican presidential campaign in 2015, Mr Trump suggested he would ask Microsoft founder Bill Gates to cut off the internet because of terror recruitment. ""We're losing a lot of people because of the internet,"" Mr Trump said at the time, without elaborating. ""We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening."" ""We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways,"" he added. Friday was not the first time Mr Trump has been accused of reacting to suspected terrorist incidents before the facts are fully known. If he did leak sensitive information in his tweet about Scotland Yard, rather than indulging in pure speculation as London police say, it could amount to a security breach. In May,US officials angered British authoritieswhen details about a deadly bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester were divulged to US media. The New York Times was criticised for publishing photographsfrom the scene, as well as images of the bomb. The president also used Friday's tweets to promote his travel ban temporarily barring people from six Muslim-majority countries as well Syrian refugees from entering the US. Allow Twitter content?

"Supporters have paid tribute to Patrik Liljeglod's bravery A Swedish politician has revealed on Facebook that he was raped by a knife-wielding attacker because of his political leanings. Patrik Liljeglod is a group leader of the Left Party, in the city of Falun. He also spoke about the assault at a council meeting on Thursday evening. ""I was brutally treated and raped at knifepoint on the pretext that I was a left-wing [expletive], that people like us like this, and finally that I was a traitor,"" he said. Police have confirmed they are investigating the matter.Sweden's SVT said,externalthere have been no arrests so far, and the National Forensic Centre is working on the case. Mr Liljeglod said the attack happened at the end of July, when he was walking home on a summer evening. He said he would have preferred to bury what happened so deep that nobody but him would ever know, but that he felt it was his duty to speak out because the attack had been politically motivated. ""I stand here because, given my deeply rooted belief that democracy is an integral part of our society, I feel that I must,""he wrote,external. The Left Party leader said he would not abandon his agenda, but would fight even harder after what had happened. ""Nothing is more important than democracy, people die for the right to democracy every day - and the right we have inherited through our parents' struggles, we have to continue fighting for,"" he wrote. ""And we must remind those citizens who have forgotten why."" Swedish festival cancelled after rape claim 'We need to talk about male rape' Male rape: Why I didn't go to the police Police spokesperson Stefan Dangardt told the TT news agency that the scene of the attack had been examined, and the results sent for forensic analysis. ""If it turns out that the motive is his political allegiance then it is obviously a hate crime,"" he said. Supporters have responded to the Facebook post to praise the politician's bravery, with one writing: ""All respect for your strength and your courage, and for your struggle for democracy. We are here for you and for the struggle for democracy."" ""I am proud to be your party-mate Patrik, and extremely sorry for what you have been exposed to.

"This video can not be played Fawas Lafeer, the owner of a surf school in Sri Lanka describes the moment Paul McClean was attacked A British man has died in Sri Lanka after being attacked by a crocodile, his employer has confirmed. Paul McClean, 24, from Thames Ditton in Surrey, was dragged into a river near Arugam Bay, witnesses said. Fawas Lafeer, who owns the nearby Safa Surf School,told BBC 5 livethe Financial Times journalist was attacked while washing his hands in the river . Local police said Mr McClean's body was found in a lagoon by a Sri Lankan Navy search team. Financial Times (FT) editor Lionel Barbersaid on Twitter,external: ""Paul McClean was an outstanding young journalist with a great future at the FT. We will miss him sorely."" The paper later released an official statement, saying: ""We are heartbroken by the tragic and untimely death of one of our journalists, Paul McClean. He was a talented and valued member of our team with a bright career ahead of him. ""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Paul's family, friends and loved ones and we ask that the media respect their privacy at this difficult time."" The paper added that the Oxford graduate's body had been identified by friends he was holidaying with in Sri Lanka, with the final cause of his death not yet established. Mr McClean's body was found in a lagoon near Elephant Rock, south of Arugam Bay James Lamont, FT managing editor, said he was a ""talented, energetic and dedicated"" journalist with an eye for hidden stories. Mr McClean, who described himself as a ""long-suffering Evertonian"", was a member of the fastFT team in London - a 24-hour rolling business news website - and wrote many of the FT's Brussels morning briefings. Friday's email, written by the paper's Brussels bureau chief, Alex Barker,external, paid tribute to him, saying he had a ""remarkable, impossible-to-miss, can-he-really-be-that-young talent"", which allowed the graduate trainee to produce ""pieces that established journalists at the peak of their careers would be proud to match"". Mr McClean was the first to work out exactly how many international treaties Britain would need to renegotiate after Brexit, said Mr Barker. ""It was painstaking work"", he added, ""but oh how he made us laugh."" The figures Mr McClean generated were used widely by the media, including on John Oliver's late night satirical television show,Last Week Tonight,external. Arugam Bay is a popular surf spot in south eastern Sri Lanka - 6km (4 miles) north of Mr Lafeer's surf school at Elephant Rock. Elephant Rock is an isolated beach surrounded by roaming elephants and other wildlife, according to National Geographic. A Sri Lankan Navy search team were sent to search for the journalist Mr Lafeer told BBC Radio 5 live surfers at his school had just finished a lesson when they were called by fishermen on the river to help. ""Fishermen saw him attacked by the crocodile and they screamed to the surfers to come and help,"" he said. ""By the time they went to the spot where the croc attacked, they couldn't save him because already the crocodile had pulled him inside the water so they couldn't see what was going on."" He said the Sri Lankan Navy retrieved a body from the river at about 20:45 local time. ""This is the first time somebody has died in this river... we have had three attacks on the fishermen. [But] they did not die, they were injured,"" Mr Lafeer added. A Sri Lankan judge is to conduct an inquiry into the death.

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un watched the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile on Friday North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to reach the country's nuclear goals, according to state media. The aim was to establish ""equilibrium"" of military force with the US, the KCNA news agency quoted him as saying. Mr Kim's comments come after North Korea fired its latest missile over Japan - in what is being described as the country's farthest-reaching test. The move split world powers who united behind new UN sanctions against North Korea just days ago. ""We should clearly show the big power chauvinists how our state attain the goal of completing its nuclear force despite their limitless sanctions and blockade,"" Mr Kim was quoted as saying by the KCNA. He also said North Korea's goal was ""to establish the equilibrium of real force with the US and make the US rulers dare not talk about military option for the DPRK [North Korea]"". Are missiles a risk to planes? The weapons North Korea does not admit to Three minutes to shelter from a missile Mr Kim personally watched the launch of a Hwasong-12 ballistic missile on Friday. Kim Jong-un and North Korea's top military officials celebrated the launch The missile reached an altitude of about 770km (478 miles), travelling 3,700km past the northernmost island of Hokkaido before landing in the sea, South Korea's military said. The missile had the capacity to reach the US territory of Guam and experts say it is the furthest any North Korean ballistic missile has ever travelled above ground. This video can not be played ""I don't know when I might be killed"" - reaction to the latest missile launch The UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting, in which members unanimously condemned the launch as ""highly provocative"" - coming as it did after Pyongyang's nuclear bomb test on 3 September. US President Donald Trump said North Korea had ""once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbours, and the entire world community"", but that he felt more confident than ever that the US was ready should a military option be needed. But Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasiliy Nebenzia, urged caution, saying: ""We think that threats, tests, launches, and mutual threats in fact should be stopped, and that we should engage in meaningful negotiations."" China accused the US of shirking its responsibilities. ""Honestly, I think the United States should be doing... much more than now, so that there's real effective international co-operation on this issue"", China's ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""They should refrain from issuing more threats. They should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiation,"" he said. Analysis by BBC's Carrie Gracie in Beijing United Nations sanctions - no more no less. From a Chinese ambassador, that is blunt language and signals Beijing's irritation over American pressure. China feels it deserves more credit for the hard work and economic pain involved in enforcing two new rounds of UN sanctions within a matter of weeks. It also doubts that sanctions alone, however tough, will deter Pyongyang. So Ambassador Cui Tiankai had his own advice for Washington, saying it should avoid making threats and instead resume dialogue. The only satisfied party today is North Korea. But China has insisted time and again that it will never accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, and it can't avoid the obvious and urgent question: how does China intend to stop it? No new sanctions have been announced at the Council's meeting. The launch took place from the Sunan district of the capital Pyongyang just before 07:00 local time on Friday (22:00 GMT on Thursday), South Korea's military says. Sunan is home to Pyongyang International Airport. As withthe last test on 29 August, the missile flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. Sirens sounded across the region and text message alerts were sent out warning people to take cover. What is so alarming about the new launch is that the US Pacific territory of Guam, whichNorth Korea says it has a plan to target, is 3,400km from Pyongyang, putting it within range of the latest missile.

"North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un - seen here on a TV screen in Tokyo - are overshadowing the region again The latest missile test by North Korea, its furthest-reaching yet, has split world powers who united behind new UN sanctions just days ago. US President Donald Trump said he was more confident than ever of America's military options, should one be needed. China earlier accused the US of shirking its responsibilities, while Russia called US rhetoric ""aggressive"". The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned the missile test, but no new sanctions have been announced.

US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley had earlier played down the possibility of further punitive action, sayingfresh economic sanctionsagreed by the council on Monday that restricted oil imports and banned textile exports would cut trade with North Korea by 90%. President Donald Trump is due to address the UN next week, as well as meet the Japanese and South Korean leaders. The missile test has been widely condemned, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saying his country would ""never tolerate"" such ""dangerous provocative action"". President Trump said North Korea had ""once again shown its utter contempt for its neighbours, and the entire world community"", but that he felt more confident than ever that the US was ready should a military option be needed. But world powers were divided over how best to respond. The big powers' envoys to the UN found common ground on North Korea earlier this month President Trump's National Security Adviser HR McMaster earlier said the US was quickly running out of patience for diplomatic solutions, adding: ""We've been kicking the can down the road, and we're out of road."" He confirmed that there was a military option, but it was not the president's preferred choice. But Russia's ambassador to the UN Vasilly Nebenzia urged caution, saying: ""We think that threats, tests, launches, and mutual threats in fact should be stopped, and that we should engage in meaningful negotiations."" USSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said China, which supplies the North with most of its oil, and Russia, which was the largest employer ofNorth Korean forced labour,external, should take direct actions to rein in Pyongyang Chinaforeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying insisted her country was not the ""focal point of the conflict"" and directed the following remarks at the US and South Korea: ""Any attempt to wash their hands of the issue is irresponsible and unhelpful for resolving the issue.""

What is so alarming about the new launch is that the US Pacific territory of Guam, whichNorth Korea says it has a plan to target, is 3,400km from Pyongyang, putting it within range of the latest missile. The North's sixth nuclear test reportedly involved a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? South Korea responded within minutes by firing two ballistic missiles into the sea in a simulated strike on the North. At an emergency meeting of his national security council, President Moon Jae-in said that dialogue with the North was ""impossible in a situation like this"".

The country does have an extensive chemical arsenal and may also have biological weapons. What damage could North Korea do? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? It insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival and there has been no let-up in its fiery rhetoric. On Thursday, it threatened to ""sink Japan and turn America to ashes"".

"Some rhododendron plants can grow taller than 25ft (8m) if they are not controlled Air, mountain and water rescue teams were called to rescue two tourists who were lost for hours in a rhododendron forest in an Irish national park. They were camping in Killarney National Park in County Kerry on Thursday when they became ""disorientated"". A helicopter guided them through the dense rhododendrons to a lake shore, where they were rescued by boat. It is not the first time rescuers have been sent to the forest, which covers about a third of the 26,000 acres park. Earlier this year, a Kerry politician called for military action to stop the ""aggressive"" rhododendrons from ""taking over"" the beauty spot. ""The rhododendron situation in Killarney National Park has become so bad that nothing short of calling in the army is going to put it right,""Michael Healy-Rae warned the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) in February. The park runs a control programme for the plant and says that ""hundreds of thousands of euros are spent each year in the battle to eradicate the highly invasive and destructive rhododendron ponticum"". Killarney National Park is trying to control wild rhododendrons from spreading Rhododendron ponticum is a non-native shrub that can grow taller than 25ft (8m) if it is not controlled. Irish broadcaster, RTÃ, said the rhododendron plants have become ""jungle-like"" in parts of the park. Its thick foliage not only presents problems for neighbouring plants and trees - it makes life difficult for rescue teams. The tourists who could not find their way out of the forest on Thursday called Kerry Mountain Rescue at about 13:00 local time. Mountain rescuers in turn requested assistance from a coast guard helicopter, because of the difficulty in finding the pair in the rhododendrons. In 2014, two walkers were rescued by boat from rhododendrons in the Knockmealdowns Mountains A spokesman for the Irish Coast Guard in Valentia said the tourists' orange tent was spotted from the air, but the aircraft could not reach them in the dense terrain. Instead, it guided them to the shore of nearby Lough Leane. The pair were taken on board a Kerry Water Rescue vessel at about 15:40 local time, more than two and a half hours after they first called for help. A similar method was also used in 2014 to help two walkers who becametrapped in a 'treacherous' rhododendron forestbetween County Waterford and County Tipperary.

"This video can not be played ""Long live Cassini"" - the project team says farewell The American-led Cassini space mission to Saturn has just come to a spectacular end. Controllers had commanded the probe to destroy itself by plunging into the planet's atmosphere. It survived for just over a minute before being broken apart. Cassini had run out of fuel and Nasa had determined that the probe should not be allowed simply to wander uncontrolled among Saturn and its moons. The loss of signal from the spacecraft occurred pretty close to the prediction. Here at mission control, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, the drop-off was timed at 04:55 PDT (11:55 GMT; 12:55 BST). How the last hours unfolded Nasa's Earl Maize addressed fellow controllers: ""Congratulations to you all. This has been an incredible mission, an incredible spacecraft and you're all an incredible team. I'm going to call this the end of mission. Project manager off the net."" The statement brought restrained applause and some comforting embraces. The loss of signal indicated that the probe was tumbling wildly in the planet's gases. Travelling downwards at over 120,000km/h, it could have survived the violence for no more than about 45 seconds before being torn to pieces. Incineration in the heat and pressure of the plunge was inevitable - but Cassini still managed to despatch home some novel data on the chemical composition of Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini has been circling around Saturn for 13 years On the icy moon Enceladus it discovered... an ocean of water hidden beneath the surface eight times as deep as the oceans on Earth. Cassini's chemical analysis of the water... suggests conditions could be right for micro-organisms to live there. While visiting Saturn's largest moon which is the size of the planet Mercury Cassini flew over seas and lakes of methane and discovered they are up to 170 metres deep. On Saturn itself, above the north pole Cassini took photos of a hexagonal hurricane 32,000km across. Scientists have puzzled over how this giant storm spins. Cassini measured its winds at a staggering 330mph Four times as strong as a hurricane on Earth! Back out on the edge of one of Saturn's rings among the clouds of ice particles Cassini even captured the birth of a possible new moon. It's been named Peggy and is just 1km wide. Finally, running out of fuel, Cassini was flown directly towards the planet until it burnt up in Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini: A mission of 'astonishing discovery' Click next button to proceed Loading ... Swipe to progress Images: Nasa, Kongle  Meet the people who made Cassini happen In Pictures: Cassini probe's greatest shots What were the mission's biggest findings? And so ends one of the most successful space missions in history. In its thirteen years at Saturn, Cassini has transformed our understanding of the sixth planet from the Sun. It has watched monster storms encircle the globe; it witnessed the delicate interplay of ice particles move through the planet's complex ring system; and it revealed extraordinary new insights on the potential habitability of Saturn's moons. Titan and Enceladus were the standout investigations. The former is a bizarre place where liquid methane rains from an orange sky and runs into huge lakes. Cassini put a small European robot called Huygens on Titan's surface in 2005. It returned a remarkable image of pebbles that had been smoothed and rounded by the action of that flowing methane. Cassini also spied what are presumed to be volcanoes that spew an icy slush and vast dunes made from a plastic-like sand. On Enceladus, the observations were no less stunning. This video can not be played ""Where Cassini took its final plunge"": Linda Spilker explains the last images Controllers' screens: The loss of signal was indicated by the absence of a green spike (right) This moon was seen to spurt water vapour into space from cracks at its south pole. The H2O came from an ocean held beneath the icy shell of Enceladus. When Cassini flew through the water plumes, it showed that conditions in the sub-surface ocean were very probably suitable for life. Today, scientists are already talking about how they can go back with another, more capable probe to investigate this idea further. Cassini's cameras were switched off for the last few hours leading to the plunge A great many of those researchers have been gathered this week at the nearby campus of the California Institute of Technology. They watched a feed from the control room at JPL on giant screens. Jonathan Lunine, from Cornell University at Ithaca, New York, spoke for many when he said: ""I feel sad but I've felt sad the whole week; we knew this was going to happen. And Cassini performed exactly as she was supposed to and I bet there is some terrific data on the ground now about Saturn's atmosphere."" And Linda Spilker, the Nasa Cassini project scientist, added: ""When I look back on the Cassini mission I see a mission that was running a 13-year marathon of scientific discovery. And this last orbit was just the last lap. And so we stood in celebration of successfully completing the race. And I know I stood there with a mixture of tears and applause."" Although the probe has gone its science lives on. It has acquired a huge amount of data that will keep researchers busy for decades to come. A lot of it has barely even been assessed. ""Linda Spliker and I were joking earlier that those last few seconds of the Cassini mission - our first 'taste' of the atmosphere of Saturn - might be a number of PhD theses for students to come,"" observed Michael Watkins, the director of JPL. ""So, even in those last few seconds, it will continue its re-writing of the textbooks."" Pictures of Titan were pulled off the probe's memory before the plunge This video can not be played Why scientists are so excited about Saturn's icy moon Enceladus Cassini has photographed some of Saturn's 62 moons: the two-toneIapetus (1)with its walnut-like equatorial ridge;Mimas (2), which has a giant crater that instantly makes everyone think of the ""Death Star"" from the Star Wars movies;Hyperion (3), which displays clusters of bizarre pock marks akin to a sponge or wasps' nest;Atlas (4), which resembles a flying saucer; the potato-likePrometheus (5); andPan (6), which has a shape that would not look out of place in a ravioli dish. A last look at Enceladus going over the northern limb of Saturn Also in the end group of images was this fabulous shot of the rings The Cassini-Huygens mission is a joint endeavour of Nasa, and the European and Italian space agencies.

"London has again fallen victim to a terror attack, targeting commuters on their way to work and visitors venturing out into the city. An explosion took place in the middle of rush hour on a Tube carriage at Parsons Green station as passengers got on and off the train. Unlike thethree other incidents to hit the capital this year, no-one has died as a result. But 22 people have been hospitalised and this bustling part of zone two left confused and shocked as people wait anxiously for an explanation. Tube blast is terror incident, say police Live: Parsons Green Tube explosion Olaniyi Shokumai was riding the Tube on the way to a training course, with his headphones plugged in and listening to music - just as he would on any other journey. After the train pulled into Parsons Green station, however, things became far from ordinary. ""The doors slid open,"" said the 24-year-old fitness instructor. ""Some people had got off, some people had come in. ""Then I looked to my left and I saw lots of people running out. There were a lot of people just stamping on each other and I saw someone jumping over [them]. ""There was a woman on the floor and she couldn't breathe. I thought, 'This has got to be serious for people to do that.'"" Olaniyi Shokumai was on the train when the explosion went off What Scotland Yard later confirmed was an ""improvised explosive device"" had been detonated in one of the carriages, ""The first thing I did was call my mum... and check my sister had got to school OK,"" said Mr Shokumai. ""But I can't explain what I have just seen. I still don't think it's real. Finding it was terror-related makes it even worse."" Now he has been left with questions and worries about his future safety. ""That train wasn't moving and the doors were open,"" he said. ""What would have happened if they hadn't been?"" ""I'm now thinking to myself, is it safe to get on a train?"" This video can not be played Peter Crowley: ""There was a fireball above my head"" Meanwhile, hundreds of other passengers were stuck on trains further down the track, with little information about what had happened ahead of them. Transport for London did what it could to get trains moving again, but the line between Earl's Court and Wimbledon was at a standstill. After more than an hour waiting in carriages, some passengers were forced to climb out of emergency exits and down ladders to get away from the scene. Olga Diavati was on her way to work as a doctor at St Helier Hospital in Sutton but her train came to a stop just outside of Parsons Green station. It turned out it had been just moments behind the Tube containing the device. ""The driver told us something was happening and they tried to keep us informed,"" she said. ""We knew there was an incident but we didn't know what had happened."" The passengers waited patiently, unsure of how long they would be stuck there or what had played out just ahead. Pictures show a white bucket on fire inside a supermarket bag, with wires trailing on to the carriage floor More than an hour passed before it was time to move. ""They told us to go to the back of the train,"" said Ms Diavati. ""Then they put up a ladder for us to climb down. ""We then walked down some emergency path to get down from the tracks and walked through the cordon."" She was shaken by the experience and said she hoped it would be a ""once in a lifetime"" event. ""I'm still shocked,"" she added. ""But I'm also really relieved to be OK."" This video can not be played Tube blast witness: ""We ran for our lives... it was a human crush."" It was not just Londoners caught up in the chaos. Justine Daniels had just arrived with a friend from South Africa that morning, laden with suitcases and looking forward to a holiday. They were also on the Tube just behind the explosion and had to wait to find out what had unfolded in front of them. ""We were on there for over an hour before they let us out through the emergency exit and we walked along the tracks,"" she said. ""It's made me very anxious."" Commuters rushed from the station as locals waited to find out what had happened Ms Daniels was not alone. As more and more residents gathered outside the cordon, anxiety was rife and questions remained. ""It just brings back memories of 7/7,"" said one local - referring to the multiple Tube and bus bombings that hit London in 2005. ""Everyone is calling and checking we are OK, but it is hard to say, and really hard to handle."" The area is awash with emergency services, with a huge cordon around the scene and investigators scouring the train and platform. It will be down to them and their hard work to find the answers.

"A manhunt is under way to find the person behind Friday's Tube bombing Police are 'chasing down suspects' and trawling CCTV after Parsons Green attack Terror threat level raised to 'critical' - meaning an attack is expected 'imminently' The station reopened in the early hours of Saturday 29 people have been treated in hospital - police say 'most' had 'flash burns' The explosion on the District Line train is being treated as terrorism Police say it was caused by an 'improvised explosive device' Anyone with information, photos or video should call 0800 789 321 Dearbail Jordan and Claire Heald Photos from the scene after an explosion on a London Underground carriage. What does the device used on the District Line tell us about the attacker? British police have arrested an 18-year old man in the Dover area in connection with the bombing on a Tube train at Parsons Green. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent This is the fourth time the UK
national terror threat level has been raised to 'critical' since the system was
made public in 2006. The last time was in May this
year, following the Manchester Arena bombing, when it was wrongly thought that
the bomb-maker was still at large and could strike again. In the case of Parsons Green
it is perhaps surprising that it took the government so long - more than 12 hours -
to raise the threat level to critical, under advice from the Joint Terrorism
Analysis Centre, when it was obvious the perpetrator had neither died nor been
caught. Each time the level has gone
to critical, it has only stayed at this highest level of alertness for three to
four days - this is partly as it involves an unsustainably high tempo for the
police, intelligence and security services. Read the full analysis here. The Daily Telegraph Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the defence think tank Rusi, says attacks on public transport strike at the heart of cities and damage the economy. While it is impossible to guarantee complete security, he says initiatives such as public awareness campaigns, as well as authorities staying on top of the terrorist threat, mean the UK is seeing only relatively limited impact events. The Guardian The Guardian suggests,externalthe incompetence of terrorists has spared hundreds of lives in recent years. Before the improvised explosive device that failed to detonate fully on the tube train at Parsons Green, there have been many other bungled attempts to kill or maim people - including a world-be suicide bomber who set off his own device in a toilet. Eliminating key individuals with high levels of expertise will help stop knowledge of destruction passing to potential attackers, the paper says. The Times Writing inThe Times,,externalcrime and security editor Fiona Hamilton says that the Tube bombing at Parsons Green station is an important reminder of how vulnerable the transport network is. While security has been improved since the 7 July in 2005, ""a network with huge numbers of passengers can never be made 100% safe"". BBC Radio 5 live Former chairman of the intelligence and security committee
and Tory MP Dominic Grieve said he âaccepted the argumentâ that cuts to the
police have led to less community officers âpicking up tipsâ. He told Radio 5 Live that the government should âlisten carefullyâ
to critics of the cuts, as âanything which can increase our resilience against
terrorism needs to be consideredâ. However, he warned against âjumping to conclusionsâ that
more police on the beat would have stopped such attacks from happening. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 More must be done by
internet companies to tackle the spread of information online which inspires
attacks, Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the Today programme. That includes taking down manuals on how to build bombs like the one used in Parsons
Green. We take a lot down, but sometimes, very quickly, these things reappear, so we go at them again.""  We have to find a way to build pressure on internet companies to get them to invest some of their vast profits into the technologies to make sure we take down content very quickly or don't even let it surface.""

Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The MI5 websitedescribes what each terrorism threat level means,external. The last time it was raised to ""critical"" was following the Manchester terror attack in May. But Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the BBC Today programme that the Parsons Green attack is different. Unlike Manchester, where the bomber obviously killed himself along with all the innocent people he murdered, there was no obvious bomber attached to this and so there is effectively a manhunt.  We are trying to track down who did it. Whether itâs a bomber, or bombers, and all those other issues we need to answer. In this case, thatâs what imminent means.""  Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The national terror alert level was raised to critical later on Friday evening, hours after Friday morning's bombing. Asked why it took hours to increase the level, Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the BBC's Today programme: The threat level in this country is set independently of politicians by the Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre.  They look at a range of things. They look at the intelligence at their fingertips. They look at changes in people we are currently watching - and see if they are inspired by an attack to maybe copy things - and they look at the pace of the investigation.  If they feel as a result of all those factors that an attack is likely to become imminent then that's why they raise it to critical as they then did later in the day.""  Extra police officers are on duty on Saturday after the bombing, including from the British Transport Police. And the police have asked asked the Prime Minister Theresa May for authorisation to enact part of the first phase of Operation Temperer  - which provides military support to police force operations.

"This video can not be played Footage shows a burning bag on board the Tube carriage at Parsons Green station An ""improvised explosive device"" was detonated on a Tube train in south-west London during Friday's morning rush hour, injuring 29 people. The blast, at Parsons Green station on a District Line train from Wimbledon, is being treated as terrorism. So-called Islamic State says it carried out the attack, which Prime Minister Theresa May condemned as ""cowardly"". A hunt is under way for the person who placed the device and the area around the station has been evacuated. Specialist officers there securing the remains of the improvised device and ensuring it is stable. Mrs May said the attack had been ""intended to cause significant harm"". She said the UK's terror threat level would remain at severe - the second highest - but would be under review. Speaking in Downing Street after chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, she said there would be an increased armed police presence on the transport network in London. Hundreds of detectives and MI5 are investigating the attack, which took place at 08:20 BST on an eastbound train. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley earlier refused to say whether anyone had been arrested. One commuter took a picture of the device, which appeared to have wires protruding from a white canister Pictures taken of the train show a white bucket on fire inside a supermarket bag, with wires trailing on to the carriage floor. The BBC understands the device had a timer. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off. Had it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said.

Chris Wildish told BBC Radio 5 live he saw a bucket in a supermarket bag with ""low-level flames coming out of it"" by the door of the rear carriage. The blast happened at 08:20 BST at Parsons Green District Line station By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The bomb at Parsons Green was an improvised explosive device (IED) and, like those on 21/7, it didn't work as planned. The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year.

"The massive data breach is being investigated by US and UK data watchdogs Data about British people ""may potentially have been accessed"" during the data breach at the US credit rating firm Equifax. The UK arm of the organisation said files containing information on ""fewer than 400,000"" UK consumers was accessed in the breach. Last week, Equifax revealed details of the hack and said data on more than 143 million Americans was taken. The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating how the data was stolen. Information released when details of the breach were disclosed suggest that hackers got at Equifax's internal systems between mid-May and the end of July this year when the company discovered it had been penetrated. Data on social security numbers, birth dates and addresses, was taken during the incident. Equifax is now facing dozens of legal claims over the incident. In a statement, the UK office of Equifax said an internal investigation had shown that data on UK consumers was accessed during the hack. It said data on Britons was being held in the US due to a ""process failure"" which meant that a limited amount of information was stored in North America between 2011 and 2016. The information held included names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers. No addresses, passwords or financial data was involved.

"This video can not be played PM: Trump speculation 'not helpful' Prime Minister Theresa May has rebuked US President Donald Trump for suggesting suspects in Friday's London train blast were known to police. ""I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,"" she said. In a tweet, Mr Trump described the attackers as ""loser terrorists"" and ""sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard"". The bomb rocked a London Underground train, injuring 29 people. Latest updates: Incident at Parsons Green Witnesses describe what happened What powers do police have to deal with terrorism? In pictures: Parsons Green blast In a phone call with Mrs May on Friday, Mr Trump ""pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism"", the White House said. A Downing Street spokesman said he also offered ""his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London"", which he described to reporters earlier as ""a terrible thing"". This video can not be played President Trump says 'we've got to be much tougher' The call followed Mrs May's critical remarks about the US president. In one of his tweets, Mr Trump appeared to chide UK authorities: ""Must be proactive!"" London police said of his comments, ""any speculation is unhelpful"". Allow Twitter content?

In other tweets on Friday, the Republican president claimed his administration had ""made more progress in the last nine months"" against the Islamic State group than his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""Must be proactive & nasty!""he tweeted,external. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington Last month Donald Trump defended his delay in ascribing blame for the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville by saying: ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement."" That is advice the president seemed uninterested in heeding on Friday morning, as he fired off a series of tweets reacting to the London train incident. In fact, with few exceptions, Mr Trump is happy to quickly react to international incidents he suspects are perpetrated by Islamic militants, even when - in the case of the Philippines casino robbery - that's not the case. Besides his London remarks on Friday morning, the president again blasted Senate procedural rules, called for his Muslim travel ban to be ""tougher"", said the fight against the so-called Islamic State should be ""nasty"", and slammed ESPN, a US sports cable network, for being too political. Given that Mr Trump was under fire from his base on Thursday for reaching out to Democrats and being too conciliatory on immigration, it is hard not to think that his actions on Friday may be an effort to change the subject. Mr Trump also renewed a call to shut down internet capabilities, which he said were a main recruitment tool for terrorists. During the Republican presidential campaign in 2015, Mr Trump suggested he would ask Microsoft founder Bill Gates to cut off the internet because of terror recruitment. ""We're losing a lot of people because of the internet,"" Mr Trump said at the time, without elaborating. ""We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening."" ""We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways,"" he added. Friday was not the first time Mr Trump has been accused of reacting to suspected terrorist incidents before the facts are fully known. If he did leak sensitive information in his tweet about Scotland Yard, rather than indulging in pure speculation as London police say, it could amount to a security breach. In May,US officials angered British authoritieswhen details about a deadly bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester were divulged to US media. The New York Times was criticised for publishing photographsfrom the scene, as well as images of the bomb. The president also used Friday's tweets to promote his travel ban temporarily barring people from six Muslim-majority countries as well Syrian refugees from entering the US. Allow Twitter content?

"The pound has hit its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote after a senior Bank of England official fuelled speculation it could raise rates in the coming months. Gertjan Vlieghe, who has previously argued against a rate rise, said the ""moment is approaching"" when interest rates might need to go up. The Bank kept rates at 0.25% this week, buthinted at a rise in the future. Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to hit $1.3610. That was its highest level since 24 June, the day after the Brexit vote. The pound also gained more than 1.1% against the euro to rise to 1.137 euros by Friday night.. Analysts have suggested the Bank could now lift interest rates back to 0.5%, the level they were before the EU referendum, as soon as November. Mr Vlieghe, a member of the Bank's interest rate-setting committee, saidin a speech on Friday,external: ""Until recently, I thought the appropriate response of monetary policy was to be patient, given modest growth and subdued underlying inflationary pressure. ""But the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank Rate may need to rise."" Mr Vlieghe, who was the first Bank member to vote for a rate cut after the Brexit vote, said there was now growing evidence the UK economy was picking up. He pointed to unemployment falling to record lows, as well as signs that households are spending more and that wages are rising in the private sector. ""If these data trends of reducing slack, rising pay pressure, strengthening household spending and robust global growth continue, the appropriate time for a rise in Bank Rate might be as early as in the coming months,"" Mr Vlieghe said. Higher interest rates benefit savers but could raise mortgage costs for homeowners Markets which track investors' expectations for the Bank rate now give a 63% likelihood of a rise in November, the highest since the Brexit vote. At the start of the week the futures markets gave only a 20% chance. The return on government bonds, often influenced by interest rate expectations, also hit 15-month highs on Friday. The yield on five-year UK bonds rose 7 basis points to hit 0.772%, the highest since 23 June, 2016, the day Britain voted to leave the European Union. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Vlieghe's comments will support belief that the Bank of England could well raise interest rates before the end of 2017 with a move as soon as November very much in play."" This video can not be played Mark Carney suggests interest rates may change in the coming months Mr Archer cautioned that the Bank of England had ""talked up the likelihood of an interest rate hike then failed to follow through"" in the past. ""But there does seem to be a more concerted effort this time around and more unanimity within the Monetary Policy Committee of the case for a hike,"" he said. The Bank said on Thursday that higher inflation and a pick up in growth could lead to a rate rise soon. Growing speculation of a rate rise lifts the pound against other currencies because higher interest rates would make sterling more attractive to investors. The Bank dropped heavy hints in 2014, and again last year before the EU referendum, that it could raise rates, only to later change course.

"Theresa May has said that the explosion on a Tube train in Parsons Green in south-west London is a terrorist incident. But are the powers currently at the disposal of the UK security services strong enough to stop suspected terrorists? There were 379 arrests for terrorism-related offences in the year ending June 2017,external, according to the latest statistics from the Home Office. The arrests led to 33 prosecutions. In the year ending 31 March 2017, a total of 47 prisoners held for terrorism-related offences were released from custody, the Home Office says. Reality Check has been looking into the main powers the police and security services have to stop suspected terrorists. Under Section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000, the police can stop and search a suspect if they have reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities. It's difficult to know how many stop and searches are carried out under this power as most police forces don't separate Section 43 from other types of stop and search. One force that does hold the data is the Met police. They say that 646 people were searched under the Terrorism Act in the 12 months to June 2017. The police also have the power to search suspects even if they don't have suspicion of any links to terrorist activities. In May 2012, the rules were tightened: the police can only carry out searches in designated places where they have reasonable grounds to believe an act of terrorism will take place. At present, anyone arrested under the Terrorism Act can be held without charge for up to 14 days. In 2006, the law was changed in order to double the maximum period to 28 days. Only six suspects were ever held for that length of time. In 2011, it reverted back to 14 days,external. This was during the coalition government when it was decided not to proceed with the annual vote in Parliament to keep it at 28 days. Theresa May was home secretary at the time. In the year to June 2017, 125 people were detained under the powers. The police can arrest individuals whom they suspect of planning an attack. Section 5 of the 2006 Terrorism Act made it a specific offence to prepare (or help others prepare) for an act of terrorism. The maximum sentence for this offence is imprisonment for life. According to the CPS, 25 people were convicted under Section 5 in the year ending September 2016, up from 11 in the previous 12 months. There is no specific offence for carrying out a terrorist act. If a perpetrator was arrested after committing an attack they would be charged with offences such as murder or grievous bodily harm. It is also an offence for someone not to tell the police about someone they believe is involved in planning a terrorism act. A conviction for this offence can lead to a five year maximum sentence. Organisations can be banned by the home secretary if they are believed to be participating, promoting or encouraging terrorism. Being a member - or claiming to be a member - of a banned organisation can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison and/or a fine. TheHome Office says,external71 international terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. A small number of agencies are able to carry out surveillance inside residential premises or private vehicles. The power requires authorisation by the secretary of state. The Office of Surveillance Commissioners provides independent oversight. The security services also have the power to intercept communication data. The power is available to nine agencies, including GCHQ and MI5. The Investigatory Powers Act, passed in 2016, compels internet companies to keep records of every website and messaging service UK-based citizens visit for a year. Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures, or TPims, are a form of house arrest. They are given to people who are deemed a threat but cannot be prosecuted or deported if they are a foreign national. They were first introduced in 2012 and replaced controversial control orders. Those under TPims can be subjected to electronic tagging, having to report regularly to the police and surrendering travel documents. A suspect must live at home and stay there overnight - possibly for up to 10 hours. Electronic tags are used to monitor the movements of criminals The suspect is allowed to use a mobile phone and the internet to work and study, subject to conditions. In 2015, TPims were toughened by granting the ability to relocate subjects up to 200 miles away from their normal residence. TPims initially last for one year, although they can be extended to two. It is possible for them to remain beyond the two-year maximum if there is suspicion of further terrorism activity. A breach of a TPim can lead to imprisonment. As of November 2016, seven people were subjected to TPims - six of whom were British citizens. Temporary Exclusion Orders (TEOs) were created by the 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act. They apply to British citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activity abroad. They are designed to stop suspects from re-entering the UK unless they give themselves up at the border. Those subjected to TEOs are only allowed to return if they make contact with the UK authorities. If they do come back, they are likely to face either prosecution or close supervision under monitoring powers. The Orders last for up to two years at a time and can be renewed. Breaches could lead to a prison sentence. The home secretary applies the TEO where they ""reasonably suspect that the subject is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity while outside the UK"". The government released details on its disruptive and investigatory powers in February. In the wake of the Manchester bombing, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed they had been used once so far. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives the police the power to stop, search and hold individuals at ports, airports and international railway stations. Initially individuals could be questioned for up to nine hours - although a change in the guidelines means it is now up to six hours. The police also have the power to inspect electronic devices such as phones and laptops. The police do not need prior knowledge or suspicion to use Schedule 7 - although the Home Office says it's done after ""informed considerations"". In the year ending June 2017, a total of 17,501 people were stopped and searched using this power in Britain, a fall of 26% on the previous year. The number of people detained using this power has also fallen by 14% to 1,522.

"How long do people in Japan have to react to a North Korean missile launch? Virtually no time at all. The latest North Korean missile was launched at 06:57 Japan time, according to Japan's defence ministry. Citizens received a text message alert from the government at 07:00, warning that a missile had been launched and advising them to seek shelter indoors or underground. Between 07:04 and 07:06, the missile flew over the northern island of Hokkaido. It eventually landed in the Pacific, to the east of Japan, at 07:16. In other words, if the missile had been launched at a Japanese target, there could have been as little as four minutes between receiving the alert and impact - very little time to get to safety. And that's assuming people see the messages as soon as they're sent. That's slightly longer than last time - on 29 August, there were just three minutes between the alert being sent at 06:02 and the missile arriving over Hokkaido at 06:05. Allow Twitter content?

So defensive measures become extremely important. What does Japan have at the moment, and what else could it get? The current missile defence system comes in two stages. There is the Aegis system, which is deployed on Japanese, US and South Korean naval craft in the region. It is designed to intercept missiles in early or mid-flight. Then there are a number of short-range Patriot anti-missile batteries (PAC-3) deployed in Japan. They are designed to shoot down missiles as they descend towards their target. It's not a bad combination, but for the Aegis system your ships have to be in the right place at the right time for intercept to be possible. And while the Patriot system can provide effective defence for specific locations, it is less effective if it needs to defend a wide area. A PAC-3 missile defence system being tested at the US Yokota Air Base in Tokyo There are alternatives, but they are expensive and would take time to install. Japan could invest in a land-based Aegis system which would provide extra security. Or it could consider an extra layer of defence such as the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system, which has been deployed in Guam and supplied by the US to South Korea. The THAAD system is not really battle-tested, however. The trouble is that none of these defence systems would provide guaranteed protection against a barrage of missiles, fired unexpectedly. That's why there has been debate in the Japanese defence establishment about acquiring advanced systems that would allow Japan to destroy North Korean missiles either on the point of launch or even pre-emptively. It is not clear, though, whether this would be permissible under Japan's pacifist constitution.

"The country that took in the most refugees in the world last year was Uganda. It is said to have one of the most generous refugee policies in the world, even giving new arrivals their own land. But how do you turn a plot of bush into a home, with nothing more than a machete? Three, four, five, six, seven. A man in a blue anorak reads the numbers off his clipboard. Women line up, many with babies strapped to their backs, a few with some belongings. ""Group two: where are you?"" the man with the clipboard calls. ""Come."" A line of South Sudanese women wait to be shown their plot of land Maybe a dozen women follow him up the hill. It's raining, the women's flip flops couldn't be less suitable for the rocky mud track. Part way up the hill, the man stops. He gestures to the woman at the front of the queue. ""This is your plot,"" the man says. ""No English,"" she says. He laughs. ""You'll see,"" he says - in English - and strides off the mud track into the bush. The other women watching try to explain to her what's going on. As the man paces 50m to show her where the boundary of her land is, she follows, pushing through the knee-high grass in her long blue dress, a baby tied to her back. She lifts her bag above the bushes and ducks under tree branches. This is Ugandan refugee policy in action in Rhino Extension camp, one of several settlements in north-western Uganda which have so far received more than a million people fleeing South Sudan's civil war. Said to be the country with the most generous refugee policy in the world, Uganda gives new arrivals land. They're encouraged to make a life there, to farm - aid agencies give them seeds to grow crops. Some get goats. But first they have to build a home. How do you build a house? That's what I'm thinking. I wonder if that's what the woman in blue is thinking. She'll be given a sheet of plastic, some wooden poles and rope. That's apparently what you need to build a home here. And a machete. Because before she builds anything, she'll have to clear the wild bush land. She smiles uncertainly - looks, frankly, bemused - as the line of women and children trudge on up the hill, leaving her behind. Listen to Ruth Alexander's radio report forCrossing Continentson BBC Radio 4:Starting from Scratch in Uganda A little further on and the line is stopped again. A young single mother, Josephine Fony, a toddler strapped to her back, is led off the track into the bush. She blinks in the direction of the man with the clipboard who's dashed off, pacing out her boundary line. She can't see him. She can't see more than three metres in front of her. Quickly the man moves on, leading the line further up the hill. Josephine on her plot of land ""This land is not suitable,"" Josephine says. ""Who is going to prepare it for me?"" She reveals that she's not just very short-sighted, she had surgery three months ago and the scar on her side is still sore. The most vulnerable refugees are given help building their shelter, but it's not clear that Josephine qualifies for that assistance. She looks around. There's a large bush just behind her. ""We'll sleep under there tonight,"" she says. There's a fallen branch in front of her. She drags it to the side. It's a small start. The rest of the 50m by 50m square of wild rocky bush land will be much harder to clear. As well as a machete, she'll need at least a hoe, and a lot of strength. I wonder where she'll get that. Josephine starts clearing her land, baby on her back Josephine starts back down the hill to collect her few belongings and, as she leaves, she pauses to snap a twig on a tree - so that she can distinguish her plot from the others when she returns. She seems to be reluctantly accepting that this is her new home. A 30km drive away, in the neighbouring district of Yumbe, I have a glimpse of what might be in Josephine's near future. Home to more than 275,000 refugees, Bidi Bidi settlement is the largest of the refugee settlements in Northern Uganda - and, in the world. This video can not be played Uganda's refugee policy in numbers It's been open a year, and gone is the wild bush land and most of the plastic-covered shacks. In their place is smoothed mud ground and small mud-brick houses with thatched roofs. It's amazing to think that this transformation has occurred so quickly - and all of it done by hand. In one village - the settlement is organised into zones and villages - I find a young woman, Christine Aisha, who arrived in Uganda a year ago without her husband, who she says is a rebel soldier. That fact makes her unpopular with her neighbours, and she feels like she's always being watched. Christine in front of the hut she built She shows me round her land. In one mud hut - which she built herself - there's a kitchen, in another a bed for her children, and in a third, a double bed which a friend gave to her, where she sleeps. At the door of her bedroom, she's planted flowers. And behind the small buildings, she's growing maize, tomatoes, okra and aubergine. To get the money for the roof, she is fostering a young refugee with special needs. She named the girl Mercy. Life's not easy though, Christine says. Mercy requires a lot of attention, she has six other children to care for and she is unhappy with the local school, which is hopelessly over-subscribed. And now, termites are eating her new roof. Christine with her foster child, Mercy For the time being, Josephine and the other new arrivals at Rhino Camp Extension can only dream of a roof over their heads, with or without termites. A hundred metres or so up the mud track from Josephine's land, I find Rose Abua, her friend and neighbour from South Sudan, with whom she made the difficult journey to Uganda. She is sizing up her new home, which is indistinguishable from Josephine's: grassy land, interrupted only by rocks, bushes and trees. Does she feel confident she can clear the land and build a house herself, I ask. ""I don't have any choice,"" she says. ""My husband's been killed. I'm here alone. I'll try my best to do it - slowly, slowly."" Throughout our conversation, there's a little boy on her back, babbling away. He's very sweet and I wonder what he's saying. She listens, and laughs. He's saying he's hungry - that it's time for his mama to cook. Rose heads down the hill to claim her food rations. â¢The Ugandan government has negotiated with 200 community landowners, who have donated bush land to host the refugee settlements in Northern Uganda â¢The landowners hope to benefit from the development of the land, as schools, clinics and roads are built by international aid agencies for use by refugees and local people â¢Tensions have arisen over the clearing of the land by refugees cutting wood for fuel Listen to Assignment:Starting from Scratch in Ugandaon the BBC World Service Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

"When Winston Churchill went to see King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud in February 1945, he soon realised that the Â£100 ($134) worth of perfume he brought was no match for the robe, jewelled sword, dagger and diamond rings he received in return. Despite the fiscal squeeze of World War Two, the British prime minister returned home and promptly ordered one of the first Rolls-Royce cars produced after the war to be sent to the king seven months later. World leaders today may not hand out planes or luxury cars, but a recent State Department document detailing 83 items US President Donald Trump received during his May visit to Saudi Arabia underscores the long-held practice of extravagant gift-giving in the Gulf kingdom. During his first foreign visit as president, Mr Trump attended an Arab Islamic Summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where King Salman bestowed to him a stockpile of gifts including multiple swords, daggers, leather ammo holders and holsters, beaded and gold-embroidered dresses, dozens of Shemagh head scarves and other traditional Arab garments, leather sandals, perfumes and artwork. The list of items,obtained by the Daily Beast,externalthrough a Freedom of Information Act request to the State Department, appears to glimpse the gilded world and diamond-encrusted indulgence of Saudi culture. But in fact, the gifts are not so luxurious after all, says Ali Shihabi, executive director of the Arabia Foundation. ""In the old days Gulf governments used to give extravagant gifts,"" says Mr Shihabi. ""Expensive watches, pieces of jewelery, things like that."" Gifts now are more emblematic of local culture, highlighting crafts and artefacts from the region, he says. Ellen Wald, an American Middle East expert and author of the forthcoming book, Saudi, Inc, says the gifts are actually quite traditional and appear to reflect the type of trip and the size of the entourage of people who accompanied Mr Trump to Riyadh. Members of the American delegation to Saudi Arabia in 2008 received similar items such as robes and jewelled daggers, she says. Six weirdest gifts countries have given each other Mr Trump won't be sporting the cheetah fur-lined robe given to him or displaying the Saudi painting of his likeness anytime soon. US federal law bans government employees from accepting any gift from a foreign government valued at more than $390. The longstanding rule came from a 1966 law prohibiting gifts above a ""minimal value"" to stop governments looking to curry favour from showering American diplomats with prize horses, luxury cars and perhaps a Rolls-Royce or two. A1978 law,externalamended the minimum to $100, with an inflation-adjusted increase every three years. Federal employees are barred from keeping gifts worth more than $390 from foreign governments Past gifts bestowed to US presidents and other diplomats are either filed away in the National Archives, displayed as relics at a presidential library or sometimes auctioned off. Government officials are also given the option to purchase the gifts they received for market value. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exercised that option in 2012, when she purchased the black pearl necklace given to her by then-Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The necklace was valued at $970. Blue and silver wool robe and purple wool robe, both lined with white tiger fur Orange and gold wool robe lined with cheetah fur Dagger made of pure silver with mother of pearl sheath and various designs Large box containing dagger, sword, ammo holder and holster Large canvas artwork depicting Saudi woman Artwork featuring a picture of President Trump Kuwaiti constitution Visits by foreign dignitaries have customarily entailed an exchange of thoughtful - and sometimes not-so-thoughtful - gifts. Gerald Feierstein, director of Gulf affairs for the Middle East Institute, says the practice of gift-giving is not unique to the Gulf kingdom. He recalls receiving a Rolex watch from the Bahraini government during a trip to the Middle East in the 1990s while he served as deputy director in the Office of Arabian Peninsula Affairs at the State Department. ""It was such an impersonal thing that they didn't actually give it to me, they just delivered these watches, for all of the members of the delegation, to the secretary's airplane and off we went,"" he says. State officials told foreign governments to stop giving President Bill Clinton saxophones, the instrument he played When he went to submit the expensive watch to the State Department's protocol division, which is tasked with organising diplomatic gifts, he was told they had a ""room full of watches from the Bahrainis"". But other gifts are tailored to the US president's predilections. State Department officials once barred foreign governments from giving horses to President Ronald Reagan, a nod to his cowboy persona, and presenting President Bill Clinton with saxophones, his instrument of choice, Mr Feierstein recalls. In 2015, President Barack Obama received a host of oddities, including a framed watercolour painting of men playing basketball from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a $110,000 gold-plated mechanical bird from Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of Qatar, and a gold-plated, sterling silver horse sculpture embellished with diamonds, tsavorites, yellow sapphires, rubies and obsidian mounted on a rotating, piano-black lacquer base from King Salman. Barack Obama's gift list reveals gem-covered sculptures and matching bikes In one trip to Australia's Northern Territory in 2011, Mr Obama received crocodile insurance that would have paid out A$50,000 to Michelle Obama if the president was snapped up by the deadly reptile. When it comes to reciprocation, Mr Feierstein adds, the US reputation is less than generous. Mr Obama raised eyebrows when he gave British Prime Minister Gordon Brown aDVD box set of American movies, which many considered a snub to the UK leader. Though Mr Trump has previously berated his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for taking contributions from the Saudis and made exaggerated claims about the government, the gifts he received probably do not reflect his relationship with the country, Ms Wald says. ""It reflects the culture of the region more than any sign of diplomacy or relationship,"" she explains. In fact, what is unique is Mr Trump's multi-day trip there, which was more common before the advent of air travel, she adds. The first US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, J Rives Childs, would embark on a minimum three-day affair, when he would receive items including a sword in a gold scabbard, a carpet, a watch and a gold dagger. On one occasion he refused the offer of a concubine to keep him company in Riyadh, Ms Walds adds. ""It's a way for the government to support the domestic industry by gifting something to the president of the United States,"" Mr Shihabi says. ""Gifts now are truly just a symbolic gesture.""

"Angela Merkel may have won but her position at the head of the CDU is weakened Angela Merkel has won four more years as chancellor and will continue to command the stage in Germany. But this is her party's worst performance with her as leader and overnight Germany's political scene has changed. The third biggest force in Germany is the nationalist and populist right of Alternative for Germany, or AfD. So what does this shake-up mean for Germany? On the surface, very little. But in reality everything has. Germany is at a turning point. Angela Merkel has secured a fourth term, but she knows she has presided over the CDU's worst electoral performance since 1949. For the first time since the 1950s, Germany will have six parties in the Bundestag, and the two giants of the political centre are at their lowest ebb. Election marks shift in German politics Mrs Merkel's main challenger, Martin Schulz, dubbed her ""the biggest loser"", even though it was his centre-left SPD that registered its worst ever showing and, barring a dramatic change of mind, will form the opposition. The real winners of this election are the nationalist, right-wing AfD and the pro-business FDP, who have returned to parliament after four years in the wilderness and are likely to return to government. Within an hour of AfD's success becoming clear, joint leader Alexander Gauland promised to ""hunt down the government, Mrs Merkel, and get our country and people back"". They will be a loud, confident opposition party with the chancellor in their sights. Alice Weidel of AfD promised party supporters to push for a committee to investigate Mrs Merkel's decision to allow migrants into Germany What does Alternative for Germany (AfD) want? With more than 90 seats in the Bundestag and 13% of the popular vote they will make life very uncomfortable for her government. They argue the chancellor has broken a number of laws with her refugee policy and say a committee should investigate her. Take apart the right-wing party's results and you will see a big east-west split. AfD are the second biggest party in the east of the country with over 20% of the vote. In the eastern state of Saxony they were even neck and neck with the CDU on just under 30%. Amongst men in the east they were the most popular party, three points ahead of the CDU. Their showing in the west was around 11%. AfD attracted a million voters from the CDU and 470,000 from the SPD, as well as over a million new voters. They simply addressed the concerns of voters worried about the influx of migrants and refugees. Afascinating survey of AfD voters,externalon Sunday showed: 99% felt the party had a better understanding that people did not feel safe any more 99% agreed with AfD's policy to reduce the influx of Islam in Germany 96% backed their plan to restrict severely the arrival of migrants and refugees 85% felt they were the only party they could register their protest with The AfD's campaign featured a poster saying ""Burkas? We like bikinis"" If this election was just about the economy, the two parties that have steered Germany through the past four years would have sailed through. Germany's economy is doing very nicely, thank you. GDP is growing, unemployment is low and the government receives more in tax than it spends. But this was the first federal vote since the Merkel government opened Germany's doors to an influx of migrants and refugees in 2015, letting in over around 1.3 million people. The conservative chancellor promised Germans they would manage, and they did. Asylum applications have fallen dramatically in the past year and Mrs Merkel has taken a tougher line on deportations. But the issues of asylum, integration and deportation of failed asylum seekers hovered over the entire campaign to such an extent that immigration monopolised the only TV debate between the two challengers for chancellor, Mrs Merkel and Martin Schulz. And AfD were the party that benefited most, even though they were not in the studio. Their poll numbers went up as the campaign progressed. Rarely has the general atmosphere in the country been so toxic and confrontational during an election campaign, Focus magazine observed. One very revealing number from the survey of AfD voters was that 55% believed the party did not distance itself sufficiently from far-right positions. In other words, more than half the party's voters felt they were too extreme but voted for them anyway. Alice Weidel (L) and Alexander Gauland (R) have both been caught up in remarks condemned as far-right They espouse anti-immigrant and anti-Islam policies and several of their leading figures have made remarks widely condemned as extremist. Their programme calls for a ban on minarets and considers Islam incompatible with German culture. ""Islam does not belong to Germany,"" the party believes. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned voters ahead of the poll against having ""real Nazis in the German Reichstag for the first time since the end of World War Two"". Germany's Central Council of Jews said its worst fears had come true. What they have said: Joint leader Alexander Gauland has called for Germans to reclaim their history: ""We have the right to be proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars."" He has also said integration commissioner Aydan Ãzoguz should be ""dumped"" back to her parents' country of origin, Turkey. Last year he said he would not want a black German footballer as a neighbour A 2013 email from lead candidate Alice Weidel was unearthed during the campaign in which she made derogatory remarks about Arabs as well as Roma and Sinti (Gypsies). Ms Weidel rejected the report as ""fake news"" Another candidate, Frauke Petry, suggested in 2016 that migrants should be shot at ""if necessary"", to stop them entering Germany illegally More on AfD: German right-wingers pick election team AfD leader faces perjury fight A so-called Jamaica coalition may be the only option open to Angela Merkel, now that Martin Schulz has ruled out a ""grand coalition"" of the two old giants. She wants to talk to the SPD, but he wants to lead the opposition and not leave the job to AfD. Jamaica appears to be the answer for Angela Merkel's coalition negotiations So that leaves Jamaica, named after the colours of the parties involved: the black of the CDU, the yellow of the liberal FDP, and the Greens. It is an unlikely pairing and there is little precedent for it. A prototype has just begun work in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, but there are genuine differences between the liberals and Greens. The Greens want to phase out 20 coal-fired power plants and the FDP disagree. But Mr Schulz thinks it could work: ""I think this might be what the country needs,"" he said late on Sunday. ""The parties on the right and left as part of this opposition - this will lead to the debates we need to be having."" And what if the Jamaica talks fall flat? Germany could be staring at early elections because the idea of a minority government has never existed on a federal level and Angela Merkel has appeared to rule it out. Christian Lindner's FDP hopes to return to government, despite four years spent outside the Bundestag If the FDP returns to power, watch out for its leader, Christian Lindner, a charismatic 38-year-old who has tried to focus on education and a ""digital first"" campaign. Party colleague Alexander Graf Lambsdorff will also be eyeing a top job. Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt of the Greens will be focusing on climate change in coalition talks The left-leaning Green Party is led by centrists Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt and Cem Ãzdemir. He has called for Angela Merkel to be much tougher with Turkey, while she has held positions in the Protestant Church. The Greens will be looking for guarantees from the chancellor on environmental protection and the Paris climate change pact. ""The social question is going to be at the heart of these debates about the future, and if the SPD is not interested in governing, we will be the party to carry this debate, especially in coalition talks,"" says Ms GÃ¶ring-Eckardt.

"""I swear to God, I had no plan at all,"" says Horan of life after One Direction Whatever you do, don't ask Niall Horan about One Direction's concert debut. ""I never want to talk about that gig again,"" grimaces the star. ""Worst night of my life. The worst One Direction show ever."" The band were less than a year old when they played the Watford Colosseum in December 2011. They'd just hit number one with What Makes You Beautiful but, despite weeks of live performance on the X Factor, they weren't quite prepared for the rigors of a full show. ""We've refused to talk about it ever since,"" says the 24-year-old. ""It was a disaster. We were just a joke. ""Anything we rehearsed just went out the window. It was our first ever gig and we just didn't know what the [expletive] was going on."" One Direction on their first tour (L-R): Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik Contrary to his memory, the show got afour star review in the Watford Observer,external, which praised the ""tightness of the vocals""; and fan-shot footage captures a likeable, if ramshackle, trot through the band's first album. ""Yeah, there was a charm,"" admits Horan. ""But the second gig was better."" Of course, One Direction went on to sell out stadiums around the world - but with the band on hiatus, Horan is back in smaller venues again, giving fans a preview of his acoustically-led debut album in a series of intimate gigs in the UK, US, Japan, Australia, Mexico and Europe. ""It's brilliant, especially with the type of music I'm doing,"" he says. ""You feel like you're in someone's living room. ""With One Direction, we were doing five or six kilometres a night, running around the stage like lunatics. ""There's none of that now. I'll probably put on a bit of weight, standing still and playing guitar all the time!"" This video can not be played Niall Horan performs Slow Hands on The One Show. So far, the singer has released two solo singles - the folky coming-of-age taleThis Town,externaland the slyly funkySlow Hands,external- both of which highlight Horan's handsomely husky voice. Crucially, they've made an impression outside One Direction's core fanbase. Slow Hands, in particular, stealthily became one of the songs of the summer. ""It's been out 15 or 16 weeks now and it's still creeping up the chart,"" says Horan when we meet in late August. ""It's the fourth most-played song on US radio this week, which is just a joke."" It's a world away from One Direction's chart performance, where songs would typically make a strong debut then nosedive out of the Top 10. ""I think it's just the way streaming is these days,"" says Horan. ""Before, you'd release a song and you'd know by the end of the week if it was going to be number one or not. Now, you have a chance to get a bit of longevity. ""I think it's much better. It gives people time to live with the tunes."" Horan was born in 1993 in the small Irish town of Mullingar. His mum soldered pewter, the town's main export, and his dad worked at the butcher's counter in Tesco. His parents divorced when he was five and, after a period of shuttling between households, Horan moved in with his father. With his dad working nights, he often had to do his own washing, ironing and cooking. In the mornings, he'd wake himself up and walk a mile-and-a-half to school. One Direction may have finished third in X Factor, but they went on to become the series' most successful graduates Everything changed when he auditioned for the X Factor in 2010, at the age of 16. Dressed in a lumberjack shirt and brimming confidence (""I've been compared to Justin Bieber, and it's not a bad comparison""), he belted out a wobbly version of Ne-Yo's So Sick. Despite negative comments from the judges, he squeaked through to the next round and was eventually incorporated into One Direction. ""After the first audition, I packed up everything in my life in a bag,"" he wrote in One Direction's book, Who We Are. ""I didn't realise at the time that, when I was stuffing clothes into the little suitcase, that was pretty much me leaving home for good."" For the next five years he was locked in a yearly cycle of recording, promoting and touring albums. At the BBC Music Awards in 2015, Horan confessed he'd only spent four nights in his own bed that year. So by the time One Direction went on hiatus that December, he was more than ready for a break. ""I didn't really want to do anything at all,"" he says. ""In my head, it was like, 'Jesus Christ, this is going to be brilliant, I can actually not work for a while'"". The star made the most of his first proper holiday in five years He booked an extended, open-ended holiday, backpacking with friends around South East Asia and hanging out in the Caribbean. ""I swear to God, I had no plan at all,"" he says. ""I just wanted to get out and see the world from a different angle."" Along the way, he swam with sharks in the Bahamas (""they feel like sandpaper"") and got into some typical tourist scrapes (""a monkey stole my wallet""). But then, unexpectedly, he got bored. ""It was a bit of a shock to the system,"" he admits. ""I was sitting at home watching Jeremy Kyle every day and I was like, 'Get me out of here!' ""I just wanted to get back in the studio and write in some shape or form."" After revisiting the music of his childhood - Don Henley, Damien Rice, The Eagles - he's already written some basic ideas ""on the backs of trucks and sitting on trains"" in Asia. The plan was to give them away to other artists, but then his manager heard This Town. ""He rang me and said, 'What are you doing? You need to make an album!'"" The singer is the most popular member of One Direction on Twitter, with 33 million followers Encouraged, Horan signed a deal with legendary US label Capitol Records, much to the dismay of Simon Cowell, whopublicly suggested,externalthe One Direction star had been ""disloyal"" by leaving his own company, Syco. ""Ah, listen, Simon's Simon,"" says Horan, equitably. ""Fair enough, at the time he might have been upset about it but do you know what? I sure he's walked straight over that bridge since and he's fine with it. ""He's a great guy and he's made our lives possible - so I'm forever grateful to him. ""I love Simon and he loves me... secretly."" Horan was convinced to leave Syco by Steve Barnett, a music executive who'd played a key role in launching One Direction in the US, and became the CEO of Capitol Records in 2012. Their relationship and Capitol's heritage of nurturing singer-songwriters proved to be an unbeatable combination. ""When I signed, Steve showed me around the building,"" Horan recalls excitedly. ""They've got all the original tapes of every Beach Boys song, every Frank Sinatra song, every Beatles song. ""You're walking down the corridor looking at all the pictures on the wall and it's incomprehensible, the artists that have gone through them halls down there."" Horan duets with country star Maren Moris on one of his new songs For his own album, he's worked with music industry heavyweights Don Was (The Rolling Stones) and Tobias Jesso Jr (Adele), while seeking out new talent like country star Maren Morris, who appears on the soaring duet Seeing Blind - tentatively pencilled in as his fourth single. Before that comes Too Much To Ask, which is out on Friday. A delicate heartbreak ballad, it's bound to get gossip columnists dredging up Horan's ex-girlfriends Ellie Goulding and Selena Gomez - but, sipping a Starbucks in his plush hotel room, he doesn't seem too concerned about that side of fame. He just wants people to hear the record. ""I would obviously like it to go to number one, that would be the dream,"" he says. ""But it is what it is. ""If it's getting a lot love and jumps in at number two or number three, I don't mind."" Too Much To Ask is out now. Niall Horan's debut album will be out later this year.

"This video can not be played PM: Trump speculation 'not helpful' Prime Minister Theresa May has rebuked US President Donald Trump for suggesting suspects in Friday's London train blast were known to police. ""I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,"" she said. In a tweet, Mr Trump described the attackers as ""loser terrorists"" and ""sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard"". The bomb rocked a London Underground train, injuring 29 people. Latest updates: Incident at Parsons Green Witnesses describe what happened What powers do police have to deal with terrorism? In pictures: Parsons Green blast In a phone call with Mrs May on Friday, Mr Trump ""pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism"", the White House said. A Downing Street spokesman said he also offered ""his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London"", which he described to reporters earlier as ""a terrible thing"". This video can not be played President Trump says 'we've got to be much tougher' The call followed Mrs May's critical remarks about the US president. In one of his tweets, Mr Trump appeared to chide UK authorities: ""Must be proactive!"" London police said of his comments, ""any speculation is unhelpful"". Allow Twitter content?

In other tweets on Friday, the Republican president claimed his administration had ""made more progress in the last nine months"" against the Islamic State group than his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""Must be proactive & nasty!""he tweeted,external. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington Last month Donald Trump defended his delay in ascribing blame for the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville by saying: ""I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement."" That is advice the president seemed uninterested in heeding on Friday morning, as he fired off a series of tweets reacting to the London train incident. In fact, with few exceptions, Mr Trump is happy to quickly react to international incidents he suspects are perpetrated by Islamic militants, even when - in the case of the Philippines casino robbery - that's not the case. Besides his London remarks on Friday morning, the president again blasted Senate procedural rules, called for his Muslim travel ban to be ""tougher"", said the fight against the so-called Islamic State should be ""nasty"", and slammed ESPN, a US sports cable network, for being too political. Given that Mr Trump was under fire from his base on Thursday for reaching out to Democrats and being too conciliatory on immigration, it is hard not to think that his actions on Friday may be an effort to change the subject. Mr Trump also renewed a call to shut down internet capabilities, which he said were a main recruitment tool for terrorists. During the Republican presidential campaign in 2015, Mr Trump suggested he would ask Microsoft founder Bill Gates to cut off the internet because of terror recruitment. ""We're losing a lot of people because of the internet,"" Mr Trump said at the time, without elaborating. ""We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening."" ""We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways,"" he added. Friday was not the first time Mr Trump has been accused of reacting to suspected terrorist incidents before the facts are fully known. If he did leak sensitive information in his tweet about Scotland Yard, rather than indulging in pure speculation as London police say, it could amount to a security breach. In May,US officials angered British authoritieswhen details about a deadly bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester were divulged to US media. The New York Times was criticised for publishing photographsfrom the scene, as well as images of the bomb. The president also used Friday's tweets to promote his travel ban temporarily barring people from six Muslim-majority countries as well Syrian refugees from entering the US. Allow Twitter content?

"A 23-year-old man has admitted killing Perthshire toddler Harlow Edwards by driving dangerously and crashing into her on a pavement. Luke Pirie lost control of his vehicle and caused the death of the two-year-old in Coupar Angus last October. The High Court in Edinburgh was told that Harlow's mother Sara ""can't put into words her grief at losing her baby"". Pirie, of Forfar, will be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow on 4 October. He also admitted causing serious injury to two other people, a 17-year-old girl and a six-year-old boy, in the same incident. The court was told Prie had passed his driving test the previous year and was said to be ""worked up"" and angry as he left his work at Scone Airport in Perth to travel to his partner's house in Montrose. Advocate Depute Iain McSporran QC told the court Pirie was seen speeding through Coupar Angus and had used his mobile for calls, texts and Facetime before the crash. CCTV showed his Ford Focus speeding behind a line of traffic moments before the crash. The cars in front had slowed as a Citroen signalled to turn right but Pirie pulled out and tried to overtake the traffic, colliding with the Citreon at about 50mph as it began to turn. Mr McSporran said Pirie lost control of his car, which spun and mounted the pavement where the children were walking after getting off a bus from Dundee. Harlow suffered ""multiple severe injuries"" while the 17-year-old suffered bleeding on the brain and a spinal fracture which left her in a wheelchair for three months. The other child suffered a skull fracture and permanent scarring in the crash. Defence lawyer Mark Stewart QC said his client ""wrongly believed it was a stationary line of traffic"" when he tried to overtake. A victim impact statement from Harlow's mother Sara was read to the court in which she said she had been ""robbed of a lifetime of memories"". Mrs Edwards said she cries herself to sleep every night and now expects bad news every time the phone rings. Pirie was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing. Judge Lord Ericht told him: ""Because of what you did, Harlow will never return home.""

"This video can not be played ""Long live Cassini"" - the project team says farewell The American-led Cassini space mission to Saturn has just come to a spectacular end. Controllers had commanded the probe to destroy itself by plunging into the planet's atmosphere. It survived for just over a minute before being broken apart. Cassini had run out of fuel and Nasa had determined that the probe should not be allowed simply to wander uncontrolled among Saturn and its moons. The loss of signal from the spacecraft occurred pretty close to the prediction. Here at mission control, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, the drop-off was timed at 04:55 PDT (11:55 GMT; 12:55 BST). How the last hours unfolded Nasa's Earl Maize addressed fellow controllers: ""Congratulations to you all. This has been an incredible mission, an incredible spacecraft and you're all an incredible team. I'm going to call this the end of mission. Project manager off the net."" The statement brought restrained applause and some comforting embraces. The loss of signal indicated that the probe was tumbling wildly in the planet's gases. Travelling downwards at over 120,000km/h, it could have survived the violence for no more than about 45 seconds before being torn to pieces. Incineration in the heat and pressure of the plunge was inevitable - but Cassini still managed to despatch home some novel data on the chemical composition of Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini has been circling around Saturn for 13 years On the icy moon Enceladus it discovered... an ocean of water hidden beneath the surface eight times as deep as the oceans on Earth. Cassini's chemical analysis of the water... suggests conditions could be right for micro-organisms to live there. While visiting Saturn's largest moon which is the size of the planet Mercury Cassini flew over seas and lakes of methane and discovered they are up to 170 metres deep. On Saturn itself, above the north pole Cassini took photos of a hexagonal hurricane 32,000km across. Scientists have puzzled over how this giant storm spins. Cassini measured its winds at a staggering 330mph Four times as strong as a hurricane on Earth! Back out on the edge of one of Saturn's rings among the clouds of ice particles Cassini even captured the birth of a possible new moon. It's been named Peggy and is just 1km wide. Finally, running out of fuel, Cassini was flown directly towards the planet until it burnt up in Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini: A mission of 'astonishing discovery' Click next button to proceed Loading ... Swipe to progress Images: Nasa, Kongle  Meet the people who made Cassini happen In Pictures: Cassini probe's greatest shots What were the mission's biggest findings? And so ends one of the most successful space missions in history. In its thirteen years at Saturn, Cassini has transformed our understanding of the sixth planet from the Sun. It has watched monster storms encircle the globe; it witnessed the delicate interplay of ice particles move through the planet's complex ring system; and it revealed extraordinary new insights on the potential habitability of Saturn's moons. Titan and Enceladus were the standout investigations. The former is a bizarre place where liquid methane rains from an orange sky and runs into huge lakes. Cassini put a small European robot called Huygens on Titan's surface in 2005. It returned a remarkable image of pebbles that had been smoothed and rounded by the action of that flowing methane. Cassini also spied what are presumed to be volcanoes that spew an icy slush and vast dunes made from a plastic-like sand. On Enceladus, the observations were no less stunning. This video can not be played ""Where Cassini took its final plunge"": Linda Spilker explains the last images Controllers' screens: The loss of signal was indicated by the absence of a green spike (right) This moon was seen to spurt water vapour into space from cracks at its south pole. The H2O came from an ocean held beneath the icy shell of Enceladus. When Cassini flew through the water plumes, it showed that conditions in the sub-surface ocean were very probably suitable for life. Today, scientists are already talking about how they can go back with another, more capable probe to investigate this idea further. Cassini's cameras were switched off for the last few hours leading to the plunge A great many of those researchers have been gathered this week at the nearby campus of the California Institute of Technology. They watched a feed from the control room at JPL on giant screens. Jonathan Lunine, from Cornell University at Ithaca, New York, spoke for many when he said: ""I feel sad but I've felt sad the whole week; we knew this was going to happen. And Cassini performed exactly as she was supposed to and I bet there is some terrific data on the ground now about Saturn's atmosphere."" And Linda Spilker, the Nasa Cassini project scientist, added: ""When I look back on the Cassini mission I see a mission that was running a 13-year marathon of scientific discovery. And this last orbit was just the last lap. And so we stood in celebration of successfully completing the race. And I know I stood there with a mixture of tears and applause."" Although the probe has gone its science lives on. It has acquired a huge amount of data that will keep researchers busy for decades to come. A lot of it has barely even been assessed. ""Linda Spliker and I were joking earlier that those last few seconds of the Cassini mission - our first 'taste' of the atmosphere of Saturn - might be a number of PhD theses for students to come,"" observed Michael Watkins, the director of JPL. ""So, even in those last few seconds, it will continue its re-writing of the textbooks."" Pictures of Titan were pulled off the probe's memory before the plunge This video can not be played Why scientists are so excited about Saturn's icy moon Enceladus Cassini has photographed some of Saturn's 62 moons: the two-toneIapetus (1)with its walnut-like equatorial ridge;Mimas (2), which has a giant crater that instantly makes everyone think of the ""Death Star"" from the Star Wars movies;Hyperion (3), which displays clusters of bizarre pock marks akin to a sponge or wasps' nest;Atlas (4), which resembles a flying saucer; the potato-likePrometheus (5); andPan (6), which has a shape that would not look out of place in a ravioli dish. A last look at Enceladus going over the northern limb of Saturn Also in the end group of images was this fabulous shot of the rings The Cassini-Huygens mission is a joint endeavour of Nasa, and the European and Italian space agencies. The BBC has plenty of coverage of the ending of the mission on both TV and radio.Inside Scienceran a preview of the climax on Radio 4.A Horizon documentarywill also review the mission and the final hours in a special programme to be broadcast on Monday 18 September at 21:00 BST on BBC Two.

"Jodie Whittaker in the BBC series ""Trust Me"" - the story of a ""Quacksalver"" Snout-fair, dowsabel and percher are among 30 ""lost"" words which experts believe are still in current use. Researchers have drawn up the list to persuade people that these defunct words can still have a relevance. Snout-fair is a word for handsome, dowsabel means ""lady-love"", and a percher is a social climber. Dominic Watt, senior linguistics lecturer at the University of York, said he hoped people would re-engage with the language of old. The team spent three months searching through old books and dictionaries to create the list. Mr Watt wants to bring these words back into modern conversations. ""We've identified lost words that are both interesting and thought-provoking, in the hope of helping people re-engage with language of old,"" he said. ""Snout-fair"", for example, means ""having a fair countenance; fair-faced, comely, handsome"", while ""sillytonian"" refers to ""a silly or gullible person, esp one considered as belonging to a notional sect of such people"". ""Dowsabel"" is ""applied generically to a sweetheart, 'lady-love'"". Margot Leadbetter, the snobby neighbour from 1970s BBC sitcom, The Good Life, could be seen as an arch example of a ""percher"" - someone ""who aspires to a higher rank or status; an ambitious or self-assertive person"". The BBC series Trust Me is the story of a ""quacksalver"" - a person who ""dishonestly claims knowledge of, or skill in, medicine; a pedlar of false cures"". Joey Essex: ""Snout-fair"" to some, to others a ""sillytonian"" The list of 30 ""lost words"" are grouped into three areas the researchers feel are relevant to modern life: post-truth (deception); appearance, personality and behaviour; and emotions. The final list also includes the words ""ear-rent"" - described as ""the figurative cost to a person of listening to trivial or incessant talk"", ""slug-a-bed"" - meaning ""a person who lies in late"", and ""merry-go-sorry"" - a phrase used to describe ""a mixture of joy and sorrow"".

Engineers had to repair a fire damaged wall near the affected line, which has been ""made safe"", Network Rail said. Network Rail said the blaze had left a trackside retaining wall ""in danger of collapse"", which needed to be ""dismantled, made safe and rebuilt"". While the wall was dismantled, all trains travelling between Euston and Milton Keynes were stopped. London Midland said they were trying to restore train services as quickly as possible Virgin Trains to and from Scotland, north-west England, the West Midlands and north Wales have severe delays Southern services between Milton Keynes Central, Watford Junction and Shepherds Bush have been cancelled. The line is expected to remain closed for the rest of the day. London Overground trains between Watford Junction and London Euston are experiencing severe delays A reduced overground service is running between Shepherds Bush and Clapham Junction We're always quick to pile into Network Rail when they mess up, but credit where it is due, their engineers have got this line open much quicker than everyone expected and it wasn't an easy job. They had to get specialist equipment on site, access the track and demolish a wall, before making the line safe again. We were initially told it would take all-day but they were done and dusted by 13:00. So the line is now open. Trains will doubtless be affected throughout the rest of the day, but it could have been a lot worse. Eight fire engines and 58 firefighters were called to a fire at a factory and offices in Chantry Place, London A regular shuttle service is operating between Milton Keynes, Northampton and Wolverton. A separate shuttle train service between Euston and Harrow and Wealdstone is being established. A rail replacement bus service between Milton Keynes Central and Luton Airport Parkway is running for Virgin Trains customers. Tickets for affected services are being accepted on: London Buses, Southeastern, Southern, Thameslink, East Coast, East Midlands, London Midland and TransPennine Express via any reasonable route. Network Rail said: ""Passengers wanting to travel on the West Coast main line and West London line are urged to check with their train operator orNational Rail Enquiries,externalbefore travelling as disruption and cancellations are to be expected throughout the day."" The wall was in danger of collapsing, Network Rail said Emergency services were called to the site in Chantry Place, Harrow, at 23:47 on Thursday. London Fire Brigade said a cordon was put in place at the warehouse fire and 12 local residents were evacuated amid fears that propane cylinders might explode.

"Fashion stylist Donna McCulloch says Instagram ""is your shop front"" Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo app, has become a lucrative shop window for many small entrepreneurs. So what are the secrets of its success? When Facebook bought the photo app Instagram in 2012 for a cool $1bn (Â£760m), eyebrows were raised at the value the tech giant had placed on this 18-month-old start-up. Fast forward to 2017, and while Instagram may still be Facebook's little sister, it has built a sizeable community of 700 million users - dwarfing both Twitter and Snapchat. With improved photo filters and the addition of Instagram Stories, a feature that lets users upload short videos that disappear after 24 hours, the platform has become a big hit with freelancers and small organisations looking to reach new audiences. So how can you use it to make money? ""Instagram is your shop front,"" says Donna McCulloch, a fashion stylist who works under the name Sulky Doll. ""People don't ask for business cards any more - they ask for your 'handle' [Instagram nickname]. It's instant - you both get your phones out, and you're connected."" Yoga enthusiast Cat Meffan was ""shocked and excited"" by Instagram's marketing power For yoga instructor Cat Meffan, the glamorous images she posts of herself in impressive yoga positions in picturesque locations around the world are intended to inspire and motivate her 77,000 followers. But they also help her to build her business. ""I sold out my first yoga retreat in five days and all I did was put up one Instagram post,"" she says. ""I was extremely shocked and excited. That's the power of Instagram."" Cat says she'll spend up to an hour crafting the captions alongside her photos - sometimes more than she'll spend on taking the photo itself. ""Sometimes I'll go out and do a photoshoot with my partner. But usually it's me with a self-timer or holding the phone."" Like Donna, Cat finds adding hashtags to her photos a useful way of reaching a new audience. A search for #yoga, for example, will bring up her images, along with those of others, while Donna's #OOTD (Outfit of The Day) are by far her most popular. ""It's a nice way of finding like-minded people,"" says Cat. Singer Selena Gomez has 126 million followers on Instagram Both women also use the Stories feature to post videos which, they say, show them as they really are - an antidote to the artificial gloss that many Instagrammers are notorious for adding to their images. ""Stories allow people to get more of a handle on you as a person and a brand,"" says Donna. ""Stories are like peeking behind the net curtains. The biggest compliment is when people say you come across the same in real life as you do on your feed [Instagram page]."" Both Cat and Donna have built their Instagram pages tightly around a very specific theme - yoga/wellness and fashion, respectively. That's important if you want to grow the number of people who follow you says Danny Coy, a photographer with 173,000 followers who now also works as an Instagram consultant. For Â£300 a month his firm Vibrance says it can ""typically"" grow an account by 2,000 followers every four weeks. Techniques for attracting followers include posting regularly and having a bank of interesting images to hand. ""You don't have to post every day, but engagement peaks - after 24 hours it's done,"" he says. ""It's important to stick to your niche."" Photographer Danny Coy thinks Instagrammers should stay focused on what they do best That's Instagram's advice, too. ""If you tell a different story every time you come to Instagram people will struggle to understand what you're trying to communicate,"" says Jen Ronan, the firm's head of small business for Europe, Middle East and Africa. ""Make sure you're thoughtful about what you want your customers to know and ensure that you're consistently reinforcing this over time."" Many of Danny's clients are companies, he says, who want to boost their numbers in order to look ""legitimate"" on the platform. ""From time to time it'll be an up-and-coming photographer who feels they can't get the numbers they deserve,"" he says. ""Everyone has to start somewhere."" Instagrammers with a significant number of followers may be approached by brands seeking ""influencers"" or ""ambassadors"" to represent them - for a fee. Why Sweden is close to becoming a cashless economy Should you let a 'robot' manage your retirement savings? Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen? Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Incorporating brand products and imagery into photos and videos can be a lucrative sideline, although you have to make clear which content is sponsored under Instagram rules. Donna McCulloch doesn't do it: ""I think I would lose my integrity,"" she says, although she does admit to wearing clothes she's been given. ""But it's because I wanted it,"" she maintains. And Cat Meffan says she spends a lot of time ""saying no"" to brands she doesn't think are right for her - but she does accept some. ""There's no set fee in the Instagram world,"" she says. ""You have a discussion [with the brand] and you have what you think you're worth."" Danny Coy says: ""Eighteen months ago I could easily be turning over Â£2,000-Â£3,000 a month in terms of influencer content."" But he says the market is tailing off because brands have wised up. If an Instagrammer tags a brand in a post independently, the brand can use the image without payment. ""Most will ask first,"" he says. ""But once you've tagged them and put it on Instagram they don't have to ask your permission."" Mariann Hardey thinks the Instagram community doesn't mind branded content if it's entertaining But isn't it a bit of a turn-off being marketed to by people whose content you admire? And do viewers sometimes not realise they are looking at paid-for content? Mariann Hardey, assistant professor of marketing at Durham University, thinks the Instagram community isn't that gullible. ""It's easy to get het up that influencers are taking over and people don't understand they are seeing paid content, but the main users of Instagram are extremely savvy at being able to filter content that is branded or sponsored,"" she says. What's most important is ""whether the post is fun"" and the pictures are ""pretty"", she adds. So, the consensus seems to be that if the sponsored Instagrammer is well-liked and engaging, and the content is entertaining, Generation Instagram doesn't mind.

"This video can not be played Footage shows a burning bag on board the Tube carriage at Parsons Green station An ""improvised explosive device"" was detonated on a Tube train in south-west London during Friday's morning rush hour, injuring 29 people. The blast, at Parsons Green station on a District Line train from Wimbledon, is being treated as terrorism. So-called Islamic State says it carried out the attack, which Prime Minister Theresa May condemned as ""cowardly"". A hunt is under way for the person who placed the device and the area around the station has been evacuated. Specialist officers there securing the remains of the improvised device and ensuring it is stable. Mrs May said the attack had been ""intended to cause significant harm"". She said the UK's terror threat level would remain at severe - the second highest - but would be under review. Speaking in Downing Street after chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, she said there would be an increased armed police presence on the transport network in London. Hundreds of detectives and MI5 are investigating the attack, which took place at 08:20 BST on an eastbound train. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley earlier refused to say whether anyone had been arrested. One commuter took a picture of the device, which appeared to have wires protruding from a white canister Pictures taken of the train show a white bucket on fire inside a supermarket bag, with wires trailing on to the carriage floor. The BBC understands the device had a timer. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the bomb appeared not to have gone off. Had it worked as intended, it would have killed everyone around it and maimed everyone in the train carriage for life, he said.

In pictures: Parsons Green blast This video can not be played PM: Trump speculation ""not helpful"" US President Donald Trump has spoken to Prime Minister Theresa May to convey his sympathies for those injured in the terrorist attack, the White House has said. President Trump pledged to continue close collaboration with the UK to stop attacks and combat extremism, the statement added. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""President Trump called the prime minister earlier today to offer his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London."" US President Donald Trump had earliertweeted,externalthat the ""sick and demented"" people behind the attack had been in the sights of the Metropolitan Police,prompting Mrs May to say it was not helpful to ""speculate""on an ongoing investigation. This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device Chelsea and Westminster Hospital has been treating 14 people, with a ""small number"" of them being taken to its specialist burns unit. Four people are being treated by Imperial College Healthcare and three at St George's Hospital. St Thomas' Hospital in London said it had treated eight patients but they had now been discharged. Mr Rowley asked the public to remain ""vigilant"", but said they should ""not be alarmed"". He said anyone who took pictures or videos at the scene could upload them toukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk,external. London Mayor Sadiq Khan appealed for calm, saying the city would ""never be intimidated or defeated by terrorism"". Witnesses to the incident have described seeing at least one passenger with facial injuries, while others spoke of ""panic"" as alarmed passengers left the train at the station, which is above ground. Anna Gorniak, who was in the same Tube carriage as the explosion, said: ""I could see a fireball filling the carriage and coming our way. At that moment, I started to run. ""In my mind I was praying, I probably thought for a second, 'That's it, my life is over.'"" Anna Gorniak said she could see a fireball ""filling the carriage"" This video can not be played Peter Crowley: ""There was a fireball above my head"" Passenger Peter Crowley was sitting in the carriage, travelling from Wimbledon, when the explosion happened. He said his head was burned by a ""really hot intense fireball above my head"" and added: ""There were people a lot worse than me."" Chris Wildish told BBC Radio 5 live he saw a bucket in a supermarket bag with ""low-level flames coming out of it"" by the door of the rear carriage. The blast happened at 08:20 BST at Parsons Green District Line station By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The bomb at Parsons Green was an improvised explosive device (IED) and, like those on 21/7, it didn't work as planned. The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year.

"This video can not be played Hull's Skelton Hooper ballet school has a record of producing world-class dancers Hull is being recognised as a centre of world-class ballet talent after producing some of Britain's top dancers. One ballet school has trained many of them. What's its secret? On the wall of Skelton Hooper dance school, which is tucked behind a church on a side street in Hull, there's a poster signed by Xander Parish, the first Briton to be a principal dancer at Russia's Mariinsky Ballet. It is dedicated to Vanessa Hooper, who runs the school. Hooper says she first taught Parish and his sister Demelza - who's with the Royal Ballet - in her ""babies' class"". On Saturday, both Xander and Demelza will return to their home town for a special performance to re-open Hull New Theatre as part of the City of Culture celebrations. They will be joined by others who have risen through the Skelton Hooper's ranks - namely Royal Ballet soloist Elizabeth Harrod and Joseph Caley, who has just been made a principal at English National Ballet. Xander Parish started his dance training at Skelton Hooper The performance will be curated by the Royal Ballet's director Kevin O'Hare who - you guessed it - trained there too. ""Most schools can maybe talk about one or two pupils who have gone professional and have become principal dancers with a major company,"" O'Hare says. ""It is quite a phenomenon that so many dancers have come from that school over the years."" O'Hare and his brother Michael, himself a former Royal Ballet principal, trained under Vera Skelton, Hooper's mother, who founded Skelton Hooper after World War II. ""Looking back on it, it was the professionalism of it,"" Kevin O'Hare recalls. ""It wasn't just like you were skipping around in the room - you were really learning how to do ballet seriously and properly. ""It was not scarily disciplined, but it was disciplined. I think a lot of the teachers in the area are like that."" Vanessa Hooper (centre) leading her pupils in a rehearsal The roll call of Skelton Hooper graduates goes on. There is Joshua McSherry-Gray, who's with the English National Ballet; his twin brother Laurie, at Ballet Vlaanderen in Belgium; and Natasha Oughtred, a former principal with Birmingham Royal Ballet. Skip back a generation or two, and those to have emerged from other Hull dance schools include former Royal Ballet principal Mark Silver and ex-Birmingham Royal Ballet principal Robert Parker. Hull seems to have a particularly good record with male dancers - and O'Hare says there was never any stigma about dancing as a boy. ""It wasn't that Billy Elliot image of the one boy among a load of girls,"" he says. ""There was a group of us, so it didn't feel like we were doing something that was not for boys."" And the city has ambition, he believes. ""People joke that it's the last stop. You don't go through Hull to get to somewhere. ""But it never felt like that as a young kid growing up. It didn't feel like there were no possibilities. It felt like anything was possible there. ""Work hard, you could achieve something - I think that's how people would feel there."" Natasha Oughtred went on to be a principal dancer at Birmingham Royal Ballet The work ethic required to succeed in the cutthroat world of professional dancing stems from Hull being a ""grit city"", according to Vanessa Hooper. ""Hull is an isolated city,"" she explains. ""We've struggled very hard. And we've got a lot of grit. ""I find that the children really commit themselves to what they want to do and what they're trying to achieve. I get great commitment."" Miss Vanessa - as she is known to her pupils - admits that some people view her as a hard taskmaster. ""But my belief is that if you don't give 100% it's really not worth bothering with, and I'm desperate for people to achieve,"" she adds. ""We live in a competitive society - it gets worse and worse - and we've got to really push ourselves to the forefront. ""I sometimes do have to give that push, but I'm very sensitive to how hard I can push."" Vanessa Hooper took over the dance school from her mother, Vera Skelton Skelton Hooper isn't the only successful ballet school in Hull. The Royal Ballet has been working with 100 youngsters from four local dance schools, including Skelton Hooper, on a free performance titled Take Flight, which will take place before the main show on Saturday. The other schools are the Lyn Wilson and Heather Shepherdson School of Dance (LWHS), the McKeown Irish Dance Academy and the Northern Academy of Performing Arts (Napa). Napa's former students include Liam Mower, one of the three original Billy Elliots in the West End, who now dances for Matthew Bourne. Mower played rugby league as a child, and Napa's head of dance Julie Lovewell thinks Hull's pedigree with male dancers has something to do with the city's passion for sport. Discipline and physicality are required for both, she says. ""I'm a really strong believer in how big sport is in Hull - the rugby, the football - and the discipline of sport. I see there's a big connection."" Around 100 local youngsters will take part in the Take Flight performance on Saturday In recent years, sport players have become more aware of fitness techniques, while the rise of contemporary dance has put more physical demands on dancers. Lovewell gives the example of a 10-year-old boy who took up dancing after being spotted doing stretches at his rugby club. ""One of our parents was there and said, 'You've got amazingly good hamstrings, really loose, and you've got a real natural flexibility in your hips. Why don't you try dancing?'"" When Xander Parish was a boy, his mind was set on playing cricket - until seeing his sister dance on stage made him jealous. Kevin O'Hare hopes Hull's current poster boys - the likes of Parish and Joseph Caley - will inspire people growing up in Hull today to take to the stage. ""Each generation has had somebody to look up to,"" he says. ""So I'm hoping some young guy is looking at Xander and Joe and thinking, 'That's what I want to do - and it's possible.'""

"This video can not be played Footage shows a burning bag on board the Tube carriage at Parsons Green station An ""improvised explosive device"" was detonated on a Tube train in south-west London during Friday's morning rush hour, injuring 29 people. The blast, at Parsons Green station on a District Line train from Wimbledon, is being treated as terrorism. So-called Islamic State says it carried out the attack, which Prime Minister Theresa May condemned as ""cowardly"". A hunt is under way for the person who placed the device and the area around the station has been evacuated. Specialist officers there securing the remains of the improvised device and ensuring it is stable. Mrs May said the attack had been ""intended to cause significant harm"". She said the UK's terror threat level would remain at severe - the second highest - but would be under review. Speaking in Downing Street after chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, she said there would be an increased armed police presence on the transport network in London. Hundreds of detectives and MI5 are investigating the attack, which took place at 08:20 BST on an eastbound train.

Chris Wildish told BBC Radio 5 live he saw a bucket in a supermarket bag with ""low-level flames coming out of it"" by the door of the rear carriage. The blast happened at 08:20 BST at Parsons Green District Line station By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The bomb at Parsons Green was an improvised explosive device (IED) and, like those on 21/7, it didn't work as planned. The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year.

"The pound has hit its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote after a senior Bank of England official fuelled speculation it could raise rates in the coming months. Gertjan Vlieghe, who has previously argued against a rate rise, said the ""moment is approaching"" when interest rates might need to go up. The Bank kept rates at 0.25% this week, buthinted at a rise in the future. Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to hit $1.3610. That was its highest level since 24 June, the day after the Brexit vote. The pound also gained more than 1.1% against the euro to rise to 1.137 euros by Friday night.. Analysts have suggested the Bank could now lift interest rates back to 0.5%, the level they were before the EU referendum, as soon as November. Mr Vlieghe, a member of the Bank's interest rate-setting committee, saidin a speech on Friday,external: ""Until recently, I thought the appropriate response of monetary policy was to be patient, given modest growth and subdued underlying inflationary pressure. ""But the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when Bank Rate may need to rise."" Mr Vlieghe, who was the first Bank member to vote for a rate cut after the Brexit vote, said there was now growing evidence the UK economy was picking up. He pointed to unemployment falling to record lows, as well as signs that households are spending more and that wages are rising in the private sector. ""If these data trends of reducing slack, rising pay pressure, strengthening household spending and robust global growth continue, the appropriate time for a rise in Bank Rate might be as early as in the coming months,"" Mr Vlieghe said. Higher interest rates benefit savers but could raise mortgage costs for homeowners Markets which track investors' expectations for the Bank rate now give a 63% likelihood of a rise in November, the highest since the Brexit vote. At the start of the week the futures markets gave only a 20% chance. The return on government bonds, often influenced by interest rate expectations, also hit 15-month highs on Friday. The yield on five-year UK bonds rose 7 basis points to hit 0.772%, the highest since 23 June, 2016, the day Britain voted to leave the European Union. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Vlieghe's comments will support belief that the Bank of England could well raise interest rates before the end of 2017 with a move as soon as November very much in play."" This video can not be played Mark Carney suggests interest rates may change in the coming months Mr Archer cautioned that the Bank of England had ""talked up the likelihood of an interest rate hike then failed to follow through"" in the past. ""But there does seem to be a more concerted effort this time around and more unanimity within the Monetary Policy Committee of the case for a hike,"" he said. The Bank said on Thursday that higher inflation and a pick up in growth could lead to a rate rise soon. Growing speculation of a rate rise lifts the pound against other currencies because higher interest rates would make sterling more attractive to investors. The Bank dropped heavy hints in 2014, and again last year before the EU referendum, that it could raise rates, only to later change course.

"Joanne Frail admitted contacting a defendant via Facebook and was jailed for eight months Is your last post on Facebook going to land you in jail? It might do if it ruins a criminal trial. And the government is now looking for evidence of whether new laws are needed to stop it happening. The Attorney General, the government's top law officer, is asking judges, police and victims' groups for examples of where posts, chat and tweets have compromised a trial. So how can a post on social media cause such damage? And what can you do to protect yourself? Well, it's all down to whether you say something that would influence a jury. If you have a friend on a jury, don't message them on Facebook asking about their case - they're not allowed to tell you. In fact don't approach jurors at all. Don't post messages saying you know the defendant in a case definitely did it. Everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty. In fact, don't comment on the character of defendants, victims or any witnesses. If you're on a jury, don't look up the history of the case. Don't contact the defendant on Facebook to tell them you're on their side. Ask yourself whether any of your actions on social media could influence a case. Journalists know the limits and get professional legal advice. If we're not doing it, there's a good reason why. Jurors receive robust warnings to ignore reports outside of the courtroom - and judges have to trust them to impartially hear the evidence. But in our law, there still comes a point where comment can become criminal. It's called contempt of court. A journalist reporting a murder trial would be in serious trouble if he or she blurted out that the defendant had in fact killed before - a fact that has been kept from the jury to ensure they return a verdict uninfluenced by past events. The judge would have to decide whether any juror who had heard the report would have been so swayed as to be incapable of assessing the evidence presented in court. The reporter might want to think about packing their toothbrush: they could be going to prison. Such events are very, very rare. Journalists are trained how to avoid spending time at Her Majesty's Pleasure. But social media is changing everything. Everyone is still subject to the same rules - but the problem is that very few people outside of the law and media have a clue about contempt of court unless they've been involved in a trial. At the same time, almost everyone has got an opinion. And if you post it on social media, an awful lot of people are going to read it. And that's why, two years ago, a judgestopped a major murder trial. Two teenage girls had been accused of murdering Angela Wrightson, a vulnerable woman from Hartlepool. As the July 2015 trial started at Teesside Crown Court, local and national media reported in accordance with the law - fairly and accurately. The Angela Wrightson case raised novel and important legal issues regarding the use of social media Then Facebook posters weighed in. Before the second day was out, there were more than 500 comments linked to news reports on the network. Some threatened the accused, others scoffed at their pleas of innocence and others attacked the court process itself. Mr Justice Globe could not be sure that a local jury, hearing one of the most controversial cases for years, could avoid being influenced. The trial was scrapped and moved at great expense to Leeds in the hope of finding a jury who would not be exposed to the inflammatory comments on Facebook. If a defendant isn't named in a court report, there's a legal reason why. If you know who the defendant is - don't name them just because you're annoyed we haven't. Don't name victims in sexual offence cases - it's against the law. Don't name children who are on trial - that's also illegal, other than in exceptional circumstances. If you are in court don't take photos. Or record videos or sound. If you overhear a private conversation in a court building relevant to a case, don't repeat it online. If you're a juror, don't talk about your case with family and friends. This Wrightson case is the most dramatic example to date - but it's not the first time that social media has disrupted the trial process. Six years ago, I reported on the first ever case of ajuror being convicted for contacting a defendant on Facebook. She was jailed for eight months. More recently, we've seen examples of social media posters ignoring the law that protects the identity of certain victims. When footballer Ched Evans was charged with rape (he was found not guilty at a retrial), 10 people posted the name of his accuser online. This is a crime because alleged victims of sexual offences are granted lifelong anonymity. All the posters were given a police caution. So the Attorney General's review will also look at examples like this or the breaching of other reporting restrictions. TheAttorney General's appeal,externalfor information runs until December. It could lead to tougher laws if the problem looks like it is really serious. Or it could also raise a more fundamental question: given other countries like the US get by without a similar law prohibiting comment during trials, is contempt of court still workable in the age of social media?

"Mr Trump drew bipartisan criticism for his comments on Charlottesville US President Donald Trump has repeated the controversial argument that ""both sides"" were at fault in white supremacist violence last month. ""A lot of people are saying... 'Gee, Trump may have a point',"" he said. Mr Trump made the comments hours before signing a resolution condemning white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups following the violence in Charlottesville on 12 August. One woman was killed when a car ploughed into a crowd in the city. That incident had followed a far-right rally which was supported by white supremacists and neo-Nazis protesting against the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. Mr Trump faced bipartisan criticism when he first condemned violence - in which anti-racism protesterHeather Heyer, 32, was killed - ""on many sides"". On Wednesday, Mr Trump met South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who had condemned his comments in the aftermath of the violence. Protesters cover Jefferson statue Trump 'edits' Charlottesville response Why did people find Trump remarks offensive? Mr Trump revived controversy over the issue on Thursday, when he said, after being asked about the meeting with Mr Scott: ""I think especially in light of the advent of Antifa [anti-fascists], if you look at what's going on there. You have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also and essentially that's what I said. ""Now because of what's happened since then with Antifa. When you look at really what's happened since Charlottesville, a lot of people are saying and people have actually written, 'Gee, Trump may have a point.' ""I said there's some very bad people on the other side also."" Hours later, Mr Trump signed a resolution ""rejecting white nationalists, white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups"". The resolution, which the president said he was ""pleased to sign"", was unanimously passed by Congress earlier this week. ""As Americans, we condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms,"" Mr Trump said in a statement. This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter Mr Scott - the lone African American Republican Senator - was asked about Mr Trump's version of their meeting. ""I didn't go in there to change who he was,"" Mr Scott said. ""I wanted to inform and educate a different perspective. I think we accomplished that and to assume that immediately thereafter he's going to have an epiphany is just unrealistic."" Mr Scott's office said the senator was ""very, very clear about the brutal history surrounding the white supremacist movement and their horrific treatment of black and other minority groups"". ""Rome wasn't built in a day, and to expect the President's rhetoric to change based on one 30-minute conversation is unrealistic,"" the statement added. ""Antifa is bad and should be condemned, yes, but the KKK has been killing and tormenting black Americans for centuries. There is no realistic comparison. Period.""

"This video can not be played Footage shows a burning bag on board the Tube carriage at Parsons Green station An ""improvised explosive device"" was detonated on a Tube train in south-west London during Friday's morning rush hour, injuring 29 people.

Hundreds of detectives and MI5 are investigating the attack, which took place at 08:20 BST on an eastbound train.

Chris Wildish told BBC Radio 5 live he saw a bucket in a supermarket bag with ""low-level flames coming out of it"" by the door of the rear carriage. The blast happened at 08:20 BST at Parsons Green District Line station By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The bomb at Parsons Green was an improvised explosive device (IED) and, like those on 21/7, it didn't work as planned. The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year.

"A manhunt is under way to find the person behind Friday's Tube bombing Police are 'chasing down suspects' and trawling CCTV after Parsons Green attack Terror threat level raised to 'critical' - meaning an attack is expected 'imminently' The station reopened in the early hours of Saturday 29 people have been treated in hospital - police say 'most' had 'flash burns' The explosion on the District Line train is being treated as terrorism Police say it was caused by an 'improvised explosive device' Anyone with information, photos or video should call 0800 789 321 Dearbail Jordan and Claire Heald Photos from the scene after an explosion on a London Underground carriage. What does the device used on the District Line tell us about the attacker? British police have arrested an 18-year old man in the Dover area in connection with the bombing on a Tube train at Parsons Green. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent This is the fourth time the UK
national terror threat level has been raised to 'critical' since the system was
made public in 2006. The last time was in May this
year, following the Manchester Arena bombing, when it was wrongly thought that
the bomb-maker was still at large and could strike again. In the case of Parsons Green
it is perhaps surprising that it took the government so long - more than 12 hours -
to raise the threat level to critical, under advice from the Joint Terrorism
Analysis Centre, when it was obvious the perpetrator had neither died nor been
caught. Each time the level has gone
to critical, it has only stayed at this highest level of alertness for three to
four days - this is partly as it involves an unsustainably high tempo for the
police, intelligence and security services. Read the full analysis here. The Daily Telegraph Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the defence think tank Rusi, says attacks on public transport strike at the heart of cities and damage the economy. While it is impossible to guarantee complete security, he says initiatives such as public awareness campaigns, as well as authorities staying on top of the terrorist threat, mean the UK is seeing only relatively limited impact events. The Guardian The Guardian suggests,externalthe incompetence of terrorists has spared hundreds of lives in recent years. Before the improvised explosive device that failed to detonate fully on the tube train at Parsons Green, there have been many other bungled attempts to kill or maim people - including a world-be suicide bomber who set off his own device in a toilet. Eliminating key individuals with high levels of expertise will help stop knowledge of destruction passing to potential attackers, the paper says. The Times Writing inThe Times,,externalcrime and security editor Fiona Hamilton says that the Tube bombing at Parsons Green station is an important reminder of how vulnerable the transport network is. While security has been improved since the 7 July in 2005, ""a network with huge numbers of passengers can never be made 100% safe"". BBC Radio 5 live Former chairman of the intelligence and security committee
and Tory MP Dominic Grieve said he âaccepted the argumentâ that cuts to the
police have led to less community officers âpicking up tipsâ. He told Radio 5 Live that the government should âlisten carefullyâ
to critics of the cuts, as âanything which can increase our resilience against
terrorism needs to be consideredâ. However, he warned against âjumping to conclusionsâ that
more police on the beat would have stopped such attacks from happening. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 More must be done by
internet companies to tackle the spread of information online which inspires
attacks, Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the Today programme. That includes taking down manuals on how to build bombs like the one used in Parsons
Green. We take a lot down, but sometimes, very quickly, these things reappear, so we go at them again.""  We have to find a way to build pressure on internet companies to get them to invest some of their vast profits into the technologies to make sure we take down content very quickly or don't even let it surface.""

Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The MI5 websitedescribes what each terrorism threat level means,external. The last time it was raised to ""critical"" was following the Manchester terror attack in May. But Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the BBC Today programme that the Parsons Green attack is different. Unlike Manchester, where the bomber obviously killed himself along with all the innocent people he murdered, there was no obvious bomber attached to this and so there is effectively a manhunt.  We are trying to track down who did it. Whether itâs a bomber, or bombers, and all those other issues we need to answer. In this case, thatâs what imminent means.""  Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The national terror alert level was raised to critical later on Friday evening, hours after Friday morning's bombing. Asked why it took hours to increase the level, Security Minister Ben Wallace tells the BBC's Today programme: The threat level in this country is set independently of politicians by the Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre.  They look at a range of things. They look at the intelligence at their fingertips. They look at changes in people we are currently watching - and see if they are inspired by an attack to maybe copy things - and they look at the pace of the investigation.  If they feel as a result of all those factors that an attack is likely to become imminent then that's why they raise it to critical as they then did later in the day.""  Extra police officers are on duty on Saturday after the bombing, including from the British Transport Police. And the police have asked asked the Prime Minister Theresa May for authorisation to enact part of the first phase of Operation Temperer  - which provides military support to police force operations.

Chris Wildish told BBC Radio 5 live he saw a bucket in a supermarket bag with ""low-level flames coming out of it"" by the door of the rear carriage. The blast happened at 08:20 BST at Parsons Green District Line station By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The bomb at Parsons Green was an improvised explosive device (IED) and, like those on 21/7, it didn't work as planned. The device's initiator appears to have worked - but the main charge did not detonate. This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year.

"Unions representing nurses and other NHS staff have written to the chancellor to demand a 3.9% pay rise and an extra Â£800 to make up for the ""cut"" they have seen in recent years. Fourteen unions have joined together to ask for the increase, saying pay has fallen by 15% since 2010 once inflation is taken into account. They said it was unfair ministers had selectively lifted the cap by agreeing a rise for police and prison officers. The unions have over a million members. But the British Medical Association, the doctors' union, has not put its name to the letter, which has also been sent to the devolved nations. In it, the unions argue that increasing pay would help tackle the shortages of staff being seen in the health service. Public sector pay rise cap to be lifted Reality check: Is public sector pay higher than private sector? UK inflation rises to 2.9% Earlier this year, research by the Royal College of Nursing suggested there were 40,000 posts unfilled - one in nine of the total. The cost of the pay rise, which the unions want implemented across the UK from next year, would total Â£2.5bn. It comes after ministers agreed to givepolice officers a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, with prison officers getting a 1.7% rise- both funded from existing budgets. The health unions, which represent a wide range of staff including nurses, midwifes, cleaners, porters, pharmacists, paramedics and dental technicians, said that still represented a pay cut. Nurses will be balloted on taking industrial action unless a 1% pay cap is dropped, says the RCN Since 2010, annual pay settlements have been frozen and then capped at 1% for public sector workers. Unison head of health Sara Gorton said: ""Health workers have gone without a proper pay rise for far too long. ""Their wages continue to fall behind inflation as food and fuel bills, housing and transport costs rise."" RCN general secretary Janet Davies said it was important the money to pay for the rise would have to be found by the Treasury rather than taken from the NHS budget. ""When ministers hold pay down, it drives too many nurses out of the NHS,"" she added. A government spokeswoman said: ""Public sector workers, including NHS staff, do a fantastic job, and the government is committed to ensuring they can continue to deliver world-class public services. ""The government will continue to ensure that the overall package is fair while also being affordable to taxpayers as a whole."" She added next year's pay award would be ""discussed and agreed"" as part of the Budget process and through the official pay review bodies and would be ""set out in due course"".

Engineers had to repair a fire damaged wall near the affected line, which has been ""made safe"", Network Rail said. Network Rail said the blaze had left a trackside retaining wall ""in danger of collapse"", which needed to be ""dismantled, made safe and rebuilt"". While the wall was dismantled, all trains travelling between Euston and Milton Keynes were stopped. London Midland said they were trying to restore train services as quickly as possible Virgin Trains to and from Scotland, north-west England, the West Midlands and north Wales have severe delays Southern services between Milton Keynes Central, Watford Junction and Shepherds Bush have been cancelled.

They had to get specialist equipment on site, access the track and demolish a wall, before making the line safe again. We were initially told it would take all-day but they were done and dusted by 13:00. So the line is now open. Trains will doubtless be affected throughout the rest of the day, but it could have been a lot worse.

"This video can not be played Burberry creative chief Christopher Bailey on Brexit opportunities and difficulties The potential for UK trade post-Brexit is ""enormous"", according to Christopher Bailey, the chief creative officer of British luxury brand Burberry. But he told the BBC he hoped an anti-immigration climate would not endanger the UK's ""thriving creative culture"". ""Being able to share ideas, to collaborate with people from other cultures and countries, is fundamental to any creative business,"" he said. Mr Bailey was chief executive of Burberry until July. He returned to a more creative role, handing the chief executive reins to Marco Gobetti. Asked on the BBC's Today programme what the potential was for post-Brexit Britain, Mr Bailey said it was ""enormous"". ""I think it's a much smaller world today than it's ever been in terms of being able to trade,"" he said. ""The possibilities and the potential for growth, both locally here in the UK and overseas, is enormous,"" he added. Drawing on Burberry's experience, he said that ""Britishness resonates globally"". Brexit customs checks 'could cost Â£800m' Dyson expects no Brexit deal Burberry is considered by many to be the quintessential British brand, thanks to the resilient popularity of its check scarves and trench coats that shoppers abroad regard as a classic British look. Mr Bailey described London as ""an energy hub for the creative industries"" and said the UK boasted the best design and art schools, attracting people from around the world. ""We've got this creatively nourishing country that people want to feed off,"" he said. When asked whether he thought the political climate towards immigration might pose a risk to that, he said he ""desperately"" hoped not. Mr Bailey has previously expressed concerns about Brexit, signing a letter before the EU referendum last year warning it could put the economy at risk. His comments come a day after the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said people ""should be under no illusions"" that Brexit is having some negative effects on the economy. ""Uncertainty is one of the consequences of this, and of course businesses never like uncertainty, because it makes it hard to plan for the future,"" he said. The fall in the pound - which is still lower against the dollar and euro, despite gains this week - has also made imports more expensive forretailers like John Lewis. Burberry has benefited from the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, with tourists, especially from China, taking the opportunity to shop more cheaply on visits to the UK. The company also manufactures some of its products in the UK, providing another benefit from the weaker pound. Currently the Far East accounts for nearly 40% of Burberry's sales. The firm does not publish a breakdown for individual countries. Carla Busazi, an analyst with trend forecasters WGSN, said Burberry was in a strong position with its focus on exports and its clearly identifiable brand. ""I think it's good that a brand that flies the flag for Britain sees Brexit as a positive thing. I'm sure there are a lot of fashion brands who are very concerned about what that might mean for them. ""It's going to be something some British brands are going to struggle with and designer brands who predominantly sell in the UK are going to have challenges ahead."" Many British businesses are unclear what tariffs will be in place for trade between the UK and EU after Brexit. Sir James Dyson, who backs Brexit, said on Thursday that he expected theUK to leave with no deal, and trade under World Trade Organization tariffs. On Friday,Tim Martin,external, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon and a Leave campaigner, said it would be companies in the EU, not the UK, which would suffer from such an outcome. However, former Bank of England governor Lord King has said he is ""not impressed"" with the UK's preparations for a failure in the talks, saying it is ""very important"" that the UK has a fall-back position. Brexit, and changes in the industry combined with changing consumer behaviour, have created uncertainty for Burberry, Mr Bailey said, resulting in the suspension of a planned Â£50m investment in Leeds. Burberry already has two manufacturing sites in Yorkshire, where its trench coats are made, but shortly following the Brexit vote last year the company said it was putting on hold the decision over whether to continue with the new development. ""Since we made that decision and bought that land a lot of things have changed in the world and as any responsible organisation, when you have these big shifts you need to reflect,"" said Mr Bailey. ""We are absolutely committed to keeping our manufacturing in this country with our factories in Yorkshire, but with the new site we're just taking a moment to make sure we understand the ramifications.""

A teaser video has been posted to its Twitter feed shows a series of questions about phone performance being typed into a Google search bar, including queries about poor battery life, before a message appears reading ""funny you should ask. Oct 4"". The date marks exactly one year since the original Pixel was announced - marketed as Google's first own-built phone - which featured virtual helper Google Assistant. The Pixel was well received by critics last year. Rumours suggest notable upgrades to this year's device will include the addition of optical image stabilisation (OIS) to the rear camera for the first time, reducing the number of blurry photos taken. Google's event will complete a busy period of smartphone announcements, with Apple, Samsung, LG and Sony having all introduced new smartphones in September.

US energy firms cut the most oil rigs in a week since January as a 14-month drilling recovery stalled due to weak crude prices. Drillers cut seven oil rigs in the week to 15 September, bringing the total count down to 749 - the lowest number since June, Baker Hughes said in its weekly report. Drillers have not added any rigs since the week of 11 August. The rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still higher than the 416 active oil rigs a year ago as energy companies had mapped out ambitious spending programs for 2017 when they expected US crude        to be higher than the current $50 a barrel.

"British troops have been sent to the region to help restore order More than 100 criminals who escaped prison in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) have been captured. The convicts escaped jail during Hurricane Irma, which devastated British overseas territories in the Caribbean. The islands' governor Gus Jaspert confirmed that the criminals had now been captured, as the government works to restore order. UK troops and police were sent to the BVI to help recapture the prisoners. On Tuesday Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said there was a ""serious threat of the complete breakdown of law and order"". About 1,000 troops are currently in the region providing aid in the wake of Hurricane Irma. The governor said the prisoners from Balsam Ghut prison, in Tortola, were captured on Thursday. The operation was conducted by BVI and Cayman Island police, alongside British royal marines and police. Mr Jaspert said: ""[We are] extremely grateful to the police and military personnel for their tireless efforts, which have resulted in a thorough and extremely successful operation. ""This signals a huge step in all of our efforts to rebuild this fantastic territory."" Previously Defence Secretary Michael Fallon had reported there had been a ""security issue"" in the BVI after reports of looting in the wake of the hurricane. Resident Shanelle Williams said: ""[Before] you go into the town, they crash and they open up and stealing everything. ""But since the military came it has calmed down, but the only issue right now is these prisoners are out.""

"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: The United Nations Security Council is to meet later after North Korea fired a missile over Japan for a second time.As with the last such test, on 29 August, the missile flew over the northern island of Hokkaido before landing in the sea. But this one went higher and further. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has reacted furiously, saying: ""If North Korea continues to walk down this path, it has no bright future."" Soon after the launch,South Korea fired two ballistic missiles into the sea, in a simulated attack on the North, it's reported. Sanctions against North Korea, which has also been testing nuclear bombs, were tightened recently, and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has urged Russia and China to ""indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own"". The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, in Tokyo, says the latest test ""came as a surprise to nobody"", adding that ""the aim of all this is to develop and deploy a reliable missile that can hit the mainland US"". Here's asummary of the North Korea missile crisis in 300 words. Fourteen unions representing nurses and other NHS staff have written to Chancellor Philip Hammond todemand a 3.9% pay increase and an extra Â£800, arguing this is needed to make up for ""cut"" they've experiencedsince 2010. They say wages have fallen by 15% in that time, when inflation is taken into account. The move follows the 1% pay cap being removed this week for police and prison officers. A government spokeswoman promised to ""continue to ensure that the overall package is fair while also being affordable to taxpayers as a whole"".

But the work of theUS-led Cassini probe will end later when it ditches itself in the ringed planet's atmosphere, being torn up as it moves at speeds of tens of thousands of miles per hour. Why? Well, after taking hundreds of thousands of pictures and other measurements, Cassini is down to its last few kilos of fuel and Nasa doesn't want an uncontrolled probe wandering aimlessly around the outer Solar System.

"This video can not be played ""Long live Cassini"" - the project team says farewell The American-led Cassini space mission to Saturn has just come to a spectacular end. Controllers had commanded the probe to destroy itself by plunging into the planet's atmosphere. It survived for just over a minute before being broken apart. Cassini had run out of fuel and Nasa had determined that the probe should not be allowed simply to wander uncontrolled among Saturn and its moons. The loss of signal from the spacecraft occurred pretty close to the prediction. Here at mission control, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, the drop-off was timed at 04:55 PDT (11:55 GMT; 12:55 BST). How the last hours unfolded Nasa's Earl Maize addressed fellow controllers: ""Congratulations to you all. This has been an incredible mission, an incredible spacecraft and you're all an incredible team. I'm going to call this the end of mission. Project manager off the net."" The statement brought restrained applause and some comforting embraces. The loss of signal indicated that the probe was tumbling wildly in the planet's gases. Travelling downwards at over 120,000km/h, it could have survived the violence for no more than about 45 seconds before being torn to pieces. Incineration in the heat and pressure of the plunge was inevitable - but Cassini still managed to despatch home some novel data on the chemical composition of Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini has been circling around Saturn for 13 years On the icy moon Enceladus it discovered... an ocean of water hidden beneath the surface eight times as deep as the oceans on Earth. Cassini's chemical analysis of the water... suggests conditions could be right for micro-organisms to live there. While visiting Saturn's largest moon which is the size of the planet Mercury Cassini flew over seas and lakes of methane and discovered they are up to 170 metres deep. On Saturn itself, above the north pole Cassini took photos of a hexagonal hurricane 32,000km across. Scientists have puzzled over how this giant storm spins. Cassini measured its winds at a staggering 330mph Four times as strong as a hurricane on Earth! Back out on the edge of one of Saturn's rings among the clouds of ice particles Cassini even captured the birth of a possible new moon. It's been named Peggy and is just 1km wide. Finally, running out of fuel, Cassini was flown directly towards the planet until it burnt up in Saturn's atmosphere. Cassini: A mission of 'astonishing discovery' Click next button to proceed Loading ... Swipe to progress Images: Nasa, Kongle  Meet the people who made Cassini happen In Pictures: Cassini probe's greatest shots What were the mission's biggest findings? And so ends one of the most successful space missions in history. In its thirteen years at Saturn, Cassini has transformed our understanding of the sixth planet from the Sun. It has watched monster storms encircle the globe; it witnessed the delicate interplay of ice particles move through the planet's complex ring system; and it revealed extraordinary new insights on the potential habitability of Saturn's moons. Titan and Enceladus were the standout investigations. The former is a bizarre place where liquid methane rains from an orange sky and runs into huge lakes. Cassini put a small European robot called Huygens on Titan's surface in 2005. It returned a remarkable image of pebbles that had been smoothed and rounded by the action of that flowing methane. Cassini also spied what are presumed to be volcanoes that spew an icy slush and vast dunes made from a plastic-like sand. On Enceladus, the observations were no less stunning. This video can not be played ""Where Cassini took its final plunge"": Linda Spilker explains the last images Controllers' screens: The loss of signal was indicated by the absence of a green spike (right) This moon was seen to spurt water vapour into space from cracks at its south pole. The H2O came from an ocean held beneath the icy shell of Enceladus. When Cassini flew through the water plumes, it showed that conditions in the sub-surface ocean were very probably suitable for life. Today, scientists are already talking about how they can go back with another, more capable probe to investigate this idea further. Cassini's cameras were switched off for the last few hours leading to the plunge A great many of those researchers have been gathered this week at the nearby campus of the California Institute of Technology. They watched a feed from the control room at JPL on giant screens. Jonathan Lunine, from Cornell University at Ithaca, New York, spoke for many when he said: ""I feel sad but I've felt sad the whole week; we knew this was going to happen. And Cassini performed exactly as she was supposed to and I bet there is some terrific data on the ground now about Saturn's atmosphere."" And Linda Spilker, the Nasa Cassini project scientist, added: ""When I look back on the Cassini mission I see a mission that was running a 13-year marathon of scientific discovery. And this last orbit was just the last lap. And so we stood in celebration of successfully completing the race. And I know I stood there with a mixture of tears and applause."" Although the probe has gone its science lives on. It has acquired a huge amount of data that will keep researchers busy for decades to come. A lot of it has barely even been assessed. ""Linda Spliker and I were joking earlier that those last few seconds of the Cassini mission - our first 'taste' of the atmosphere of Saturn - might be a number of PhD theses for students to come,"" observed Michael Watkins, the director of JPL. ""So, even in those last few seconds, it will continue its re-writing of the textbooks."" Pictures of Titan were pulled off the probe's memory before the plunge This video can not be played Why scientists are so excited about Saturn's icy moon Enceladus Cassini has photographed some of Saturn's 62 moons: the two-toneIapetus (1)with its walnut-like equatorial ridge;Mimas (2), which has a giant crater that instantly makes everyone think of the ""Death Star"" from the Star Wars movies;Hyperion (3), which displays clusters of bizarre pock marks akin to a sponge or wasps' nest;Atlas (4), which resembles a flying saucer; the potato-likePrometheus (5); andPan (6), which has a shape that would not look out of place in a ravioli dish. A last look at Enceladus going over the northern limb of Saturn Also in the end group of images was this fabulous shot of the rings The Cassini-Huygens mission is a joint endeavour of Nasa, and the European and Italian space agencies.

"A technology that could eventually see every childhood vaccine delivered in a single injection has been developed by US researchers. Their one-shot solution stores the vaccine in microscopic capsules that release the initial dose and then boosters at specific times. The approach has been shown to work in mouse studies, described in the journal Science. The researchers say the technology could help patients around the world. Childhood immunisations come with tears and screams. And there are a lot of them. Diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Hib and hepatitis B at eight, 12 and 16 weeks. Pneumococcal jab at eight weeks, 16 weeks and one year Men B vaccine at eight weeks, 16 weeks and one year Hib/Men C vaccine at one year Measles, mumps and rubella at one year and three years and four months Source:NHS Choices,external A team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology has designed a new type of micro-particle that could combine everything into a single jab. The particles look like miniature coffee cups that are filled with vaccine and then sealed with a lid. Crucially, the design of the cups can be altered so they break down and spill their contents at just the right time. One set of tests showed the contents could be released at exactly nine, 20 and 41 days after they were injected into mice. Other particles that last for hundreds of days have also been developed, the researchers say. The approach has not yet been tested on patients. Prof Robert Langer, from MIT, said: ""We are very excited about this work. ""For the first time, we can create a library of tiny, encased vaccine particles, each programmed to release at a precise, predictable time, so that people could potentially receive a single injection that, in effect, would have multiple boosters already built into it. ""This could have a significant impact on patients everywhere, especially in the developing world."" Drug-delivery pioneer wins Â£1m engineering prize The work differs from previous attempts, which slowly released medicines over a long period of time. The idea is the short, sharp bursts of vaccine more closely mimic routine immunisation programmes. Fellow researcher Dr Kevin McHugh said: ""In the developing world, that might be the difference between not getting vaccinated and receiving all of your vaccines in one shot.""

"A passer-by in Tokyo looks at a TV screen reporting news about North Korea's missile launch North Korea has fired a ballistic missile across Japan, creating new tension in the region after its nuclear bomb test less than two weeks ago. The missile reached an altitude of about 770km (478 miles), travelling 3,700km before landing in the sea off Hokkaido, South Korea's military says. It flew higher and further than one fired over Japan late last month. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would ""never tolerate"" such ""dangerous provocative action"". South Korea responded within minutes by firing two ballistic missiles into the sea in a simulated strike on the North. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also condemned the launch and the UN Security Council will meet later on Friday in New York at the request of the United States and Japan. Are Pyongyang's missiles a risk to planes? Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words Special report: Korea crisis The launch took place from the Sunan district of the capital Pyongyang just before 07:00 local time (22:00 GMT on Thursday), South Korea's military says. Sunan is home to Pyongyang International Airport, 24km north of the city centre. This video can not be played North Korea missile triggers Japan warning alarms As withthe last test on 29 August, the missile flew over Japan's northern Hokkaido island before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. There were no immediate reports of damage to aircraft or ships. Sirens sounded across the region and text message alerts were sent out warning people to take cover. Observers say it is likely to have been an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) though Japanese officials believe there is still a possibility it was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). What is so alarming about the new launch is that the US Pacific territory of Guam, whichNorth Korea says it has plans to fire missiles towards, is 3,400km from Pyongyang, putting it within range of the latest missile. Sanctions on the North were tightened this week in response to its sixth nuclear test on 3 September, which reportedly involved a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. After the latest round of sanctions, it is not clear what other course of action is open to the UN Security Council. Only on Monday,the Security Council voted unanimously to restrict oil imports and ban textile exports, in an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. Mr Tillerson put the burden of response to the latest test on China and Russia, the North's main economic partners. They ""must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own"", he said. He said that China supplied North Korea with most of its oil, while Russia was the largest employer ofNorth Korean forced labour,external. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said her country was not the ""focal point of the conflict"". ""The various directly involved parties should take responsibility,"" she added, in remarks that appeared aimed at the US and South Korea. ""Any attempt to wash their hands of the issue is irresponsible."" Ms Hua called for a peaceful solution ""through formal diplomatic means"". Russia's foreign ministry condemned North Korea's ""illegal"" test, but added: ""Regrettably, aggressive rhetoric is the only thing coming from Washington."" Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? In South Korea, President Moon Jae-in held an emergency meeting of his national security council, where he said that dialogue with the North was ""impossible in a situation like this"". South Korea tested missiles in response to the North's new launch Officials have been ordered to prepare for possible North Korean chemical, biological and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks, a presidential spokesman said. North Korea has said it has bombs capable of sending EMP shock waves, which would disrupt power supplies, although the claim has been greeted with some scepticism. The country does have an extensive chemical arsenal and may also have biological weapons. What damage could North Korea do? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? It insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival and there has been no let-up in its fiery rhetoric. On Thursday, it threatened to ""sink Japan and turn America to ashes"". North Korea said in early September that it had tested a ""missile-ready"" hydrogen bomb A commentary in North Korea's state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper after the missile launch accuses the US and South Korea of conducting ""ceaseless"" exercises as a provocation.

Pyongyang has been developing weapons, initially based on the Soviet-developed Scud, for decades Conducted short and medium-range missile tests on many occasions, sometimes to mark domestic events or periods of regional tension Pace of tests has increased in recent months; experts say North Korea appears to be making significant advances towards building a reliable long-range nuclear-capable weapon On 3 September, North Korea said it tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Tokyo North Korea's rocket launch last month was described by Japan as an ""unprecedented threat"" This test came as a surprise to nobody. North Korea is steadily proceeding down the path to full ICBM capability. To do that, it needs to test-fire its projectiles - every other missile-armed nation has done the same. It started earlier this year by firing its new longer-range Hwasong missiles into the Sea of Japan, then flew one over Hokkaido in August. Next it tested a powerful nuclear device, which it claims it can put on a missile. Now it has tested another intermediate range missile at longer range and higher altitude. The next step will almost certainly be a test of the Hwasong-14 ICBM over Japan and far out into the Pacific. The aim of all this is to develop and deploy a reliable missile that can hit the mainland US. What missiles has North Korea been testing?
