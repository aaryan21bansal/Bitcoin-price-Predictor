"Campaigners have called for legislation to support the Irish language Sinn FÃ©in has said it will not agree to a new DUP first minister without movement on Irish language legislation. A stand-off has developed between the parties over language and culture law. Following Arlene Foster's resignation, both parties must agree to a new first minister and deputy first minister. But Sinn FÃ©in has said it wants Irish language legislation passed, while the DUP will not commit to this before the next election. The party told the UK government it should legislate for the Irish language through Westminster to resolve a Stormont split on the issue. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald claimed the government offered to intervene weeks ago, but the party declined. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the government ""must not interfere in devolved issues at the behest of Sinn FÃ©in"". Following talks with the political parties on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted that the people of Northern Ireland ""deserve a stable, mature, functioning executive that is able to deliver in their best interests"". ""They need to see that politics works and dialogue and debate delivers results,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard was asked if his party would agree to the nomination of a new first minister if Westminster did not agree to put forward an Irish language act. The South Down MP said: ""No. There is simply no basis for power-sharing if we do not have movement on these issues."" He added: ""The underlying fact in all of this is power-sharing doesn't work on broken promises."" Mary Lou McDonald (centre) - pictured with Sinn Fein colleagues Conor Murphy and Michelle O'Neill - says the UK government can resolve the Stormont split over Irish language law When Arlene Foster stood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. The DUP has nominated Paul Givan as Mrs Foster's replacement. The parties have until Monday to approve new first and deputy first ministers, otherwise Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis will be obliged to call an election within a ""reasonable time"". Mrs Foster said on Monday in her final statement as first minister that a deal on language and culture - struck in January 2020 -was the ""only model for success"". After meeting Mr Lewis on Monday night, Ms McDonald said government intervention was the ""only way forward to finally resolve"" the dispute over Irish language legislation. She said Sinn FÃ©in had declined an earlier offer from the UK government to legislate at Westminster because its preference was for the matter to be dealt with at Stormont. ""We have engaged intensively with the DUP and with party leader Edwin Poots,"" said Ms McDonald. Paul Givan (left) - pictured with DUP leader Edwin Poots - is the party's nomination for first minister ""He has told us that they will not be delivering [an Irish language act] in this mandate. ""This legislation was negotiated a year-and-a-half ago and it is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act."" The 2020 deal as part of the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long accused the DUP of refusing to show ""any sort of compromise or ability to work with others"". ""It's apparent that some parties now see this change of leadership in the DUP as an opportunity to renegotiate, reposition themselves and create a crisis where none is necessary,"" Mrs Long told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Naomi Long urged parties to ""stop messing around and breaking promises"" ""We all signed up to NDNA knowing that there were parts of that agreement that would be more difficult, would be more challenging, but we knew that it had to be done. ""All we need to do is move on, get the Irish language act underway, stop messing around and breaking promises and get on with the real business of government."" However, Mr Wilson, DUP chief whip at Westminster, said: ""To force through the latest Sinn FÃ©in wish list will cause further damage to the credibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly. How does the election of a new first minister work? ""Rather than running to Her Majesty's Government when they can't get their way, republicans should respect our mandate. ""Sinn FÃ©in is playing the politics of ransom and are placing culture above health, education and economic recovery."" In July 2019, when Stormont was suspended,MPs at Westminster backed amendments to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriageto Northern Ireland. Mr Wilson said this ""only served to undermine devolution"". Education Minister Michelle McIlveen accused Sinn FÃ©in of prioritising Irish language commitments ""above all else"" DUP Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said she would not be ""particularly happy"" about the secretary of state intervening to pass Irish language legislation at Westminster. Speaking during a visit to a school in Belfast - her first engagement since taking over the role -  she accused Sinn FÃ©in of prioritising Irish language commitments ""above all else"". ""This is a devolved matter - the secretary of state has gotten himself involved in previous issues but this is about the devolution package and how that's being respected,"" she added. Explaining the latest developments in Northern Irish politics to people who live here is sometimes hard enough - never mind to people who don't Sinn FÃ©in's appeal to the British government to bypass Stormont and legislate for the Irish language directly is such a moment. This from the party who warned against the introduction of direct rule for the three years Stormont was suspended is quite a move. Pragmatism or hypocrisy? You decide and many will. Even more astonishing is the claim that Westminster offered to do it weeks ago and Sinn FÃ©in turned them down, believing it could be sorted at home. The fact they've changed their minds shows that things between the party and the new DUP leadership could, shall we say, be better. It's also a sure sign that Sinn FÃ©in, no more than the DUP, want a collapse they would ship their fair share of blame for from an increasingly unforgiving public. Another one for the pages of that still unwritten book ""Stormont, you couldn't make it up"". Also speaking to Good Morning Ulster, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said all of the NDNA commitments needed to be delivered ""urgently"", adding: ""That includes the Irish language legislation, it includes other cultural legislation in the agreement."" However, Mr Eastwood said it would be ""absolutely wrong"" to bring the executive down over the issue. Instead he said he and his fellow SDLP MP Claire Hanna would seek to legislate on the Irish language at Westminster. He said if the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in could not reach a solution he would attempt to amend a bill related to Northern Ireland that is currently making its way through the House of Commons On Monday Mr Poots said ""time will tell"" whether the implementation of the dealwould happen in the existing Northern Ireland Assembly term, which is due to expire in April 2022. He added that it was not appropriate for Sinn FÃ©in to set preconditions on nominating a first and deputy first minister. ""It's not respecting someone's mandate... I'm not setting preconditions to the selection of Sinn Fein's deputy first minister,"" he said. The Northern Ireland Assembly has the power to make laws in any area that isn't ""reserved"" to Westminster. Reserved matters include things such as defence, income tax and making foreign treaties. Any matter that is not a reserved matter is devolved. The Northern Ireland Act - which established the assembly - allows the NI secretary to make any devolved matter a reserved matter, or vice versa, using a legislative instrument known as an Order in Council. However in the case of the language and cultural package agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach deal in January 2020, it was specifically stated that the legislation would be established as new dedicated parts of the Northern Ireland Act. This meant it was always going to require passage at Westminster at some stage of the process. However it will still be up to Stormont to implement the legislation in practice. Language translation motion passed by Stormont Foster urges NI parties to stick to language deal Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term How does election of new first minister work?

"A woman adding flowers to a New York City memorial to those who died due to the virus The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 has reached 600,012 - the most of any nation - according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US also ranks highest in total number of recorded cases, with nearly 33.5 million infections since 2020. This latest milestone comes as President Joe Biden's goal of getting 70% of US adults vaccinated by 4 July appears increasingly likely to fail. Over 173 million people, around 52% of the US, have had at least one dose. Brazil and India have reported the next highest death tolls, with Brazil at more than 488,000 deaths and India at more than 377,000. It took around four months for the US to go from 500,000 to 600,000 deaths - about as long as it took to go from none to 100,000. It marks a significant change from the height of the pandemic when the death toll jumped from 300,000 to 400,000 in one month last winter. But the country's vaccination rate has begun to fall to around 1m doses administered per day - down from a high this April of nearly 3.4m. Roughly 43% of the US population, or about 144 million Americans, are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says people are fully vaccinated at least two weeks after their final vaccine dose. It comes as the CDC officially labels the Delta mutation, first discovered in India, a ""variant of concern"". Delta variant cases amount to 10% of all new infections, the CDC said, and is growing in comparison to the dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, UK. Headache and runny nose linked to Delta variant Though a majority of adult Americans have received at least one dose, the percentages vary wildly from state to state. Vermont has fully vaccinated 71% of its residents, but only 36% of Mississippians have received both jabs,according to a New York Times database,external. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found around a third of US adults were not planning on getting vaccinated yet - leading states and companies to offer countless vaccine incentives. Ohio has been selecting one vaccinated resident each week to win $1m (Â£708,000). On Tuesday, California will give $1.5m each to 10 residents. Other winnable items include alcohol, cannabis, guns, food vouchers and gift cards. Vice-President Harris visited a pop-up vaccination clinic in South Carolina on Monday The White House is also working to boost vaccinations, with Vice-President Kamala Harris beginning a national tour to promote jabs on Monday. The same day, US drug maker Novavax announced that its vaccine was found to be 90.4% effective after testing was conducted on 30,000 participants. If this vaccine is eventually approved, it would be the fourth coronavirus vaccine to hit the US market. G7 leaders promise one billion vaccine doses How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? The Biden administration has already ordered enough doses of the existing vaccines for the entire US population, US media report, so Novavax may become part of the global vaccine-sharing deal to donate doses. On Monday night, the governor of California - the most populous US state - announced a ""grand re-opening"". The state which ordered the first coronavirus lockdown will now allow vaccinated people to not wear masks or socially distance in most settings. Public health measures remain for events with over 5,000 people. Across the country, New York is also beginning a return to normalcy. New York's governor hugs a hospital director at an event to lift 'virtually all' restrictions On Tuesday, the Governor Andrew Cuomo lifted nearly all restrictions after the state's vaccination rate passed 70%. ""We can now return to life as we know it,"" declared Mr Cuomo, adding that the new rules were effective immediately. This video can not be played Should you wear a mask outdoors?

"Long-term goals include moving towards a seven-day working week for hospital theatres Long hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland are to be banished by March 2026, according to a roadmap set out by Health Minister Robin Swann. More than 330,000 people are on some form of hospital waiting list in Northern Ireland. The new elective care framework proposes a Â£700m investment over five years. It sets out a twin-track approach of investment and reform to ensure that ""backlogs do not keep re-occurring"". ""The time for talk is over. What we need now is concerted action,"" Mr Swann said. Life on a hospital list 'makes you feel forgotten' NI has 'lost control' of hospital waiting lists The plan, ambitious in itself, also has to build in dealing with Covid-19. In order to do that, it proposes to implement ""green pathways"" which will keep elected care services entirely separate from any exposure to Covid-19. Robin Swann said ""the time for talk is over"" It will also see emergency departments kept separate as much as possible from planned surgical hubs. That means operations for the likes of hips, knees, cataracts and varicose veins can be performed on sites at speed and uninterrupted in order to cut through the waiting lists. Other aspects of the plan include: Surgeries in ring-fenced specialist hubs A regional NI-wide approach as opposed to a disjointed postcode lottery system Mega clinics for outpatient, assessment and pre-operative assessment clinics Ongoing cooperation with the independent sector Improved data, reporting and accountability The framework sets a target of March 2026 for no patient waiting more than 52 weeks for a first outpatient appointment and inpatient day case treatment, or 26 weeks for a diagnostics appointment. Mr Swann said that if the timeline could be brought forward it would, but he said he had to ""acknowledge the scale of the problem that has built up and the capacity restrictions that will limit room for manoeuvre"". ""There are currently almost 190,000 patients waiting more than a year for their first outpatient appointment,"" Mr Swann said. The proposals must be signed off by the executive and there needs to be confirmation of long-term funding from the executive and the Treasury. Hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland are the worst in the UK ""This is almost five times as many as when the abortive 2017 Elective Care Plan was published."" It is also proposed that cash incentives should be offered to staff in areas where waiting lists are more acute, although the plan does not specify whether this includes nurses, surgeons or both. This could, however, create problems for health unions and would require negotiation. If a lot of this sounds familiar, it's because it is. In 2017, then health minister Michelle O'Neill published a similar wish list - Stormont was on the political precipice once again and within three weeks of the plan being published the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed. Northern Ireland is now in a similar position - the big differences, however, are that waiting list numbers are bigger and there's a different health minister at the helm. While Robin Swann seems to have been in the post a long time, this is his first real test of dealing with bread-and-butter health issues, as the Covid pandemic has been his priority until now. However, for this plan to see the light of day it is relying on a great deal, including recurrent investment, political backing and, most importantly, political stability. There is also the added problem of not having enough staff in post to see it through. The public have been waiting long enough. While Mr Swann is keen to spread the responsibility among his executive colleagues, ultimately he is the health minister and the buck stops with him. A new cross-border healthcare scheme is to be set up for a 12-month period from July 2021. The new scheme is separate from the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive which allowed patients to arrange health treatment in most other European countries, but ended with Brexit. It allows patients to seek and pay for routinely commissioned treatment in the private sector of the Republic of Ireland while having the cost of the treatment reimbursed. On 1 January 2021, theIrish government introduced a new ""unilateral"" arrangementfor its own residents known as theNorthern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.,external This allows patients from the Republic of Ireland to continue to access certain private healthcare treatments in Northern Ireland and apply for reimbursement from the Irish state. It is envisaged that operations for the likes of hips, knees, cataracts and varicose veins can be performed on sites at speed and uninterrupted A similar plan, the Elective Care Plan, was published in 2017, however the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed just three weeks later. The big differences in the 2021 plan are that waiting numbers have increased and the service is also dealing with the pandemic. The waiting lists plan does not go as far as highlighting where surgical hubs will be based, or how services will be re-jigged on sites - that is when even tougher and more politically sensitive decisions will have to be taken. The plan distinguishes between immediate, medium and longer-term actions. For instance, from next month the health service will introduce enhanced rates of pay for staff working in ""targeted shifts and delivering priority elective activity"". Also by September ""mega clinics"" will be in place for orthopaedic outpatients, cataract assessments and for a range of pre-operative assessments. Some of these clinics will require patients having to travel slightly further than they otherwise would have, but the plan states this should reduce the time waiting to be seen. By next March, it is hoped detailed proposals will be in place for how the service can provide a rapid diagnostic centre. Long-term goals include moving towards a seven-day working week for hospital theatres. And, to mirror how waiting times are measured across the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland will become more ""transparent"" in how it measures the length of time a person has to wait, for instance from when patients actually see their GP with a medical complaint. The health minister described the launch of the plan as a ""staging post"" in the ""long struggle"" to turn the health service around. He also said it is fundamental ""to restore hope to all those languishing on waiting lists"".

"Billionaire MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated another $2.7bn (Â£1.9bn) to a range of charities. Ms Scott saidin a blog post,externalthat she wanted to give the money to those ""that have been historically underfunded and overlooked"". She wrote that she had chosen 286 organisations working on racial inequality, the arts and education. Ms Scott is one of the world's richest women. Much of her fortune comes from her 2019 divorce from Mr Bezos, who is currently the world's richest man. As part of the deal, Ms Scott ended up with 4% of Amazon's shares, having helped Mr Bezos start the technology giant in 1994. The author has since posted about her charitable donations, such as in December, when she revealed she haddonated more than $4bn in just four monthsto women-led charities, food banks and Black colleges. Despite the size of these donations, she is still the world's 22nd-richest person, worth $59.5bn, according to Forbes. MacKenzie Scott and Dan Jewett. In her most recent blog post on Tuesday, she said again that she was keen to redistribute her wealth, having worked with a team of researchers and her new husband, science teacher Dan Jewett, to pick who to donate to. ""In this effort, we are governed by a humbling belief that it would be better if disproportionate wealth were not concentrated in a small number of hands, and that the solutions are best designed and implemented by others."" Among the charities and organisations who received the ""relatively large gifts"" were also those working on ""bridging divides"" between different religions, as well as some colleges and universities. In 2019, she signed the Giving Pledge, promising to give away most of her fortune. The Giving Pledge is a commitment by the world's richest individuals and families to dedicate the majority of their wealth to giving back. It was started by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010 and other signatories include the likes of Star Wars creator George Lucas. Mr Bezos has not yet signed the pledge, although Mr Jewett joined in March. He said in a letter: ""In a stroke of happy coincidence, I am married to one of the most generous and kind people I know - and joining her in a commitment to pass on an enormous financial wealth to serve others.""

"Scotland has been a surge in cases in recent weeks driven by the Delta variant The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland is likely to be pushed back by three weeks, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. The whole country had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June. However Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that this was likely to be be delayed by three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated against the virus. The Covid case rate in Scotland is five times higher than it was in early May. Ms Sturgeon said that ""we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture"". She added: ""Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave"". What level is your area in? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Business organisations said the delay would be ""frustrating and painful"" for firms who were gearing up to make the most of a boom in summer trade over the coming weeks, and called for greater support to be given. And opposition parties accused the Scottish government of sending out mixed messages over Covid restrictions in recent weeks. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be pushed back by four weeks until 19 July. A formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not be taken until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said it was ""reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level"" as planned. It means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero. Ms Sturgeon said the vaccination programme was weakening the link between the rising number of cases - largely driven by the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India - and serious illness and deaths. But she said there were still too many people who have not yet had both doses of the vaccine. She also said she did not want to ""commit to firm dates"" for easing restrictions, saying she was ""not going to give false guarantees"" in the face of an ""unpredictable virus"". Thousands of supporters have been allowed to gather in a Fan Zone in Glasgow to watch Euro 2020 matches The Scottish government says the entire adult population will have been offered an appointment for a first dose of the vaccine by the end of next week, with everyone due to have had their first dose by 18 July - two weeks ahead of schedule. It is also planning for the possibility of booster vaccines against Covid-19 in the autumn. The first minister added: ""The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well and it is being rolled out just as quickly as supplies allow. But there is still a significant proportion of the population that isn't yet fully vaccinated. ""To be blunt, that remains our biggest vulnerability at this stage - and it is a significant one."" While the wider easing of restrictions is likely to be delayed, ministers will consider whether some rules could be changed to correct ""perceived anomalies"". Many soft play owners, for example, have questioned why their facilities remain closed in level two areas while trampoline centres are allowed to open. Questions have also been asked about why thousands of fans are allowed to gather in a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow, but parents are not allowed to attend outdoor nursery graduations. The government is also to publish the outcome of a review of physical distancing rules, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero - which Ms Sturgeon said she hoped could still happen ""later in the summer"". She said breaking the link between cases and hospital admissions would allow for a move to a ""fundamentally different way of dealing with this virus"" with ""far, far less restrictions and hopefully no meaningful restrictions at all"". Meanwhile, the finance ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer calling for an urgent meeting with him to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people would be ""frustrated"" that restrictions looked set to continue for ""weeks or even months"", pressing for more detail on when the vaccination programme would be complete. He said: ""We had all hoped for a summer of freedom but instead this stubborn virus is determined to keep us scunnered instead. ""It's disappointing that there was no further hope or information for people planning weddings, businesses waiting to know when they can reopen or parents desperately hoping to see their children graduate from nursery."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for called for action to speed up vaccinations and the publishing of hot-spot protocols. He added: ""In order to maintain public trust and confidence we need consistent communications, consistent decision-making, adequate support for businesses and employees alongside a robust vaccination programme, and hot-spot protocols. ""I accept what the first minister has said around the delay, but there has been mixed messages that I think do not help maintain public trust. ""We have also seen inconsistent decision making: why is it okay to have 3,000 fans at a fan zone, but parents cannot attend a nursery graduation outdoors?"" Ms Sturgeon said she understood why some people would be ""nervous"" about the fan zone, but said she was a ""highly regulated environment"" and was ""confident it is low risk based on public health advice"".

"Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock said it was a ""sensible and reasonable step"" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS. There are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said. Workers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament. If they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons that the ""vast majority of staff in care homes"" were vaccinated, but not all of them. ""We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,"" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives. What happened to care homes early in the pandemic? How many people have been vaccinated so far? When will I get the vaccine? Care organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people. The government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London. A Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination. The requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians. Workers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected. There will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work. Governments inScotland, Wales andNorthern Irelandhave said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff. It comes as the UK recorded a further 9,055 confirmed Covid cases and nine more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Another 190,033 people received a first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, bringing the total with at least one dose to more than 42 million - or 79.8% of adults. More than 30 million people - 57.8% of adults - have had both doses after a further 230,666 second jabs were given out. The move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February. At the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams. Dr Susan Hopkins, strategic response director for Covid-19 at Public Health England, said there are ""pros and cons to any debate on mandatory vaccination"", with the ""pro"" being that those caring for the most vulnerable in care homes would be vaccinated, thus minimising the risks to residents. She said a possible downside could be that ""people may vote with their feet, and not want to have the vaccine, and therefore not work in a care home, and that could lead to staff supply issues in care homes"". Dr Hopkins said there had been ""excellent uptake"" of the vaccine, adding: ""I think where people are hesitant, we need to work harder to make them understand why the vaccines work."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on: What are the Delta variant symptoms? The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was ""a blunt instrument that carries its own risks"". It added: ""While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specific proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would raise new ethical and legal implications."" Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group (ICG) which represents care homes in Yorkshire, said he was disappointed by the decision and concerned it could cause legal disputes for providers. He told the Today programme: ""People should be vaccinated, every member of staff should take up the vaccine, but I just think persuasion rather than coercion or compulsion is the way to deal with it."" Susan Lord, whose mother lives in a care home in Leeds, said whilst it was ""great"" staff in the home had been vaccinated, she was ""concerned"" by the idea of mandatory jabs targeted solely at care workers. Susan Lord, whose mother is in a care home, said it seemed ""harsh"" to threaten the jobs of social care staff Ms Lord, from High Wycombe, told BBC News: ""If someone has been working in care for years and isn't able to have the vaccine or has strong objections to having it, it seems a little bit unfair that they're going to lose their job"". She said most care home staff only work in one place and are regularly tested, so it seems ""a little bit harsh"". Mr Padgham said the sector already had a ""recruitment crisis"", saying: ""We're frightened that this is going to put more people off coming into social care and that's going to be difficult."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: ""Every care home resident would want to be cared for by someone who had been vaccinated, but if a compulsory approach leads to some care workers quitting it will make existing chronic staff shortages even worse."" ""With or without mandatory vaccination,"" she said an approach of ""peer-to-peer persuasion"" should be taken in care homes, ""because this approach has been found to work well"". Low uptake among care home staff was a big concern when the vaccine programme was launched - similar issues are seen with the annual flu jab. Efforts have been made to convince staff of the need to get vaccinated - there have been advertising campaigns targeting them, webinars held by health leaders and repeat visits made to homes by vaccination teams. There are plenty of places where there has been good uptake. But there are also significant numbers of places where fewer than 80% of staff have been vaccinated - the threshold deemed essential to keep the virus out if 90% of residents are also vaccinated. Those working in the sector say there are a variety of reasons staff have cited - cultural reasons and concerns about safety. One common issue has been (unfounded) worries about its impact on fertility as the workforce is young and predominantly female. This move raises lots of concerns from individual rights to its potential to force staff out from a sector that is already short of workers. But the counter argument is that the vulnerabilities of residents and the closed environments they live in require drastic action. Kelly Andrews, national care lead of the GMB union and a former care worker told BBC News: ""We should not have forced vaccinations in social care, this is pushing the workforce away from social care in an area that we're already struggling to recruit and retain"". In a survey of about 1,000 of its carers, the GMB said, more than a third indicated they would quit their jobs if vaccines were mandated. In the care sector in Englandthere have been more than 40,000 deaths involving Covid.,external Additional reporting by Joseph Lee. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Boris Johnson has condemned as ""disgraceful"" footage of a journalist being abused by protesters. A clip shared on social media shows demonstrators haranguing BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt on Monday outside Downing Street. A crowd had gathered to protest the extension of coronavirus restrictions for a further four weeks. The protesters shouted ""traitor"" at Mr Watt and accused him of ""lying"" about lockdowns being legal. The Metropolitan Police said they were interviewing a man in his fifties at a police station in Hertfordshire in relation to the incident. ""A second man has been identified and is being actively sought by officers,"" it added. Man admits harassing BBC news reporter Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 July Following the emergence of the footage, theprime minister tweeted,external: ""Disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job. ""The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour - they are the lifeblood of our democracy."" In a statement, BBC director-general Tim Davie said: ""The safety of journalists is fundamental to any democracy - they must be able to report unhindered free from abuse. ""There is absolutely no justification for any journalist to be treated in this way."" The footage was also condemned by the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, while media minister John Whittingdale said the incident was ""totally unacceptable"" adding that the UK was ""taking the lead"" in tackling intimidation of journalists through its national action plan. Measures in the plan include new training for police officers and journalists, as well as ""commitments from social media platforms and prosecution services to take tough action against abusers"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens, said: ""This extremely disturbing footage showing clear intimidation of a journalist while carrying out his job is absolutely unacceptable and should be condemned in the strongest terms. ""It is shocking that a BBC lanyard makes someone a target like this."" Following suggestions online that officers should have intervened in the incident, the Metropolitan Police initially said: ""In this instance, while officers were nearby as part of the policing response to the ongoing protest, they were not in the immediate vicinity of the incident."" The force later released a further statement saying: ""An initial statement issued earlier today suggested officers were not in the immediate vicinity of the incident. It was drafted based on the 45 second video of the incident which was shared very widely on social media this morning. ""We were subsequently made aware of a longer piece of footage lasting 3 minutes and 28 seconds which shows the incident in full. ""It is clear that the incident began on Whitehall where officers were present."" It added that ""the behaviour shown in the video is unacceptable - members of the public, of any profession, have the right to go about their day without being subjected to verbal harassment or actions that put them in fear for their safety"". Responding to concerns about police actions during the incident, the Met said it would ""be reviewing our actions with a view to improving the policing of events for all Londoners"".

"A woman adding flowers to a New York City memorial to those who died due to the virus The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 has reached 600,012 - the most of any nation - according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US also ranks highest in total number of recorded cases, with nearly 33.5 million infections since 2020. This latest milestone comes as President Joe Biden's goal of getting 70% of US adults vaccinated by 4 July appears increasingly likely to fail. Over 173 million people, around 52% of the US, have had at least one dose. Brazil and India have reported the next highest death tolls, with Brazil at more than 488,000 deaths and India at more than 377,000. It took around four months for the US to go from 500,000 to 600,000 deaths - about as long as it took to go from none to 100,000. It marks a significant change from the height of the pandemic when the death toll jumped from 300,000 to 400,000 in one month last winter. But the country's vaccination rate has begun to fall to around 1m doses administered per day - down from a high this April of nearly 3.4m. Roughly 43% of the US population, or about 144 million Americans, are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says people are fully vaccinated at least two weeks after their final vaccine dose. It comes as the CDC officially labels the Delta mutation, first discovered in India, a ""variant of concern"". Delta variant cases amount to 10% of all new infections, the CDC said, and is growing in comparison to the dominant Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, UK. Headache and runny nose linked to Delta variant Though a majority of adult Americans have received at least one dose, the percentages vary wildly from state to state. Vermont has fully vaccinated 71% of its residents, but only 36% of Mississippians have received both jabs,according to a New York Times database,external. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found around a third of US adults were not planning on getting vaccinated yet - leading states and companies to offer countless vaccine incentives. Ohio has been selecting one vaccinated resident each week to win $1m (Â£708,000). On Tuesday, California will give $1.5m each to 10 residents. Other winnable items include alcohol, cannabis, guns, food vouchers and gift cards. Vice-President Harris visited a pop-up vaccination clinic in South Carolina on Monday The White House is also working to boost vaccinations, with Vice-President Kamala Harris beginning a national tour to promote jabs on Monday. The same day, US drug maker Novavax announced that its vaccine was found to be 90.4% effective after testing was conducted on 30,000 participants. If this vaccine is eventually approved, it would be the fourth coronavirus vaccine to hit the US market. G7 leaders promise one billion vaccine doses How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? The Biden administration has already ordered enough doses of the existing vaccines for the entire US population, US media report, so Novavax may become part of the global vaccine-sharing deal to donate doses. On Monday night, the governor of California - the most populous US state - announced a ""grand re-opening"". The state which ordered the first coronavirus lockdown will now allow vaccinated people to not wear masks or socially distance in most settings. Public health measures remain for events with over 5,000 people. Across the country, New York is also beginning a return to normalcy. New York's governor hugs a hospital director at an event to lift 'virtually all' restrictions On Tuesday, the Governor Andrew Cuomo lifted nearly all restrictions after the state's vaccination rate passed 70%. ""We can now return to life as we know it,"" declared Mr Cuomo, adding that the new rules were effective immediately. This video can not be played Should you wear a mask outdoors?

"Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock said it was a ""sensible and reasonable step"" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS. There are no plans to extend mandatory vaccinations beyond health and care workers, he said. Workers will have 16 weeks to get both jabs from the time regulations are approved by Parliament. If they do not, they face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially losing their job. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons that the ""vast majority of staff in care homes"" were vaccinated, but not all of them. ""We know that the vaccine not only protects you but protects those around you,"" he said, adding that compulsory vaccinations in care homes and hospitals would save lives. What happened to care homes early in the pandemic? How many people have been vaccinated so far? When will I get the vaccine? Care organisations have warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people. The government, however, is believed to have considerable concerns about low take-up of the vaccine in some areas, including London. A Whitehall source told the BBC that guidance to doctors that they should take the Hepatitis B vaccine suggested there is a precedent for mandatory vaccination. The requirement will also apply to volunteers at care homes and those visiting for other work, such as healthcare workers, tradespeople, hairdressers and beauticians. Workers who can prove they are medically exempt from getting the vaccine will not be affected. There will be also be exemptions for visiting family and friends, under-18s, emergency services and people undertaking urgent maintenance work.

"A new trade deal between the UK and Australia will not harm British farmers' livelihoods, the trade secretary has told the BBC. Liz Truss denied that imports of Australian beef would flood the UK and said British export markets would grow. The pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - will cover British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics. But some UK farmers fear they may be undercut on price and standards. Speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Truss said: ""At the moment there are extremely small quantities of Australian beef coming into the UK. ""So what we'd be looking at here is over time some of the EU imports [lost due to Brexit] being replaced by Australian imports."" How will the UK-Australia trade deal work? She added that the deal - which is seen as an important step towards the UK joining a wider Asia Pacific free-trade agreement - would also create opportunities. ""We can see the evidence, that sales of British beef international are growing to places like Asia-Pacific and the United States because people want to buy high quality British products produced in a high animal welfare way,"" Ms Truss said. Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson agreed the broad terms of the deal over dinner She said by 2030, 66% of the world's middle classes will be in Asia and they want to buy products such as whisky, cars, beef, and lamb from the UK. ""We need to be positive about what we've got to sell rather than being defensive,"" she said. However, Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, expressed concern about the lack of detail in the deal. 'Safeguards' promise over UK-Australia trade deal Farmers' opposition to UK-Australia trade deal grows ""It is now vital that we know the detail of what has been agreed to help businesses understand and begin to prepare for the new terms of trade,"" he said. ""The terms must also ensure that consumers have continued confidence that any agreement maintains the highest food safety and animal welfare standards."" NFU president Minette Batters has warned farmers would struggle if the wrong deal is struck National Farmers' Union president President Minette Batters said: ""While the government has previously been keen to highlight how our free trade agreements will uphold our high standards of food production, there has always been a question mark over how this can be achieved while opening up our markets to food produced to different standards. ""We will need to know more about any provisions on animal welfare and the environment to ensure our high standards of production are not undermined by the terms of this deal."" This video can not be played 'We don't have enough beef to flood the UK market' Under the deal with Australia, the government says farmers will be protected by a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years, using tariff rate quotas and other safeguards. But some UK farmers have concerns there will be no meaningful safeguards in place to stop them being undercut by cheap imports. Farmers in Australia are allowed to use some hormone growth promoters, pesticides, and feed additives that are banned in the UK. The UK Trade and Business Commission is worried that Australian farming operates on a scale that UK counterparts cannot compete with, saying Australia contains eight of the 10 largest farms in the world, including one which is larger than Israel. According to the UK's National Farmers Union, Australian farmers are able to produce beef at a lower cost of production, and could undercut farmers in the UK. But Ms Truss said the deal would be fully scrutinised by the Trade and Agriculture Commission and MPs could block it if they were not happy. She added that it would create better access for UK digital and financial services and better arrangements for UK citizens who want to work in Australia. Welsh lamb and Australian wine are said to have been on the menu as Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison settled the deal over dinner - but ultimately this deal is more significant in symbolic than economic terms. For the government's own estimates say the new arrangements may add just 0.02% to our GDP, and the impact on prices is negligible. But this, the first bespoke deal of the post-Brexit era, signifies global Britain's ambitions. The hope is that this paves the way for more alliances beyond the EU - starting with a group of trans-Pacific nations, the CPTPP. They only buy 8% of our exports - and we have deals already with the majority of members. But the ultimate hope is that key partners - such as the US - might also join. It also symbolises though, the sacrifices that may be needed to get deals. British farmers fear they will face more competition from Australian counterparts on their home soil. Australian farmers say they won't be flooding the market. The UK is so far away that even the 80% increase in Australian imports the government predicts equates to 0.1% of total UK imports. It'll be a while before the detail of this deal can be publicly scrutinised - even by those who'll be affected. But the concern is that this sets a marker, that  agriculture may be up for grabs when it comes to compromise in future and far bigger trade deals. The UK government has signeda long list of trade dealsover the past year, but they have been rollovers of those the UK already had as part of the EU. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn.,externalThe government says the deal will boost UK industries that employ 3.5 million people across the country. How many trade deals has the UK done? Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? Food and drink sector criticise Australia trade deal Metals, wine and machines,externalhave formed the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small at present, with 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia and just 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK. ""A deal would be good for my exports if there's a drop in the tariffs but if we start importing more I might be faced with more competition here,"" says Mary Quicke, owner of Devon-based artisan cheesemaker Quicke's. She exports about 10% of her produce to Australia, but is more concerned about Europe. ""I would rather they had another look at the Brexit deal and ironed out a lot of the problems there. ""There's a dreadful amount of paperwork for exporting to the EU right now, it's a complete nightmare. ""I want to preserve our beautiful patchwork of British farms, so I'm cautious. Our milk is produced with half the carbon footprint of milk worldwide so it's really important that we don't just create a worse environmental footprint."" The deal marks the end of what has essentially been a 50-year lock-out for Australian farmers, who have struggled to navigate Brussels' restrictions, tariffs and quotas. The president of the Australian National Farmers' Federation said it had been very difficult to break into the UK because it was ""way too expensive and way too far"". Australian farmers have also been looking to diversify due to the increased tensions between Australia and China. In the past year, China has imposed tariffs and restrictions on everything from Australian beef, barley and wine, to rock lobster and coal.

"The prime minister is determined the remaining coronavirus restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July, No 10 says, despite concern that a rise in deaths could force a change of plan. Boris Johnson said the measures must remain in place until then because of the rapid spread of the Delta variant. All adults will be able to book a jab by the end of the week, NHS chiefs say. But some Tory MPs fear a further delay to lockdown easing amid warnings of a return to hundreds of deaths a day. A further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Tuesday, and 7,673 more cases. Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said the health service would ""finish the job"" of the vaccination programme to the ""greatest extent possible"" over the next four weeks. He said he expected that all those over the age of 18 would be able to book ""by the end of this week"", and that the NHS aimed to offer second doses to two thirds of adults by 19 July. So far, nearly 42 million people in the UK have received their first dose, and just over 30 million have had their second. In Scotland, the easing of restrictions islikely to be pushed back by three weeksso more people can be vaccinated against the virus, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday. All of Scotland had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June. This new date will bring Scotland into line with England. Allow Twitter content?

On Monday, Mr Johnson announceda four-week delayto the planned easing of lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June, after scientific advisers warned of a ""significant resurgence"" in people needing hospital treatment if it went ahead. He said 19 July would be the ""terminus date"" for the remaining restrictions on social contact, and the delay would allow more people to get vaccinated. Afew restrictions are being lifted on 21 June,including the limit on wedding guest numbers. And 15 coronavirus pilot events will continue as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games,Wimbledonand arts and music performances. Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? The announcement that the vaccine rollout would be accelerated came as Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the numbers of people dying from coronavirus would rise. ""The question is really as to what level they will rise,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It is possible we could end up with a situation whereby the numbers of people going to hospital really mean that the government have to take some kind of action that they don't want to."" But he added that the government has had to do this throughout the pandemic. What are the rules after 21 June? What will delaying the full unlock achieve? How many people can go to a wedding and reception? Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the delay was ""extremely welcome"" and he hoped it would be ""enough"". He told BBC Breakfast there was ""very promising evidence"" that the vaccination rollout meant there were fewer serious cases of coronavirus, and that getting more people vaccinated would allow England  to ""get ahead of this current wave"". This video can not be played Michael Gove says that the increased level of vaccination should allow further relaxation of restrictions on 19 July Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he shared the prime minister's confidence about the 19 July end date. ""One can never predict the future with perfect confidence,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""But insofar as we can be confident about anything in this complex world, we can be confident that the increased level of vaccination that we will have by 19 July should allow us to further relax restrictions."" However, Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, said ""we could have moved ahead perfectly safely"" without the delay. He told LBC radio that the prime minister's comments about 19 July were ""exactly the same words as he was using about 21 June"". ""So some of us, I'm afraid, are a bit worried that we're not going to actually move forward on 19 July,"" he said. Labour, meanwhile, has accused the government of incompetence over its handling of Covid variants, saying lax border policies led to the Delta variant entering the country. ""Rather than red-listing this variant, we essentially gave it the red carpet treatment as 20,000 people were allowed to arrive from India over a number of weeks in April, even though the warning signs were there,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. ""That essentially seeded this Delta variant across the country."" The confidence among ministers that all remaining restrictions will lift on 19 July is understandable given the extent of the vaccine rollout. But behind the scenes, the one fear is what to do if cases are still rising at that point. Infections are currently climbing sharply and modellers believe this could lead to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day later in the summer. That is equivalent to what the NHS would face for all types of respiratory illness in the middle of a bad winter. The hope is that in a couple of weeks infection levels will have started to flatten, and maybe even fall, as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme. But there are no guarantees of that. Knowing the peak of this wave is still to come will make the final decision harder if hospitalisations climb as expected. But the fact remains Covid is always going to present a risk. Exactly how much is hard to quantify at this stage, although it will of course be much much lower than it was before. In the end it will come down to balancing that extra risk against the need to get back our old way of life and reducing the harms caused by our response to Covid. The extension of restrictions will be put to a Commons vote, which could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion, with a debate expected on Wednesday. New analysis by Public Health England showed two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine were highly effective at preventing hospital admissions from the Delta variant. PHE said the effectiveness was comparable to against the Alpha variant which was previously dominant in the UK. Mr Johnson said the gap between doses for over-40s in England would be reduced from 12 to eight weeks. And the target to offer all adults a first dose will be brought forward to 19 July. Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businessesare among those to have criticised the delay. The government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme or other financial support further, despite the delay to the unlocking roadmap. Downing Street said local authorities have Â£1bn of unspent money to support businesses, which could be used to pay business rates or contribute to furlough payments. Reopening delay a 'hammer blow for live events' Businesses react to easing delay Under thefurlough scheme, the government covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work because of the pandemic. The scheme is due to run until the end of September but employers will have to help cover the cost from July. Plans for easing coronavirus restrictions differ in all four UK nations. Limits on indoor gatherings inNorthern Irelandare scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the rules inWaleswill be reviewed on 25 June.

"This video can not be played Ex-BBC boss Lord Hall: ""I trusted a journalist... and that trust was abused and misplaced"" A former BBC director general has said it was the ""wrong judgement"" in hindsight not to sack Martin Bashir over his behaviour in the run-up to his 1995 interview with Princess Diana. At the time, Tony Hall investigated Bashir's faking of bank documents over questions about whether the reporter had used them to secure the scoop. He told a committee of MPs: ""We trusted him and we clearly shouldn't have."" Committee chairman Julian Knight said there had been ""a failure of morality"". Lord Hall was head of news at the time of the princess's explosive interview, and his subsequent investigation concluded that Bashir was an ""honest and an honourable man"". Bashir's interview with Princess Diana on Panorama in 1995 was watched by 22.8 million people He told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee on Tuesday that he knew he had been lied to on multiple occasions by Bashir when he conducted the internal investigation in 1996. He said Bashir had ended up ""contrite and in tears"" when he ""quizzed him really, really hard"" about the matter at the time. ""He appeared to us that he was contrite, inexperienced and out of his depth and that is why in the end rather than sacking him, and I can see the reasons for that, he was given a second chance."" Bashir admitted to his bosses that the statements had been mocked up, but repeatedly denied showing them to Diana's brother Earl Spencer. He had done, and Earl Spencer has said Bashir was trying to ""groom"" him in order to get to his sister. It was Bashir's first breach of the BBC's guidelines, Lord Hall explained. ""Do you say, that's it, farewell, you're sacked? Or do you say, all right, you're remorseful, you understand it, we'll give you a second chance? And that's what we did, and we did it having talked to him 25 years ago. ""Now, in the light of what I now know about Bashir, was that the wrong judgement? Well, yes it was. But we trusted him, and we clearly shouldn't have done."" He said he wasn't ""trying to conceal anything"", and added: ""We were lied to, and our trust was misplaced and, bluntly, Bashir took us all in, from the director general down to the programme editor.""  -Broadcast on BBC One on 20 November 1995, the interview was watched by more than 20m people -At the time Princess Diana had been separated from Prince Charles for three years and they divorced the following year -She famously told Bashir there were ""three of us"" in the marriage, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles But Mr Knight criticised the decision to blacklist Matt Wiessler, the graphic designer who mocked up the documents and tried to raise the alarm, but not sack Bashir. ""It wasn't just a failure of management, it was a failure of morality,"" the committee chairman said. Lord Hall said: ""I regret the language that we used about Mr Wiessler and I think we could have managed it better."" No evidence Bashir rehired as cover-up - report What is the Diana interview row all about? BBC's deceit to Diana damaged my parents - William Lord Hall resigns after Diana interview inquiry BBC apologises to designer asked to create bank statement Mr Knight also said it was ""utterly extraordinary"" that the BBC would re-hire a ""known liar"" as religious affairs correspondent in 2016, when Lord Hall was director general. ""We didn't know 25 years ago the scale of what Martin Bashir had done to gain access to the Princess of Wales, through Earl Spencer,"" Lord Hall said. ""If we knew then what we know now, of course he wouldn't have been re-hired."" A recent report by former judge Lord Dyson criticised Bashir's ""deceitful"" actions and Lord Hall's ""woefully ineffective"" investigation. This video can not be played Princess Diana was failed not just by Martin Bashir but by leaders at the BBC, says Prince William Lord Hall also he was ""sorry for the hurt caused"" to the Royal Family by the scandal. After the Dyson Report was published, Prince William, Diana's son, said she was ""failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions"". Current director general Tim Davie described the prince's comments as ""a very low moment"" for the BBC, and revealed he had since held private meetings with the royal household. The committee also quizzed John Birt, who was director general at the time of the interview. Lord Birt called Bashir ""a serial liar on an industrial scale"" and ""a very skilled confidence trickster"". His actions were ""one of the biggest crimes in the history of broadcasting"", he added. Steve Brine MP suggested to him that the interview ""sparked a train of events"" that ended with Diana's death in a car crash two years later. Lord Birt replied: ""It is a tragic occurrence, it is an absolute horror story, and it should never have happened. ""And it is a complete embarrassment that it did happen. My heart goes out to the sons of Princess Diana, but none of us can truly speculate and understand what the consequences were."" But Lord Birt refused to apologise to Mr Wiessler, saying he didn't ""understand enough of what happened"". Lord Hall cut a very pained and anguished figure today. Coming under a sustained ad hominem attack from John Nicolson MP, he said he hoped this scandal wouldn't colour his 35 years of public service, at the BBC and beyond. The sad truth for him is that endings have disproportionate weight in human psychology. The likelihood is that Lord Hall - an effective and popular Director-General - will indeed have his legacy not just coloured but stained by this episode. His tactic - one Rupert Murdoch honed at a select committee a decade ago - of stating his regret and apologising at the outset set the tone for what followed. He repeatedly argued that his failure was an excess of trust. He trusted Bashir, a liar. He trusted those who re-hired him, his senior leaders in BBC News. Had the late Steve Hewlett, the Panorama editor at the time of the Diana interview, been alive today, the heat on Hall would have been shared round. Instead, he was solitary, apologising repeatedly even while saying - as Lord Dyson did - that Princess Diana was likely to have given an interview at the time, even if not to Bashir. Bashir's interview - in which Diana discussed her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, their affairs and her bulimia - was described as ""the scoop of the century"" by one MP and was watched by 22.8 million people. Last month's Dyson Report described Bashir as ""unreliable"", ""devious"" and ""dishonest"". The BBC admitted the report showed ""clear failings"" in its own processes. The MPs' hearing came a day afterthe BBC published a separate reportinto how and why Bashir was rehired in 2016 before being promoted to religion editor two years later. This video can not be played Tim Davie said Martin Bashir would not have been rehired if they had had full knowledge around events of the Princess Diana interview Lord Hall told the select committee he didn't know Bashir had been re-hired until the appointment had been made. Mr Davie said an employee would be fired today for forging documents. ""If you're faking documents, that's not a matter for debate,"" he said.

"All adults in England should be able to book their Covid-19 jab by the end of this week, NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens says He says vaccine supply is constrained, so the NHS is pacing itself, but it is time to finish the job It's unlikely Scotland will move to level 0 - near normal - restrictions on 28 June, with a final decision due next week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says The regrettable delay to easing lockdown in England is so that the government does not find it has to reverse its decision, Cabinet minister Michael Gove says Industry figures say live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by the delay Without delay, it's possible the country could have returned to hundreds of deaths a day, Sage scientist Professor Graham Medley says The PM confirmed on Monday that there would be a four-week delay to the lifting of all restrictions beyond 21 June due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant There were 108 deaths registered involving Covid-19 in the week ending 4 June 2021, two more than the previous week, ONS figures show Edited by Claire Heald Updates were brought to you today by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Claire Heald, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett, Mary O'Connor and Holly Wallis. Join us again tomorrow. The main headlines:  Here are the latest international developments: US President Joe Biden wants to encourage nationwide celebrations on 4 July to mark the countryâs return to some kind of normalcy after 16 months of pandemic. This also coincides with the self-imposed deadline ofvaccinating 70% of US adults by that date(although the country is not expected to reach that goal by then). The holiday will also see the largest event yet of Mr Bidenâs presidency,the Associated Press news agency reports,external, with plans to host emergency and key workers, as well as members of the military, at the White House. âWe welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honour our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the front lines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,â the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials. âAmerica is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,â the administration wrote to officials. âA summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.â The US is set to reach the milestone of 600,000 deaths seen in the pandemic later on Tuesday. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is big news
in China on Tuesday thatmore than 900 million vaccines have been administered there,external. China has
delivered more vaccine doses than any other country in the world, and in recent
days, has on average been carrying out some 20 million doses a day. The last
100 million doses were carried out within six days; China surpassed the 800-million mark on 9 June. Our World In
Data statistics suggest that the number of inoculations carried out in China is
more than a third of the global total. Chinaâs
statistics include both single and double doses. As China has a population of
1.4 billion people, this means that at least 32% of the population have
been fully vaccinated, ie have received two doses. The country is on track to meetits first objective of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The hope
is then tovaccinate 70% of the population by the end of the year,external, and 80%
by early 2022. Officials have said that80% will be the national threshold for herd immunity,external. There are
currently seven vaccines used in China. These are all
domestic vaccines, and the National Health Commission says the country has
the capacity to produce âclose to five billion vaccine dosesâ annually. It is
currently prioritising vaccination among adults, but last week approved the
use of vaccines on children over the age of three. A Cumbrian mobile DJ says he fears many in the hospitality and wedding entertainment business will not survive after yesterday's announcement of afour-week delay to the planned easing of lockdown restrictionsin England. Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, butthey are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. The summer months are usually the busiest time of year for Andy Neen, who runs a mobile disco and also owns Cumbria DJ Store in Penrith, which sells, repairs and hires equipment to bands, clubs and festivals. However, he is currently facing a lot of uncertainty. Mr Neen said: ""I've managed 15 months and I'll survive another four weeks but it's like being back at square one again building up a  customer base. ""If it gets extended again and we miss revenue from August, that might wipe me out. ""I've had no income basically, well very little, the shop's been closed four times and all my customers work in the same industry, the forgotten industry. ""It's not just DJ's, it's bands, it's wedding planners and venue dressers - anybody who works alongside us, nobody has been able to work."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News The coronavirus pandemic wiped out much of last summer's festival season, with only a handful of events able to go ahead - most held in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. At the start of this year, organisers were more optimistic amid the continued vaccine drive and the availability of mass testing, with dozens of events putting tickets on sale. But as the year has gone on, events scheduled for early summer - most notably Glastonbury - have been cancelled, with dozens of others following in April and May. While others moved to dates later in the summer, the government's decision todelay the easing of lockdown restrictions until 19 Julyhas now forced many festivals to shut their doors for another year. To help fans plan ahead, we've put together a guide of all the festivals that have been delayed, cancelled, postponed or given the green light as of 15 June, which can be readhere. Natalia Bubel says she has not seen her parents for three years The longer wait for the end of legal restrictions on social contact in England announced yesterday has affected many people's work and personal lives. One of them is Natalia Bubel, who works in the events industry for travel companies. âItâs been tough and itâs not getting any easier. Weâve lost 80% of our staff and in light of further restrictions we may struggle,"" she says. Her company is preparing for events in the autumn and she says it's crucial that those are able to go ahead. Their business has been doubly affected, first by restrictions which make events and exhibitions impossible and secondly by the economic damage to the travel companies who are their customers. She says ""if we don't pick up new jobs soon thereâs not going to be much left"" of their business. Meanwhile, the last time she was able to travel and see family in Poland was three years ago, and a longed-for trip in August is hanging in the balance. âIâve been hoping that Poland will be added to the green list but Iâm slowly losing hope,â she says. Reality Check There is controversy about why India was not placed on the travel red list with Pakistan and Bangladesh As England's decision yesterday to delay ending coronavirus restrictions sinks in, there is increasing focus on how the Delta variant was able to gain such a foothold in the UK. Labour has been blaming the governmentâs âlax border measuresâ â in particular the âfortnight of failureâ when it delayed adding India to its travel-ban red list. India is where the Delta variant, which is being blamed for the recent increase in cases in the UK, was first identified. It was added to the governmentâs red list (with the highest level of travel restrictions) on 23 April 2021 â two weeks after neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. The government has said this delay was based on the proportion of people arriving in the UK from the three countries who tested positive for coronavirus - the positivity rate. Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May:""The truth is that when we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India."" The government has not published all the figures that it said supported that claim, but Reality Check said at the time thatthere was no evidence that Bangladesh had three times the positivity rate of India. In the Commons last night, Mr Hancock had changed his line, saying: ""As I have said to this House before, when the decision was taken on 2 April to put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, test positivity of travellers returning from Pakistan was 4.6%âthree times the 1.6% positivity of returning travellers from India."" But this time he did not mention Bangladesh. The figures for Pakistan and India are close to the ones that have been published by Mr Hancockâs department, although we cannot be sure because it has not published the figures for the exact date he was talking about.  Vaccinating a country of 1.4 billion people is no easy task. India began giving jabs in mid-January, but by May, the country was severely low on stocks. The supply shortage, however, has not been the only challenge. India's effort to vaccinate its people has had varying success across regions because of other issues, from planning to infrastructure to misinformation. Data from 729 districts shows wide disparities in vaccination rates. Some districts have given jabs to half their population, while others have vaccinated as little as 3%.

The boss of a US investment bank is cracking down on employees reluctant to return to work as restrictions ease. Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman said: ""If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office."" Speaking at a conference, Mr Gorman said he would be ""very disappointed"" if US-based workers had not returned by September. It comes as a number of banks have taken a tough position on home-working. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank JP Morgan, recently said he wanted US staff back in the office from July. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs bankers wereinstructed to report their vaccine statusahead of returning to their desks this week. Read more here. Centre Court's retractable roof creates an enclosed environment Despite delaying the final stage of England's lockdown easing, the government yesterday announced thatWimbledon would be able to host a full capacity crowdfor the men's and women's finals. Now the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has also confirmed that the tournament will be able to close the Centre Court roof over the crowd of 15,000 in the event of rain. The Wimbledon finals, along with the knockout games of Euro 2020 being played at Wembley, are being included in the government's fan pilots, meaning they are exempt from the current limit on crowds. The department says it has trialled spectator events at a range of both indoor and outdoor venues, including the World Snooker Championship final at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Spectators at Wimbledon will be expected to prove their Covid status, using lateral flow tests or the NHS app - which can record vaccination status. Trials of using the NHS app to record natural immunity from a previous infection are also due to take place. Yesterday, there were a further 132,627 first vaccine doses administered in the UK and 235,928 second doses, for a total of 368,555 extra vaccinations. It means that 41,831,056 people have now had at least one dose, equivalent to 79.4% of people aged over 18. There are 30,209,707 people who are fully vaccinated - 57.4% of adults. Today's figures show another 7,673 people have tested positive for coronavirus. It means that cases in the last seven days have risen 38.8% from the previous week. A further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. People have been visiting shopping centres without masks in Israel Israel has ended a requirement to wear masks indoors, lifting one of its last major restrictions after a successful vaccination programme. The country's health ministry said there were three exceptions - unvaccinated healthcare workers, people going into quarantine, and travellers on a flight. Israel starting easing lockdown restrictions in February as studies revealed the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and death. Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. More than 63% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has criticised anti-lockdown protesters who harassed and abused BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt at a demonstration outside Downing Street. Johnson said,externalit was ""disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job"". ""The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour â they are the lifeblood of our democracy,"" he added. A group of demonstrators surrounded Watt at the protest on Monday after the announcement of the delay in lifting restrictions, following him and shouting ""traitor"", until he took refuge behind policed barriers. England has announced a delay in easing coronavirus rules and Scotland has said it is ""likely"" to put off its next step out of restrictions for a further three weeks. So what are the rules on where you can go and who you can meet across the UK? We've set out all the latest changes inour lockdown explainer here. Back at the Scottish parliament, where MSPs are asking questions of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Greens co-leader Lorna Slater welcomes the ""cautious"" decision to delay further easing of restrictions. Ms Slater asks if the first minister agrees that non-essential international leisure travel should be the last thing that returns to normal. Ms Sturgeon says people should not travel overseas for non-essential reasons. The first minister speaks of her ""intense frustration"" at the lack of more robust border controls around the UK. She says we are paying a price for that now with the Delta variant. Ms Sturgeon insists that limiting international travel gave us the best chance of halting new variants and getting the situation back under control. Marjorie Taylor Greene has acknowledged her remarks were offensive A Republican lawmaker in the US has apologisedfor likening coronavirus mask rules to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia disavowed her comments after a visit to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. The conservative firebrand said it was important for her to acknowledge she had made ""offensive remarks"". An ally of former US President Donald Trump, Greene has courted controversy since assuming office in January. In an interview last month, she lambasted safety protocols adopted by Democrats in the House of Representatives, including a requirement that masks be worn on the chamber floor. The lab-leak theory has been strongly rejected by China Turning now to the very beginning of events, a top Chinese virologist has dismissed suggestions that Covid-19 may have escaped from a lab in the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first detected. Chinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals. But recent scrutiny from the administration of US President Joe Biden has drawn attention to claims that the virus may have emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Dr Shi Zhengli studies viruses at that lab.In a rare interview with the New York Times newspaper,external, she addressed the lab-leak theory. âHow on earth can I offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?â she told the New York Times. In a text message, she accused her critics of ""constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist"". There is no proof Covid-19 came from a lab, but President Biden has ordered a review that angered China, which has rejected the theory.

"This video can not be played Ex-BBC boss Lord Hall: ""I trusted a journalist... and that trust was abused and misplaced"" A former BBC director general has said it was the ""wrong judgement"" in hindsight not to sack Martin Bashir over his behaviour in the run-up to his 1995 interview with Princess Diana. At the time, Tony Hall investigated Bashir's faking of bank documents over questions about whether the reporter had used them to secure the scoop. He told a committee of MPs: ""We trusted him and we clearly shouldn't have."" Committee chairman Julian Knight said there had been ""a failure of morality"". Lord Hall was head of news at the time of the princess's explosive interview, and his subsequent investigation concluded that Bashir was an ""honest and an honourable man"". Bashir's interview with Princess Diana on Panorama in 1995 was watched by 22.8 million people He told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee on Tuesday that he knew he had been lied to on multiple occasions by Bashir when he conducted the internal investigation in 1996. He said Bashir had ended up ""contrite and in tears"" when he ""quizzed him really, really hard"" about the matter at the time. ""He appeared to us that he was contrite, inexperienced and out of his depth and that is why in the end rather than sacking him, and I can see the reasons for that, he was given a second chance."" Bashir admitted to his bosses that the statements had been mocked up, but repeatedly denied showing them to Diana's brother Earl Spencer. He had done, and Earl Spencer has said Bashir was trying to ""groom"" him in order to get to his sister. It was Bashir's first breach of the BBC's guidelines, Lord Hall explained. ""Do you say, that's it, farewell, you're sacked? Or do you say, all right, you're remorseful, you understand it, we'll give you a second chance? And that's what we did, and we did it having talked to him 25 years ago. ""Now, in the light of what I now know about Bashir, was that the wrong judgement? Well, yes it was. But we trusted him, and we clearly shouldn't have done."" He said he wasn't ""trying to conceal anything"", and added: ""We were lied to, and our trust was misplaced and, bluntly, Bashir took us all in, from the director general down to the programme editor.""  -Broadcast on BBC One on 20 November 1995, the interview was watched by more than 20m people -At the time Princess Diana had been separated from Prince Charles for three years and they divorced the following year -She famously told Bashir there were ""three of us"" in the marriage, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles But Mr Knight criticised the decision to blacklist Matt Wiessler, the graphic designer who mocked up the documents and tried to raise the alarm, but not sack Bashir. ""It wasn't just a failure of management, it was a failure of morality,"" the committee chairman said.

""We didn't know 25 years ago the scale of what Martin Bashir had done to gain access to the Princess of Wales, through Earl Spencer,"" Lord Hall said. ""If we knew then what we know now, of course he wouldn't have been re-hired."" A recent report by former judge Lord Dyson criticised Bashir's ""deceitful"" actions and Lord Hall's ""woefully ineffective"" investigation. This video can not be played Princess Diana was failed not just by Martin Bashir but by leaders at the BBC, says Prince William Lord Hall also he was ""sorry for the hurt caused"" to the Royal Family by the scandal. After the Dyson Report was published, Prince William, Diana's son, said she was ""failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions"". Current director general Tim Davie described the prince's comments as ""a very low moment"" for the BBC, and revealed he had since held private meetings with the royal household. The committee also quizzed John Birt, who was director general at the time of the interview. Lord Birt called Bashir ""a serial liar on an industrial scale"" and ""a very skilled confidence trickster"". His actions were ""one of the biggest crimes in the history of broadcasting"", he added. Steve Brine MP suggested to him that the interview ""sparked a train of events"" that ended with Diana's death in a car crash two years later. Lord Birt replied: ""It is a tragic occurrence, it is an absolute horror story, and it should never have happened. ""And it is a complete embarrassment that it did happen. My heart goes out to the sons of Princess Diana, but none of us can truly speculate and understand what the consequences were."" But Lord Birt refused to apologise to Mr Wiessler, saying he didn't ""understand enough of what happened"". Lord Hall cut a very pained and anguished figure today. Coming under a sustained ad hominem attack from John Nicolson MP, he said he hoped this scandal wouldn't colour his 35 years of public service, at the BBC and beyond. The sad truth for him is that endings have disproportionate weight in human psychology. The likelihood is that Lord Hall - an effective and popular Director-General - will indeed have his legacy not just coloured but stained by this episode. His tactic - one Rupert Murdoch honed at a select committee a decade ago - of stating his regret and apologising at the outset set the tone for what followed. He repeatedly argued that his failure was an excess of trust. He trusted Bashir, a liar. He trusted those who re-hired him, his senior leaders in BBC News. Had the late Steve Hewlett, the Panorama editor at the time of the Diana interview, been alive today, the heat on Hall would have been shared round. Instead, he was solitary, apologising repeatedly even while saying - as Lord Dyson did - that Princess Diana was likely to have given an interview at the time, even if not to Bashir. Bashir's interview - in which Diana discussed her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, their affairs and her bulimia - was described as ""the scoop of the century"" by one MP and was watched by 22.8 million people. Last month's Dyson Report described Bashir as ""unreliable"", ""devious"" and ""dishonest"". The BBC admitted the report showed ""clear failings"" in its own processes. The MPs' hearing came a day afterthe BBC published a separate reportinto how and why Bashir was rehired in 2016 before being promoted to religion editor two years later.

Last month's Dyson Report described Bashir as ""unreliable"", ""devious"" and ""dishonest"". The BBC admitted the report showed ""clear failings"" in its own processes. The MPs' hearing came a day afterthe BBC published a separate reportinto how and why Bashir was rehired in 2016 before being promoted to religion editor two years later. This video can not be played Tim Davie said Martin Bashir would not have been rehired if they had had full knowledge around events of the Princess Diana interview Lord Hall told the select committee he didn't know Bashir had been re-hired until the appointment had been made. Mr Davie said an employee would be fired today for forging documents. ""If you're faking documents, that's not a matter for debate,"" he said. He was challenged on why, in that case, Bashir was re-hired in 2016 despite it being known that he had faked documents in the past. ""With the glory of hindsight, and with what I know now based on having personally commissioned Lord Dyson to go at this - that hiring would never have been made, there's no doubt about that,"" said Mr Davie,who took over as director general in 2020. Bashir had also been embroiled in controversies while working in the US, including one that led to him resigning from MSNBCin 2013. Mr Davie said those who reappointed him to the BBC in 2016 ""were aware of some of the controversies of the time"", but that ""overall they did not see them as substantive enough to block a rehiring"". Bashir has said mocking up the documents ""was a stupid thing to do"" and he regretted it, but that they had had no bearing on Diana's decision to be interviewed.

"There was a record rise in the number of workers on payrolls in May as the jobs market continued to recover. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there were 197,000 more people in payrolled employment last month compared with April, the highest rise since records began in 2014. It came as the unemployment rate fell again to 4.7% in the three months to April, down from 4.8% previously. But unemployment remained high among the young and those in based in London. Sam Beckett, ONS head of economic statistics, said: ""The number of employees on payroll grew strongly in May, up by almost 200,000, although it is still over half a million down since the pandemic struck. ""Job vacancies continued to recover in the spring, and our early estimates suggest that by May the total had surpassed its pre-pandemic level, with strong growth in sectors such as hospitality. ""Meanwhile the redundancy rate remains subdued, while the number of employees on furlough has continued to decline."" Unemployment rose sharply last year as the UK went through successive lockdowns, but it has gradually fallen in 2021 as restrictions are eased. Firms appear to be expanding again, with the number of job vacancies in most industries above pre-pandemic levels in May, according to the ONS. Similarly, the redundancy rate is back to levels seen before the spread of coronavirus. However, the number of workers on company payrolls in the accommodation and food services sector, aged under 25, or living in London remains ""well below"" pre-pandemic levels, the ONS said. After a long hiatus, DJ and music producer Sean Dakin will be playing a few socially distanced gigs during the Euro football championships. He has also started freelancing again in sales and as an editor after the best part of a year with no proper income. His fear now is that the job opportunities will dry up again because ofthe delay to unlocking Covid restrictions. ""If we are pushing things back we need urgent help for those in hospitality, theatre, nightclubs, other late night venues,"" he told the BBC. ""It's absolutely a disgrace that dates are moved with what feels like little thought for the consequences with a complete disregard for peoples' mental health and incomes."" He says he understands the need to protect public health, but that the UK ""cannot afford to stumble every time there's a variant and cases rise a little"". Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC's Today programme that the figures showed the labour market was ""starting to turn in a good way after quite a painful year"". ""It is pretty much all down to the furlough scheme,"" he said. ""That has been a huge success and quite frankly one of the best government policies I think that the modern economy has ever seen. Without that I do think we would have had unemployment rates of 8-9%, similar to the peaks we saw during the global financial crisis."" Mr Dales noted there were still 3.4 million people on furlough but said the ""way the wind is blowing"" meant many would end up returning to their jobs. If they did not, he said it ""wouldn't be too long until they found another one"". Part-timers 'clinging on to disappearing jobs' We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector Hospitality 'struggling to fill thousands of jobs' There are fears the four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions will harm many firms, and the government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme (due to end in September) or other financial support. Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have allreacted with dismay. However, Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said she expected the labour market to improve despite the delay, and that employers may struggle to fill gaps. ""Sharp declines in furloughed employees in those sectors that reopened on 12 April... coupled with anecdotal evidence of significant difficulties to fill vacancies in some sectors, point at increasing challenges to add staff in the coming months."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our Plan for Jobs is working - the latest forecasts for unemployment are around half of what was previously feared and the number of employees on payroll is at its highest level since April last year."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government needed to do more for businesses affected by the delay to removing restrictions. ""Many businesses have financial pinch points coming up but are still struggling to turn a profit. ""If businesses have to stay closed or operate at massively reduced capacity they're not going to be able to pay staff, rents and loans back. Government support must recognise that."" There are a number of upbeat indicators in today's jobs figures. Granted the latest estimate of the number on employers' payrolls remains over half a million below its pre-pandemic level. The living standards think-tank the Resolution Foundation also estimates there are still 2.8 million people who remain on furlough and self-employed income support schemes who need to find work as support is withdrawn. But that's down from 6.2 million in March. And the number of job vacancies, at 758,000, is now back up to pre-pandemic levels. What's unlike any other economic crisis of the past 50 years is that in this one, it's London that's been hardest hit by unemployment. With financial sector employees continuing to work from home in large numbers, there's less demand for the restaurants, coffee shops and shops that cater for the City of London's much-reduced army of commuters. London alone still has fewer employees than it did in May last year and it now has the highest unemployment rate, at 6.5%, of any region.

"Health Minister Eluned Morgan has vowed to support Long Covid patients in Wales The ""serious and potentially debilitating"" impact of long Covid on health is being recognised in Wales, the new health minister has said. Eluned Morgan said she was putting a Â£5m recovery programme in place to help patients living with the condition. GPs will be issued with new guidance and diagnostic tools, with treatment and rehabilitation ""pathways"". Ms Morgan said she wanted to ensure people could get specialist hospital treatment, if needed. ""It's about making sure there is clear guidance at GP level to make sure they understand what's going on,"" she said. ""There will be pathway for more serious and complex cases - when they access hospital care that there's an understanding complex cases will be dealt with in a wholehearted way - taking into account the different issues. ""Because that's part of the problem - everybody suffers from long Covid in a slightly different way."" Fatigue is one of the most common features of Long Covid There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences,according to NHS Wales,external. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Warning over combining ME and long Covid treatment The similarities between 'long Covid' and ME 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? Others symptoms include breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported, including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. But the programme being announced on Tuesday does not commit the Welsh government to establishing specialist central long Covid centres or hubs, as in England,despite calls to implement the measure. Ms Morgan said the approach in Wales was based on the principle of helping people ""as close to home"" as possible. ""That's why it's critical we make that support available in GP surgeries and we've given huge support to online provision to allow people to self-support,"" she added. The recovery programme will be reviewed every six months, to take into account the latest global research on what is a new, but potentially very serious condition. Helen James suffers with long Covid Grandmother Helen James already had underlying health worries when she caught Covid, not just once, but twice. Both times she was ill for about four weeks, and developed pneumonia both times. She was left ""fighting for every breath"". Helen, from Pontypool in Torfaen, now has extensive scarring on her lungs and needs to use steroid inhalers and other drugs. Kidney issues she had under control before Covid now need a new regime of medicines. ""Fatigue is the biggest issue because it stops you living your life,"" she said. ""You know I couldn't ever plan anything. Sometimes I have to just stay in bed."" Some days, she said she did not ""have the strength to even get to the bathroom, or even to have a shower"". Helen called for a ""joined up"" consultant-led approach for long Covid patients, and has told the minister personally in a meeting. ""I'm fighting this to the end. I'm not giving up,"" she added. Up to 50,000 people in Wales have reported having long Covid symptoms Hundreds of thousands of people in Wales have had Covid-19 and research suggests as many as 10% might experience longer-term effects. In May, the Office for National Statistics estimated that one million people across the UK living in private households had self-reported long Covid, with symptoms that have lasted more than four weeks after the initial infection. This included 50,000 people in Wales. The new recovery programme has been welcomed by the Royal College of GPs in Wales. Joint chairman Prof Peter Saul said: ""The condition has required us all to learn and adapt quickly to support our patients. ""Primary care is at the forefront of long Covid care and this announcement will provide confidence that we will have the infrastructure, shared knowledge and data for GPs and their teams across Wales to respond to patients' needs.""

"Scotland has been a surge in cases in recent weeks driven by the Delta variant The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland is likely to be pushed back by three weeks, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. The whole country had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June. However Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that this was likely to be be delayed by three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated against the virus. The Covid case rate in Scotland is five times higher than it was in early May. Ms Sturgeon said that ""we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture"". She added: ""Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave"". What level is your area in? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Business organisations said the delay would be ""frustrating and painful"" for firms who were gearing up to make the most of a boom in summer trade over the coming weeks, and called for greater support to be given. And opposition parties accused the Scottish government of sending out mixed messages over Covid restrictions in recent weeks. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be pushed back by four weeks until 19 July. A formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not be taken until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said it was ""reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level"" as planned. It means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero. Ms Sturgeon said the vaccination programme was weakening the link between the rising number of cases - largely driven by the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India - and serious illness and deaths. But she said there were still too many people who have not yet had both doses of the vaccine. She also said she did not want to ""commit to firm dates"" for easing restrictions, saying she was ""not going to give false guarantees"" in the face of an ""unpredictable virus"". Thousands of supporters have been allowed to gather in a Fan Zone in Glasgow to watch Euro 2020 matches The Scottish government says the entire adult population will have been offered an appointment for a first dose of the vaccine by the end of next week, with everyone due to have had their first dose by 18 July - two weeks ahead of schedule. It is also planning for the possibility of booster vaccines against Covid-19 in the autumn. The first minister added: ""The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well and it is being rolled out just as quickly as supplies allow. But there is still a significant proportion of the population that isn't yet fully vaccinated. ""To be blunt, that remains our biggest vulnerability at this stage - and it is a significant one."" While the wider easing of restrictions is likely to be delayed, ministers will consider whether some rules could be changed to correct ""perceived anomalies"". Many soft play owners, for example, have questioned why their facilities remain closed in level two areas while trampoline centres are allowed to open. Questions have also been asked about why thousands of fans are allowed to gather in a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow, but parents are not allowed to attend outdoor nursery graduations. The government is also to publish the outcome of a review of physical distancing rules, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero - which Ms Sturgeon said she hoped could still happen ""later in the summer"". She said breaking the link between cases and hospital admissions would allow for a move to a ""fundamentally different way of dealing with this virus"" with ""far, far less restrictions and hopefully no meaningful restrictions at all"". Meanwhile, the finance ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer calling for an urgent meeting with him to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people would be ""frustrated"" that restrictions looked set to continue for ""weeks or even months"", pressing for more detail on when the vaccination programme would be complete. He said: ""We had all hoped for a summer of freedom but instead this stubborn virus is determined to keep us scunnered instead. ""It's disappointing that there was no further hope or information for people planning weddings, businesses waiting to know when they can reopen or parents desperately hoping to see their children graduate from nursery."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for called for action to speed up vaccinations and the publishing of hot-spot protocols. He added: ""In order to maintain public trust and confidence we need consistent communications, consistent decision-making, adequate support for businesses and employees alongside a robust vaccination programme, and hot-spot protocols. ""I accept what the first minister has said around the delay, but there has been mixed messages that I think do not help maintain public trust. ""We have also seen inconsistent decision making: why is it okay to have 3,000 fans at a fan zone, but parents cannot attend a nursery graduation outdoors?"" Ms Sturgeon said she understood why some people would be ""nervous"" about the fan zone, but said she was a ""highly regulated environment"" and was ""confident it is low risk based on public health advice"".

"Boris Johnson has condemned as ""disgraceful"" footage of a journalist being abused by protesters. A clip shared on social media shows demonstrators haranguing BBC Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Watt on Monday outside Downing Street. A crowd had gathered to protest the extension of coronavirus restrictions for a further four weeks. The protesters shouted ""traitor"" at Mr Watt and accused him of ""lying"" about lockdowns being legal. The Metropolitan Police said they were interviewing a man in his fifties at a police station in Hertfordshire in relation to the incident. ""A second man has been identified and is being actively sought by officers,"" it added. Man admits harassing BBC news reporter Lockdown easing in England delayed to 19 July Following the emergence of the footage, theprime minister tweeted,external: ""Disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job. ""The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour - they are the lifeblood of our democracy."" In a statement, BBC director-general Tim Davie said: ""The safety of journalists is fundamental to any democracy - they must be able to report unhindered free from abuse. ""There is absolutely no justification for any journalist to be treated in this way."" The footage was also condemned by the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, while media minister John Whittingdale said the incident was ""totally unacceptable"" adding that the UK was ""taking the lead"" in tackling intimidation of journalists through its national action plan. Measures in the plan include new training for police officers and journalists, as well as ""commitments from social media platforms and prosecution services to take tough action against abusers"". Labour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens, said: ""This extremely disturbing footage showing clear intimidation of a journalist while carrying out his job is absolutely unacceptable and should be condemned in the strongest terms. ""It is shocking that a BBC lanyard makes someone a target like this."" Following suggestions online that officers should have intervened in the incident, the Metropolitan Police initially said: ""In this instance, while officers were nearby as part of the policing response to the ongoing protest, they were not in the immediate vicinity of the incident."" The force later released a further statement saying: ""An initial statement issued earlier today suggested officers were not in the immediate vicinity of the incident. It was drafted based on the 45 second video of the incident which was shared very widely on social media this morning. ""We were subsequently made aware of a longer piece of footage lasting 3 minutes and 28 seconds which shows the incident in full. ""It is clear that the incident began on Whitehall where officers were present."" It added that ""the behaviour shown in the video is unacceptable - members of the public, of any profession, have the right to go about their day without being subjected to verbal harassment or actions that put them in fear for their safety"". Responding to concerns about police actions during the incident, the Met said it would ""be reviewing our actions with a view to improving the policing of events for all Londoners"".

"Scotland has been a surge in cases in recent weeks driven by the Delta variant The easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Scotland is likely to be pushed back by three weeks, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. The whole country had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June. However Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that this was likely to be be delayed by three weeks so that more people can be vaccinated against the virus. The Covid case rate in Scotland is five times higher than it was in early May. Ms Sturgeon said that ""we need to buy sufficient time for vaccination to get ahead and stay ahead of the virus, and that is the reason for caution at this juncture"". She added: ""Doing that will give us the best chance, later in July, of getting back on track and restoring the much greater normality that we all crave"". What level is your area in? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Business organisations said the delay would be ""frustrating and painful"" for firms who were gearing up to make the most of a boom in summer trade over the coming weeks, and called for greater support to be given. And opposition parties accused the Scottish government of sending out mixed messages over Covid restrictions in recent weeks. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that plans to lift restrictions in England would be pushed back by four weeks until 19 July. A formal decision on what level each area of Scotland will be in will not be taken until next week, but Ms Sturgeon said it was ""reasonable to indicate now that I think it unlikely that any part of the country will move down a level"" as planned. It means the country's mainland council areas will remain in either level one or level two, although many island communities including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero. Ms Sturgeon said the vaccination programme was weakening the link between the rising number of cases - largely driven by the so-called Delta variant that was first detected in India - and serious illness and deaths. But she said there were still too many people who have not yet had both doses of the vaccine. She also said she did not want to ""commit to firm dates"" for easing restrictions, saying she was ""not going to give false guarantees"" in the face of an ""unpredictable virus"". Thousands of supporters have been allowed to gather in a Fan Zone in Glasgow to watch Euro 2020 matches The Scottish government says the entire adult population will have been offered an appointment for a first dose of the vaccine by the end of next week, with everyone due to have had their first dose by 18 July - two weeks ahead of schedule. It is also planning for the possibility of booster vaccines against Covid-19 in the autumn. The first minister added: ""The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well and it is being rolled out just as quickly as supplies allow. But there is still a significant proportion of the population that isn't yet fully vaccinated. ""To be blunt, that remains our biggest vulnerability at this stage - and it is a significant one."" While the wider easing of restrictions is likely to be delayed, ministers will consider whether some rules could be changed to correct ""perceived anomalies"". Many soft play owners, for example, have questioned why their facilities remain closed in level two areas while trampoline centres are allowed to open. Questions have also been asked about why thousands of fans are allowed to gather in a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow, but parents are not allowed to attend outdoor nursery graduations. The government is also to publish the outcome of a review of physical distancing rules, along with a report on what life could look like once Scotland moves beyond level zero - which Ms Sturgeon said she hoped could still happen ""later in the summer"". She said breaking the link between cases and hospital admissions would allow for a move to a ""fundamentally different way of dealing with this virus"" with ""far, far less restrictions and hopefully no meaningful restrictions at all"". Meanwhile, the finance ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer calling for an urgent meeting with him to discuss the financial recovery from the pandemic, including the furlough scheme. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people would be ""frustrated"" that restrictions looked set to continue for ""weeks or even months"", pressing for more detail on when the vaccination programme would be complete. He said: ""We had all hoped for a summer of freedom but instead this stubborn virus is determined to keep us scunnered instead. ""It's disappointing that there was no further hope or information for people planning weddings, businesses waiting to know when they can reopen or parents desperately hoping to see their children graduate from nursery."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for called for action to speed up vaccinations and the publishing of hot-spot protocols. He added: ""In order to maintain public trust and confidence we need consistent communications, consistent decision-making, adequate support for businesses and employees alongside a robust vaccination programme, and hot-spot protocols. ""I accept what the first minister has said around the delay, but there has been mixed messages that I think do not help maintain public trust. ""We have also seen inconsistent decision making: why is it okay to have 3,000 fans at a fan zone, but parents cannot attend a nursery graduation outdoors?"" Ms Sturgeon said she understood why some people would be ""nervous"" about the fan zone, but said she was a ""highly regulated environment"" and was ""confident it is low risk based on public health advice"".

"The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has confirmed it is investigating Apple and Google over their dominant position in the mobile phone market. It is ""taking a closer look"" at the ""effective duopoly"" the two firms have. That includes the operating systems Android and iOS, both app stores, and Safari and Chrome web browsers. Officials are examining whether the pair are ""stifling competition across a range of digital markets"". ""The CMA is concerned this could lead to reduced innovation across the sector and consumers paying higher prices for devices and apps, or for other goods and services due to higher advertising prices,"" the authority said. Google said its Android ecosystem generates Â£2.8bn in revenue for UK developers, and supports 240,000 jobs. It also said it had made major changes to its terms based on discussions with regulators - such as the EU. Apple has also been contacted for comment. The announcement also specifically highlighted the question of whether either of the two tech giants has market power over other businesses - including the app developers which rely on their app stores. That has been a hot-button issue for the mobile industry over the past year,particularly since Epic Games launched its high-profile legal action against both Apple and Google, alleging unfair business practices.

""Apple and Google control the major gateways through which people download apps or browse the web on their mobiles - whether they want to shop, play games, stream music or watch TV,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli. ""We're looking into whether this could be creating problems for consumers and the businesses that want to reach people through their phones."" A Google spokeswoman said the company welcomed the CMA's ""efforts to understand"" before implementing new rules. ""Android provides people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps they use, and enables thousands of developers and manufacturers to build successful businesses,"" she said. Apple is already under investigation by the CMA over its App Store, and whether its demands on app developers are anti-competitive. Google, likewise,is being investigated for its proposed new privacy system, over concerns it could affect news publishers and the wider digital advertising market. The CMA said that while both those topics were ""within the scope"" of the new investigation, it was also ""much broader"". The watchdog said it was keen to hear directly from app developers about their experiences. A questionnaire it posted included questions about which app stores developers work with, and whether there are web-based alternatives that can offer the same experience. The investigation will last no more than a year, officials said.

"Lin-Manuel Miranda is best-known for creating and starring in Broadway hit Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda has apologised for a lack of Afro-Latino actors in the lead roles for his new film musical In The Heights. The movie is adapted from Miranda's 2005 stage show of the same name, which refers to Washington Heights, a mainly Latino neighbourhood in New York. The movie has been praised by film critics but also criticised for not using Afro-Latino actors. Miranda acknowledged in a tweet that his film ""fell short"". Miranda, who is of Puerto-Rican descent, served as a producer on the movie and had an on-screen role. Heissued an apology on Twitter,externalabout not employing more actors of Afro-Latino backgrounds. In The Heights is the film version of Lin-Manuel Miranda's Tony-winning musical ""I started writing In the Heights because I didn't feel seen. And over the past 20 years all I wanted was for us - ALL of us - to feel seen,"" he said. ""I'm seeing the discussion around Afro-Latino representation in our film this weekend and it is clear that many in our dark-skinned Afro-Latino community don't feel sufficiently represented within it, particularly among the leading roles."" Miranda said he could ""hear the hurt and frustration over colourism"" and said the film ""fell short"". ""I hear that without sufficient dark-skinned Afro-Latino representation, the work feels extractive of the community we wanted so much to represent with pride and joy. ""In trying to paint a mosaic of this community, we fell short. I'm truly sorry. I'm learning from the feedback, I thank you for raising it, and I'm listening."" Miranda added he is ""dedicated"" to ""learning and evolving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The apology follows an interview conducted by the journalist Felice LeÃ³n, who describes herself as a ""blacktina"", with the film's director Jon M Chu and the actors Melissa Barrera, Leslia Grace and Gregory Diaz. The interview on LeÃ³n's online show The Root saw her address the fact that most of the actors in the film are ""light-skinned or white-passing"". ""What would you say to folks who say that In the Heights privileges white-passing and light-skinned Latinx people?"" she asked. Chu responded: ""I think that was something we talked about and I needed to be educated about, of course. In the end, when we were looking at the cast, we tried to get the people who were best for those roles. ""I hear you on trying to fill those cast members with darker skin. I think that's a really good conversation to have and something we should all be talking about."" Social media users have also been criticising the film for a lack of dark-skinned Latino actors in its cast. One Twitter user said ""Black-Latin"" people were a Washington Heights fixture and accused the film of ""erasing"" them from the neighbourhood. Allow Twitter content?

Moreno is the subject of new documentary Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It Rita Moreno, Oscar-winning star of 1961 musical West Side Story, voiced similar sentiments on Tuesday while appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. ""You can never do right it seems,"" said the Puerto Rican actress, who is the subject of a new documentary that Lin-Manuel Miranda executive produced. ""This is the man who literally has brought Latino-ness and Puerto Rican-ness to America,"" the 89-year-old went on to claim. ""Lin-Manuel has done that really singlehandedly. ""I'm simply saying, can't you just wait a while and leave it alone?"" she continued in response to Colbert's suggestion that the criticisms levelled against Miranda were misplaced.

Moreno won an Academy Award for playing Anita in the original film version of West Side Story and also has a role in Steven Spielberg's upcoming big-screen remake. While In The Heights has been a hit with critics, it has initially disappointed at the box office.

Variety said the film's underwhelming reception was ""puzzling"" given the positive reviews it had received and the amount its distributor Warner Bros spent promoting the film. It asked whether audiences were more inclined towards properties ""with higher brand recognition"" while suggesting the film might go on to become a so-called ""sleeper"" hit.

The main headlines:  Here are the latest international developments: US President Joe Biden wants to encourage nationwide celebrations on 4 July to mark the countryâs return to some kind of normalcy after 16 months of pandemic. This also coincides with the self-imposed deadline ofvaccinating 70% of US adults by that date(although the country is not expected to reach that goal by then). The holiday will also see the largest event yet of Mr Bidenâs presidency,the Associated Press news agency reports,external, with plans to host emergency and key workers, as well as members of the military, at the White House. âWe welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honour our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the front lines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,â the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials. âAmerica is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,â the administration wrote to officials. âA summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.â The US is set to reach the milestone of 600,000 deaths seen in the pandemic later on Tuesday. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is big news
in China on Tuesday thatmore than 900 million vaccines have been administered there,external. China has
delivered more vaccine doses than any other country in the world, and in recent
days, has on average been carrying out some 20 million doses a day. The last
100 million doses were carried out within six days; China surpassed the 800-million mark on 9 June. Our World In
Data statistics suggest that the number of inoculations carried out in China is
more than a third of the global total. Chinaâs
statistics include both single and double doses. As China has a population of
1.4 billion people, this means that at least 32% of the population have
been fully vaccinated, ie have received two doses. The country is on track to meetits first objective of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The hope
is then tovaccinate 70% of the population by the end of the year,external, and 80%
by early 2022. Officials have said that80% will be the national threshold for herd immunity,external. There are
currently seven vaccines used in China. These are all
domestic vaccines, and the National Health Commission says the country has
the capacity to produce âclose to five billion vaccine dosesâ annually. It is
currently prioritising vaccination among adults, but last week approved the
use of vaccines on children over the age of three. A Cumbrian mobile DJ says he fears many in the hospitality and wedding entertainment business will not survive after yesterday's announcement of afour-week delay to the planned easing of lockdown restrictionsin England. Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, butthey are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. The summer months are usually the busiest time of year for Andy Neen, who runs a mobile disco and also owns Cumbria DJ Store in Penrith, which sells, repairs and hires equipment to bands, clubs and festivals. However, he is currently facing a lot of uncertainty. Mr Neen said: ""I've managed 15 months and I'll survive another four weeks but it's like being back at square one again building up a  customer base. ""If it gets extended again and we miss revenue from August, that might wipe me out. ""I've had no income basically, well very little, the shop's been closed four times and all my customers work in the same industry, the forgotten industry. ""It's not just DJ's, it's bands, it's wedding planners and venue dressers - anybody who works alongside us, nobody has been able to work."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News The coronavirus pandemic wiped out much of last summer's festival season, with only a handful of events able to go ahead - most held in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. At the start of this year, organisers were more optimistic amid the continued vaccine drive and the availability of mass testing, with dozens of events putting tickets on sale. But as the year has gone on, events scheduled for early summer - most notably Glastonbury - have been cancelled, with dozens of others following in April and May. While others moved to dates later in the summer, the government's decision todelay the easing of lockdown restrictions until 19 Julyhas now forced many festivals to shut their doors for another year. To help fans plan ahead, we've put together a guide of all the festivals that have been delayed, cancelled, postponed or given the green light as of 15 June, which can be readhere. Natalia Bubel says she has not seen her parents for three years The longer wait for the end of legal restrictions on social contact in England announced yesterday has affected many people's work and personal lives. One of them is Natalia Bubel, who works in the events industry for travel companies. âItâs been tough and itâs not getting any easier. Weâve lost 80% of our staff and in light of further restrictions we may struggle,"" she says. Her company is preparing for events in the autumn and she says it's crucial that those are able to go ahead. Their business has been doubly affected, first by restrictions which make events and exhibitions impossible and secondly by the economic damage to the travel companies who are their customers. She says ""if we don't pick up new jobs soon thereâs not going to be much left"" of their business. Meanwhile, the last time she was able to travel and see family in Poland was three years ago, and a longed-for trip in August is hanging in the balance. âIâve been hoping that Poland will be added to the green list but Iâm slowly losing hope,â she says. Reality Check There is controversy about why India was not placed on the travel red list with Pakistan and Bangladesh As England's decision yesterday to delay ending coronavirus restrictions sinks in, there is increasing focus on how the Delta variant was able to gain such a foothold in the UK. Labour has been blaming the governmentâs âlax border measuresâ â in particular the âfortnight of failureâ when it delayed adding India to its travel-ban red list. India is where the Delta variant, which is being blamed for the recent increase in cases in the UK, was first identified. It was added to the governmentâs red list (with the highest level of travel restrictions) on 23 April 2021 â two weeks after neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. The government has said this delay was based on the proportion of people arriving in the UK from the three countries who tested positive for coronavirus - the positivity rate. Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May:""The truth is that when we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India."" The government has not published all the figures that it said supported that claim, but Reality Check said at the time thatthere was no evidence that Bangladesh had three times the positivity rate of India. In the Commons last night, Mr Hancock had changed his line, saying: ""As I have said to this House before, when the decision was taken on 2 April to put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, test positivity of travellers returning from Pakistan was 4.6%âthree times the 1.6% positivity of returning travellers from India."" But this time he did not mention Bangladesh. The figures for Pakistan and India are close to the ones that have been published by Mr Hancockâs department, although we cannot be sure because it has not published the figures for the exact date he was talking about.  Vaccinating a country of 1.4 billion people is no easy task. India began giving jabs in mid-January, but by May, the country was severely low on stocks. The supply shortage, however, has not been the only challenge. India's effort to vaccinate its people has had varying success across regions because of other issues, from planning to infrastructure to misinformation. Data from 729 districts shows wide disparities in vaccination rates. Some districts have given jabs to half their population, while others have vaccinated as little as 3%.

Centre Court's retractable roof creates an enclosed environment Despite delaying the final stage of England's lockdown easing, the government yesterday announced thatWimbledon would be able to host a full capacity crowdfor the men's and women's finals. Now the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has also confirmed that the tournament will be able to close the Centre Court roof over the crowd of 15,000 in the event of rain. The Wimbledon finals, along with the knockout games of Euro 2020 being played at Wembley, are being included in the government's fan pilots, meaning they are exempt from the current limit on crowds. The department says it has trialled spectator events at a range of both indoor and outdoor venues, including the World Snooker Championship final at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Spectators at Wimbledon will be expected to prove their Covid status, using lateral flow tests or the NHS app - which can record vaccination status. Trials of using the NHS app to record natural immunity from a previous infection are also due to take place. Yesterday, there were a further 132,627 first vaccine doses administered in the UK and 235,928 second doses, for a total of 368,555 extra vaccinations. It means that 41,831,056 people have now had at least one dose, equivalent to 79.4% of people aged over 18. There are 30,209,707 people who are fully vaccinated - 57.4% of adults. Today's figures show another 7,673 people have tested positive for coronavirus. It means that cases in the last seven days have risen 38.8% from the previous week. A further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. People have been visiting shopping centres without masks in Israel Israel has ended a requirement to wear masks indoors, lifting one of its last major restrictions after a successful vaccination programme. The country's health ministry said there were three exceptions - unvaccinated healthcare workers, people going into quarantine, and travellers on a flight.

Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. More than 63% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has criticised anti-lockdown protesters who harassed and abused BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt at a demonstration outside Downing Street. Johnson said,externalit was ""disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job"". ""The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour â they are the lifeblood of our democracy,"" he added. A group of demonstrators surrounded Watt at the protest on Monday after the announcement of the delay in lifting restrictions, following him and shouting ""traitor"", until he took refuge behind policed barriers. England has announced a delay in easing coronavirus rules and Scotland has said it is ""likely"" to put off its next step out of restrictions for a further three weeks. So what are the rules on where you can go and who you can meet across the UK? We've set out all the latest changes inour lockdown explainer here. Back at the Scottish parliament, where MSPs are asking questions of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Greens co-leader Lorna Slater welcomes the ""cautious"" decision to delay further easing of restrictions. Ms Slater asks if the first minister agrees that non-essential international leisure travel should be the last thing that returns to normal. Ms Sturgeon says people should not travel overseas for non-essential reasons. The first minister speaks of her ""intense frustration"" at the lack of more robust border controls around the UK. She says we are paying a price for that now with the Delta variant. Ms Sturgeon insists that limiting international travel gave us the best chance of halting new variants and getting the situation back under control. Marjorie Taylor Greene has acknowledged her remarks were offensive A Republican lawmaker in the US has apologisedfor likening coronavirus mask rules to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia disavowed her comments after a visit to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. The conservative firebrand said it was important for her to acknowledge she had made ""offensive remarks"". An ally of former US President Donald Trump, Greene has courted controversy since assuming office in January. In an interview last month, she lambasted safety protocols adopted by Democrats in the House of Representatives, including a requirement that masks be worn on the chamber floor. The lab-leak theory has been strongly rejected by China Turning now to the very beginning of events, a top Chinese virologist has dismissed suggestions that Covid-19 may have escaped from a lab in the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first detected. Chinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals.

"All adults in England should be able to book their Covid-19 jab by the end of this week, NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens says He says vaccine supply is constrained, so the NHS is pacing itself, but it is time to finish the job It's unlikely Scotland will move to level 0 - near normal - restrictions on 28 June, with a final decision due next week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says The regrettable delay to easing lockdown in England is so that the government does not find it has to reverse its decision, Cabinet minister Michael Gove says Industry figures say live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by the delay Without delay, it's possible the country could have returned to hundreds of deaths a day, Sage scientist Professor Graham Medley says The PM confirmed on Monday that there would be a four-week delay to the lifting of all restrictions beyond 21 June due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant There were 108 deaths registered involving Covid-19 in the week ending 4 June 2021, two more than the previous week, ONS figures show Edited by Claire Heald Updates were brought to you today by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Claire Heald, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett, Mary O'Connor and Holly Wallis. Join us again tomorrow. The main headlines:  Here are the latest international developments: US President Joe Biden wants to encourage nationwide celebrations on 4 July to mark the countryâs return to some kind of normalcy after 16 months of pandemic. This also coincides with the self-imposed deadline ofvaccinating 70% of US adults by that date(although the country is not expected to reach that goal by then). The holiday will also see the largest event yet of Mr Bidenâs presidency,the Associated Press news agency reports,external, with plans to host emergency and key workers, as well as members of the military, at the White House. âWe welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honour our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the front lines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,â the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials. âAmerica is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,â the administration wrote to officials. âA summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.â The US is set to reach the milestone of 600,000 deaths seen in the pandemic later on Tuesday. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is big news
in China on Tuesday thatmore than 900 million vaccines have been administered there,external. China has
delivered more vaccine doses than any other country in the world, and in recent
days, has on average been carrying out some 20 million doses a day. The last
100 million doses were carried out within six days; China surpassed the 800-million mark on 9 June. Our World In
Data statistics suggest that the number of inoculations carried out in China is
more than a third of the global total. Chinaâs
statistics include both single and double doses. As China has a population of
1.4 billion people, this means that at least 32% of the population have
been fully vaccinated, ie have received two doses. The country is on track to meetits first objective of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The hope
is then tovaccinate 70% of the population by the end of the year,external, and 80%
by early 2022. Officials have said that80% will be the national threshold for herd immunity,external. There are
currently seven vaccines used in China. These are all
domestic vaccines, and the National Health Commission says the country has
the capacity to produce âclose to five billion vaccine dosesâ annually. It is
currently prioritising vaccination among adults, but last week approved the
use of vaccines on children over the age of three. A Cumbrian mobile DJ says he fears many in the hospitality and wedding entertainment business will not survive after yesterday's announcement of afour-week delay to the planned easing of lockdown restrictionsin England. Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, butthey are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. The summer months are usually the busiest time of year for Andy Neen, who runs a mobile disco and also owns Cumbria DJ Store in Penrith, which sells, repairs and hires equipment to bands, clubs and festivals. However, he is currently facing a lot of uncertainty. Mr Neen said: ""I've managed 15 months and I'll survive another four weeks but it's like being back at square one again building up a  customer base. ""If it gets extended again and we miss revenue from August, that might wipe me out. ""I've had no income basically, well very little, the shop's been closed four times and all my customers work in the same industry, the forgotten industry. ""It's not just DJ's, it's bands, it's wedding planners and venue dressers - anybody who works alongside us, nobody has been able to work."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News The coronavirus pandemic wiped out much of last summer's festival season, with only a handful of events able to go ahead - most held in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. At the start of this year, organisers were more optimistic amid the continued vaccine drive and the availability of mass testing, with dozens of events putting tickets on sale. But as the year has gone on, events scheduled for early summer - most notably Glastonbury - have been cancelled, with dozens of others following in April and May.

"A new trade deal between the UK and Australia will not harm British farmers' livelihoods, the trade secretary has told the BBC. Liz Truss denied that imports of Australian beef would flood the UK and said British export markets would grow. The pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - will cover British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics. But some UK farmers fear they may be undercut on price and standards. Speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Truss said: ""At the moment there are extremely small quantities of Australian beef coming into the UK. ""So what we'd be looking at here is over time some of the EU imports [lost due to Brexit] being replaced by Australian imports."" How will the UK-Australia trade deal work? She added that the deal - which is seen as an important step towards the UK joining a wider Asia Pacific free-trade agreement - would also create opportunities. ""We can see the evidence, that sales of British beef international are growing to places like Asia-Pacific and the United States because people want to buy high quality British products produced in a high animal welfare way,"" Ms Truss said. Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson agreed the broad terms of the deal over dinner She said by 2030, 66% of the world's middle classes will be in Asia and they want to buy products such as whisky, cars, beef, and lamb from the UK. ""We need to be positive about what we've got to sell rather than being defensive,"" she said. However, Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, expressed concern about the lack of detail in the deal. 'Safeguards' promise over UK-Australia trade deal Farmers' opposition to UK-Australia trade deal grows ""It is now vital that we know the detail of what has been agreed to help businesses understand and begin to prepare for the new terms of trade,"" he said. ""The terms must also ensure that consumers have continued confidence that any agreement maintains the highest food safety and animal welfare standards."" NFU president Minette Batters has warned farmers would struggle if the wrong deal is struck National Farmers' Union president President Minette Batters said: ""While the government has previously been keen to highlight how our free trade agreements will uphold our high standards of food production, there has always been a question mark over how this can be achieved while opening up our markets to food produced to different standards. ""We will need to know more about any provisions on animal welfare and the environment to ensure our high standards of production are not undermined by the terms of this deal."" This video can not be played 'We don't have enough beef to flood the UK market' Under the deal with Australia, the government says farmers will be protected by a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years, using tariff rate quotas and other safeguards. But some UK farmers have concerns there will be no meaningful safeguards in place to stop them being undercut by cheap imports. Farmers in Australia are allowed to use some hormone growth promoters, pesticides, and feed additives that are banned in the UK. The UK Trade and Business Commission is worried that Australian farming operates on a scale that UK counterparts cannot compete with, saying Australia contains eight of the 10 largest farms in the world, including one which is larger than Israel. According to the UK's National Farmers Union, Australian farmers are able to produce beef at a lower cost of production, and could undercut farmers in the UK. But Ms Truss said the deal would be fully scrutinised by the Trade and Agriculture Commission and MPs could block it if they were not happy. She added that it would create better access for UK digital and financial services and better arrangements for UK citizens who want to work in Australia. Welsh lamb and Australian wine are said to have been on the menu as Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison settled the deal over dinner - but ultimately this deal is more significant in symbolic than economic terms. For the government's own estimates say the new arrangements may add just 0.02% to our GDP, and the impact on prices is negligible. But this, the first bespoke deal of the post-Brexit era, signifies global Britain's ambitions. The hope is that this paves the way for more alliances beyond the EU - starting with a group of trans-Pacific nations, the CPTPP. They only buy 8% of our exports - and we have deals already with the majority of members. But the ultimate hope is that key partners - such as the US - might also join. It also symbolises though, the sacrifices that may be needed to get deals. British farmers fear they will face more competition from Australian counterparts on their home soil. Australian farmers say they won't be flooding the market. The UK is so far away that even the 80% increase in Australian imports the government predicts equates to 0.1% of total UK imports. It'll be a while before the detail of this deal can be publicly scrutinised - even by those who'll be affected. But the concern is that this sets a marker, that  agriculture may be up for grabs when it comes to compromise in future and far bigger trade deals. The UK government has signeda long list of trade dealsover the past year, but they have been rollovers of those the UK already had as part of the EU. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn.,externalThe government says the deal will boost UK industries that employ 3.5 million people across the country. How many trade deals has the UK done? Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? Food and drink sector criticise Australia trade deal Metals, wine and machines,externalhave formed the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small at present, with 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia and just 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK. ""A deal would be good for my exports if there's a drop in the tariffs but if we start importing more I might be faced with more competition here,"" says Mary Quicke, owner of Devon-based artisan cheesemaker Quicke's. She exports about 10% of her produce to Australia, but is more concerned about Europe. ""I would rather they had another look at the Brexit deal and ironed out a lot of the problems there. ""There's a dreadful amount of paperwork for exporting to the EU right now, it's a complete nightmare. ""I want to preserve our beautiful patchwork of British farms, so I'm cautious. Our milk is produced with half the carbon footprint of milk worldwide so it's really important that we don't just create a worse environmental footprint."" The deal marks the end of what has essentially been a 50-year lock-out for Australian farmers, who have struggled to navigate Brussels' restrictions, tariffs and quotas. The president of the Australian National Farmers' Federation said it had been very difficult to break into the UK because it was ""way too expensive and way too far"". Australian farmers have also been looking to diversify due to the increased tensions between Australia and China. In the past year, China has imposed tariffs and restrictions on everything from Australian beef, barley and wine, to rock lobster and coal.

"The Welsh government is pledging the ""real living wage"" for social care staff A living wage for care staff and jobs and training for young people are among the Welsh government's plans for the next five years. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out his government's plans for the term, following his Senedd election success. It includes building 20,000 new low-carbon ""social homes"" for rent, and more 20mph zones in residential areas. But opposition parties criticised the lack of detail in the document. The Welsh Conservatives said it was alarming that the17-page programme for government,externalwas the ""sum total"" of Labour's plan. Plaid Cymru said it lacked targets. Meanwhile Mark Drakeford has refused to say whether he would raise income tax, reiterating there is no plan to do so while the economy is recovering. Welsh ministers said they would put climate change at the ""heart of everything the Welsh government does"". National living wage rises by 6.2% Care workers should get Â£10 an hour, Senedd told 'Fatigued, exhausted but still going' Mr Drakeford's programme incorporates pledges made by the Welsh Labour leaderat the recent Welsh election. He was returned to power in May after his party won 30 Senedd seats - one short of a majority, meaning he will need some opposition help to pass budgets and laws. The first minister said: ""We will build a fairer, greener and stronger Wales in which everyone plays a part - we don't want anyone to be left behind or held back."" The Welsh government is pledging action on single-use plastics Speaking to BBC Wales the first minister said the 20,000 homes would be built to the ""highest"" environmental standards and provided through housing associations and councils. ""They will be homes that produce more energy than they consume,"" he said. The plans include giving everyone under the age of 25 the offer of work, education, training or self-employment, and a new law on air pollution, called a Clean Air Act. Ministers pledged to extend the entitlement to free school meals ""as far as resources allow"" - Welsh Labour has come under pressure from within its own ranks to expand the scheme. How many children need free meals? Meanwhile the document says the 20mph limit would become the default speed limit in residential areas. The programme - made up of a series of short bullet point policy plans - does not say when the ideas will be implemented within the next term, which ends at the 2026 Senedd election. However Mr Drakeford told PA news agency that he hoped social care changes would come in in the ""first half"" of this Senedd's five-year term. The Welsh government said it would extend free school meals as far as resources allowed The document says the the Welsh government will ""not take more in Welsh rates of income tax from Welsh families for at least as long as the economic impact of coronavirus lasts"". In the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies asked Mr Drakeford if he wants to raise taxes during some point in the Senedd term. ""Well the member will have to wait to see,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""It will depend on the circumstances."" ""What lies beyond the recovery can only sensibly be decided in the circumstances that we will face, when we get there."" The Welsh government programme said it would ""seek to reform council tax"", and change the way council elections work to reduce the ""democratic deficit"". Under the plans mental health would be prioritised for investment, and more single-use plastics would be banned -  although plans were previouslyannounced to do this last year. England has already banned the use of single-use plastic straws, cotton buds and stirrers - Wales has consulted on doing the same, with the original plans going further. The document did not put a figure on extra cash for mental health services, although Mr Drakeford said there would be ""millions more"". He said a scheme where child and adolescent mental health services go into schools would be rolled out in every council area. Other pledges include: Creating 125,000 ""all-age"" apprenticeships A new medical school in north Wales New laws to modernise the taxi and private vehicle sector Supporting 80 re-use and repair hubs in town centres Create a national forest stretching from north to south Wales Establish a ""peace academy"" - a community of researchers to shape international strategies - in Wales There had been calls for a pay rise for social care workers in the wake of the Covid pandemic - at the May Senedd election Labour pledged to pay the ""real living wage"" to social care workers. The real living wage is higher than the national living wage, and is pegged to the cost of living. It is currently set at Â£9.50 outside London. Ministers also plan an independent commission to consider Wales' constitutional future, with the Welsh government seeking control over further powers including policing. Mark Drakeford's plan was criticised for lacking detail Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said people and businesses would be ""alarmed and concerned that this 17-page document is the sum total of Labour's plan to get Wales on the road to recovery after the pandemic"". ""We desperately need this Welsh government to succeed if we are to recover from the most difficult year our country has experienced, but unfortunately this programme - combined with Labour's poor track record over the past 22 years - does not inspire confidence."" Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said there was ""nothing transformational or ambitious about Labour's program for government"". ""There's no economic strategy to support and help small and medium Welsh businesses grow or any detail on how they will deliver high-skilled, well-paid jobs in all parts of Wales. ""There's nothing here that comes close to tackling child poverty - nor any concrete commitment to extending free school meals. And there's nothing here that addresses the ever-growing housing crisis that is pricing young people out of their communities. ""This program, thin in detail and absent of targets, almost certainly does not provide the new start that Wales so desperately needs and is not the plan needed to take Wales forward to recovery and beyond."" The Welsh government will likely need at least one vote from non-Labour MSs to change laws and pass budgets. Mr Drakeford said the election result was an ""invitation to opposition parties to work with us on those aspects of our programme where they themselves have an interest"". ""The programme is there for others to work with us on it,"" he said. Wales is embarking on its sixth successive period of Labour-led government since devolution started. The last two began in circumstances Welsh Labour would not have chosen. In 2011 it was austerity. In 2016 it was Brexit. But the backdrop this time is more daunting. Opponents say the Welsh government's plans lack the ambition to meet the challenge of the pandemic and its legacy. But, as in those previous terms in office, Labour's lack of an outright majority means it will need talk to other parties to get the job done.

"Health Minister Eluned Morgan has vowed to support Long Covid patients in Wales The ""serious and potentially debilitating"" impact of long Covid on health is being recognised in Wales, the new health minister has said. Eluned Morgan said she was putting a Â£5m recovery programme in place to help patients living with the condition. GPs will be issued with new guidance and diagnostic tools, with treatment and rehabilitation ""pathways"". Ms Morgan said she wanted to ensure people could get specialist hospital treatment, if needed. ""It's about making sure there is clear guidance at GP level to make sure they understand what's going on,"" she said. ""There will be pathway for more serious and complex cases - when they access hospital care that there's an understanding complex cases will be dealt with in a wholehearted way - taking into account the different issues. ""Because that's part of the problem - everybody suffers from long Covid in a slightly different way."" Fatigue is one of the most common features of Long Covid There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences,according to NHS Wales,external. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Warning over combining ME and long Covid treatment The similarities between 'long Covid' and ME 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? Others symptoms include breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported, including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. But the programme being announced on Tuesday does not commit the Welsh government to establishing specialist central long Covid centres or hubs, as in England,despite calls to implement the measure. Ms Morgan said the approach in Wales was based on the principle of helping people ""as close to home"" as possible. ""That's why it's critical we make that support available in GP surgeries and we've given huge support to online provision to allow people to self-support,"" she added. The recovery programme will be reviewed every six months, to take into account the latest global research on what is a new, but potentially very serious condition. Helen James suffers with long Covid Grandmother Helen James already had underlying health worries when she caught Covid, not just once, but twice. Both times she was ill for about four weeks, and developed pneumonia both times. She was left ""fighting for every breath"". Helen, from Pontypool in Torfaen, now has extensive scarring on her lungs and needs to use steroid inhalers and other drugs. Kidney issues she had under control before Covid now need a new regime of medicines. ""Fatigue is the biggest issue because it stops you living your life,"" she said. ""You know I couldn't ever plan anything. Sometimes I have to just stay in bed."" Some days, she said she did not ""have the strength to even get to the bathroom, or even to have a shower"". Helen called for a ""joined up"" consultant-led approach for long Covid patients, and has told the minister personally in a meeting. ""I'm fighting this to the end. I'm not giving up,"" she added. Up to 50,000 people in Wales have reported having long Covid symptoms Hundreds of thousands of people in Wales have had Covid-19 and research suggests as many as 10% might experience longer-term effects. In May, the Office for National Statistics estimated that one million people across the UK living in private households had self-reported long Covid, with symptoms that have lasted more than four weeks after the initial infection. This included 50,000 people in Wales. The new recovery programme has been welcomed by the Royal College of GPs in Wales. Joint chairman Prof Peter Saul said: ""The condition has required us all to learn and adapt quickly to support our patients. ""Primary care is at the forefront of long Covid care and this announcement will provide confidence that we will have the infrastructure, shared knowledge and data for GPs and their teams across Wales to respond to patients' needs.""

"The government in England is delaying the full lifting of restrictions in England by four weeks. It comes amid rising infection rates. But what difference does waiting another month make? The most obvious consequence will be that a greater number of people will have been vaccinated. The government has now brought forward its target to offer all adults a first dose of a vaccine to 19 July. This is nearly two weeks earlier than the original deadline and means all adults will have had the opportunity to have at least one dose by the time all restrictions are due to lift. Not everyone will come forward, but if the number of vaccinations being done at the moment remains consistent it would mean more than three-quarters of adults will have had two jabs and nearly nine in 10 one jab. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says this will act as a ""double protection"". That is because the over-40s, who are most at risk of serious illness, will have had the chance to be fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, younger age groups, who have the highest rates of infection, will have the benefit of one jab if they take up the offer. As well as providing some protection to them, this will help slow the spread of the virus. All this though is dependent on supply. The UK has plenty of AstraZeneca doses - there is thought to be a stockpile of about five million - but the under-30s, who are now being given their first dose, are being offered Pfizer or Moderna because of concern about blood clots. That has to be imported, and is essentially being used as soon as it arrives. Infection rates are already rising rapidly - doubling every 10 days or so. On current trends, we could hit January levels of infections by the end of July. The fear was that opening up further would have allowed the virus to spread even more quickly than it is now. By delaying opening up by four weeks, government modellers say it could reduce the number of those cases ending up in hospital by between a third and a half to around 1,000 a day in the summer. The rises we are seeing at the moment could also start to slow during this period. That's because of the high levels of immunity in the population from the vaccination programme, which will make it harder for the virus to spread after an initial surge. Prof Jonathan Ball, an expert in viruses at University of Nottingham, says his hope is the increases that are being seen now will start to flatten. ""I think in a few weeks we could see it slow. I certainly don't think the speed of the rises we are seeing now will continue for long, given how well the vaccines work."" And if that has not happened by late July, the break-up of schools for the summer holidays could help tip the scales, as it will reduce contacts among young people where Covid is spreading more quickly. But even if infections continue to rise, the delay will still be of benefit as it will give government scientists a better grasp of what the consequences are in terms of hospitalisations. One of the crucial elements, that is not fully understood at the moment, is to what extent the vaccination programme has broken the link between infections and serious illness. Hospitalisations have started to rise - albeit from a low base. Early data suggests about 4% of confirmed cases are currently ending up in hospital although there is a lot of uncertainty around this, as the impact of the rise in infections in recent weeks is only just translating into admissions. That is less than half the proportion ending up in hospital during the winter wave. But the data only tells you part of the story. It also seems that the patients ending up in hospital are less sick, and are being discharged more quickly. So it is pretty clear - as we would expect given the vaccine rollout - that the link between infections and hospital cases is significantly weakened, but to what extent exactly remains to be seen. Fully understanding this will enable scientists to give ministers a clearer idea of what the consequences of a full unlock will be if cases are still rising come 19 July, and therefore whether any measures at all may need to be retained.

"All adults in England should be able to book their Covid-19 jab by the end of this week, NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens says He says vaccine supply is constrained, so the NHS is pacing itself, but it is time to finish the job It's unlikely Scotland will move to level 0 - near normal - restrictions on 28 June, with a final decision due next week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says The regrettable delay to easing lockdown in England is so that the government does not find it has to reverse its decision, Cabinet minister Michael Gove says Industry figures say live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by the delay Without delay, it's possible the country could have returned to hundreds of deaths a day, Sage scientist Professor Graham Medley says The PM confirmed on Monday that there would be a four-week delay to the lifting of all restrictions beyond 21 June due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant There were 108 deaths registered involving Covid-19 in the week ending 4 June 2021, two more than the previous week, ONS figures show Edited by Claire Heald Updates were brought to you today by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Claire Heald, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett, Mary O'Connor and Holly Wallis. Join us again tomorrow. The main headlines:  Here are the latest international developments: US President Joe Biden wants to encourage nationwide celebrations on 4 July to mark the countryâs return to some kind of normalcy after 16 months of pandemic. This also coincides with the self-imposed deadline ofvaccinating 70% of US adults by that date(although the country is not expected to reach that goal by then). The holiday will also see the largest event yet of Mr Bidenâs presidency,the Associated Press news agency reports,external, with plans to host emergency and key workers, as well as members of the military, at the White House. âWe welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honour our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the front lines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,â the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials. âAmerica is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,â the administration wrote to officials. âA summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.â The US is set to reach the milestone of 600,000 deaths seen in the pandemic later on Tuesday. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is big news
in China on Tuesday thatmore than 900 million vaccines have been administered there,external. China has
delivered more vaccine doses than any other country in the world, and in recent
days, has on average been carrying out some 20 million doses a day. The last
100 million doses were carried out within six days; China surpassed the 800-million mark on 9 June. Our World In
Data statistics suggest that the number of inoculations carried out in China is
more than a third of the global total. Chinaâs
statistics include both single and double doses. As China has a population of
1.4 billion people, this means that at least 32% of the population have
been fully vaccinated, ie have received two doses. The country is on track to meetits first objective of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The hope
is then tovaccinate 70% of the population by the end of the year,external, and 80%
by early 2022. Officials have said that80% will be the national threshold for herd immunity,external. There are
currently seven vaccines used in China. These are all
domestic vaccines, and the National Health Commission says the country has
the capacity to produce âclose to five billion vaccine dosesâ annually. It is
currently prioritising vaccination among adults, but last week approved the
use of vaccines on children over the age of three. A Cumbrian mobile DJ says he fears many in the hospitality and wedding entertainment business will not survive after yesterday's announcement of afour-week delay to the planned easing of lockdown restrictionsin England. Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, butthey are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. The summer months are usually the busiest time of year for Andy Neen, who runs a mobile disco and also owns Cumbria DJ Store in Penrith, which sells, repairs and hires equipment to bands, clubs and festivals. However, he is currently facing a lot of uncertainty. Mr Neen said: ""I've managed 15 months and I'll survive another four weeks but it's like being back at square one again building up a  customer base. ""If it gets extended again and we miss revenue from August, that might wipe me out. ""I've had no income basically, well very little, the shop's been closed four times and all my customers work in the same industry, the forgotten industry. ""It's not just DJ's, it's bands, it's wedding planners and venue dressers - anybody who works alongside us, nobody has been able to work."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News The coronavirus pandemic wiped out much of last summer's festival season, with only a handful of events able to go ahead - most held in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. At the start of this year, organisers were more optimistic amid the continued vaccine drive and the availability of mass testing, with dozens of events putting tickets on sale. But as the year has gone on, events scheduled for early summer - most notably Glastonbury - have been cancelled, with dozens of others following in April and May. While others moved to dates later in the summer, the government's decision todelay the easing of lockdown restrictions until 19 Julyhas now forced many festivals to shut their doors for another year. To help fans plan ahead, we've put together a guide of all the festivals that have been delayed, cancelled, postponed or given the green light as of 15 June, which can be readhere. Natalia Bubel says she has not seen her parents for three years The longer wait for the end of legal restrictions on social contact in England announced yesterday has affected many people's work and personal lives. One of them is Natalia Bubel, who works in the events industry for travel companies. âItâs been tough and itâs not getting any easier. Weâve lost 80% of our staff and in light of further restrictions we may struggle,"" she says. Her company is preparing for events in the autumn and she says it's crucial that those are able to go ahead. Their business has been doubly affected, first by restrictions which make events and exhibitions impossible and secondly by the economic damage to the travel companies who are their customers. She says ""if we don't pick up new jobs soon thereâs not going to be much left"" of their business. Meanwhile, the last time she was able to travel and see family in Poland was three years ago, and a longed-for trip in August is hanging in the balance. âIâve been hoping that Poland will be added to the green list but Iâm slowly losing hope,â she says. Reality Check There is controversy about why India was not placed on the travel red list with Pakistan and Bangladesh As England's decision yesterday to delay ending coronavirus restrictions sinks in, there is increasing focus on how the Delta variant was able to gain such a foothold in the UK. Labour has been blaming the governmentâs âlax border measuresâ â in particular the âfortnight of failureâ when it delayed adding India to its travel-ban red list. India is where the Delta variant, which is being blamed for the recent increase in cases in the UK, was first identified. It was added to the governmentâs red list (with the highest level of travel restrictions) on 23 April 2021 â two weeks after neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. The government has said this delay was based on the proportion of people arriving in the UK from the three countries who tested positive for coronavirus - the positivity rate. Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May:""The truth is that when we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India."" The government has not published all the figures that it said supported that claim, but Reality Check said at the time thatthere was no evidence that Bangladesh had three times the positivity rate of India. In the Commons last night, Mr Hancock had changed his line, saying: ""As I have said to this House before, when the decision was taken on 2 April to put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, test positivity of travellers returning from Pakistan was 4.6%âthree times the 1.6% positivity of returning travellers from India."" But this time he did not mention Bangladesh. The figures for Pakistan and India are close to the ones that have been published by Mr Hancockâs department, although we cannot be sure because it has not published the figures for the exact date he was talking about.  Vaccinating a country of 1.4 billion people is no easy task. India began giving jabs in mid-January, but by May, the country was severely low on stocks. The supply shortage, however, has not been the only challenge. India's effort to vaccinate its people has had varying success across regions because of other issues, from planning to infrastructure to misinformation. Data from 729 districts shows wide disparities in vaccination rates. Some districts have given jabs to half their population, while others have vaccinated as little as 3%.

The boss of a US investment bank is cracking down on employees reluctant to return to work as restrictions ease. Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman said: ""If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office."" Speaking at a conference, Mr Gorman said he would be ""very disappointed"" if US-based workers had not returned by September. It comes as a number of banks have taken a tough position on home-working. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank JP Morgan, recently said he wanted US staff back in the office from July. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs bankers wereinstructed to report their vaccine statusahead of returning to their desks this week. Read more here. Centre Court's retractable roof creates an enclosed environment Despite delaying the final stage of England's lockdown easing, the government yesterday announced thatWimbledon would be able to host a full capacity crowdfor the men's and women's finals. Now the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has also confirmed that the tournament will be able to close the Centre Court roof over the crowd of 15,000 in the event of rain. The Wimbledon finals, along with the knockout games of Euro 2020 being played at Wembley, are being included in the government's fan pilots, meaning they are exempt from the current limit on crowds. The department says it has trialled spectator events at a range of both indoor and outdoor venues, including the World Snooker Championship final at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Spectators at Wimbledon will be expected to prove their Covid status, using lateral flow tests or the NHS app - which can record vaccination status. Trials of using the NHS app to record natural immunity from a previous infection are also due to take place. Yesterday, there were a further 132,627 first vaccine doses administered in the UK and 235,928 second doses, for a total of 368,555 extra vaccinations. It means that 41,831,056 people have now had at least one dose, equivalent to 79.4% of people aged over 18. There are 30,209,707 people who are fully vaccinated - 57.4% of adults. Today's figures show another 7,673 people have tested positive for coronavirus. It means that cases in the last seven days have risen 38.8% from the previous week. A further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. People have been visiting shopping centres without masks in Israel Israel has ended a requirement to wear masks indoors, lifting one of its last major restrictions after a successful vaccination programme. The country's health ministry said there were three exceptions - unvaccinated healthcare workers, people going into quarantine, and travellers on a flight. Israel starting easing lockdown restrictions in February as studies revealed the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and death. Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. More than 63% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has criticised anti-lockdown protesters who harassed and abused BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt at a demonstration outside Downing Street. Johnson said,externalit was ""disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job"". ""The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour â they are the lifeblood of our democracy,"" he added. A group of demonstrators surrounded Watt at the protest on Monday after the announcement of the delay in lifting restrictions, following him and shouting ""traitor"", until he took refuge behind policed barriers. England has announced a delay in easing coronavirus rules and Scotland has said it is ""likely"" to put off its next step out of restrictions for a further three weeks. So what are the rules on where you can go and who you can meet across the UK? We've set out all the latest changes inour lockdown explainer here. Back at the Scottish parliament, where MSPs are asking questions of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Greens co-leader Lorna Slater welcomes the ""cautious"" decision to delay further easing of restrictions. Ms Slater asks if the first minister agrees that non-essential international leisure travel should be the last thing that returns to normal. Ms Sturgeon says people should not travel overseas for non-essential reasons. The first minister speaks of her ""intense frustration"" at the lack of more robust border controls around the UK. She says we are paying a price for that now with the Delta variant. Ms Sturgeon insists that limiting international travel gave us the best chance of halting new variants and getting the situation back under control. Marjorie Taylor Greene has acknowledged her remarks were offensive A Republican lawmaker in the US has apologisedfor likening coronavirus mask rules to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia disavowed her comments after a visit to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. The conservative firebrand said it was important for her to acknowledge she had made ""offensive remarks"". An ally of former US President Donald Trump, Greene has courted controversy since assuming office in January. In an interview last month, she lambasted safety protocols adopted by Democrats in the House of Representatives, including a requirement that masks be worn on the chamber floor. The lab-leak theory has been strongly rejected by China Turning now to the very beginning of events, a top Chinese virologist has dismissed suggestions that Covid-19 may have escaped from a lab in the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first detected. Chinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals. But recent scrutiny from the administration of US President Joe Biden has drawn attention to claims that the virus may have emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

"All adults in England should be able to book their Covid-19 jab by the end of this week, NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens says He says vaccine supply is constrained, so the NHS is pacing itself, but it is time to finish the job It's unlikely Scotland will move to level 0 - near normal - restrictions on 28 June, with a final decision due next week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says The regrettable delay to easing lockdown in England is so that the government does not find it has to reverse its decision, Cabinet minister Michael Gove says Industry figures say live music, theatre and other events have been dealt a ""hammer blow"" by the delay Without delay, it's possible the country could have returned to hundreds of deaths a day, Sage scientist Professor Graham Medley says The PM confirmed on Monday that there would be a four-week delay to the lifting of all restrictions beyond 21 June due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant There were 108 deaths registered involving Covid-19 in the week ending 4 June 2021, two more than the previous week, ONS figures show Edited by Claire Heald Updates were brought to you today by Doug Faulkner, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Claire Heald, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett, Mary O'Connor and Holly Wallis. Join us again tomorrow. The main headlines:  Here are the latest international developments: US President Joe Biden wants to encourage nationwide celebrations on 4 July to mark the countryâs return to some kind of normalcy after 16 months of pandemic. This also coincides with the self-imposed deadline ofvaccinating 70% of US adults by that date(although the country is not expected to reach that goal by then). The holiday will also see the largest event yet of Mr Bidenâs presidency,the Associated Press news agency reports,external, with plans to host emergency and key workers, as well as members of the military, at the White House. âWe welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honour our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the front lines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,â the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials. âAmerica is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,â the administration wrote to officials. âA summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.â The US is set to reach the milestone of 600,000 deaths seen in the pandemic later on Tuesday. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is big news
in China on Tuesday thatmore than 900 million vaccines have been administered there,external. China has
delivered more vaccine doses than any other country in the world, and in recent
days, has on average been carrying out some 20 million doses a day. The last
100 million doses were carried out within six days; China surpassed the 800-million mark on 9 June. Our World In
Data statistics suggest that the number of inoculations carried out in China is
more than a third of the global total. Chinaâs
statistics include both single and double doses. As China has a population of
1.4 billion people, this means that at least 32% of the population have
been fully vaccinated, ie have received two doses. The country is on track to meetits first objective of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The hope
is then tovaccinate 70% of the population by the end of the year,external, and 80%
by early 2022. Officials have said that80% will be the national threshold for herd immunity,external. There are
currently seven vaccines used in China. These are all
domestic vaccines, and the National Health Commission says the country has
the capacity to produce âclose to five billion vaccine dosesâ annually. It is
currently prioritising vaccination among adults, but last week approved the
use of vaccines on children over the age of three. A Cumbrian mobile DJ says he fears many in the hospitality and wedding entertainment business will not survive after yesterday's announcement of afour-week delay to the planned easing of lockdown restrictionsin England. Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, butthey are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. The summer months are usually the busiest time of year for Andy Neen, who runs a mobile disco and also owns Cumbria DJ Store in Penrith, which sells, repairs and hires equipment to bands, clubs and festivals. However, he is currently facing a lot of uncertainty. Mr Neen said: ""I've managed 15 months and I'll survive another four weeks but it's like being back at square one again building up a  customer base. ""If it gets extended again and we miss revenue from August, that might wipe me out. ""I've had no income basically, well very little, the shop's been closed four times and all my customers work in the same industry, the forgotten industry. ""It's not just DJ's, it's bands, it's wedding planners and venue dressers - anybody who works alongside us, nobody has been able to work."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News The coronavirus pandemic wiped out much of last summer's festival season, with only a handful of events able to go ahead - most held in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. At the start of this year, organisers were more optimistic amid the continued vaccine drive and the availability of mass testing, with dozens of events putting tickets on sale. But as the year has gone on, events scheduled for early summer - most notably Glastonbury - have been cancelled, with dozens of others following in April and May. While others moved to dates later in the summer, the government's decision todelay the easing of lockdown restrictions until 19 Julyhas now forced many festivals to shut their doors for another year. To help fans plan ahead, we've put together a guide of all the festivals that have been delayed, cancelled, postponed or given the green light as of 15 June, which can be readhere. Natalia Bubel says she has not seen her parents for three years The longer wait for the end of legal restrictions on social contact in England announced yesterday has affected many people's work and personal lives. One of them is Natalia Bubel, who works in the events industry for travel companies. âItâs been tough and itâs not getting any easier. Weâve lost 80% of our staff and in light of further restrictions we may struggle,"" she says. Her company is preparing for events in the autumn and she says it's crucial that those are able to go ahead. Their business has been doubly affected, first by restrictions which make events and exhibitions impossible and secondly by the economic damage to the travel companies who are their customers. She says ""if we don't pick up new jobs soon thereâs not going to be much left"" of their business. Meanwhile, the last time she was able to travel and see family in Poland was three years ago, and a longed-for trip in August is hanging in the balance. âIâve been hoping that Poland will be added to the green list but Iâm slowly losing hope,â she says. Reality Check There is controversy about why India was not placed on the travel red list with Pakistan and Bangladesh As England's decision yesterday to delay ending coronavirus restrictions sinks in, there is increasing focus on how the Delta variant was able to gain such a foothold in the UK. Labour has been blaming the governmentâs âlax border measuresâ â in particular the âfortnight of failureâ when it delayed adding India to its travel-ban red list. India is where the Delta variant, which is being blamed for the recent increase in cases in the UK, was first identified. It was added to the governmentâs red list (with the highest level of travel restrictions) on 23 April 2021 â two weeks after neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. The government has said this delay was based on the proportion of people arriving in the UK from the three countries who tested positive for coronavirus - the positivity rate. Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May:""The truth is that when we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India."" The government has not published all the figures that it said supported that claim, but Reality Check said at the time thatthere was no evidence that Bangladesh had three times the positivity rate of India. In the Commons last night, Mr Hancock had changed his line, saying: ""As I have said to this House before, when the decision was taken on 2 April to put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, test positivity of travellers returning from Pakistan was 4.6%âthree times the 1.6% positivity of returning travellers from India."" But this time he did not mention Bangladesh. The figures for Pakistan and India are close to the ones that have been published by Mr Hancockâs department, although we cannot be sure because it has not published the figures for the exact date he was talking about.  Vaccinating a country of 1.4 billion people is no easy task. India began giving jabs in mid-January, but by May, the country was severely low on stocks. The supply shortage, however, has not been the only challenge. India's effort to vaccinate its people has had varying success across regions because of other issues, from planning to infrastructure to misinformation. Data from 729 districts shows wide disparities in vaccination rates. Some districts have given jabs to half their population, while others have vaccinated as little as 3%.

The boss of a US investment bank is cracking down on employees reluctant to return to work as restrictions ease. Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman said: ""If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office."" Speaking at a conference, Mr Gorman said he would be ""very disappointed"" if US-based workers had not returned by September. It comes as a number of banks have taken a tough position on home-working. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank JP Morgan, recently said he wanted US staff back in the office from July. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs bankers wereinstructed to report their vaccine statusahead of returning to their desks this week. Read more here. Centre Court's retractable roof creates an enclosed environment Despite delaying the final stage of England's lockdown easing, the government yesterday announced thatWimbledon would be able to host a full capacity crowdfor the men's and women's finals. Now the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has also confirmed that the tournament will be able to close the Centre Court roof over the crowd of 15,000 in the event of rain. The Wimbledon finals, along with the knockout games of Euro 2020 being played at Wembley, are being included in the government's fan pilots, meaning they are exempt from the current limit on crowds. The department says it has trialled spectator events at a range of both indoor and outdoor venues, including the World Snooker Championship final at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Spectators at Wimbledon will be expected to prove their Covid status, using lateral flow tests or the NHS app - which can record vaccination status. Trials of using the NHS app to record natural immunity from a previous infection are also due to take place. Yesterday, there were a further 132,627 first vaccine doses administered in the UK and 235,928 second doses, for a total of 368,555 extra vaccinations. It means that 41,831,056 people have now had at least one dose, equivalent to 79.4% of people aged over 18. There are 30,209,707 people who are fully vaccinated - 57.4% of adults. Today's figures show another 7,673 people have tested positive for coronavirus. It means that cases in the last seven days have risen 38.8% from the previous week. A further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. People have been visiting shopping centres without masks in Israel Israel has ended a requirement to wear masks indoors, lifting one of its last major restrictions after a successful vaccination programme. The country's health ministry said there were three exceptions - unvaccinated healthcare workers, people going into quarantine, and travellers on a flight. Israel starting easing lockdown restrictions in February as studies revealed the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and death. Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. More than 63% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has criticised anti-lockdown protesters who harassed and abused BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt at a demonstration outside Downing Street. Johnson said,externalit was ""disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job"". ""The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour â they are the lifeblood of our democracy,"" he added. A group of demonstrators surrounded Watt at the protest on Monday after the announcement of the delay in lifting restrictions, following him and shouting ""traitor"", until he took refuge behind policed barriers. England has announced a delay in easing coronavirus rules and Scotland has said it is ""likely"" to put off its next step out of restrictions for a further three weeks. So what are the rules on where you can go and who you can meet across the UK? We've set out all the latest changes inour lockdown explainer here. Back at the Scottish parliament, where MSPs are asking questions of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Greens co-leader Lorna Slater welcomes the ""cautious"" decision to delay further easing of restrictions. Ms Slater asks if the first minister agrees that non-essential international leisure travel should be the last thing that returns to normal. Ms Sturgeon says people should not travel overseas for non-essential reasons. The first minister speaks of her ""intense frustration"" at the lack of more robust border controls around the UK. She says we are paying a price for that now with the Delta variant. Ms Sturgeon insists that limiting international travel gave us the best chance of halting new variants and getting the situation back under control. Marjorie Taylor Greene has acknowledged her remarks were offensive A Republican lawmaker in the US has apologisedfor likening coronavirus mask rules to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia disavowed her comments after a visit to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. The conservative firebrand said it was important for her to acknowledge she had made ""offensive remarks"". An ally of former US President Donald Trump, Greene has courted controversy since assuming office in January. In an interview last month, she lambasted safety protocols adopted by Democrats in the House of Representatives, including a requirement that masks be worn on the chamber floor. The lab-leak theory has been strongly rejected by China Turning now to the very beginning of events, a top Chinese virologist has dismissed suggestions that Covid-19 may have escaped from a lab in the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first detected. Chinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals. But recent scrutiny from the administration of US President Joe Biden has drawn attention to claims that the virus may have emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

"The Welsh government is pledging the ""real living wage"" for social care staff A living wage for care staff and jobs and training for young people are among the Welsh government's plans for the next five years. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out his government's plans for the term, following his Senedd election success. It includes building 20,000 new low-carbon ""social homes"" for rent, and more 20mph zones in residential areas. But opposition parties criticised the lack of detail in the document. The Welsh Conservatives said it was alarming that the17-page programme for government,externalwas the ""sum total"" of Labour's plan. Plaid Cymru said it lacked targets. Meanwhile Mark Drakeford has refused to say whether he would raise income tax, reiterating there is no plan to do so while the economy is recovering. Welsh ministers said they would put climate change at the ""heart of everything the Welsh government does"". National living wage rises by 6.2% Care workers should get Â£10 an hour, Senedd told 'Fatigued, exhausted but still going' Mr Drakeford's programme incorporates pledges made by the Welsh Labour leaderat the recent Welsh election. He was returned to power in May after his party won 30 Senedd seats - one short of a majority, meaning he will need some opposition help to pass budgets and laws. The first minister said: ""We will build a fairer, greener and stronger Wales in which everyone plays a part - we don't want anyone to be left behind or held back."" The Welsh government is pledging action on single-use plastics Speaking to BBC Wales the first minister said the 20,000 homes would be built to the ""highest"" environmental standards and provided through housing associations and councils. ""They will be homes that produce more energy than they consume,"" he said. The plans include giving everyone under the age of 25 the offer of work, education, training or self-employment, and a new law on air pollution, called a Clean Air Act. Ministers pledged to extend the entitlement to free school meals ""as far as resources allow"" - Welsh Labour has come under pressure from within its own ranks to expand the scheme. How many children need free meals? Meanwhile the document says the 20mph limit would become the default speed limit in residential areas. The programme - made up of a series of short bullet point policy plans - does not say when the ideas will be implemented within the next term, which ends at the 2026 Senedd election. However Mr Drakeford told PA news agency that he hoped social care changes would come in in the ""first half"" of this Senedd's five-year term. The Welsh government said it would extend free school meals as far as resources allowed The document says the the Welsh government will ""not take more in Welsh rates of income tax from Welsh families for at least as long as the economic impact of coronavirus lasts"". In the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies asked Mr Drakeford if he wants to raise taxes during some point in the Senedd term. ""Well the member will have to wait to see,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""It will depend on the circumstances."" ""What lies beyond the recovery can only sensibly be decided in the circumstances that we will face, when we get there."" The Welsh government programme said it would ""seek to reform council tax"", and change the way council elections work to reduce the ""democratic deficit"". Under the plans mental health would be prioritised for investment, and more single-use plastics would be banned -  although plans were previouslyannounced to do this last year. England has already banned the use of single-use plastic straws, cotton buds and stirrers - Wales has consulted on doing the same, with the original plans going further. The document did not put a figure on extra cash for mental health services, although Mr Drakeford said there would be ""millions more"". He said a scheme where child and adolescent mental health services go into schools would be rolled out in every council area. Other pledges include: Creating 125,000 ""all-age"" apprenticeships A new medical school in north Wales New laws to modernise the taxi and private vehicle sector Supporting 80 re-use and repair hubs in town centres Create a national forest stretching from north to south Wales Establish a ""peace academy"" - a community of researchers to shape international strategies - in Wales There had been calls for a pay rise for social care workers in the wake of the Covid pandemic - at the May Senedd election Labour pledged to pay the ""real living wage"" to social care workers. The real living wage is higher than the national living wage, and is pegged to the cost of living. It is currently set at Â£9.50 outside London. Ministers also plan an independent commission to consider Wales' constitutional future, with the Welsh government seeking control over further powers including policing. Mark Drakeford's plan was criticised for lacking detail Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said people and businesses would be ""alarmed and concerned that this 17-page document is the sum total of Labour's plan to get Wales on the road to recovery after the pandemic"". ""We desperately need this Welsh government to succeed if we are to recover from the most difficult year our country has experienced, but unfortunately this programme - combined with Labour's poor track record over the past 22 years - does not inspire confidence."" Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said there was ""nothing transformational or ambitious about Labour's program for government"". ""There's no economic strategy to support and help small and medium Welsh businesses grow or any detail on how they will deliver high-skilled, well-paid jobs in all parts of Wales. ""There's nothing here that comes close to tackling child poverty - nor any concrete commitment to extending free school meals. And there's nothing here that addresses the ever-growing housing crisis that is pricing young people out of their communities. ""This program, thin in detail and absent of targets, almost certainly does not provide the new start that Wales so desperately needs and is not the plan needed to take Wales forward to recovery and beyond."" The Welsh government will likely need at least one vote from non-Labour MSs to change laws and pass budgets. Mr Drakeford said the election result was an ""invitation to opposition parties to work with us on those aspects of our programme where they themselves have an interest"". ""The programme is there for others to work with us on it,"" he said. Wales is embarking on its sixth successive period of Labour-led government since devolution started. The last two began in circumstances Welsh Labour would not have chosen. In 2011 it was austerity. In 2016 it was Brexit. But the backdrop this time is more daunting. Opponents say the Welsh government's plans lack the ambition to meet the challenge of the pandemic and its legacy. But, as in those previous terms in office, Labour's lack of an outright majority means it will need talk to other parties to get the job done.

"Lin-Manuel Miranda is best-known for creating and starring in Broadway hit Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda has apologised for a lack of Afro-Latino actors in the lead roles for his new film musical In The Heights. The movie is adapted from Miranda's 2005 stage show of the same name, which refers to Washington Heights, a mainly Latino neighbourhood in New York. The movie has been praised by film critics but also criticised for not using Afro-Latino actors. Miranda acknowledged in a tweet that his film ""fell short"". Miranda, who is of Puerto-Rican descent, served as a producer on the movie and had an on-screen role. Heissued an apology on Twitter,externalabout not employing more actors of Afro-Latino backgrounds. In The Heights is the film version of Lin-Manuel Miranda's Tony-winning musical ""I started writing In the Heights because I didn't feel seen. And over the past 20 years all I wanted was for us - ALL of us - to feel seen,"" he said. ""I'm seeing the discussion around Afro-Latino representation in our film this weekend and it is clear that many in our dark-skinned Afro-Latino community don't feel sufficiently represented within it, particularly among the leading roles."" Miranda said he could ""hear the hurt and frustration over colourism"" and said the film ""fell short"". ""I hear that without sufficient dark-skinned Afro-Latino representation, the work feels extractive of the community we wanted so much to represent with pride and joy. ""In trying to paint a mosaic of this community, we fell short. I'm truly sorry. I'm learning from the feedback, I thank you for raising it, and I'm listening."" Miranda added he is ""dedicated"" to ""learning and evolving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The apology follows an interview conducted by the journalist Felice LeÃ³n, who describes herself as a ""blacktina"", with the film's director Jon M Chu and the actors Melissa Barrera, Leslia Grace and Gregory Diaz. The interview on LeÃ³n's online show The Root saw her address the fact that most of the actors in the film are ""light-skinned or white-passing"". ""What would you say to folks who say that In the Heights privileges white-passing and light-skinned Latinx people?"" she asked. Chu responded: ""I think that was something we talked about and I needed to be educated about, of course. In the end, when we were looking at the cast, we tried to get the people who were best for those roles. ""I hear you on trying to fill those cast members with darker skin. I think that's a really good conversation to have and something we should all be talking about."" Social media users have also been criticising the film for a lack of dark-skinned Latino actors in its cast. One Twitter user said ""Black-Latin"" people were a Washington Heights fixture and accused the film of ""erasing"" them from the neighbourhood. Allow Twitter content?

""You can never do right it seems,"" said the Puerto Rican actress, who is the subject of a new documentary that Lin-Manuel Miranda executive produced. ""This is the man who literally has brought Latino-ness and Puerto Rican-ness to America,"" the 89-year-old went on to claim. ""Lin-Manuel has done that really singlehandedly. ""I'm simply saying, can't you just wait a while and leave it alone?"" she continued in response to Colbert's suggestion that the criticisms levelled against Miranda were misplaced.

Variety said the film's underwhelming reception was ""puzzling"" given the positive reviews it had received and the amount its distributor Warner Bros spent promoting the film. It asked whether audiences were more inclined towards properties ""with higher brand recognition"" while suggesting the film might go on to become a so-called ""sleeper"" hit.

"US model and author Chrissy Teigen has 35 million followers on Instagram Chrissy Teigen has broken a month-long social media silence to apologise for bullying several people on Twitter. In a blog post, the US model reflected on ""the crushing weight of regret for the things I've said in the past"". Teigen published a series of tweets in May apologising to TV personality Courtney Stodden, who accused her of online bullying. Stodden accepted the apology but said it could just be an attempt to limit damage to Teigen's reputation. In her latest blog post,external, Teigen said she was privately reaching out to people she'd insulted in the past, though she did not say who. ""There is simply no excuse for my past horrible tweets,"" wrote Teigen, who is married to singer John Legend. ""I was a troll, full stop. And I am so sorry."" ""I took to Twitter to try to gain attention and show off what I at the time believed was a crude, clever, harmless quip. I thought it made me cool and relatable if I poked fun at celebrities,"" she continued. ""In reality, I was insecure, immature and in a world where I thought I needed to impress strangers to be accepted,"" Teigen added. Teigen currently has 13.5 million Twitter followers and 35 million on Instagram - where she also shared a link to her blog post. Chrissy Teigen is married to award-winning musician John Legend She said she was not seeking sympathy, and that she was ""no longer the person who wrote those horrible things"" after getting married, having kids and attending therapy. ""We are all more than our worst moments,"" Teigen wrote. ""I won't ask for your forgiveness, only your patience and tolerance."" In 2011 Teigen, who was aged 25 at the time, sent Twitter messages to then-16-year-old Stodden, urging them to take their own life. During that period Stodden rose to fame as the teenage bride of actor Doug Hutchison, who was aged 50 when they married. US TV personality Courtney Stodden has said Chrissy Teigen was not the only celebrity to comment on their marriage Hutchison, who featured alongside Tom Hanks in the 1999 film The Green Mile, was divorced from Stodden last year. Stodden, whohas come out as non-binary,external, recently told The Daily Beast that other celebrities had commented on the relationship. ""People came out of the woodwork to beat up on a kid because she was in a situation that she shouldn't have been in,"" Stodden told the publication.

"This video can not be played Ex-BBC boss Lord Hall: ""I trusted a journalist... and that trust was abused and misplaced"" A former BBC director general has said it was the ""wrong judgement"" in hindsight not to sack Martin Bashir over his behaviour in the run-up to his 1995 interview with Princess Diana. At the time, Tony Hall investigated Bashir's faking of bank documents over questions about whether the reporter had used them to secure the scoop. He told a committee of MPs: ""We trusted him and we clearly shouldn't have."" Committee chairman Julian Knight said there had been ""a failure of morality"". Lord Hall was head of news at the time of the princess's explosive interview, and his subsequent investigation concluded that Bashir was an ""honest and an honourable man"". Bashir's interview with Princess Diana on Panorama in 1995 was watched by 22.8 million people He told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee on Tuesday that he knew he had been lied to on multiple occasions by Bashir when he conducted the internal investigation in 1996. He said Bashir had ended up ""contrite and in tears"" when he ""quizzed him really, really hard"" about the matter at the time. ""He appeared to us that he was contrite, inexperienced and out of his depth and that is why in the end rather than sacking him, and I can see the reasons for that, he was given a second chance."" Bashir admitted to his bosses that the statements had been mocked up, but repeatedly denied showing them to Diana's brother Earl Spencer. He had done, and Earl Spencer has said Bashir was trying to ""groom"" him in order to get to his sister. It was Bashir's first breach of the BBC's guidelines, Lord Hall explained. ""Do you say, that's it, farewell, you're sacked? Or do you say, all right, you're remorseful, you understand it, we'll give you a second chance? And that's what we did, and we did it having talked to him 25 years ago. ""Now, in the light of what I now know about Bashir, was that the wrong judgement? Well, yes it was. But we trusted him, and we clearly shouldn't have done."" He said he wasn't ""trying to conceal anything"", and added: ""We were lied to, and our trust was misplaced and, bluntly, Bashir took us all in, from the director general down to the programme editor.""  -Broadcast on BBC One on 20 November 1995, the interview was watched by more than 20m people -At the time Princess Diana had been separated from Prince Charles for three years and they divorced the following year -She famously told Bashir there were ""three of us"" in the marriage, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles But Mr Knight criticised the decision to blacklist Matt Wiessler, the graphic designer who mocked up the documents and tried to raise the alarm, but not sack Bashir. ""It wasn't just a failure of management, it was a failure of morality,"" the committee chairman said. Lord Hall said: ""I regret the language that we used about Mr Wiessler and I think we could have managed it better."" No evidence Bashir rehired as cover-up - report What is the Diana interview row all about? BBC's deceit to Diana damaged my parents - William Lord Hall resigns after Diana interview inquiry BBC apologises to designer asked to create bank statement Mr Knight also said it was ""utterly extraordinary"" that the BBC would re-hire a ""known liar"" as religious affairs correspondent in 2016, when Lord Hall was director general. ""We didn't know 25 years ago the scale of what Martin Bashir had done to gain access to the Princess of Wales, through Earl Spencer,"" Lord Hall said. ""If we knew then what we know now, of course he wouldn't have been re-hired."" A recent report by former judge Lord Dyson criticised Bashir's ""deceitful"" actions and Lord Hall's ""woefully ineffective"" investigation. This video can not be played Princess Diana was failed not just by Martin Bashir but by leaders at the BBC, says Prince William Lord Hall also he was ""sorry for the hurt caused"" to the Royal Family by the scandal. After the Dyson Report was published, Prince William, Diana's son, said she was ""failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions"". Current director general Tim Davie described the prince's comments as ""a very low moment"" for the BBC, and revealed he had since held private meetings with the royal household. The committee also quizzed John Birt, who was director general at the time of the interview. Lord Birt called Bashir ""a serial liar on an industrial scale"" and ""a very skilled confidence trickster"". His actions were ""one of the biggest crimes in the history of broadcasting"", he added. Steve Brine MP suggested to him that the interview ""sparked a train of events"" that ended with Diana's death in a car crash two years later. Lord Birt replied: ""It is a tragic occurrence, it is an absolute horror story, and it should never have happened. ""And it is a complete embarrassment that it did happen. My heart goes out to the sons of Princess Diana, but none of us can truly speculate and understand what the consequences were."" But Lord Birt refused to apologise to Mr Wiessler, saying he didn't ""understand enough of what happened"". Lord Hall cut a very pained and anguished figure today. Coming under a sustained ad hominem attack from John Nicolson MP, he said he hoped this scandal wouldn't colour his 35 years of public service, at the BBC and beyond. The sad truth for him is that endings have disproportionate weight in human psychology. The likelihood is that Lord Hall - an effective and popular Director-General - will indeed have his legacy not just coloured but stained by this episode. His tactic - one Rupert Murdoch honed at a select committee a decade ago - of stating his regret and apologising at the outset set the tone for what followed. He repeatedly argued that his failure was an excess of trust. He trusted Bashir, a liar. He trusted those who re-hired him, his senior leaders in BBC News. Had the late Steve Hewlett, the Panorama editor at the time of the Diana interview, been alive today, the heat on Hall would have been shared round. Instead, he was solitary, apologising repeatedly even while saying - as Lord Dyson did - that Princess Diana was likely to have given an interview at the time, even if not to Bashir. Bashir's interview - in which Diana discussed her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, their affairs and her bulimia - was described as ""the scoop of the century"" by one MP and was watched by 22.8 million people. Last month's Dyson Report described Bashir as ""unreliable"", ""devious"" and ""dishonest"". The BBC admitted the report showed ""clear failings"" in its own processes. The MPs' hearing came a day afterthe BBC published a separate reportinto how and why Bashir was rehired in 2016 before being promoted to religion editor two years later. This video can not be played Tim Davie said Martin Bashir would not have been rehired if they had had full knowledge around events of the Princess Diana interview Lord Hall told the select committee he didn't know Bashir had been re-hired until the appointment had been made. Mr Davie said an employee would be fired today for forging documents. ""If you're faking documents, that's not a matter for debate,"" he said. He was challenged on why, in that case, Bashir was re-hired in 2016 despite it being known that he had faked documents in the past. ""With the glory of hindsight, and with what I know now based on having personally commissioned Lord Dyson to go at this - that hiring would never have been made, there's no doubt about that,"" said Mr Davie,who took over as director general in 2020. Bashir had also been embroiled in controversies while working in the US, including one that led to him resigning from MSNBCin 2013. Mr Davie said those who reappointed him to the BBC in 2016 ""were aware of some of the controversies of the time"", but that ""overall they did not see them as substantive enough to block a rehiring"". Bashir has said mocking up the documents ""was a stupid thing to do"" and he regretted it, but that they had had no bearing on Diana's decision to be interviewed.

"The Welsh government is pledging the ""real living wage"" for social care staff A living wage for care staff and jobs and training for young people are among the Welsh government's plans for the next five years. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out his government's plans for the term, following his Senedd election success. It includes building 20,000 new low-carbon ""social homes"" for rent, and more 20mph zones in residential areas. But opposition parties criticised the lack of detail in the document. The Welsh Conservatives said it was alarming that the17-page programme for government,externalwas the ""sum total"" of Labour's plan. Plaid Cymru said it lacked targets. Meanwhile Mark Drakeford has refused to say whether he would raise income tax, reiterating there is no plan to do so while the economy is recovering. Welsh ministers said they would put climate change at the ""heart of everything the Welsh government does"". National living wage rises by 6.2% Care workers should get Â£10 an hour, Senedd told 'Fatigued, exhausted but still going' Mr Drakeford's programme incorporates pledges made by the Welsh Labour leaderat the recent Welsh election. He was returned to power in May after his party won 30 Senedd seats - one short of a majority, meaning he will need some opposition help to pass budgets and laws. The first minister said: ""We will build a fairer, greener and stronger Wales in which everyone plays a part - we don't want anyone to be left behind or held back."" The Welsh government is pledging action on single-use plastics Speaking to BBC Wales the first minister said the 20,000 homes would be built to the ""highest"" environmental standards and provided through housing associations and councils. ""They will be homes that produce more energy than they consume,"" he said. The plans include giving everyone under the age of 25 the offer of work, education, training or self-employment, and a new law on air pollution, called a Clean Air Act. Ministers pledged to extend the entitlement to free school meals ""as far as resources allow"" - Welsh Labour has come under pressure from within its own ranks to expand the scheme. How many children need free meals? Meanwhile the document says the 20mph limit would become the default speed limit in residential areas. The programme - made up of a series of short bullet point policy plans - does not say when the ideas will be implemented within the next term, which ends at the 2026 Senedd election. However Mr Drakeford told PA news agency that he hoped social care changes would come in in the ""first half"" of this Senedd's five-year term. The Welsh government said it would extend free school meals as far as resources allowed The document says the the Welsh government will ""not take more in Welsh rates of income tax from Welsh families for at least as long as the economic impact of coronavirus lasts"". In the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies asked Mr Drakeford if he wants to raise taxes during some point in the Senedd term. ""Well the member will have to wait to see,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""It will depend on the circumstances."" ""What lies beyond the recovery can only sensibly be decided in the circumstances that we will face, when we get there."" The Welsh government programme said it would ""seek to reform council tax"", and change the way council elections work to reduce the ""democratic deficit"". Under the plans mental health would be prioritised for investment, and more single-use plastics would be banned -  although plans were previouslyannounced to do this last year. England has already banned the use of single-use plastic straws, cotton buds and stirrers - Wales has consulted on doing the same, with the original plans going further. The document did not put a figure on extra cash for mental health services, although Mr Drakeford said there would be ""millions more"". He said a scheme where child and adolescent mental health services go into schools would be rolled out in every council area. Other pledges include: Creating 125,000 ""all-age"" apprenticeships A new medical school in north Wales New laws to modernise the taxi and private vehicle sector Supporting 80 re-use and repair hubs in town centres Create a national forest stretching from north to south Wales Establish a ""peace academy"" - a community of researchers to shape international strategies - in Wales There had been calls for a pay rise for social care workers in the wake of the Covid pandemic - at the May Senedd election Labour pledged to pay the ""real living wage"" to social care workers. The real living wage is higher than the national living wage, and is pegged to the cost of living. It is currently set at Â£9.50 outside London. Ministers also plan an independent commission to consider Wales' constitutional future, with the Welsh government seeking control over further powers including policing. Mark Drakeford's plan was criticised for lacking detail Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said people and businesses would be ""alarmed and concerned that this 17-page document is the sum total of Labour's plan to get Wales on the road to recovery after the pandemic"". ""We desperately need this Welsh government to succeed if we are to recover from the most difficult year our country has experienced, but unfortunately this programme - combined with Labour's poor track record over the past 22 years - does not inspire confidence."" Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said there was ""nothing transformational or ambitious about Labour's program for government"". ""There's no economic strategy to support and help small and medium Welsh businesses grow or any detail on how they will deliver high-skilled, well-paid jobs in all parts of Wales. ""There's nothing here that comes close to tackling child poverty - nor any concrete commitment to extending free school meals. And there's nothing here that addresses the ever-growing housing crisis that is pricing young people out of their communities. ""This program, thin in detail and absent of targets, almost certainly does not provide the new start that Wales so desperately needs and is not the plan needed to take Wales forward to recovery and beyond."" The Welsh government will likely need at least one vote from non-Labour MSs to change laws and pass budgets. Mr Drakeford said the election result was an ""invitation to opposition parties to work with us on those aspects of our programme where they themselves have an interest"". ""The programme is there for others to work with us on it,"" he said. Wales is embarking on its sixth successive period of Labour-led government since devolution started. The last two began in circumstances Welsh Labour would not have chosen. In 2011 it was austerity. In 2016 it was Brexit. But the backdrop this time is more daunting. Opponents say the Welsh government's plans lack the ambition to meet the challenge of the pandemic and its legacy. But, as in those previous terms in office, Labour's lack of an outright majority means it will need talk to other parties to get the job done.

The main headlines:  Here are the latest international developments: US President Joe Biden wants to encourage nationwide celebrations on 4 July to mark the countryâs return to some kind of normalcy after 16 months of pandemic. This also coincides with the self-imposed deadline ofvaccinating 70% of US adults by that date(although the country is not expected to reach that goal by then). The holiday will also see the largest event yet of Mr Bidenâs presidency,the Associated Press news agency reports,external, with plans to host emergency and key workers, as well as members of the military, at the White House. âWe welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honour our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the front lines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,â the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials. âAmerica is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,â the administration wrote to officials. âA summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.â The US is set to reach the milestone of 600,000 deaths seen in the pandemic later on Tuesday. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is big news
in China on Tuesday thatmore than 900 million vaccines have been administered there,external. China has
delivered more vaccine doses than any other country in the world, and in recent
days, has on average been carrying out some 20 million doses a day. The last
100 million doses were carried out within six days; China surpassed the 800-million mark on 9 June. Our World In
Data statistics suggest that the number of inoculations carried out in China is
more than a third of the global total. Chinaâs
statistics include both single and double doses. As China has a population of
1.4 billion people, this means that at least 32% of the population have
been fully vaccinated, ie have received two doses. The country is on track to meetits first objective of vaccinating 40% of the population by the end of June. The hope
is then tovaccinate 70% of the population by the end of the year,external, and 80%
by early 2022. Officials have said that80% will be the national threshold for herd immunity,external. There are
currently seven vaccines used in China. These are all
domestic vaccines, and the National Health Commission says the country has
the capacity to produce âclose to five billion vaccine dosesâ annually. It is
currently prioritising vaccination among adults, but last week approved the
use of vaccines on children over the age of three. A Cumbrian mobile DJ says he fears many in the hospitality and wedding entertainment business will not survive after yesterday's announcement of afour-week delay to the planned easing of lockdown restrictionsin England. Wedding venues and planners have told the BBC the government's announcement about unlimited guest numbers being permitted has provided some relief, butthey are still deeply worried about the future of their industry. The summer months are usually the busiest time of year for Andy Neen, who runs a mobile disco and also owns Cumbria DJ Store in Penrith, which sells, repairs and hires equipment to bands, clubs and festivals. However, he is currently facing a lot of uncertainty. Mr Neen said: ""I've managed 15 months and I'll survive another four weeks but it's like being back at square one again building up a  customer base. ""If it gets extended again and we miss revenue from August, that might wipe me out. ""I've had no income basically, well very little, the shop's been closed four times and all my customers work in the same industry, the forgotten industry. ""It's not just DJ's, it's bands, it's wedding planners and venue dressers - anybody who works alongside us, nobody has been able to work."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News The coronavirus pandemic wiped out much of last summer's festival season, with only a handful of events able to go ahead - most held in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. At the start of this year, organisers were more optimistic amid the continued vaccine drive and the availability of mass testing, with dozens of events putting tickets on sale. But as the year has gone on, events scheduled for early summer - most notably Glastonbury - have been cancelled, with dozens of others following in April and May. While others moved to dates later in the summer, the government's decision todelay the easing of lockdown restrictions until 19 Julyhas now forced many festivals to shut their doors for another year. To help fans plan ahead, we've put together a guide of all the festivals that have been delayed, cancelled, postponed or given the green light as of 15 June, which can be readhere. Natalia Bubel says she has not seen her parents for three years The longer wait for the end of legal restrictions on social contact in England announced yesterday has affected many people's work and personal lives. One of them is Natalia Bubel, who works in the events industry for travel companies. âItâs been tough and itâs not getting any easier. Weâve lost 80% of our staff and in light of further restrictions we may struggle,"" she says. Her company is preparing for events in the autumn and she says it's crucial that those are able to go ahead. Their business has been doubly affected, first by restrictions which make events and exhibitions impossible and secondly by the economic damage to the travel companies who are their customers. She says ""if we don't pick up new jobs soon thereâs not going to be much left"" of their business. Meanwhile, the last time she was able to travel and see family in Poland was three years ago, and a longed-for trip in August is hanging in the balance. âIâve been hoping that Poland will be added to the green list but Iâm slowly losing hope,â she says. Reality Check There is controversy about why India was not placed on the travel red list with Pakistan and Bangladesh As England's decision yesterday to delay ending coronavirus restrictions sinks in, there is increasing focus on how the Delta variant was able to gain such a foothold in the UK. Labour has been blaming the governmentâs âlax border measuresâ â in particular the âfortnight of failureâ when it delayed adding India to its travel-ban red list. India is where the Delta variant, which is being blamed for the recent increase in cases in the UK, was first identified. It was added to the governmentâs red list (with the highest level of travel restrictions) on 23 April 2021 â two weeks after neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. The government has said this delay was based on the proportion of people arriving in the UK from the three countries who tested positive for coronavirus - the positivity rate. Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May:""The truth is that when we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India."" The government has not published all the figures that it said supported that claim, but Reality Check said at the time thatthere was no evidence that Bangladesh had three times the positivity rate of India. In the Commons last night, Mr Hancock had changed his line, saying: ""As I have said to this House before, when the decision was taken on 2 April to put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, test positivity of travellers returning from Pakistan was 4.6%âthree times the 1.6% positivity of returning travellers from India."" But this time he did not mention Bangladesh. The figures for Pakistan and India are close to the ones that have been published by Mr Hancockâs department, although we cannot be sure because it has not published the figures for the exact date he was talking about.  Vaccinating a country of 1.4 billion people is no easy task. India began giving jabs in mid-January, but by May, the country was severely low on stocks. The supply shortage, however, has not been the only challenge. India's effort to vaccinate its people has had varying success across regions because of other issues, from planning to infrastructure to misinformation. Data from 729 districts shows wide disparities in vaccination rates. Some districts have given jabs to half their population, while others have vaccinated as little as 3%.

The boss of a US investment bank is cracking down on employees reluctant to return to work as restrictions ease. Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman said: ""If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office."" Speaking at a conference, Mr Gorman said he would be ""very disappointed"" if US-based workers had not returned by September. It comes as a number of banks have taken a tough position on home-working. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank JP Morgan, recently said he wanted US staff back in the office from July. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs bankers wereinstructed to report their vaccine statusahead of returning to their desks this week. Read more here.

The Wimbledon finals, along with the knockout games of Euro 2020 being played at Wembley, are being included in the government's fan pilots, meaning they are exempt from the current limit on crowds. The department says it has trialled spectator events at a range of both indoor and outdoor venues, including the World Snooker Championship final at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Spectators at Wimbledon will be expected to prove their Covid status, using lateral flow tests or the NHS app - which can record vaccination status. Trials of using the NHS app to record natural immunity from a previous infection are also due to take place. Yesterday, there were a further 132,627 first vaccine doses administered in the UK and 235,928 second doses, for a total of 368,555 extra vaccinations. It means that 41,831,056 people have now had at least one dose, equivalent to 79.4% of people aged over 18. There are 30,209,707 people who are fully vaccinated - 57.4% of adults. Today's figures show another 7,673 people have tested positive for coronavirus. It means that cases in the last seven days have risen 38.8% from the previous week. A further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. People have been visiting shopping centres without masks in Israel Israel has ended a requirement to wear masks indoors, lifting one of its last major restrictions after a successful vaccination programme. The country's health ministry said there were three exceptions - unvaccinated healthcare workers, people going into quarantine, and travellers on a flight. Israel starting easing lockdown restrictions in February as studies revealed the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and death. Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. More than 63% of peoplehave received at least one dose,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has criticised anti-lockdown protesters who harassed and abused BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt at a demonstration outside Downing Street. Johnson said,externalit was ""disgraceful to see the hounding of Nick Watt doing his job"". ""The media must be able to report the facts without fear or favour â they are the lifeblood of our democracy,"" he added. A group of demonstrators surrounded Watt at the protest on Monday after the announcement of the delay in lifting restrictions, following him and shouting ""traitor"", until he took refuge behind policed barriers. England has announced a delay in easing coronavirus rules and Scotland has said it is ""likely"" to put off its next step out of restrictions for a further three weeks. So what are the rules on where you can go and who you can meet across the UK? We've set out all the latest changes inour lockdown explainer here. Back at the Scottish parliament, where MSPs are asking questions of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Greens co-leader Lorna Slater welcomes the ""cautious"" decision to delay further easing of restrictions. Ms Slater asks if the first minister agrees that non-essential international leisure travel should be the last thing that returns to normal. Ms Sturgeon says people should not travel overseas for non-essential reasons. The first minister speaks of her ""intense frustration"" at the lack of more robust border controls around the UK. She says we are paying a price for that now with the Delta variant. Ms Sturgeon insists that limiting international travel gave us the best chance of halting new variants and getting the situation back under control. Marjorie Taylor Greene has acknowledged her remarks were offensive A Republican lawmaker in the US has apologisedfor likening coronavirus mask rules to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia disavowed her comments after a visit to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. The conservative firebrand said it was important for her to acknowledge she had made ""offensive remarks"". An ally of former US President Donald Trump, Greene has courted controversy since assuming office in January. In an interview last month, she lambasted safety protocols adopted by Democrats in the House of Representatives, including a requirement that masks be worn on the chamber floor. The lab-leak theory has been strongly rejected by China Turning now to the very beginning of events, a top Chinese virologist has dismissed suggestions that Covid-19 may have escaped from a lab in the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first detected. Chinese authorities linked early Covid-19 cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise the virus first passed to humans from animals. But recent scrutiny from the administration of US President Joe Biden has drawn attention to claims that the virus may have emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Dr Shi Zhengli studies viruses at that lab.In a rare interview with the New York Times newspaper,external, she addressed the lab-leak theory. âHow on earth can I offer up evidence for something where there is no evidence?â she told the New York Times. In a text message, she accused her critics of ""constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist"". There is no proof Covid-19 came from a lab, but President Biden has ordered a review that angered China, which has rejected the theory.

"Amy said police officers 'didn't know what stalking protection orders were or how they worked' A woman whose stalker tried to convince her family and friends that she had given him HIV says police officers left her feeling unprotected. Amy, 26, was bombarded with messages about her sexual health by a man she met on a dating app. It comes as a BBC investigation reveals new powers to protect victims are not being used by some police forces, despite a surge in stalking offences. Stalking protection orders (SPOs) were introduced in January last year. The Home Office is set to meet with the police to find ways to bolster the figures as forces look to improve training for officers. Victims of stalking have called for better education and training so officers can recognise when action is needed to apply for an order. Amy said: ""[My stalker] accused me of giving him HIV, even after I showed him my negative test results. ""I was petrified.  It triggered my mental health and I did feel quite suicidal at that point. Nothing I said to him was stopping him from messaging me."" ""I didn't feel that I was protected by the police at all, and I had to go back to my family home. He knew where I lived and where I worked. He had called my work and had spoken to my manager to find me."" Amy was granted a Stalking Protection Order in February and said it had made a difference. She said: ""It makes me feel safe, I was always looking over my shoulder. But now I have my protection order I don't feel the need too. Police officers didn't know what it is or how it works"" Jessica - not her real name - experienced stalking behaviour from someone she employed at the restaurant where she works. She experienced abuse online, personal threats and vandalism to her workplace, but struggled for it be taken seriously. She said: ""It was impossible. They wouldn't put it together as one case. Every single time I phoned up to report an incident they would log it as a separate incident."" It took Jessica three years to obtain a Stalking Protection Order, after she raised the new powers available to her with the police. She said: ""Nobody knows what it is or how it works. I had to explain it to so many young police officers. They had heard of it in theory but didn't understand what it was."" Her stalker has since breached the protection order. ""Every time I call [the police] I have to go through the whole thing again with another officer who doesn't understand about SPOs. ""I think it's great legislation, but I just wish the police would think about how they are actually going to use it"" Stalking protection orders were introduced in January 2020 to police forces in Wales and England. They are civil orders which aim to protect victims, and it is a criminal offence to breach the terms of an order. Police apply to the magistrates for a stalking protection order, which usually remains in place for two years. The idea is that an order can be used quickly, so an interim order can be granted to provide immediate protection for the victim while a decision is being made. When issued, they can include bans like stopping an offender contacting a person through social media, through a third party, or being within a certain distance of their home or workplace. Use of the new orders is varied across the country: Four forces, including Humberside, Suffolk, Dorset and Thames Valley had failed to make a single application by May this year, according to a Freedom of Information request by the BBC's Shared Data Unit (Thames Valley Police has since said it applied for one SPO at the end of April this year, which has been granted). More than half of all applications came from just four police forces in the South East of England - Kent, Surrey, Sussex and the Met Police in London - while applications made by the Met accounted for a more than a third of the total. Some 427 SPOs had been applied for by police forces since January 2020. There were 294 successful applications, with just 22 rejected by the courts During that time the number of reported cases of stalking has surged. The latest figures show 59,950 incidents were recorded across England and Wales in the nine months between April and December 2020 - almost double the annual number of incidents for the year ending March 2020. More than half of all police forces have seen stalking incidents double over the same time period. And the national charge rate for stalking offences is at its lowest point for five years, falling from 23% in 2015-16 to just 6% for the nine months to December 2020. The lowest charge rate for stalking recorded by any force was 2% - seen in Kent. Police forces said officers were being given more training on how to use stalking protection orders to encourage more applications in appropriate cases. They added changes to how stalking crimes were recorded, as well as last year's lockdowns and the growth of online stalking, had been a factor in the surge in stalking incidents. Alice Ruggles told police she was concerned for her safety Clive Ruggles, whose 24-year-old daughterAlice Ruggleswas murdered by her stalker in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in 2017, said he was ""disappointed"" at the lack of use in some forces.

"Campaigners have called for legislation to support the Irish language Sinn FÃ©in has said it will not agree to a new DUP first minister without movement on Irish language legislation. A stand-off has developed between the parties over language and culture law. Following Arlene Foster's resignation, both parties must agree to a new first minister and deputy first minister. But Sinn FÃ©in has said it wants Irish language legislation passed, while the DUP will not commit to this before the next election. The party told the UK government it should legislate for the Irish language through Westminster to resolve a Stormont split on the issue. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald claimed the government offered to intervene weeks ago, but the party declined. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the government ""must not interfere in devolved issues at the behest of Sinn FÃ©in"". Following talks with the political parties on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis tweeted that the people of Northern Ireland ""deserve a stable, mature, functioning executive that is able to deliver in their best interests"". ""They need to see that politics works and dialogue and debate delivers results,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard was asked if his party would agree to the nomination of a new first minister if Westminster did not agree to put forward an Irish language act. The South Down MP said: ""No. There is simply no basis for power-sharing if we do not have movement on these issues."" He added: ""The underlying fact in all of this is power-sharing doesn't work on broken promises."" Mary Lou McDonald (centre) - pictured with Sinn Fein colleagues Conor Murphy and Michelle O'Neill - says the UK government can resolve the Stormont split over Irish language law When Arlene Foster stood down as first minister on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill also lost her position as deputy first minister because the roles are a joint office. The DUP has nominated Paul Givan as Mrs Foster's replacement. The parties have until Monday to approve new first and deputy first ministers, otherwise Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis will be obliged to call an election within a ""reasonable time"". Mrs Foster said on Monday in her final statement as first minister that a deal on language and culture - struck in January 2020 -was the ""only model for success"". After meeting Mr Lewis on Monday night, Ms McDonald said government intervention was the ""only way forward to finally resolve"" the dispute over Irish language legislation. She said Sinn FÃ©in had declined an earlier offer from the UK government to legislate at Westminster because its preference was for the matter to be dealt with at Stormont. ""We have engaged intensively with the DUP and with party leader Edwin Poots,"" said Ms McDonald. Paul Givan (left) - pictured with DUP leader Edwin Poots - is the party's nomination for first minister ""He has told us that they will not be delivering [an Irish language act] in this mandate. ""This legislation was negotiated a year-and-a-half ago and it is now incumbent on the British and Irish governments to act."" The 2020 deal as part of the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement, included an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, an Irish language commissioner and a commissioner to enhance and develop the language and culture of the Ulster-Scots/Ulster-British tradition. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long accused the DUP of refusing to show ""any sort of compromise or ability to work with others"". ""It's apparent that some parties now see this change of leadership in the DUP as an opportunity to renegotiate, reposition themselves and create a crisis where none is necessary,"" Mrs Long told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Naomi Long urged parties to ""stop messing around and breaking promises"" ""We all signed up to NDNA knowing that there were parts of that agreement that would be more difficult, would be more challenging, but we knew that it had to be done. ""All we need to do is move on, get the Irish language act underway, stop messing around and breaking promises and get on with the real business of government."" However, Mr Wilson, DUP chief whip at Westminster, said: ""To force through the latest Sinn FÃ©in wish list will cause further damage to the credibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly. How does the election of a new first minister work? ""Rather than running to Her Majesty's Government when they can't get their way, republicans should respect our mandate. ""Sinn FÃ©in is playing the politics of ransom and are placing culture above health, education and economic recovery."" In July 2019, when Stormont was suspended,MPs at Westminster backed amendments to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriageto Northern Ireland. Mr Wilson said this ""only served to undermine devolution"". Education Minister Michelle McIlveen accused Sinn FÃ©in of prioritising Irish language commitments ""above all else"" DUP Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said she would not be ""particularly happy"" about the secretary of state intervening to pass Irish language legislation at Westminster. Speaking during a visit to a school in Belfast - her first engagement since taking over the role -  she accused Sinn FÃ©in of prioritising Irish language commitments ""above all else"". ""This is a devolved matter - the secretary of state has gotten himself involved in previous issues but this is about the devolution package and how that's being respected,"" she added. Explaining the latest developments in Northern Irish politics to people who live here is sometimes hard enough - never mind to people who don't Sinn FÃ©in's appeal to the British government to bypass Stormont and legislate for the Irish language directly is such a moment. This from the party who warned against the introduction of direct rule for the three years Stormont was suspended is quite a move. Pragmatism or hypocrisy? You decide and many will. Even more astonishing is the claim that Westminster offered to do it weeks ago and Sinn FÃ©in turned them down, believing it could be sorted at home. The fact they've changed their minds shows that things between the party and the new DUP leadership could, shall we say, be better. It's also a sure sign that Sinn FÃ©in, no more than the DUP, want a collapse they would ship their fair share of blame for from an increasingly unforgiving public. Another one for the pages of that still unwritten book ""Stormont, you couldn't make it up"". Also speaking to Good Morning Ulster, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said all of the NDNA commitments needed to be delivered ""urgently"", adding: ""That includes the Irish language legislation, it includes other cultural legislation in the agreement."" However, Mr Eastwood said it would be ""absolutely wrong"" to bring the executive down over the issue. Instead he said he and his fellow SDLP MP Claire Hanna would seek to legislate on the Irish language at Westminster. He said if the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in could not reach a solution he would attempt to amend a bill related to Northern Ireland that is currently making its way through the House of Commons On Monday Mr Poots said ""time will tell"" whether the implementation of the dealwould happen in the existing Northern Ireland Assembly term, which is due to expire in April 2022. He added that it was not appropriate for Sinn FÃ©in to set preconditions on nominating a first and deputy first minister. ""It's not respecting someone's mandate... I'm not setting preconditions to the selection of Sinn Fein's deputy first minister,"" he said. The Northern Ireland Assembly has the power to make laws in any area that isn't ""reserved"" to Westminster. Reserved matters include things such as defence, income tax and making foreign treaties. Any matter that is not a reserved matter is devolved. The Northern Ireland Act - which established the assembly - allows the NI secretary to make any devolved matter a reserved matter, or vice versa, using a legislative instrument known as an Order in Council. However in the case of the language and cultural package agreed as part of the New Decade, New Approach deal in January 2020, it was specifically stated that the legislation would be established as new dedicated parts of the Northern Ireland Act. This meant it was always going to require passage at Westminster at some stage of the process. However it will still be up to Stormont to implement the legislation in practice. Language translation motion passed by Stormont Foster urges NI parties to stick to language deal Poots will not guarantee Irish language law this term How does election of new first minister work?

"A new trade deal between the UK and Australia will not harm British farmers' livelihoods, the trade secretary has told the BBC. Liz Truss denied that imports of Australian beef would flood the UK and said British export markets would grow. The pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - will cover British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics. But some UK farmers fear they may be undercut on price and standards. Speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Truss said: ""At the moment there are extremely small quantities of Australian beef coming into the UK. ""So what we'd be looking at here is over time some of the EU imports [lost due to Brexit] being replaced by Australian imports."" How will the UK-Australia trade deal work? She added that the deal - which is seen as an important step towards the UK joining a wider Asia Pacific free-trade agreement - would also create opportunities. ""We can see the evidence, that sales of British beef international are growing to places like Asia-Pacific and the United States because people want to buy high quality British products produced in a high animal welfare way,"" Ms Truss said. Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson agreed the broad terms of the deal over dinner She said by 2030, 66% of the world's middle classes will be in Asia and they want to buy products such as whisky, cars, beef, and lamb from the UK. ""We need to be positive about what we've got to sell rather than being defensive,"" she said. However, Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, expressed concern about the lack of detail in the deal. 'Safeguards' promise over UK-Australia trade deal Farmers' opposition to UK-Australia trade deal grows ""It is now vital that we know the detail of what has been agreed to help businesses understand and begin to prepare for the new terms of trade,"" he said. ""The terms must also ensure that consumers have continued confidence that any agreement maintains the highest food safety and animal welfare standards."" NFU president Minette Batters has warned farmers would struggle if the wrong deal is struck National Farmers' Union president President Minette Batters said: ""While the government has previously been keen to highlight how our free trade agreements will uphold our high standards of food production, there has always been a question mark over how this can be achieved while opening up our markets to food produced to different standards. ""We will need to know more about any provisions on animal welfare and the environment to ensure our high standards of production are not undermined by the terms of this deal."" This video can not be played 'We don't have enough beef to flood the UK market' Under the deal with Australia, the government says farmers will be protected by a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years, using tariff rate quotas and other safeguards. But some UK farmers have concerns there will be no meaningful safeguards in place to stop them being undercut by cheap imports. Farmers in Australia are allowed to use some hormone growth promoters, pesticides, and feed additives that are banned in the UK. The UK Trade and Business Commission is worried that Australian farming operates on a scale that UK counterparts cannot compete with, saying Australia contains eight of the 10 largest farms in the world, including one which is larger than Israel. According to the UK's National Farmers Union, Australian farmers are able to produce beef at a lower cost of production, and could undercut farmers in the UK. But Ms Truss said the deal would be fully scrutinised by the Trade and Agriculture Commission and MPs could block it if they were not happy. She added that it would create better access for UK digital and financial services and better arrangements for UK citizens who want to work in Australia. Welsh lamb and Australian wine are said to have been on the menu as Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison settled the deal over dinner - but ultimately this deal is more significant in symbolic than economic terms. For the government's own estimates say the new arrangements may add just 0.02% to our GDP, and the impact on prices is negligible. But this, the first bespoke deal of the post-Brexit era, signifies global Britain's ambitions. The hope is that this paves the way for more alliances beyond the EU - starting with a group of trans-Pacific nations, the CPTPP. They only buy 8% of our exports - and we have deals already with the majority of members. But the ultimate hope is that key partners - such as the US - might also join. It also symbolises though, the sacrifices that may be needed to get deals. British farmers fear they will face more competition from Australian counterparts on their home soil. Australian farmers say they won't be flooding the market. The UK is so far away that even the 80% increase in Australian imports the government predicts equates to 0.1% of total UK imports. It'll be a while before the detail of this deal can be publicly scrutinised - even by those who'll be affected. But the concern is that this sets a marker, that  agriculture may be up for grabs when it comes to compromise in future and far bigger trade deals. The UK government has signeda long list of trade dealsover the past year, but they have been rollovers of those the UK already had as part of the EU. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn.,externalThe government says the deal will boost UK industries that employ 3.5 million people across the country. How many trade deals has the UK done? Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? Food and drink sector criticise Australia trade deal Metals, wine and machines,externalhave formed the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small at present, with 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia and just 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK. ""A deal would be good for my exports if there's a drop in the tariffs but if we start importing more I might be faced with more competition here,"" says Mary Quicke, owner of Devon-based artisan cheesemaker Quicke's. She exports about 10% of her produce to Australia, but is more concerned about Europe. ""I would rather they had another look at the Brexit deal and ironed out a lot of the problems there. ""There's a dreadful amount of paperwork for exporting to the EU right now, it's a complete nightmare. ""I want to preserve our beautiful patchwork of British farms, so I'm cautious. Our milk is produced with half the carbon footprint of milk worldwide so it's really important that we don't just create a worse environmental footprint."" The deal marks the end of what has essentially been a 50-year lock-out for Australian farmers, who have struggled to navigate Brussels' restrictions, tariffs and quotas. The president of the Australian National Farmers' Federation said it had been very difficult to break into the UK because it was ""way too expensive and way too far"". Australian farmers have also been looking to diversify due to the increased tensions between Australia and China. In the past year, China has imposed tariffs and restrictions on everything from Australian beef, barley and wine, to rock lobster and coal.

"Amy said police officers 'didn't know what stalking protection orders were or how they worked' A woman whose stalker tried to convince her family and friends that she had given him HIV says police officers left her feeling unprotected. Amy, 26, was bombarded with messages about her sexual health by a man she met on a dating app. It comes as a BBC investigation reveals new powers to protect victims are not being used by some police forces, despite a surge in stalking offences. Stalking protection orders (SPOs) were introduced in January last year. The Home Office is set to meet with the police to find ways to bolster the figures as forces look to improve training for officers. Victims of stalking have called for better education and training so officers can recognise when action is needed to apply for an order. Amy said: ""[My stalker] accused me of giving him HIV, even after I showed him my negative test results. ""I was petrified.  It triggered my mental health and I did feel quite suicidal at that point. Nothing I said to him was stopping him from messaging me."" ""I didn't feel that I was protected by the police at all, and I had to go back to my family home. He knew where I lived and where I worked. He had called my work and had spoken to my manager to find me."" Amy was granted a Stalking Protection Order in February and said it had made a difference. She said: ""It makes me feel safe, I was always looking over my shoulder. But now I have my protection order I don't feel the need too. Police officers didn't know what it is or how it works"" Jessica - not her real name - experienced stalking behaviour from someone she employed at the restaurant where she works. She experienced abuse online, personal threats and vandalism to her workplace, but struggled for it be taken seriously. She said: ""It was impossible. They wouldn't put it together as one case. Every single time I phoned up to report an incident they would log it as a separate incident."" It took Jessica three years to obtain a Stalking Protection Order, after she raised the new powers available to her with the police. She said: ""Nobody knows what it is or how it works. I had to explain it to so many young police officers. They had heard of it in theory but didn't understand what it was."" Her stalker has since breached the protection order. ""Every time I call [the police] I have to go through the whole thing again with another officer who doesn't understand about SPOs. ""I think it's great legislation, but I just wish the police would think about how they are actually going to use it"" Stalking protection orders were introduced in January 2020 to police forces in Wales and England. They are civil orders which aim to protect victims, and it is a criminal offence to breach the terms of an order. Police apply to the magistrates for a stalking protection order, which usually remains in place for two years. The idea is that an order can be used quickly, so an interim order can be granted to provide immediate protection for the victim while a decision is being made. When issued, they can include bans like stopping an offender contacting a person through social media, through a third party, or being within a certain distance of their home or workplace. Use of the new orders is varied across the country: Four forces, including Humberside, Suffolk, Dorset and Thames Valley had failed to make a single application by May this year, according to a Freedom of Information request by the BBC's Shared Data Unit (Thames Valley Police has since said it applied for one SPO at the end of April this year, which has been granted). More than half of all applications came from just four police forces in the South East of England - Kent, Surrey, Sussex and the Met Police in London - while applications made by the Met accounted for a more than a third of the total. Some 427 SPOs had been applied for by police forces since January 2020. There were 294 successful applications, with just 22 rejected by the courts During that time the number of reported cases of stalking has surged. The latest figures show 59,950 incidents were recorded across England and Wales in the nine months between April and December 2020 - almost double the annual number of incidents for the year ending March 2020. More than half of all police forces have seen stalking incidents double over the same time period. And the national charge rate for stalking offences is at its lowest point for five years, falling from 23% in 2015-16 to just 6% for the nine months to December 2020. The lowest charge rate for stalking recorded by any force was 2% - seen in Kent. Police forces said officers were being given more training on how to use stalking protection orders to encourage more applications in appropriate cases. They added changes to how stalking crimes were recorded, as well as last year's lockdowns and the growth of online stalking, had been a factor in the surge in stalking incidents. Alice Ruggles told police she was concerned for her safety Clive Ruggles, whose 24-year-old daughterAlice Ruggleswas murdered by her stalker in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in 2017, said he was ""disappointed"" at the lack of use in some forces. ""We have to train front line police to recognise stalking and to not pass it off as a series of unrelated events or as harassment,"" he said. ""Stalking is about obsession and all that that implies. We have to teach the front line officers to join the dots up enough to recognise what stalking is, to crime it as stalking and then to pass it on to the right specialists."" Suky Bhaker, the chief executive of the personal safety charity The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said the inconsistent application of the law was concerning. She said: ""We're seeing a real postcode lottery in terms of the support that victims get. ""Often what we're finding is criminal justice professionals are not identifying stalking, not putting their appropriate risk management strategies in place and not offering protection, like the stalking protection orders for victims."" Lisa King, the director of communications with the charity Refuge, said the findings were disappointing. ""This really should be a wakeup call for police forces across the country to get the training in place, and then start to message also that these orders are there, that women and men can use, so that they are taken up and protection is given,"" she said. Katy Bourne, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is the lead for stalking in Wales and England. She is also a victim of stalking. Katy Bourne is the Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex ""We've issued about 30 stalking protection orders and we've got several others in the pipeline,"" she said. She urged other forces to use the orders to protect victims. ""It says to the victim 'we take you seriously' - and that in itself is such a relief that the police are listening to you and believe you."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Stalking Protection Orders stop perpetrators in their tracks and prevent them contacting victims. We expect police forces to make full use of them. ""The Home Office and College of Policing have worked closely with forces to produce guidance on issuing them. ""Next week, Home Office officials will meet with the police and other stakeholders who work to tackle stalking to set out our findings on how effectively police forces have been using SPOs and discuss how to improve this."" National Police Chiefs' Council lead for stalking and harassment, Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills, said: ""We continue to work with victim groups and others to improve our response to this issue. We have updated the training and guidance to officers and there are specialists in each force who are responsible for improving standards. ""This new training and changes to the way we record crime, where we will still take a detailed report even if there is no information which can identify a suspect, go some way to explaining the increase in offences. ""We know how important charging an offender and securing justice is and we are working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure more are brought before a court.""

"There was a record rise in the number of workers on payrolls in May as the jobs market continued to recover. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there were 197,000 more people in payrolled employment last month compared with April, the highest rise since records began in 2014. It came as the unemployment rate fell again to 4.7% in the three months to April, down from 4.8% previously. But unemployment remained high among the young and those in based in London. Sam Beckett, ONS head of economic statistics, said: ""The number of employees on payroll grew strongly in May, up by almost 200,000, although it is still over half a million down since the pandemic struck. ""Job vacancies continued to recover in the spring, and our early estimates suggest that by May the total had surpassed its pre-pandemic level, with strong growth in sectors such as hospitality. ""Meanwhile the redundancy rate remains subdued, while the number of employees on furlough has continued to decline."" Unemployment rose sharply last year as the UK went through successive lockdowns, but it has gradually fallen in 2021 as restrictions are eased. Firms appear to be expanding again, with the number of job vacancies in most industries above pre-pandemic levels in May, according to the ONS. Similarly, the redundancy rate is back to levels seen before the spread of coronavirus. However, the number of workers on company payrolls in the accommodation and food services sector, aged under 25, or living in London remains ""well below"" pre-pandemic levels, the ONS said. After a long hiatus, DJ and music producer Sean Dakin will be playing a few socially distanced gigs during the Euro football championships. He has also started freelancing again in sales and as an editor after the best part of a year with no proper income. His fear now is that the job opportunities will dry up again because ofthe delay to unlocking Covid restrictions. ""If we are pushing things back we need urgent help for those in hospitality, theatre, nightclubs, other late night venues,"" he told the BBC. ""It's absolutely a disgrace that dates are moved with what feels like little thought for the consequences with a complete disregard for peoples' mental health and incomes."" He says he understands the need to protect public health, but that the UK ""cannot afford to stumble every time there's a variant and cases rise a little"". Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC's Today programme that the figures showed the labour market was ""starting to turn in a good way after quite a painful year"". ""It is pretty much all down to the furlough scheme,"" he said. ""That has been a huge success and quite frankly one of the best government policies I think that the modern economy has ever seen. Without that I do think we would have had unemployment rates of 8-9%, similar to the peaks we saw during the global financial crisis."" Mr Dales noted there were still 3.4 million people on furlough but said the ""way the wind is blowing"" meant many would end up returning to their jobs. If they did not, he said it ""wouldn't be too long until they found another one"". Part-timers 'clinging on to disappearing jobs' We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector Hospitality 'struggling to fill thousands of jobs' There are fears the four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions will harm many firms, and the government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme (due to end in September) or other financial support. Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have allreacted with dismay. However, Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said she expected the labour market to improve despite the delay, and that employers may struggle to fill gaps. ""Sharp declines in furloughed employees in those sectors that reopened on 12 April... coupled with anecdotal evidence of significant difficulties to fill vacancies in some sectors, point at increasing challenges to add staff in the coming months."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our Plan for Jobs is working - the latest forecasts for unemployment are around half of what was previously feared and the number of employees on payroll is at its highest level since April last year."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government needed to do more for businesses affected by the delay to removing restrictions. ""Many businesses have financial pinch points coming up but are still struggling to turn a profit. ""If businesses have to stay closed or operate at massively reduced capacity they're not going to be able to pay staff, rents and loans back. Government support must recognise that."" There are a number of upbeat indicators in today's jobs figures. Granted the latest estimate of the number on employers' payrolls remains over half a million below its pre-pandemic level. The living standards think-tank the Resolution Foundation also estimates there are still 2.8 million people who remain on furlough and self-employed income support schemes who need to find work as support is withdrawn. But that's down from 6.2 million in March. And the number of job vacancies, at 758,000, is now back up to pre-pandemic levels. What's unlike any other economic crisis of the past 50 years is that in this one, it's London that's been hardest hit by unemployment. With financial sector employees continuing to work from home in large numbers, there's less demand for the restaurants, coffee shops and shops that cater for the City of London's much-reduced army of commuters. London alone still has fewer employees than it did in May last year and it now has the highest unemployment rate, at 6.5%, of any region.

Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC's Today programme that the figures showed the labour market was ""starting to turn in a good way after quite a painful year"". ""It is pretty much all down to the furlough scheme,"" he said. ""That has been a huge success and quite frankly one of the best government policies I think that the modern economy has ever seen. Without that I do think we would have had unemployment rates of 8-9%, similar to the peaks we saw during the global financial crisis."" Mr Dales noted there were still 3.4 million people on furlough but said the ""way the wind is blowing"" meant many would end up returning to their jobs. If they did not, he said it ""wouldn't be too long until they found another one"". Part-timers 'clinging on to disappearing jobs' We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector Hospitality 'struggling to fill thousands of jobs' There are fears the four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions will harm many firms, and the government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme (due to end in September) or other financial support. Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businesses have allreacted with dismay. However, Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said she expected the labour market to improve despite the delay, and that employers may struggle to fill gaps. ""Sharp declines in furloughed employees in those sectors that reopened on 12 April... coupled with anecdotal evidence of significant difficulties to fill vacancies in some sectors, point at increasing challenges to add staff in the coming months."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our Plan for Jobs is working - the latest forecasts for unemployment are around half of what was previously feared and the number of employees on payroll is at its highest level since April last year."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government needed to do more for businesses affected by the delay to removing restrictions. ""Many businesses have financial pinch points coming up but are still struggling to turn a profit. ""If businesses have to stay closed or operate at massively reduced capacity they're not going to be able to pay staff, rents and loans back. Government support must recognise that."" There are a number of upbeat indicators in today's jobs figures. Granted the latest estimate of the number on employers' payrolls remains over half a million below its pre-pandemic level. The living standards think-tank the Resolution Foundation also estimates there are still 2.8 million people who remain on furlough and self-employed income support schemes who need to find work as support is withdrawn. But that's down from 6.2 million in March. And the number of job vacancies, at 758,000, is now back up to pre-pandemic levels. What's unlike any other economic crisis of the past 50 years is that in this one, it's London that's been hardest hit by unemployment. With financial sector employees continuing to work from home in large numbers, there's less demand for the restaurants, coffee shops and shops that cater for the City of London's much-reduced army of commuters. London alone still has fewer employees than it did in May last year and it now has the highest unemployment rate, at 6.5%, of any region.

"The prime minister is determined the remaining coronavirus restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July, No 10 says, despite concern that a rise in deaths could force a change of plan. Boris Johnson said the measures must remain in place until then because of the rapid spread of the Delta variant. All adults will be able to book a jab by the end of the week, NHS chiefs say. But some Tory MPs fear a further delay to lockdown easing amid warnings of a return to hundreds of deaths a day. A further 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Tuesday, and 7,673 more cases. Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said the health service would ""finish the job"" of the vaccination programme to the ""greatest extent possible"" over the next four weeks. He said he expected that all those over the age of 18 would be able to book ""by the end of this week"", and that the NHS aimed to offer second doses to two thirds of adults by 19 July. So far, nearly 42 million people in the UK have received their first dose, and just over 30 million have had their second. In Scotland, the easing of restrictions islikely to be pushed back by three weeksso more people can be vaccinated against the virus, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday. All of Scotland had been due to move to the lowest level zero of its five-tier system from 28 June. This new date will bring Scotland into line with England. Allow Twitter content?

On Monday, Mr Johnson announceda four-week delayto the planned easing of lockdown restrictions in England on 21 June, after scientific advisers warned of a ""significant resurgence"" in people needing hospital treatment if it went ahead. He said 19 July would be the ""terminus date"" for the remaining restrictions on social contact, and the delay would allow more people to get vaccinated. Afew restrictions are being lifted on 21 June,including the limit on wedding guest numbers. And 15 coronavirus pilot events will continue as planned, including some upcoming Euro 2020 games,Wimbledonand arts and music performances. Attendees will have to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? The announcement that the vaccine rollout would be accelerated came as Prof Graham Medley, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the numbers of people dying from coronavirus would rise. ""The question is really as to what level they will rise,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It is possible we could end up with a situation whereby the numbers of people going to hospital really mean that the government have to take some kind of action that they don't want to."" But he added that the government has had to do this throughout the pandemic. What are the rules after 21 June? What will delaying the full unlock achieve? How many people can go to a wedding and reception? Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the delay was ""extremely welcome"" and he hoped it would be ""enough"". He told BBC Breakfast there was ""very promising evidence"" that the vaccination rollout meant there were fewer serious cases of coronavirus, and that getting more people vaccinated would allow England  to ""get ahead of this current wave"". This video can not be played Michael Gove says that the increased level of vaccination should allow further relaxation of restrictions on 19 July Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he shared the prime minister's confidence about the 19 July end date. ""One can never predict the future with perfect confidence,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""But insofar as we can be confident about anything in this complex world, we can be confident that the increased level of vaccination that we will have by 19 July should allow us to further relax restrictions."" However, Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, said ""we could have moved ahead perfectly safely"" without the delay. He told LBC radio that the prime minister's comments about 19 July were ""exactly the same words as he was using about 21 June"". ""So some of us, I'm afraid, are a bit worried that we're not going to actually move forward on 19 July,"" he said. Labour, meanwhile, has accused the government of incompetence over its handling of Covid variants, saying lax border policies led to the Delta variant entering the country. ""Rather than red-listing this variant, we essentially gave it the red carpet treatment as 20,000 people were allowed to arrive from India over a number of weeks in April, even though the warning signs were there,"" shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. ""That essentially seeded this Delta variant across the country."" The confidence among ministers that all remaining restrictions will lift on 19 July is understandable given the extent of the vaccine rollout. But behind the scenes, the one fear is what to do if cases are still rising at that point. Infections are currently climbing sharply and modellers believe this could lead to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day later in the summer. That is equivalent to what the NHS would face for all types of respiratory illness in the middle of a bad winter. The hope is that in a couple of weeks infection levels will have started to flatten, and maybe even fall, as the virus hits the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme. But there are no guarantees of that. Knowing the peak of this wave is still to come will make the final decision harder if hospitalisations climb as expected. But the fact remains Covid is always going to present a risk. Exactly how much is hard to quantify at this stage, although it will of course be much much lower than it was before. In the end it will come down to balancing that extra risk against the need to get back our old way of life and reducing the harms caused by our response to Covid. The extension of restrictions will be put to a Commons vote, which could trigger a sizeable Conservative backbench rebellion, with a debate expected on Wednesday. New analysis by Public Health England showed two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine were highly effective at preventing hospital admissions from the Delta variant. PHE said the effectiveness was comparable to against the Alpha variant which was previously dominant in the UK. Mr Johnson said the gap between doses for over-40s in England would be reduced from 12 to eight weeks. And the target to offer all adults a first dose will be brought forward to 19 July. Hospitality, wedding and night-time entertainment businessesare among those to have criticised the delay. The government has said it will not extend the furlough scheme or other financial support further, despite the delay to the unlocking roadmap. Downing Street said local authorities have Â£1bn of unspent money to support businesses, which could be used to pay business rates or contribute to furlough payments. Reopening delay a 'hammer blow for live events' Businesses react to easing delay Under thefurlough scheme, the government covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work because of the pandemic. The scheme is due to run until the end of September but employers will have to help cover the cost from July. Plans for easing coronavirus restrictions differ in all four UK nations. Limits on indoor gatherings inNorthern Irelandare scheduled to be relaxed on 21 June and the rules inWaleswill be reviewed on 25 June.
