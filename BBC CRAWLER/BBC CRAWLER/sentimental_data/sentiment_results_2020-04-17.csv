"Councils in England have warned that the coronavirus crisis is pushing them to the brink of financial failure. The Local Government Association said that without more funding some authorities would be forced to cut ""vital"" services. Councils face increased costs from supporting vulnerable people, while income from fees and rates is falling. The government said it was providing Â£1.6bn extra to help them ""provide services"" during the pandemic. The LGA welcomed this, but said more money was needed and called for a ""cast-iron commitment"" to cover the costs of coronavirus-related work. Many councils were already under severe financial strain before the coronavirus crisis, particularly those responsible for social care. Since 2010 many local authorities have had to cut services to balance the books. The crisis has resulted in extra pressure on services that support the most vulnerable: the elderly, disabled and homeless. At the same time income from fees and charges has dried up, and there's fear that council tax revenues may fall as people face financial hardship. At the start of this crisis, council leaders said they largely felt reassured by government promises of support. Now - with so much demand on the Treasury - there's scepticism about how much more funding will be forthcoming. Local government, which often feels like a forgotten frontline service, wants to ensure its voice is heard among the calls for support. Hence this stark warning about the potential consequences for crucial services if it doesn't get more cash. The LGA says councils are spending more on helping disabled, older and homeless people through the crisis, but leisure and planning services at many town halls have been scaled back or closed, meaning income has ""dried up"". Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: ""Additional funding is urgently needed to help councils get through this crisis, support the vulnerable and adapt to life once we defeat this virus, when our local services will be needed more than ever to help communities rebuild. ""It would be wrong and unacceptable if councils are then forced to make further cutbacks to the very services that will have helped the nation through this crisis and the key workers who are producing heroics on the front line see their jobs placed at risk."" The government has announced councils will be able to defer Â£2.6bn in business rate payments owed to central government. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: ""We've already provided Â£1.6bn of additional funding and have announced new measures to help ease immediate cash flow pressures faced by councils in England.""

"The boss of the Bank of England has said that emergency lending to businesses ""has to be sorted out"" amid the coronavirus pandemic. Governor Andrew Bailey questioned whether the system is ""too complicated"" as banks struggle to cope with applications. Mr Bailey said that banks must now ""dig in"" with processing risk assessments. He added that the government-backed scheme had taken longer to get into full operation than expected. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in March that UK-based small and medium-sized business could apply for an interest-free loan of up to Â£5m to help them with Covid-19 related difficulties. However, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Wednesday that only 2% of UK firms had so far secured the loans. ""Notwithstanding the stress that we're all operating under in terms of the current working environment, they [the banks] have got to put their backs into it and get on with it, frankly,"" Mr Bailey said on Friday. Mr Bailey also said that the chancellor and HM Treasury had to make a decision on whether or not the taxpayer gives 100% backing for the loan scheme. Currently, the government guarantees 80% of the loan amount to give banks and financial companies the confidence to lend. Banks and financial institutions have lent more than Â£1.1bn to those enterprises under the government's coronavirus loan scheme, according to the latest figures released by UK Finance on Wednesday. More than 6,000 loans have now been provided, with an average value of about Â£185,000. On Thursday it was announced loansto large firms would also be included in the government's Â£330bn economic support package. The scheme is part of government efforts to help keep the UK economy afloat as it is battered by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. During the phone call with journalists on Friday, Mr Bailey also addressed the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast, which expects GDP to drop by 35% in the three months to June. He said that such a scenario was ""not implausible"". The Bank of England has also slashed interest rates to a new low and freed up billions of pounds to help consumers and banks through the crisis.

"Coronavirus testing will be rolled out to people working in public services such as police, fire and prison staff, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Capacity was rising ""sharply"" but not as many NHS staff had come forward for tests as had been expected, he said. The government said 21,328 tests were carried out on Thursday but there had been capacity for at least 38,000. Meanwhile, scientistssay they should have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by September. However, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said there were ""no guarantees"" and it was not possible to put a date on when a vaccine would be created by. Producing one is ""a colossal undertaking"" and ""a complex process which will take many months"", he told the government's daily press briefing. It comes as the UK recorded 847 new coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals on Thursday, taking the total to 14,576. The figure does not include hundreds more who have died in care homes and the community. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Speaking by videolink to an online meeting of the Commons health committee earlier, Mr Hancock said the government had prioritised testing for hospital patients and NHS workers before expanding it to residents and staff in social care. He added some 50,000 NHS workers had been tested so far. However, he said it was ""frustrating"" there was capacity for 10,000 more tests a day than were carried out on Thursday. The government has a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. Eligibility for testing will also be expanded to critical local authority workers, the judiciary and Department for Work and Pensions staff, he said. ""We're able to do that because of the scale-up of testing,"" he added. Mr Hancock said he hoped anyone with symptoms would be able to be tested ""relatively soon"". ""Now we've got the curve under control, I want to be able to get back to the position that we can test everybody with symptoms - and I anticipate being able to do that relatively soon because we're increasing capacity, as I say,"" he said. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, welcomed the expansion of testing. However, he added: ""It is a shame it has come this late, with thousands of firefighters already self-isolating - this is something that could have been easily avoided."" Mr Wrack said there were also issues around how accessible testing was, with many testing centres far out of town. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, told the committee some sick NHS workers were compelled to drive for up to two hours to be tested. Also speaking to the committee, Prof Anthony Costello, the director of University College London's Institute for Global Health, said there could be 40,000 deaths in the UK as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. He said the UK had been ""too slow"" to react on a number of fronts to the crisis which may lead to it having ""probably the highest death rate in Europe"". Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, previously said it would be a ""good outcome""if total UK deaths could be kept below 20,000. Warning that the UK would face ""further waves"" of the virus, Prof Costello said a system needed to be put in place that ""cannot just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory"" but one that reached out at ""district and community level"". Can I get tested? Should we all be wearing face masks now? Are NHS staff getting the protective gear they need? Speaking at the briefing, Sir Patrick said there was beginning to be a ""gradual decrease"" in the number of coronavirus patients in London hospitals and a flattening or decrease in other areas. ""The numbers are not only at a plateau but beginning to come down in some areas and that will translate into fewer people in intensive care in due course,"" he said. ""But do not expect this to be quick. This is not going to be a sudden drop, there will be a plateau - it will take a while for the numbers to come right down and that's why it's important that we continue with the strong social distancing measures that we have in place."" Sir Patrick added that he unfortunately expected the number of coronavirus-related deaths to continue to plateau ""for a little while"" before starting to come down slowly.

"Doctors and nurses in England are to be asked to treat coronavirus patients without fully protective gowns and to reuse equipment due to shortage fears. The decision came in a reversal of guidance to hospitals from Public Health England on Friday. Earlier this week, the BBC reportedthe plan was being considered as a ""last resort"". It comes as NHS Providers warned some hospitals' supplies could run out in 24 hours. Chris Hopson, head of the association, which represents healthcare trusts across England,said in a tweet,external: ""We have now reached the point where the national stock of fully fluid repellent gowns and long-sleeved laboratory coats will be exhausted in the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours."" He said that national leaders have left ""no stone unturned"" - but gowns that were ordered weeks ago are currently only arriving in ""fits and starts"". Public Health England changed its guidance, which until now required long-sleeved, disposable, fluid-repellent gowns for people treating Covid-19 patients. Now it says if these gowns are not available, staff can wear washable medical gowns or non-fluid-repellent equipment. Documents seen by the BBC said the measures were considered earlier this week to cope with ""acute supply shortages"" It comes as the UK recorded 847 new coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals on Thursday, taking the total to 14,576. Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Unions seeing coronavirus PPE 'horror stories' A Department of Health spokesman said: ""New clinical advice has been issued today to make sure that if there are shortages in one area, frontline staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk."" And Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he ""would love to be able to wave a magic wand"" to increase supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). ""But given that we have a global situation in which there is less PPE in the world than the world needs, obviously it's going to be a huge pressure point,"" he told a virtual committee of MPs. Mr Hancock admitted the supply of gowns was ""tight"" but said he was aiming to get enough gowns to staff this weekend.

"There have been UK protests about the lack of PPE for nursing staff The health secretary has said that thousands of pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) will arrive in the UK on Friday as the government faces criticism over shortages. Matt Hancock said that 55,000 more gowns were due to arrive, but admitted there was ""a huge challenge"". He added: ""We are tight on gowns and that is the pressure point."" The government has been criticised for not providing enough PPE for healthcare workers during the coronavirus crisis. An earlier version of this story reported that a director of a large NHS trust had contacted the BBC with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff. The person concerned is not a director of a trust - the BBC has since been told he is currently part of a network of organisations helping to source PPE for some NHS trusts during the pandemic. For a number of weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and government ministers have said during press briefings and interviews that firms including Burberry will begin making personal protective equipment on behalf of the government as one of the answers to a critical shortage. Asked about the PPE produced by such manufacturers, Mr Hancock praised the ""national effort"" but urged more companies to come forward. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Hancock said on Friday that PPE was a ""precious resource"" and that maintaining supplies was challenging due to the ""very high"" global demand. Latest statistics revealed the UK recorded another 861 coronavirus-related deaths in hospital, taking the total to 13,729. The overall figure does not include hundreds more who have died in residential and nursing homes. On Thursday, as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension of lockdown restrictions for ""at least"" another three weeks, he said there remained ""issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes"". Among five conditions he said must be met before curbs on daily life could be lifted were making sure the NHS could cope and ensuring PPE supplies could meet demand. In other developments: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have acknowledged the coronavirus pandemic is""stressful"" for many, and urged people to look after their mental health. Prince William also praised NHS workers, saying they were making the nation proud with their ""stoicism and determination"" People struggling with payday loans, car finance and pawn shop borrowing will begranted a payment holiday under plans by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak first began, has raised its death toll by 50% - equal to 1,290 cases - attributing it to updated reporting and more deaths from outside hospitals being counted Meanwhile, China, the world's second biggest economy, has reportedits worst economic performance in decades as the impact of the virus hits, with its GDP figures for the first quarter of 2020 showing its economy shrank 6.8% US President Donald Trump has issued guidance to governors for how they may gradually ease their state lockdown measures as part of his""Opening up America Again"" plan Last week, Mr Hancock said there was ""enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance"", adding there was a ""huge task"" to make sure those who need it get it. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. Has the NHS got enough PPE? 'Last resort' plans revealed for PPE reuse by health workers 'Herculean effort' to provide NHS protective gear The shortage of non-surgical gowns is a critical problem facing the NHS as it struggles to secure enough kit for frontline staff. A leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a ""last resort"". This video can not be played For a fourth week, people clap to show appreciation for health professionals and other key workers As the world fights coronavirus, the demand for gowns is at levels never seen before. Almost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East. These decisions have been driven by cost, as all sectors seek the cheapest prices. But as every country in the world fights for finite supplies, a UK solution has been sought. The government and management consultancy Deloitte approached well known UK garment brands asking if they could help make PPE. They also requested that UK manufacturers complete a survey to share what they could make. Earlier this week, Barbour began distributing gowns from its factory in the north-east of England. Burberry is still making the final adjustments to its factory and production is expected to start next week. Getting a supply chain formalised using UK factories has been difficult. UK garment factories approached by the BBC have said the government does not fully understand what is possible in the UK, and which firms could produce what. This lack of understanding has caused production delays. Delays around certification of gowns for use is also slowing down the manufacturing process. Some factories say it could be another two weeks before the necessary paperwork is signed off and they can manufacture the gowns. This comes as factories around the UK are empty. Machinists and pattern cutters have been sent home and furloughed. To add to the frustration of factory bosses, they say they're getting upsetting calls from NHS hospitals and workers begging for gowns. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Adequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic."" Nearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said. ""There is also a 24-hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report supply disruption. ""We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need and it is crucial the guidance for protective equipment is followed closely,"" the spokesman added. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that a director of a large NHS trust had contacted the BBC with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff. The person concerned is not a director of a trust - the BBC has since been told he is currently part of a network of organisations helping to source personal protective equipment for some NHS trusts during the pandemic.

"The jackpot winner will scoop Â£57.8m once the ticket is verified A Euromillions player in South Ayrshire has made a claim for a Â£57.8m jackpot. An appeal was issued last monthafter the winning ticket went unclaimed. But National Lottery operator Camelot has confirmed a claim has now been made. The winner matched all five main numbers and the two Lucky Stars in the draw on Tuesday 17 March. The winning numbers were 05, 07, 08, 16 and 20, with the Lucky Stars 02 and 12. The claim is going through the validation process before any payment can be made. Once the ticket has been validated and the money paid out, it is up to the winner to decide whether to go public with the Â£57,869,670 jackpot. Camelot's Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, said: ""It is fantastic news that a lucky ticket-holder has now claimed this enormous prize. We will now focus on supporting the ticket-holder through the process. ""During the current crisis, we'd like to encourage as many players as possible to check their tickets and play online or on the National Lottery app, and to only buy their tickets in retail or claim a retail prize if they are already in-store to do an essential shop.""

"The Chinese city of Wuhan recently lifted its strict quarantine measures The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus originated last year, has raised its official Covid-19 death toll by 50%, adding 1,290 fatalities. Wuhan officials attributed the new figure to updated reporting and deaths outside hospitals. China has insisted there was no cover-up. It has been accused of downplaying the severity of its virus outbreak. Wuhan's 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions, which have only recently been eased. The latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in China's central Hubei province to 3,869, increasing the national total to more than 4,600. China has confirmed nearly 84,000 coronavirus infections, the seventh-highest globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The virus has had a huge impact on the Chinese economy, which shrank for the first time in decades in the first quarter of the year. Follow our live reporting from around the world Why China's claims of success raise eyebrows In a statement released on Friday, officials in Wuhan said the revised figures were the result of new data received from multiple sources, including records kept by funeral homes and prisons. Deaths linked to the virus outside hospitals, such as people who died at home, had not previously been recorded. This video can not be played Learn how Wuhan dealt with the lockdown The ""statistical verification"" followed efforts by authorities to ""ensure that information on the city's Covid-19 epidemic is open, transparent and the data [is] accurate"", the statement said. It added that health systems were initially overwhelmed and cases were ""mistakenly reported"" - in some instances counted more than once and in others missed entirely. A shortage of testing capacity in the early stages meant that many infected patients were not accounted for, it said. A spokesman for China's National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said the new death count came from a ""comprehensive review"" of epidemic data. In its daily news conference, the foreign ministry said accusations of a cover-up, which have been made most stridently on the world stage by US President Donald Trump, were unsubstantiated. ""We'll never allow any concealment,"" a spokesman said. Friday's revised figures come amid growing international concern that deaths in China have been under-reported. Questions have also been raised about Beijing's handling of the epidemic, particularly in its early stages. In December 2019, Chinese authorities launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia after cases began circulating in Wuhan. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health China reported the cases to the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN's global health agency, on 31 December. But WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases. The mayor of Wuhan has previously admitted there was a lack of action between the start of January - when about 100 cases had been confirmed - and 23 January, when city-wide restrictions were enacted. Around that time, a doctor who tried to warn his colleagues about an outbreak of a Sars-like virus was silenced by the authorities. Dr Li Wenlianglater died from Covid-19. Wuhan's death toll increase of almost exactly 50% has left some analysts wondering if this is all a bit too neat. For months questions have been asked about the veracity of China's official coronavirus statistics. The inference has been that some Chinese officials may have deliberately under-reported deaths and infections to give the impression that cities and towns were successfully managing the emergency. If that was the case, Chinese officials were not to know just how bad this crisis would get in other countries, making its own figures now seem implausibly small. The authorities in Wuhan, where the first cluster of this disease was reported, said there had been no deliberate misrepresentation of data, rather that a stabilisation in the emergency had allowed them time to revisit the reported cases and to add any previously missed. That the new death toll was released at the same time as a press conference announcing a total collapse in China's economic growth figures has led some to wonder whether this was a deliberate attempt to bury one or other of these stories. Then again, it could also be a complete coincidence. China has been pushing back against US suggestions that the coronavirus came from a laboratory studying infectious diseases in Wuhan, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington DC reports. US President Donald Trump and some of his officials have been flirting with the outlier theory in the midst of a propaganda war with China over the origin and handling of the pandemic, our correspondent says. Mr Trump this week halted funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing it of making deadly mistakes and overly trusting China. The WHO row, explained ""Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?"" Mr Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. French PresidentEmmanuel Macron has also questioned China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, saying it was ""naive"" to suggest the country had dealt better with the crisis, adding things ""happened that we don't know about"". On Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We'll have to ask the hard questions about how [coronavirus] came about and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier."" But China has also been praised for its handling of the crisis and the unprecedented restrictions that it instituted to slow the spread of the virus. WHO Director GeneralDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has hailed Chinafor the ""speed with which [it] detected the outbreak"" and its ""commitment to transparency"".

However, it is still uncertain whether the jab will work as the first patients are not expected to take part in trials until next week.

However, it is still uncertain whether the jab will work as the first patients are not expected to take part in trials until next week. Most argue it will take between 12 and 18 months before there is a vaccine that can be widely administered. Separately the government has announced it has formed a vaccine taskforce to accelerate the development of a working vaccine. As chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, Jeremy Hunt has called for an increase in virus testing and contact tracing. He said contact tracing could be trialled in places such as Yorkshire or Cornwall today ""because those are parts of the country which have relatively few Covid cases"". He said testing and contact tracing might offer a way out of the lockdown. ""That really has to be the next step,"" the former health secretary added. A painting of a 99-year-old war veteran who has raised more than Â£19m for the NHS has appeared on a wall in Pontefract. Captain Tom Moore, originally from Keighley, raised millions of pounds by completing 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. The mural was painted on the wall of the Malt Shovel, in Cornmarket, earlier by artist Rachel List. She said: ""When I saw what Capt Tom had done I just thought it was amazing. It's going to be talked about in 10 and 20 years time and I felt it needed documenting.""

"Norman Hunter won the league title with Leeds in 1969 and 1974 Leeds United great Norman Hunter has died in hospital aged 76 after contracting coronavirus. The tough-tackling centre-back, nicknamed 'Bites Yer Legs', was a key player in Leeds' most successful era. He won two league titles during a 14-year first-team career at Elland Road, and was a non-playing member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad. Hunter was admitted to hospital on 10 April after testing positive for coronavirus. Former Leeds team-mate Eddie Gray said Hunter was an ""iconic figure"" at the club. ""He was a truly great player,"" Gray, 72, told the BBC. ""I don't think people realise because of the 'Bites Yer Legs', it took away from his actual ability as a player. ""He never got as many caps as he deserved because of the great Bobby Moore, but he was as good as any defender that played the game."" Leeds said the defender's death leaves ""a huge hole"" in the family of the club. ""His legacy will never be forgotten and our thoughts are with Norman's family and friends at this very difficult time,"" the Yorkshire club saidin a statement.,external Obituary: Hunter 'a man of steel who could also produce silk' This video can not be played Eddie Gray pays tribute to 'truly great' Leeds team-mate Norman Hunter Hunter joined Leeds aged 15 and went on to play 726 matches in all competitions for the club - the fourth-highest individual total in their history. As an integral part of Don Revie's famous side, Hunter won the First Division title in 1969 and 1974, helped them beat Arsenal in the 1968 League Cup final, and then returned to Wembley in 1972 as Leeds defeated the Gunners to win the FA Cup. He also played in the 1975 European Cup final defeat by Bayern Munich in Paris - a year after Revie left to manage England - but he did taste European success as Leeds won the now-defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1968 and 1971. Speaking in 2013, when he announced he was selling his Leeds memorabilia at auction, Hunter said his one regret from his time playing for the club was that he never lifted the European Cup. ""Someone asked me if I was selling my shirt from that game [against Bayern] but I honestly don't know where it is,"" he added. ""I was that upset that I don't know what I did with it. ""Medals don't mean much to me. For me it was about being at Leeds United and playing with that group of players and staff. ""It was magic."" Although a member of the squad, Hunter did not play during England's triumphant 1966 World Cup campaign, with their central defensive partnership formed by Jack Charlton - his Leeds team-mate - and captain Bobby Moore. The England national team said they were ""extremely saddened"" by Hunter's death and that ""all of our thoughts are with his family, friends and supporters"". After leaving Leeds in 1976, Hunter also played for Bristol City and Barnsley, managing the Tykes and Rotherham after he retired from playing. The Professional Footballers' Association said: ""Football has lost a legend and we join the entire football community in mourning this loss."" Norman Hunter also won the FA Cup and League Cup with Leeds England World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst:""Enormously shocked and saddened to hear the awful news about my friend Norman Hunter, he will be very sadly missed. My heartfelt thoughts are with his wife, Sue, his family and the England and Leeds United fans, a huge part of the 1966-70 England squad back in the day."" Former England captain Gary Lineker:Grew up watching that great Leeds side of which Norman Hunter was a huge part. This awful virus was one crunching tackle too far but he'll be biting yer legs somewhere. RIP. Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton on BBC Radio 5 Live:""Norman always had a laugh. He was very professional, a hard worker and someone who was good to have around in the squad. ""He was somebody you never liked playing against because he did let players know he was around. He was a great player. He had a lot more than just being a tough man."" Former Leeds defender Danny Mills on BBC Radio 5 Live:""He loved Leeds like nothing else. It's incredibly sad that he won't get to see Leeds promoted back to the Premier League. ""His knowledge of football was immense. He could be critical of the players and the team but he did it in a charming way. He could be critical but never offended anybody."" Former England defender Casey Stoney:""I was extremely privileged to sit next to Norman at a PFA awards a couple of years ago and he was one of the nicest, warmest and friendliest men I've met. He shared stories that were amazing to hear and was so kind to me and I was just a stranger."" BBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter Ian Dennis:""I worked with Norman Hunter at BBC Radio Leeds.

"The boss of the Bank of England has said that emergency lending to businesses ""has to be sorted out"" amid the coronavirus pandemic. Governor Andrew Bailey questioned whether the system is ""too complicated"" as banks struggle to cope with applications. Mr Bailey said that banks must now ""dig in"" with processing risk assessments. He added that the government-backed scheme had taken longer to get into full operation than expected. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in March that UK-based small and medium-sized business could apply for an interest-free loan of up to Â£5m to help them with Covid-19 related difficulties. However, the British Chambers of Commerce said on Wednesday that only 2% of UK firms had so far secured the loans. ""Notwithstanding the stress that we're all operating under in terms of the current working environment, they [the banks] have got to put their backs into it and get on with it, frankly,"" Mr Bailey said on Friday. Mr Bailey also said that the chancellor and HM Treasury had to make a decision on whether or not the taxpayer gives 100% backing for the loan scheme. Currently, the government guarantees 80% of the loan amount to give banks and financial companies the confidence to lend. Banks and financial institutions have lent more than Â£1.1bn to those enterprises under the government's coronavirus loan scheme, according to the latest figures released by UK Finance on Wednesday. More than 6,000 loans have now been provided, with an average value of about Â£185,000. On Thursday it was announced loansto large firms would also be included in the government's Â£330bn economic support package. The scheme is part of government efforts to help keep the UK economy afloat as it is battered by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. During the phone call with journalists on Friday, Mr Bailey also addressed the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast, which expects GDP to drop by 35% in the three months to June. He said that such a scenario was ""not implausible"". The Bank of England has also slashed interest rates to a new low and freed up billions of pounds to help consumers and banks through the crisis.

"Andy Shaw (left) and his business partner Jake say their firm is at risk Andy Shaw, 57, has built up a painting and decorating firm with his brother-in-law Jake, but has now seen work dry up owing to the coronavirus lockdown. ""We could come out of this with no business or savings, it would be absolutely devastating,"" he says. Why? Because the business is a limited company and the duo are company directors who pay themselves in dividends. Like hundreds of thousands of people running their businesses the same way, they will get little or no state support. His firm has been able to furlough, or put on state-paid leave, its two full-time members of staff to take off some of the pressure. But he and Jake will personally be eligible for much less, as they pay themselves in dividends, which the government will not cover. ""We can furlough ourselves for the small basic salaries we take, but that will only leave us with Â£600 a month, which doesn't cover my outgoings at all,"" says Andy, from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. By furloughing themselves, they would not be allowed to work on anything that brings in money for the business, only organisational work as a director. ""It means we won't be able to work at a time when our business is on the brink,"" he says. There is a real prospect he might have to shut up shop and lay off his staff. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Turning from a sole trader into a limited company has been popular in the past, with small business owners - from marketing agents to milkmen - becoming company directors and using the professional-sounding title that comes with it. Historically, it saved on their tax bill, although that benefit has been considerably watered down in recent times. For many, the attraction was to separate personal finances from that of the business and to protect themselves as individuals if something went wrong with a supplier or customer. Even that benefit can be reduced if, for example, banks still require the business owner's home as collateral for a loan. Like so many businesses, they are now facing difficulties in the light of the coronavirus restrictions, and the choice of becoming a limited company looks set to be an expensive one. The government has said it will pay 80% of employed and self-employed workers' incomes, up to Â£2,500 a month, for three months if they are furloughed. But it will not cover dividends, because it says there is no way of telling whether people have received them in lieu of wages or as a return on capital in their own company or an investment. Coronavirus: 'I lost my job, now we're on the bare minimum' What help will self-employed get from government? This means people such as Andy and Jake, who pay themselves mostly in dividends, say that typically furlough pay - covering 80% of what they pay themselves as a salary - would typically give them about Â£585 per month, making it difficult to put food on the table after business and personal bills are paid. Campaigners point out that most company directors are not especially wealthy, with many running small firms or operating by themselves. ""These are real, hard-working people who have built up successful businesses and paid taxes all their lives, who now find themselves facing hardship with little of the current support available for them,"" says Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. Some 327,000 people havesigned a petition,externalcalling on the government to change course. One remedy, they argue, is for dividend income to be included in the calculations for furlough, rather than only a salary. Although the small business ministerhas offered some support,external, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is open to ideas, there is no plan from the Treasury to change its policy as yet. ""Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures,"" a Treasury spokeswoman says, including income tax referrals and mortgage holidays. Nick Steele, 46, is one of many who say they set up as a limited company on the encouragement of one government, only now to be treated inferiorly by another. He and his partner have run a hospitality recruitment company in Gloucestershire since 2006, but since the epidemic hit, all of their work has evaporated. Nick Steele is one of those affected by the shutdown in the hospitality sector ""Back then, I think they thought it was more controllable and easier to tax limited companies. Now it seems this government wants to crush us,"" he says. ""I have no choice but to sell personal possessions and borrow money. For the record, I can't get a government grant because I have no premises; I might be able to get a loan, but I don't want to take that risk."" He thinks the government is uninterested in supporting limited company directors because of a perception they pay less tax. But the recruitment professional, who earns about Â£45,000 a year, mainly in dividends, says he pays ""no more or less tax than self-employed or employed people"". He also points out he is not entitled to government subsidised benefits such as statutory sick pay. ""I'm not some high net worth individual, I'm not squirrelling money away. I fill out a tax return every year, it's just that in one column I state my income from PAYE, and in another the income from dividends. ""The government's policy just doesn't stack up."" Sonali Joshi says they are ineligible for various government support measures Sonali Joshi, 45, whose business provides access services to the film industry, such as subtitles and audio descriptions, says she is struggling to make ends meet. ""While we have plenty of ideas of how to reconfigure our business during this difficult time, we need investment to do this and right now we have nothing."" She says they cannot access a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan, according to their bank, because their 2019 turnover was less than Â£100,000. They are also not eligible for a Â£10,000 government grant for small-to-medium sized enterprises that receive rates relief, as they do not have any premises. ""VAT deferral does little for us, since work tailed off weeks ago, as we work internationally and coronavirus began to impact our work much earlier this year. We also do not qualify for universal credit,"" she says. ""We feel let down by the government. We hear the chancellor saying, 'We are all in this together,' and that the UK is a great environment for small business, but it doesn't feel like that now, due to the lack of support.""

"The Chinese city of Wuhan recently lifted its strict quarantine measures The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus originated last year, has raised its official Covid-19 death toll by 50%, adding 1,290 fatalities. Wuhan officials attributed the new figure to updated reporting and deaths outside hospitals. China has insisted there was no cover-up. It has been accused of downplaying the severity of its virus outbreak. Wuhan's 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions, which have only recently been eased. The latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in China's central Hubei province to 3,869, increasing the national total to more than 4,600. China has confirmed nearly 84,000 coronavirus infections, the seventh-highest globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The virus has had a huge impact on the Chinese economy, which shrank for the first time in decades in the first quarter of the year. Follow our live reporting from around the world Why China's claims of success raise eyebrows In a statement released on Friday, officials in Wuhan said the revised figures were the result of new data received from multiple sources, including records kept by funeral homes and prisons. Deaths linked to the virus outside hospitals, such as people who died at home, had not previously been recorded. This video can not be played Learn how Wuhan dealt with the lockdown The ""statistical verification"" followed efforts by authorities to ""ensure that information on the city's Covid-19 epidemic is open, transparent and the data [is] accurate"", the statement said. It added that health systems were initially overwhelmed and cases were ""mistakenly reported"" - in some instances counted more than once and in others missed entirely. A shortage of testing capacity in the early stages meant that many infected patients were not accounted for, it said. A spokesman for China's National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said the new death count came from a ""comprehensive review"" of epidemic data. In its daily news conference, the foreign ministry said accusations of a cover-up, which have been made most stridently on the world stage by US President Donald Trump, were unsubstantiated. ""We'll never allow any concealment,"" a spokesman said. Friday's revised figures come amid growing international concern that deaths in China have been under-reported. Questions have also been raised about Beijing's handling of the epidemic, particularly in its early stages. In December 2019, Chinese authorities launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia after cases began circulating in Wuhan. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health China reported the cases to the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN's global health agency, on 31 December. But WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases. The mayor of Wuhan has previously admitted there was a lack of action between the start of January - when about 100 cases had been confirmed - and 23 January, when city-wide restrictions were enacted. Around that time, a doctor who tried to warn his colleagues about an outbreak of a Sars-like virus was silenced by the authorities. Dr Li Wenlianglater died from Covid-19. Wuhan's death toll increase of almost exactly 50% has left some analysts wondering if this is all a bit too neat. For months questions have been asked about the veracity of China's official coronavirus statistics. The inference has been that some Chinese officials may have deliberately under-reported deaths and infections to give the impression that cities and towns were successfully managing the emergency. If that was the case, Chinese officials were not to know just how bad this crisis would get in other countries, making its own figures now seem implausibly small. The authorities in Wuhan, where the first cluster of this disease was reported, said there had been no deliberate misrepresentation of data, rather that a stabilisation in the emergency had allowed them time to revisit the reported cases and to add any previously missed. That the new death toll was released at the same time as a press conference announcing a total collapse in China's economic growth figures has led some to wonder whether this was a deliberate attempt to bury one or other of these stories. Then again, it could also be a complete coincidence. China has been pushing back against US suggestions that the coronavirus came from a laboratory studying infectious diseases in Wuhan, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington DC reports. US President Donald Trump and some of his officials have been flirting with the outlier theory in the midst of a propaganda war with China over the origin and handling of the pandemic, our correspondent says. Mr Trump this week halted funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing it of making deadly mistakes and overly trusting China. The WHO row, explained ""Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?"" Mr Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. French PresidentEmmanuel Macron has also questioned China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, saying it was ""naive"" to suggest the country had dealt better with the crisis, adding things ""happened that we don't know about"". On Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We'll have to ask the hard questions about how [coronavirus] came about and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier."" But China has also been praised for its handling of the crisis and the unprecedented restrictions that it instituted to slow the spread of the virus. WHO Director GeneralDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has hailed Chinafor the ""speed with which [it] detected the outbreak"" and its ""commitment to transparency"".

"Premier League football has been suspended since 13 March Finishing the season in a 40-day window was one of the scenarios discussed at a Premier League meeting on Friday. Top-flight clubs remain committed to playing all 92 remaining fixtures this season but did not discuss a deadline by which action must resume. Clubs were expected to debate a 30 June deadlineto end the seasonbut instead discussed ""possible scheduling models"". The Premier League said it ""remains our objective"" to complete matches but currently ""all dates are tentative"". The league has been suspended since 13 March because of coronavirus. It is understood some clubs expected to discuss the proposed 30 June deadline at Friday's meeting but it was decided this was not the right time to do so. A Premier League spokesperson said ""in common with other businesses and industries"" clubs were ""working through complex planning scenarios"". ""Today's shareholders' meeting provided an opportunity to discuss possible scheduling models,"" it added. ""It remains our objective to complete the 2019-20 season but at this stage all dates are tentative while the impact of Covid-19 develops."" Sixteen of the 20 Premier League teams have nine games to play, with four having 10 left. Earlier this month the Premier League said play will only resume when""it is safe and appropriate to do so"".The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK has since risen to more than 12,000. On Thursday, the government issued a further three-week lockdown to ensure social distancing and manage the spread of the virus. BBC sports editor Dan Roan has learned Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden spoke to Premier League bosses this week and signalled the government was content for them to start contingency planning. But nothing will be taken forward without the green light from the government, in accordance with medical advice. In a section on player welfare at the meeting, it was decided tests for coronavirus would have to be widely available to the public before the widespread testing of players. When and how football resumes has been widely debated across the sport as clubs face up to financial difficulties and the logistical issues caused by a late finish to the season. The contracts of numerous players expire on 30 June, including those of Chelsea midfielder Willian and Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen. If the season is extended beyond that date there is a possibility clubs will lose players before fixtures are concluded. World governing body Fifa is aware of the problem and is looking at alternatives such as rolling contract extensions. The 30 June date is also an issue for clubs around agreed changes in kit manufacturers. Liverpool are due to change shirt manufacturers from New Balance to Nike, while Watford and Newcastle are also set to use new suppliers. In a BBC Sport vote on how the season should be dealt with39% of respondents wanted to 'declare the season null and void', with 28% opting to 'finish the season no matter how long it takes'. Uefa has pleaded for leagues to give them time to return with their own proposals for ending the season across Europe. European football's governing body will meet next week to further discuss plans which include potentially using the Champions League finalto end the 2019-20 season on 29 August. Lower down the football pyramid in England, the EFL has sent a letter to clubs recommending they return to training on 16 May at the earliest. The EFL has not discussed a league restart date with the government but told clubs: ""Our planning needs to be agile enough to allow us to be as prepared as possible for a start at relatively short notice."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone In the end, the 30 June deadline demand some were so keen to push earlier in the week was never raised. The feeling that today's meeting was not the right time to widen the debate and the Premier League desire for a united front was strong enough to dissuade a discussion that would have extended the chat, which was wrapped up in under two hours. Individual clubs will go away to continue discussions with players about wage cuts and deferrals and wait to see what comes out of two Uefa meetings next week. Before their next scheduled meeting on 1 May, lessons should also be absorbed from Germany. Some Bundesliga players have already returned to their clubs for training under social distancing rules - getting changed at home and returning to shower after picking up some food. A Bundesliga meeting on Thursday will offer guidance on if and when this can be stepped up following the revised regulations announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. It will start to offer the Premier League some kind of clarity over the major discussions today, which centred around different start and end dates to play the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign. At the moment, it is felt eight weeks will be enough from returning to training in order to regain match fitness and play nine rounds of games to complete the season. Germany's experience will help frame whether that prospect is a realistic one. In the meantime, as has been the case since matches were first called off five weeks ago, the only certainty is uncertainty. The body that represents Europe's top leagues says when football does return itwill ""no doubt"" be played behind closed doors. At present, the state of play in the continent's top leagues is: Germany's Bundesliga:Clubs have returned to training but the season is still suspended until 30 April. Spain's La Liga:There will be no training until emergency measures in place are lifted and La Liga president Javier Tebas says resuming play on 28 May is a best-case scenario.

"The Chinese city of Wuhan recently lifted its strict quarantine measures The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus originated last year, has raised its official Covid-19 death toll by 50%, adding 1,290 fatalities. Wuhan officials attributed the new figure to updated reporting and deaths outside hospitals. China has insisted there was no cover-up. It has been accused of downplaying the severity of its virus outbreak. Wuhan's 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions, which have only recently been eased. The latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in China's central Hubei province to 3,869, increasing the national total to more than 4,600. China has confirmed nearly 84,000 coronavirus infections, the seventh-highest globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The virus has had a huge impact on the Chinese economy, which shrank for the first time in decades in the first quarter of the year. Follow our live reporting from around the world Why China's claims of success raise eyebrows In a statement released on Friday, officials in Wuhan said the revised figures were the result of new data received from multiple sources, including records kept by funeral homes and prisons. Deaths linked to the virus outside hospitals, such as people who died at home, had not previously been recorded. This video can not be played Learn how Wuhan dealt with the lockdown The ""statistical verification"" followed efforts by authorities to ""ensure that information on the city's Covid-19 epidemic is open, transparent and the data [is] accurate"", the statement said. It added that health systems were initially overwhelmed and cases were ""mistakenly reported"" - in some instances counted more than once and in others missed entirely. A shortage of testing capacity in the early stages meant that many infected patients were not accounted for, it said. A spokesman for China's National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said the new death count came from a ""comprehensive review"" of epidemic data. In its daily news conference, the foreign ministry said accusations of a cover-up, which have been made most stridently on the world stage by US President Donald Trump, were unsubstantiated. ""We'll never allow any concealment,"" a spokesman said. Friday's revised figures come amid growing international concern that deaths in China have been under-reported. Questions have also been raised about Beijing's handling of the epidemic, particularly in its early stages. In December 2019, Chinese authorities launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia after cases began circulating in Wuhan. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health China reported the cases to the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN's global health agency, on 31 December. But WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases. The mayor of Wuhan has previously admitted there was a lack of action between the start of January - when about 100 cases had been confirmed - and 23 January, when city-wide restrictions were enacted. Around that time, a doctor who tried to warn his colleagues about an outbreak of a Sars-like virus was silenced by the authorities. Dr Li Wenlianglater died from Covid-19. Wuhan's death toll increase of almost exactly 50% has left some analysts wondering if this is all a bit too neat. For months questions have been asked about the veracity of China's official coronavirus statistics. The inference has been that some Chinese officials may have deliberately under-reported deaths and infections to give the impression that cities and towns were successfully managing the emergency. If that was the case, Chinese officials were not to know just how bad this crisis would get in other countries, making its own figures now seem implausibly small. The authorities in Wuhan, where the first cluster of this disease was reported, said there had been no deliberate misrepresentation of data, rather that a stabilisation in the emergency had allowed them time to revisit the reported cases and to add any previously missed. That the new death toll was released at the same time as a press conference announcing a total collapse in China's economic growth figures has led some to wonder whether this was a deliberate attempt to bury one or other of these stories. Then again, it could also be a complete coincidence. China has been pushing back against US suggestions that the coronavirus came from a laboratory studying infectious diseases in Wuhan, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington DC reports. US President Donald Trump and some of his officials have been flirting with the outlier theory in the midst of a propaganda war with China over the origin and handling of the pandemic, our correspondent says. Mr Trump this week halted funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing it of making deadly mistakes and overly trusting China. The WHO row, explained ""Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?"" Mr Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. French PresidentEmmanuel Macron has also questioned China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, saying it was ""naive"" to suggest the country had dealt better with the crisis, adding things ""happened that we don't know about"". On Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We'll have to ask the hard questions about how [coronavirus] came about and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier."" But China has also been praised for its handling of the crisis and the unprecedented restrictions that it instituted to slow the spread of the virus. WHO Director GeneralDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has hailed Chinafor the ""speed with which [it] detected the outbreak"" and its ""commitment to transparency"".

"How do you co-ordinate economic policy across the globe, when an invisible enemy that behaves in unknown ways systematically erodes the very way economies function? That is the tricky challenge facing the relatively new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, who sat down with me to discuss this in her first British broadcast interview. The IMF is now a fire fighting service battling multiple infernos, almost everywhere. This discussion was meant to take place face to face at the IMF's annual meetings in Washington DC. But for obvious reasons, those meetings became virtual, as did my interview with her. First up, a refreshing admission. Just three months ago, the IMF's January economic forecast update projected that the base unit of living standards - the per person size of the economy or GDP per capita - would be going up in 160 countries. That would have meant 82% of nations becoming better off in 2020. 'World faces worst decline since 1930s depression' IMF provides $50bn to fight coronavirus outbreak Now, in April, because of Covid-19, she says: ""We are projecting 170 countries to see income per capita shrinking during 2020"" - 87% of the atlas of the world. And yet this detail - which is part of a broader forecast that sees world GDP dive 3% in 2020, creating ""a global recession we have not seen in our lifetimes"" - may not be the end of it. ""I want to stress this may be actually a more optimistic picture than reality produces,"" Ms Georgieva told the BBC. ""Epidemiologists are now helping us making macroeconomic projections. Never in the history of the IMF have we had that. And what they're telling us is that the novel coronavirus is a big unknown, and we don't know whether it may return in 2021."" It is small wonder that the IMF is in rescue mode. The organisation traditionally tasked with being a fiscal watchdog and ambulance for the world now has a rather different message - that the priority everywhere has to be lives and livelihoods. ""It is the time that governments should spend as much as they can afford and more, but keep the receipts. We don't want to lose accountability and transparency during this crisis,"" Ms Georgieva says. ""We will see some countries being able to do more, and actually, the UK has already done quite a lot. And we will see some countries that will need more help because they have much more limited capacity to act. And this is where the IMF and other international financial institutions come into play."" Coronavirus is a ""big unknown"", says Kristalina Georgieva In these times of ultra-low interest rates, she says, the IMF can help countries to get more ammunition to fight the health crisis, but also to deal with the economic fallout. ""We need to target support to the most vulnerable people in the most vulnerable parts of the economy,"" Ms Georgieva says. Interventions now will help spur a rapid bounce-back in growth and reduce permanent economic scars. But despite the depth and breadth of the downturn, she is very cautious about prematurely lifting shutdowns around the world. ""Saving lives and saving livelihoods go hand in hand with stopping the pandemic. We simply cannot restart the economy to the fullest, and without restarting the economy, finance ministers are not going to have the revenues they need, including for their health services,"" Ms Georgieva says. ""So we have to, of course, listen to the health professionals and design protocols that allow us over time to reopen segments of the economy and do that cautiously. We have to then carefully calibrate how we're doing this reopening."" She suggests that automated factories and rural areas might be easier to reopen, but there is still some ""figuring out"" to do around reopening busy cities and towns. Ms Georgieva warns against what has been dubbed ""pandemic protectionism"", where some advanced countries have sat on medical equipment and pharmaceutical supplies for use domestically. ""It's a very simple message - you cannot beat the virus unless you beat it everywhere. When one country is suffering from an epidemic, then it makes sense to be protective and keep what the country needs domestically. ""But when we are all hit by an epidemic... we need to act together. And we would very much encourage countries to actually integrate their capabilities rather than trying to keep it each one for itself."" But her central message is to look beyond the understandable concern for what is happening in the world's advanced nations, to the problems facing poorer ones. The G20's decision to suspend debt repayments from the world's most deprived countries was a start, but she says we must remain mindful. ""Poor countries in the world are hit multiple times. They're hit by the the pandemic. They're hit by the spillover from economic contraction elsewhere. They're hit by the flight to safety,"" Ms Georgieva says. ""$100bn has left emerging markets in developing countries just in two months, much more than during the global financial crisis. They're hit because remittances are drying up. And those that are commodity exporters are hit by prices of their exports dropping."" She says ""lifelines"" are needed now for such countries, such as the debt standstill which would free billions for health services. ""We need each other. It is a moment testing our humanity and being together acting with solidarity. We will get to the other side of this."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"People struggling with payday loans, car finance and pawn shop borrowing will be granted a payment holiday under plans by the City watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the measures would help borrowers who are experiencing money problems amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The FCA wants motor finance firms to grant a three-month freeze. It is also asking firms specialising in rent-to-own, buy-now-pay-later and pawnbroking loans to delay repayments. More newly-hired staff will get paid 'I lost my job, now we're on the bare minimum' You can't just stop paying rent, tenants told Those people with a payday loan will be given a one-month reprieveunder the FCA's plan,external. Last week, the watchdog announced a three-month freeze on loan and credit card repayments. ""We are very aware of the continued struggle people are facing as a result of the pandemic,"" said the FCA's interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard. ""These measures build on the interventions we announced last week and will provide much-needed relief to consumers during these difficult times."" The FCA will consult with finance firms and expects to finalise proposals by 24 April, ""with them coming into force shortly afterwards"". Motor finance companies have been asked not to repossess cars or end loan agreements with customers who are ""experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus"". The FCA also said companies should not alter contracts in an ""unfair"" way, such as using the temporary fall in car prices caused by the pandemic to change the so-called balloon payment expected at the end of an agreement. Meanwhile, pawnbrokers have been advised not to sell items that struggling customers have borrowed against. The FCA said: ""If the firm has already informed the consumer they intend to sell the item, they should suspend the sale during the payment freeze."" The watchdog said the proposed freeze on payday loan repayment was a shorter one-month period because it ""reflects both the much shorter length of most loans and, given interest rates tend to be higher than for other high-cost credit products, prevents firms from accruing additional interest during the freeze period"". But Sara Williams, an adviser who runs the blog Debt Camel, questioned why there was a difference in the length of payment holidays for different types of loans. ""I think these proposals are disappointing,"" she said. ""It's good that interest has to be stopped, but many people will find a one month break isn't long enough. ""The three month breaks being proposed for car finance and credit cards are both more helpful and more realistic for people with coronavirus problems."" However, she added: ""One month is better than nothing so if you need help phone up and ask for it."" Mr Woolard said: ""We have tailored our measures to specific products. For most of these proposals, firms and consumers should consider the amount of interest which may build up, and balance this against the need for immediate temporary support. ""If a payment freeze isn't in the customer's interests, firms should offer an alternative solution, potentially including the waiving of interest and charges or rescheduling the term of the loan.""

"Andy Shaw (left) and his business partner Jake say their firm is at risk Andy Shaw, 57, has built up a painting and decorating firm with his brother-in-law Jake, but has now seen work dry up owing to the coronavirus lockdown. ""We could come out of this with no business or savings, it would be absolutely devastating,"" he says. Why? Because the business is a limited company and the duo are company directors who pay themselves in dividends. Like hundreds of thousands of people running their businesses the same way, they will get little or no state support. His firm has been able to furlough, or put on state-paid leave, its two full-time members of staff to take off some of the pressure. But he and Jake will personally be eligible for much less, as they pay themselves in dividends, which the government will not cover. ""We can furlough ourselves for the small basic salaries we take, but that will only leave us with Â£600 a month, which doesn't cover my outgoings at all,"" says Andy, from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. By furloughing themselves, they would not be allowed to work on anything that brings in money for the business, only organisational work as a director. ""It means we won't be able to work at a time when our business is on the brink,"" he says. There is a real prospect he might have to shut up shop and lay off his staff. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Turning from a sole trader into a limited company has been popular in the past, with small business owners - from marketing agents to milkmen - becoming company directors and using the professional-sounding title that comes with it. Historically, it saved on their tax bill, although that benefit has been considerably watered down in recent times. For many, the attraction was to separate personal finances from that of the business and to protect themselves as individuals if something went wrong with a supplier or customer. Even that benefit can be reduced if, for example, banks still require the business owner's home as collateral for a loan. Like so many businesses, they are now facing difficulties in the light of the coronavirus restrictions, and the choice of becoming a limited company looks set to be an expensive one. The government has said it will pay 80% of employed and self-employed workers' incomes, up to Â£2,500 a month, for three months if they are furloughed. But it will not cover dividends, because it says there is no way of telling whether people have received them in lieu of wages or as a return on capital in their own company or an investment. Coronavirus: 'I lost my job, now we're on the bare minimum' What help will self-employed get from government? This means people such as Andy and Jake, who pay themselves mostly in dividends, say that typically furlough pay - covering 80% of what they pay themselves as a salary - would typically give them about Â£585 per month, making it difficult to put food on the table after business and personal bills are paid. Campaigners point out that most company directors are not especially wealthy, with many running small firms or operating by themselves. ""These are real, hard-working people who have built up successful businesses and paid taxes all their lives, who now find themselves facing hardship with little of the current support available for them,"" says Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. Some 327,000 people havesigned a petition,externalcalling on the government to change course. One remedy, they argue, is for dividend income to be included in the calculations for furlough, rather than only a salary. Although the small business ministerhas offered some support,external, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is open to ideas, there is no plan from the Treasury to change its policy as yet. ""Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures,"" a Treasury spokeswoman says, including income tax referrals and mortgage holidays. Nick Steele, 46, is one of many who say they set up as a limited company on the encouragement of one government, only now to be treated inferiorly by another. He and his partner have run a hospitality recruitment company in Gloucestershire since 2006, but since the epidemic hit, all of their work has evaporated. Nick Steele is one of those affected by the shutdown in the hospitality sector ""Back then, I think they thought it was more controllable and easier to tax limited companies. Now it seems this government wants to crush us,"" he says. ""I have no choice but to sell personal possessions and borrow money. For the record, I can't get a government grant because I have no premises; I might be able to get a loan, but I don't want to take that risk."" He thinks the government is uninterested in supporting limited company directors because of a perception they pay less tax. But the recruitment professional, who earns about Â£45,000 a year, mainly in dividends, says he pays ""no more or less tax than self-employed or employed people"". He also points out he is not entitled to government subsidised benefits such as statutory sick pay. ""I'm not some high net worth individual, I'm not squirrelling money away. I fill out a tax return every year, it's just that in one column I state my income from PAYE, and in another the income from dividends. ""The government's policy just doesn't stack up."" Sonali Joshi says they are ineligible for various government support measures Sonali Joshi, 45, whose business provides access services to the film industry, such as subtitles and audio descriptions, says she is struggling to make ends meet. ""While we have plenty of ideas of how to reconfigure our business during this difficult time, we need investment to do this and right now we have nothing."" She says they cannot access a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan, according to their bank, because their 2019 turnover was less than Â£100,000. They are also not eligible for a Â£10,000 government grant for small-to-medium sized enterprises that receive rates relief, as they do not have any premises. ""VAT deferral does little for us, since work tailed off weeks ago, as we work internationally and coronavirus began to impact our work much earlier this year. We also do not qualify for universal credit,"" she says. ""We feel let down by the government. We hear the chancellor saying, 'We are all in this together,' and that the UK is a great environment for small business, but it doesn't feel like that now, due to the lack of support.""

"Premier League football has been suspended since 13 March Finishing the season in a 40-day window was one of the scenarios discussed at a Premier League meeting on Friday. Top-flight clubs remain committed to playing all 92 remaining fixtures this season but did not discuss a deadline by which action must resume. Clubs were expected to debate a 30 June deadlineto end the seasonbut instead discussed ""possible scheduling models"". The Premier League said it ""remains our objective"" to complete matches but currently ""all dates are tentative"". The league has been suspended since 13 March because of coronavirus. It is understood some clubs expected to discuss the proposed 30 June deadline at Friday's meeting but it was decided this was not the right time to do so. A Premier League spokesperson said ""in common with other businesses and industries"" clubs were ""working through complex planning scenarios"". ""Today's shareholders' meeting provided an opportunity to discuss possible scheduling models,"" it added. ""It remains our objective to complete the 2019-20 season but at this stage all dates are tentative while the impact of Covid-19 develops."" Sixteen of the 20 Premier League teams have nine games to play, with four having 10 left. Earlier this month the Premier League said play will only resume when""it is safe and appropriate to do so"".The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK has since risen to more than 12,000. On Thursday, the government issued a further three-week lockdown to ensure social distancing and manage the spread of the virus. BBC sports editor Dan Roan has learned Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden spoke to Premier League bosses this week and signalled the government was content for them to start contingency planning. But nothing will be taken forward without the green light from the government, in accordance with medical advice. In a section on player welfare at the meeting, it was decided tests for coronavirus would have to be widely available to the public before the widespread testing of players. When and how football resumes has been widely debated across the sport as clubs face up to financial difficulties and the logistical issues caused by a late finish to the season. The contracts of numerous players expire on 30 June, including those of Chelsea midfielder Willian and Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen. If the season is extended beyond that date there is a possibility clubs will lose players before fixtures are concluded. World governing body Fifa is aware of the problem and is looking at alternatives such as rolling contract extensions. The 30 June date is also an issue for clubs around agreed changes in kit manufacturers. Liverpool are due to change shirt manufacturers from New Balance to Nike, while Watford and Newcastle are also set to use new suppliers. In a BBC Sport vote on how the season should be dealt with39% of respondents wanted to 'declare the season null and void', with 28% opting to 'finish the season no matter how long it takes'. Uefa has pleaded for leagues to give them time to return with their own proposals for ending the season across Europe. European football's governing body will meet next week to further discuss plans which include potentially using the Champions League finalto end the 2019-20 season on 29 August. Lower down the football pyramid in England, the EFL has sent a letter to clubs recommending they return to training on 16 May at the earliest. The EFL has not discussed a league restart date with the government but told clubs: ""Our planning needs to be agile enough to allow us to be as prepared as possible for a start at relatively short notice."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone In the end, the 30 June deadline demand some were so keen to push earlier in the week was never raised. The feeling that today's meeting was not the right time to widen the debate and the Premier League desire for a united front was strong enough to dissuade a discussion that would have extended the chat, which was wrapped up in under two hours. Individual clubs will go away to continue discussions with players about wage cuts and deferrals and wait to see what comes out of two Uefa meetings next week. Before their next scheduled meeting on 1 May, lessons should also be absorbed from Germany. Some Bundesliga players have already returned to their clubs for training under social distancing rules - getting changed at home and returning to shower after picking up some food. A Bundesliga meeting on Thursday will offer guidance on if and when this can be stepped up following the revised regulations announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. It will start to offer the Premier League some kind of clarity over the major discussions today, which centred around different start and end dates to play the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign. At the moment, it is felt eight weeks will be enough from returning to training in order to regain match fitness and play nine rounds of games to complete the season. Germany's experience will help frame whether that prospect is a realistic one. In the meantime, as has been the case since matches were first called off five weeks ago, the only certainty is uncertainty. The body that represents Europe's top leagues says when football does return itwill ""no doubt"" be played behind closed doors. At present, the state of play in the continent's top leagues is: Germany's Bundesliga:Clubs have returned to training but the season is still suspended until 30 April. Spain's La Liga:There will be no training until emergency measures in place are lifted and La Liga president Javier Tebas says resuming play on 28 May is a best-case scenario. France's Ligue 1:French football authorities are considering restarting Ligue 1 on 3 or 17 June, with the latter date the more likely, according to sports daily L'Equipe.

"There have been UK protests about the lack of PPE for nursing staff The health secretary has said that thousands of pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) will arrive in the UK on Friday as the government faces criticism over shortages. Matt Hancock said that 55,000 more gowns were due to arrive, but admitted there was ""a huge challenge"". He added: ""We are tight on gowns and that is the pressure point."" The government has been criticised for not providing enough PPE for healthcare workers during the coronavirus crisis. An earlier version of this story reported that a director of a large NHS trust had contacted the BBC with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff. The person concerned is not a director of a trust - the BBC has since been told he is currently part of a network of organisations helping to source PPE for some NHS trusts during the pandemic. For a number of weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and government ministers have said during press briefings and interviews that firms including Burberry will begin making personal protective equipment on behalf of the government as one of the answers to a critical shortage. Asked about the PPE produced by such manufacturers, Mr Hancock praised the ""national effort"" but urged more companies to come forward. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Hancock said on Friday that PPE was a ""precious resource"" and that maintaining supplies was challenging due to the ""very high"" global demand. Latest statistics revealed the UK recorded another 861 coronavirus-related deaths in hospital, taking the total to 13,729. The overall figure does not include hundreds more who have died in residential and nursing homes. On Thursday, as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension of lockdown restrictions for ""at least"" another three weeks, he said there remained ""issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes"". Among five conditions he said must be met before curbs on daily life could be lifted were making sure the NHS could cope and ensuring PPE supplies could meet demand. In other developments: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have acknowledged the coronavirus pandemic is""stressful"" for many, and urged people to look after their mental health.

A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. Has the NHS got enough PPE? 'Last resort' plans revealed for PPE reuse by health workers 'Herculean effort' to provide NHS protective gear The shortage of non-surgical gowns is a critical problem facing the NHS as it struggles to secure enough kit for frontline staff. A leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a ""last resort"". This video can not be played For a fourth week, people clap to show appreciation for health professionals and other key workers As the world fights coronavirus, the demand for gowns is at levels never seen before. Almost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East. These decisions have been driven by cost, as all sectors seek the cheapest prices. But as every country in the world fights for finite supplies, a UK solution has been sought. The government and management consultancy Deloitte approached well known UK garment brands asking if they could help make PPE. They also requested that UK manufacturers complete a survey to share what they could make. Earlier this week, Barbour began distributing gowns from its factory in the north-east of England. Burberry is still making the final adjustments to its factory and production is expected to start next week. Getting a supply chain formalised using UK factories has been difficult. UK garment factories approached by the BBC have said the government does not fully understand what is possible in the UK, and which firms could produce what. This lack of understanding has caused production delays. Delays around certification of gowns for use is also slowing down the manufacturing process. Some factories say it could be another two weeks before the necessary paperwork is signed off and they can manufacture the gowns. This comes as factories around the UK are empty. Machinists and pattern cutters have been sent home and furloughed. To add to the frustration of factory bosses, they say they're getting upsetting calls from NHS hospitals and workers begging for gowns. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Adequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic."" Nearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said. ""There is also a 24-hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report supply disruption. ""We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need and it is crucial the guidance for protective equipment is followed closely,"" the spokesman added.

"People struggling with payday loans, car finance and pawn shop borrowing will be granted a payment holiday under plans by the City watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the measures would help borrowers who are experiencing money problems amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The FCA wants motor finance firms to grant a three-month freeze. It is also asking firms specialising in rent-to-own, buy-now-pay-later and pawnbroking loans to delay repayments. More newly-hired staff will get paid 'I lost my job, now we're on the bare minimum' You can't just stop paying rent, tenants told Those people with a payday loan will be given a one-month reprieveunder the FCA's plan,external. Last week, the watchdog announced a three-month freeze on loan and credit card repayments. ""We are very aware of the continued struggle people are facing as a result of the pandemic,"" said the FCA's interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard. ""These measures build on the interventions we announced last week and will provide much-needed relief to consumers during these difficult times."" The FCA will consult with finance firms and expects to finalise proposals by 24 April, ""with them coming into force shortly afterwards"". Motor finance companies have been asked not to repossess cars or end loan agreements with customers who are ""experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus"". The FCA also said companies should not alter contracts in an ""unfair"" way, such as using the temporary fall in car prices caused by the pandemic to change the so-called balloon payment expected at the end of an agreement. Meanwhile, pawnbrokers have been advised not to sell items that struggling customers have borrowed against. The FCA said: ""If the firm has already informed the consumer they intend to sell the item, they should suspend the sale during the payment freeze."" The watchdog said the proposed freeze on payday loan repayment was a shorter one-month period because it ""reflects both the much shorter length of most loans and, given interest rates tend to be higher than for other high-cost credit products, prevents firms from accruing additional interest during the freeze period"". But Sara Williams, an adviser who runs the blog Debt Camel, questioned why there was a difference in the length of payment holidays for different types of loans. ""I think these proposals are disappointing,"" she said. ""It's good that interest has to be stopped, but many people will find a one month break isn't long enough. ""The three month breaks being proposed for car finance and credit cards are both more helpful and more realistic for people with coronavirus problems."" However, she added: ""One month is better than nothing so if you need help phone up and ask for it."" Mr Woolard said: ""We have tailored our measures to specific products. For most of these proposals, firms and consumers should consider the amount of interest which may build up, and balance this against the need for immediate temporary support. ""If a payment freeze isn't in the customer's interests, firms should offer an alternative solution, potentially including the waiving of interest and charges or rescheduling the term of the loan.""

"Coronavirus testing will be rolled out to people working in public services such as police, fire and prison staff, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Capacity was rising ""sharply"" but not as many NHS staff had come forward for tests as had been expected, he said. The government said 21,328 tests were carried out on Thursday but there had been capacity for at least 38,000. Meanwhile, scientistssay they should have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by September. However, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said there were ""no guarantees"" and it was not possible to put a date on when a vaccine would be created by. Producing one is ""a colossal undertaking"" and ""a complex process which will take many months"", he told the government's daily press briefing. It comes as the UK recorded 847 new coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals on Thursday, taking the total to 14,576. The figure does not include hundreds more who have died in care homes and the community. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Speaking by videolink to an online meeting of the Commons health committee earlier, Mr Hancock said the government had prioritised testing for hospital patients and NHS workers before expanding it to residents and staff in social care. He added some 50,000 NHS workers had been tested so far. However, he said it was ""frustrating"" there was capacity for 10,000 more tests a day than were carried out on Thursday. The government has a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. Eligibility for testing will also be expanded to critical local authority workers, the judiciary and Department for Work and Pensions staff, he said. ""We're able to do that because of the scale-up of testing,"" he added. Mr Hancock said he hoped anyone with symptoms would be able to be tested ""relatively soon"". ""Now we've got the curve under control, I want to be able to get back to the position that we can test everybody with symptoms - and I anticipate being able to do that relatively soon because we're increasing capacity, as I say,"" he said. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, welcomed the expansion of testing. However, he added: ""It is a shame it has come this late, with thousands of firefighters already self-isolating - this is something that could have been easily avoided."" Mr Wrack said there were also issues around how accessible testing was, with many testing centres far out of town. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, told the committee some sick NHS workers were compelled to drive for up to two hours to be tested. Also speaking to the committee, Prof Anthony Costello, the director of University College London's Institute for Global Health, said there could be 40,000 deaths in the UK as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. He said the UK had been ""too slow"" to react on a number of fronts to the crisis which may lead to it having ""probably the highest death rate in Europe"". Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, previously said it would be a ""good outcome""if total UK deaths could be kept below 20,000. Warning that the UK would face ""further waves"" of the virus, Prof Costello said a system needed to be put in place that ""cannot just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory"" but one that reached out at ""district and community level"". Can I get tested? Should we all be wearing face masks now? Are NHS staff getting the protective gear they need? Speaking at the briefing, Sir Patrick said there was beginning to be a ""gradual decrease"" in the number of coronavirus patients in London hospitals and a flattening or decrease in other areas. ""The numbers are not only at a plateau but beginning to come down in some areas and that will translate into fewer people in intensive care in due course,"" he said. ""But do not expect this to be quick. This is not going to be a sudden drop, there will be a plateau - it will take a while for the numbers to come right down and that's why it's important that we continue with the strong social distancing measures that we have in place.""

"Africans in Guangzhou have complained that they have been forced from their accommodation Ade* was given until midnight to vacate his apartment. Five months earlier, the Nigerian student had moved to Guangzhou, southern China, to study computing at Guangdong university. He had just paid his university fees for the new semester when his landlord informed him that he needed to leave. He scrambled to pack his belongings. The police were waiting for him and his roommates outside. When he attempted to drop off his bags at a friend's warehouse, he was prevented from entering. He spent several nights sleeping on the streets. ""Look how they are treating us, how they forced us out of our houses and forced us to self-quarantine,"" he told the BBC from a hotel in the city. ""They told me that the [test] result is out and I am negative. Still they don't want me to go out."" McDonald's in China apologised after a branch in Guangzhou barred black people from entering African community leaders in Guangzhou believe the vast majority of the city's African population have been forced into quarantine or are sleeping on the streets. ""Some are in hiding,"" said one community leader over an encrypted social media app. In early April, online rumours began to circulate that parts of the city where Africans live and trade were under lockdown after two Nigerians who had tested positive for the virus escaped. Chinese media reported that a Nigerian patient had attacked a Chinese nurse. The health commission began widespread testing of African nationals. The local authority says it has tested every African national in the city for the coronavirus. It found that 111 of the more than 4,500 Africans in Guangzhou tested positive. ""They just came with their ambulance and medical team and took us. All they said was that it was Chinese law and an order from the government,"" said Hao*, a businessman from Ivory Coast. Businesses in Guangzhou, including in the area popular with Africans, have been shut because of coronavirus fears Guangzhou has become a hub for Africans in China. Towards the end of the century's first decade, hundreds of thousands were thought to live in the city. Many of them entering the country on short-term visas to buy goods from nearby factories and send them back to the continent. By some estimates there were more than 200,000 dwelling in the city. Some settled for the long term. Many overstayed their visas. In recent years, the numbers have dwindled. Businessmen have complained of unfair visa restrictions and unfair treatment.  In 2018, small hotels in Xiao Bei Lu, a popular area for African traders, temporarily turned away Africans from several nations, they told the BBC. ""Most of the Africans living there are nice and friendly with the locals, and they are doing business as normal for the past years,"" said one Guangzhou resident who did not want to be named. ""If there is a problem, it may be that some Africans are overstaying and doing some illegal things. ""The conflict over the virus test, I think it is something of a misunderstanding. It is not about racial discrimination. That's not the style of the Guangzhou people,"" he said. ""People are not hostile to Africans in their mind, unless some Africans are doing things against the local rules,"" he added. The street brawl with Africans in China that never was A dazed city emerges from the harshest of lockdowns China and the virus that threatens everything Coronavirus lessons from president who led Ebola fight The Chinese government dismissed claims of racism, insisting China and Africa are friends, partners and brothers and that it has zero tolerance to racism. But many of those the BBC spoke to say they have been singled out because of their race. ""Ninety-eight per cent of Africans are in quarantine,"" said one community leader who did not want to be named. Africans across China say they are facing increased scrutiny. On the deserted campus of Wuhan University African faces outnumber Chinese. ""We are the ones that are left behind,"" says a Ghanaian student in the Chinese city where coronavirus was first detected. Things started to get back to normal as the lockdown in Wuhan ended on 8 April At the height of the outbreak, an estimated 5,000 African students were stranded in Wuhan and neighbouring cities, after most sub-Saharan nations failed to evacuate their citizens. ""We feel like sacrificial lambs for no reason. The plan was to keep the people safe by sacrificing us,"" asked one student who did not want to be named. ""What was the point as our countries didn't put measures in place to protect the people from the virus?"" When Wuhan officially ended its lockdown on 8 April, normality began to creep back into the city. More than a week on, African students on campuses remain unable to leave the grounds of the university. They have no information of when their own lockdown will be lifted. Part of Guangzhou has become known as Little Africa, because of the large number of Africans who live and work there Back in Guangzhou, a student from Sierra Leone said she believed Africans were being singled out. ""All of this is happening because there has been a rise in foreign imported cases, [but] the majority are from Chinese nationals,"" she said. ""Only a small percentage is made up of Africans."" She received a letter from her university stating that all Africans needed to be tested. Despite being tested twice she remains in quarantine. ""With all this happening, the Chinese have exhibited racism and discrimination against black people here in Guangzhou. ""I know people from my church who are white and non-Africans who are not going through what we are going through - quarantine and multiple testing,"" she said. ""Quarantine hotels are like forced detention for blacks."" A Nigerian businessman under quarantine said that ""it was the police that removed me from my apartment and put me on the streets"". ""I don't have any problem with my landlord. He didn't even know I had been evicted. My children slept on the streets for many days."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LIVE TRACKER:Coronavirus in Africa VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health On social media, hundreds of Africans in Guangzhou have organised groups supplying each other with regular updates. They send photos of numerous hotels and hospitals where businessmen, residents and students are being held across the city. Some post test results showing that they are negative. Others post medical and hotel bills that they say they cannot afford to pay. Videos of Africans sleeping on the streets have gone viral. The Guangdong government has publicised a hotline for ""foreigners who experience discrimination"".  But for those in quarantine, suspicions remain high. Videos continue to circulate online of Africans being moved between hotels by ambulance. Xiao Bei Lu is known as ""China's little Africa"" but social media videos show that its streets, at one time packed with African traders, are now deserted.

"Schools in Denmark for children up to 11 were allowed to reopen on Wednesday It began with schools for young children this week - now Denmark will allow beauty salons, hairdressers and tattoo parlours to reopen on Monday. Denmark moved fast to tackle the outbreak, imposing restrictions on movement early on 12 March, while neighbouring Sweden decided to steer clear of severe measures. Companies that do go back to work will have to follow guidelines. Any further easing will depend on Danes respecting social distancing rules. ""No-one wants to keep Denmark closed a day more than is absolutely necessary,"" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen wrote on Facebook. ""But we mustn't go ahead faster than we are able to keep the epidemic under control."" Hairdressers, dentists, tattooists and driving school instructors will be allowed to resume work. Other professions include: Physiotherapists Psychologists Beauty and massage salons Optometrists Podiatrists Spa clinics Piercing studios Chiropractors The courts will reopen on 27 April. Cafes, restaurants and schools for ages 12 and over will not. Those who are allowed to go back to work but feel the time is not yet right will still be allowed to claim government compensation. Why Denmark is taking steps to open up again Denmark lets young children return to school Work will also be carried out to enable family visits to vulnerable people, both the elderly and children. As soon as details of the relaxation became clear, one of Denmark's biggest online hairdresser booking systems, ordering.nu, crashed, Ekstra Bladet reported. The newspaper suggested that Danes crying out for a haircut had all tried to book at the same time. By Adrienne Murray, Copenhagen When young children returned to schools and nurseries on Wednesday, it certainly wasn't a normal school day. Lots of new health and safety rules had to be met before schools could open their doors. Inevitably many weren't ready. That's very likely to happen next week when Denmark allows a number of smaller businesses to reopen. Much of the work done by hairdressers, tattooists, dentists or opticians requires close contact with customers. Businesses will need to comply with health guidelines on hygiene and distance, but rules will vary sector by sector, and details are still being ironed out. The Dental Association says it is still waiting to hear whether extra protective clothing or visors will be needed. One hairdresser told me she was fully booked for the next three weeks, and planned to open on Monday by taking common sense precautions and using hand sanitiser. Allan Randrup Thomsen, professor of virology at Copenhagen university, told Danish TV that opening up cafes would be far more risky because the number of customers would be far higher than to a dentist or a hairdresser. This video can not be played Italyâs lockdown puts restaurants out of business The decision on reopening came after political leaders, including opposition parties, reached a consensus based on advice from the SSI infectious diseases institute. Denmark has reported 336 deaths,externaland some 7,000 infections linked to coronavirus in a population of 5.8 million. One in five of the reported infections involved health care workers. Elsewhere in Europe, Austria allowed small shops to reopen on Tuesday while in Germany small shops of up to 800 sq m (8,600 sq ft) will also be allowed to resume trading from Monday. Spain allowed some construction and manufacturing to resume this week. The lockdown across Europe has had a dramatic effect on the car industry. New car sales fell by 55% in March with markets across all EU states affected. Meanwhile, the Swedish government has reacted to criticism of its decision to avoid strict measures aimed at tackling Covid-19. ""It's a myth that life goes on as normal in Sweden,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Ann Linde told reporters, pointing out that many parts of society had shut down and that businesses were collapsing as a result of the pandemic. Pubs, shops and schools are still open in Sweden but the government has barred gatherings of more than 50 people as well as visits to nursing homes. Swedes are still able to enjoy going to cafes and restaurants unlike elsewhere in Europe Sweden has seen 1,333 deaths in a population of 10 million. The head of the public health agency, Johan Carlsson, said Sweden was relying on personal responsibility so ""all citizens need to comply with legislation and recommendations"". MPs passed a law on Thursday granting the government powers to push through measures over the next few weeks that involve closing businesses, limiting public gatherings and shutting down airports. Scientists are divided on the government's approach but polls suggest its popular with the public, the BBC's Maddy Savage reports from Stockholm.

"Scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to Gmail users every day, according to Google. The tech giant says the pandemic has led to an explosion ofphishing attacksin which criminals try to trick users into revealing personal data. The company said it was blocking more than 100 million phishing emails a day. Over the past week, almost a fifth were scam emails related to coronavirus. The virus may now be the biggest phishing topic ever, tech firms say. Google's Gmail is used by 1.5 billion people. One of the scam emails impersonates the World Health Organization Individuals are being sent a huge variety of emails which impersonate authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), in an effort to persuade victims to download software or donate to bogus causes. Cyber-criminals are also attempting to capitalise on government support packages by imitating public institutions. Google claims that its machine-learning tools are able to block more than 99.9% of emails from reaching its users. This scam email targeted businesses on Gmail The growth in coronavirus-themed phishing is being recorded by several cyber-security companies. Barracuda Networks said it had seen a 667% increase in malicious phishing emails during the pandemic. Scammers have been sending fake emails and text messages claiming to be from the UK government, the WHO, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and even individual US officials, including President Trump. ""Phishing attacks always share the common trait of inciting or depending on an emotion that causes us to act more hastily or think less about our actions at that moment in time,"" said independent security researcher Scott Helme. ""The coronavirus pandemic is a highly emotional topic right now and cyber-criminals clearly know this. They're hoping that the typical person might be more inclined to click through links or follow bad instructions if they use this lure."" Researchers have also found malicious websites and smartphone applications based on genuine coronavirus resources. One malicious Android app claims to help track the spread of the virus, but instead infects the phone withransomwareand demands payment to restore the device. Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre and the US Department of Homeland Security issued a joint advisory. They said they had seen ""an increasing number of malicious cyber-actors"" that were ""exploiting the current Covid-19 pandemic for their own objectives"".

"The Chinese city of Wuhan recently lifted its strict quarantine measures The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus originated last year, has raised its official Covid-19 death toll by 50%, adding 1,290 fatalities. Wuhan officials attributed the new figure to updated reporting and deaths outside hospitals. China has insisted there was no cover-up. It has been accused of downplaying the severity of its virus outbreak. Wuhan's 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions, which have only recently been eased. The latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in China's central Hubei province to 3,869, increasing the national total to more than 4,600. China has confirmed nearly 84,000 coronavirus infections, the seventh-highest globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The virus has had a huge impact on the Chinese economy, which shrank for the first time in decades in the first quarter of the year. Follow our live reporting from around the world Why China's claims of success raise eyebrows In a statement released on Friday, officials in Wuhan said the revised figures were the result of new data received from multiple sources, including records kept by funeral homes and prisons. Deaths linked to the virus outside hospitals, such as people who died at home, had not previously been recorded. This video can not be played Learn how Wuhan dealt with the lockdown The ""statistical verification"" followed efforts by authorities to ""ensure that information on the city's Covid-19 epidemic is open, transparent and the data [is] accurate"", the statement said. It added that health systems were initially overwhelmed and cases were ""mistakenly reported"" - in some instances counted more than once and in others missed entirely. A shortage of testing capacity in the early stages meant that many infected patients were not accounted for, it said. A spokesman for China's National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said the new death count came from a ""comprehensive review"" of epidemic data. In its daily news conference, the foreign ministry said accusations of a cover-up, which have been made most stridently on the world stage by US President Donald Trump, were unsubstantiated. ""We'll never allow any concealment,"" a spokesman said. Friday's revised figures come amid growing international concern that deaths in China have been under-reported. Questions have also been raised about Beijing's handling of the epidemic, particularly in its early stages. In December 2019, Chinese authorities launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia after cases began circulating in Wuhan. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health China reported the cases to the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN's global health agency, on 31 December. But WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases. The mayor of Wuhan has previously admitted there was a lack of action between the start of January - when about 100 cases had been confirmed - and 23 January, when city-wide restrictions were enacted. Around that time, a doctor who tried to warn his colleagues about an outbreak of a Sars-like virus was silenced by the authorities. Dr Li Wenlianglater died from Covid-19. Wuhan's death toll increase of almost exactly 50% has left some analysts wondering if this is all a bit too neat. For months questions have been asked about the veracity of China's official coronavirus statistics. The inference has been that some Chinese officials may have deliberately under-reported deaths and infections to give the impression that cities and towns were successfully managing the emergency. If that was the case, Chinese officials were not to know just how bad this crisis would get in other countries, making its own figures now seem implausibly small. The authorities in Wuhan, where the first cluster of this disease was reported, said there had been no deliberate misrepresentation of data, rather that a stabilisation in the emergency had allowed them time to revisit the reported cases and to add any previously missed. That the new death toll was released at the same time as a press conference announcing a total collapse in China's economic growth figures has led some to wonder whether this was a deliberate attempt to bury one or other of these stories. Then again, it could also be a complete coincidence. China has been pushing back against US suggestions that the coronavirus came from a laboratory studying infectious diseases in Wuhan, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington DC reports. US President Donald Trump and some of his officials have been flirting with the outlier theory in the midst of a propaganda war with China over the origin and handling of the pandemic, our correspondent says. Mr Trump this week halted funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing it of making deadly mistakes and overly trusting China. The WHO row, explained ""Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?"" Mr Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. French PresidentEmmanuel Macron has also questioned China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, saying it was ""naive"" to suggest the country had dealt better with the crisis, adding things ""happened that we don't know about"". On Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We'll have to ask the hard questions about how [coronavirus] came about and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier."" But China has also been praised for its handling of the crisis and the unprecedented restrictions that it instituted to slow the spread of the virus. WHO Director GeneralDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has hailed Chinafor the ""speed with which [it] detected the outbreak"" and its ""commitment to transparency"".

"Norman Hunter won the league title with Leeds in 1969 and 1974 Leeds United great Norman Hunter has died in hospital aged 76 after contracting coronavirus. The tough-tackling centre-back, nicknamed 'Bites Yer Legs', was a key player in Leeds' most successful era. He won two league titles during a 14-year first-team career at Elland Road, and was a non-playing member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad. Hunter was admitted to hospital on 10 April after testing positive for coronavirus. Former Leeds team-mate Eddie Gray said Hunter was an ""iconic figure"" at the club. ""He was a truly great player,"" Gray, 72, told the BBC. ""I don't think people realise because of the 'Bites Yer Legs', it took away from his actual ability as a player. ""He never got as many caps as he deserved because of the great Bobby Moore, but he was as good as any defender that played the game."" Leeds said the defender's death leaves ""a huge hole"" in the family of the club. ""His legacy will never be forgotten and our thoughts are with Norman's family and friends at this very difficult time,"" the Yorkshire club saidin a statement.,external Obituary: Hunter 'a man of steel who could also produce silk' This video can not be played Eddie Gray pays tribute to 'truly great' Leeds team-mate Norman Hunter Hunter joined Leeds aged 15 and went on to play 726 matches in all competitions for the club - the fourth-highest individual total in their history. As an integral part of Don Revie's famous side, Hunter won the First Division title in 1969 and 1974, helped them beat Arsenal in the 1968 League Cup final, and then returned to Wembley in 1972 as Leeds defeated the Gunners to win the FA Cup. He also played in the 1975 European Cup final defeat by Bayern Munich in Paris - a year after Revie left to manage England - but he did taste European success as Leeds won the now-defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1968 and 1971. Speaking in 2013, when he announced he was selling his Leeds memorabilia at auction, Hunter said his one regret from his time playing for the club was that he never lifted the European Cup. ""Someone asked me if I was selling my shirt from that game [against Bayern] but I honestly don't know where it is,"" he added. ""I was that upset that I don't know what I did with it. ""Medals don't mean much to me. For me it was about being at Leeds United and playing with that group of players and staff. ""It was magic."" Although a member of the squad, Hunter did not play during England's triumphant 1966 World Cup campaign, with their central defensive partnership formed by Jack Charlton - his Leeds team-mate - and captain Bobby Moore. The England national team said they were ""extremely saddened"" by Hunter's death and that ""all of our thoughts are with his family, friends and supporters"". After leaving Leeds in 1976, Hunter also played for Bristol City and Barnsley, managing the Tykes and Rotherham after he retired from playing. The Professional Footballers' Association said: ""Football has lost a legend and we join the entire football community in mourning this loss."" Norman Hunter also won the FA Cup and League Cup with Leeds England World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst:""Enormously shocked and saddened to hear the awful news about my friend Norman Hunter, he will be very sadly missed.

"China's economy shrank for the first time in decades in the first quarter of the year, as the virus forced factories and businesses to close. The world's second biggest economy contracted 6.8% according to official data released on Friday. The financial toll the coronavirus is having on the Chinese economy will be a huge concern to other countries. China is an economic powerhouse as a major consumer and producer of goods and services. This is the first time China has seen its economy shrink in the first three months of the year since it started recording quarterly figures in 1992. ""The GDP contraction in January-March will translate into permanent income losses, reflected in bankruptcies across small companies and job losses,"" said Yue Su at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Analysis: What China's gloomy numbers tell us Can we trust China claims of virus success? Last year, China saw healthy economic growth of 6.4% in the first quarter, a period when it was locked in a trade war with the US. In the last two decades, China has seen average economic growth of around 9% a year, although experts have regularly questioned the accuracy of its economic data. Its economy had ground to a halt during the first three months of the year as it introduced large-scale shutdowns and quarantines to prevent the virus spread in late January. Macron questions China's handling of coronavirus Asian economies won't grow this year, warns IMF As a result, economists had expected bleak figures, but the official data comes in slightly worse than expected. Among other key figures released in Friday's report: Factory output was down 1.1% for March as China slowly starts manufacturing again. Retail sales plummeted 15.8% last month as many of shoppers stayed at home. Unemployment hit 5.9% in March, slightly better than February's all-time high of 6.2%. Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai The huge decline shows the profound impact that the virus outbreak, and the government's draconian reaction to it, had on the world's second largest economy. It wipes out the 6% expansion in China's economy recorded in the last set of figures at the end of last year. Beijing has signalled a significant economic stimulus is on the way as it tries to stabilise its economy and recover. Earlier this week the official mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, the People's Daily, reported it would ""expand domestic demand"". But the slowdown in the rest of the global economy presents a significant problem as exports still play a major role in China's economy. If it comes this will not be a quick recovery. On Thursday the International Monetary Fund forecast China's economy would avoid a recession but grow by just 1.2% this year. Job figures released recently showed the official government unemployment figure had risen sharply, with the number working in companies linked to export trade falling the most. China has unveiled a range of financial support measures to cushion the impact of the slowdown, but not on the same scale as other major economies. ""We don't expect large stimulus, given that that remains unpopular in Beijing. Instead, we think policymakers will accept low growth this year, given the prospects for a better 2021,"" said Louis Kuijs, an analyst with Oxford Economics. Since March, China has slowly started letting factories resume production and letting businesses reopen, but this is a gradual process to return to pre-lockdown levels. This video can not be played Why does Chinaâs economy matter to you? China relies heavily on its factories and manufacturing plants for economic growth, and has been dubbed ""the world's factory"". Stock markets in the region showed mixed reaction to the Chinese economic data, with China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index up 0.9%. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 2.5% on Friday, although this was largely due to gains on Wall Street afterUS President Donald Trump unveiled plans to ease lockdowns.

"There have been UK protests about the lack of PPE for nursing staff The health secretary has said that thousands of pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) will arrive in the UK on Friday as the government faces criticism over shortages. Matt Hancock said that 55,000 more gowns were due to arrive, but admitted there was ""a huge challenge"". He added: ""We are tight on gowns and that is the pressure point."" The government has been criticised for not providing enough PPE for healthcare workers during the coronavirus crisis. An earlier version of this story reported that a director of a large NHS trust had contacted the BBC with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff. The person concerned is not a director of a trust - the BBC has since been told he is currently part of a network of organisations helping to source PPE for some NHS trusts during the pandemic. For a number of weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and government ministers have said during press briefings and interviews that firms including Burberry will begin making personal protective equipment on behalf of the government as one of the answers to a critical shortage. Asked about the PPE produced by such manufacturers, Mr Hancock praised the ""national effort"" but urged more companies to come forward. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Hancock said on Friday that PPE was a ""precious resource"" and that maintaining supplies was challenging due to the ""very high"" global demand. Latest statistics revealed the UK recorded another 861 coronavirus-related deaths in hospital, taking the total to 13,729. The overall figure does not include hundreds more who have died in residential and nursing homes. On Thursday, as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension of lockdown restrictions for ""at least"" another three weeks, he said there remained ""issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes"". Among five conditions he said must be met before curbs on daily life could be lifted were making sure the NHS could cope and ensuring PPE supplies could meet demand. In other developments: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have acknowledged the coronavirus pandemic is""stressful"" for many, and urged people to look after their mental health. Prince William also praised NHS workers, saying they were making the nation proud with their ""stoicism and determination"" People struggling with payday loans, car finance and pawn shop borrowing will begranted a payment holiday under plans by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak first began, has raised its death toll by 50% - equal to 1,290 cases - attributing it to updated reporting and more deaths from outside hospitals being counted Meanwhile, China, the world's second biggest economy, has reportedits worst economic performance in decades as the impact of the virus hits, with its GDP figures for the first quarter of 2020 showing its economy shrank 6.8% US President Donald Trump has issued guidance to governors for how they may gradually ease their state lockdown measures as part of his""Opening up America Again"" plan Last week, Mr Hancock said there was ""enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance"", adding there was a ""huge task"" to make sure those who need it get it. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. Has the NHS got enough PPE? 'Last resort' plans revealed for PPE reuse by health workers 'Herculean effort' to provide NHS protective gear The shortage of non-surgical gowns is a critical problem facing the NHS as it struggles to secure enough kit for frontline staff. A leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a ""last resort"". This video can not be played For a fourth week, people clap to show appreciation for health professionals and other key workers As the world fights coronavirus, the demand for gowns is at levels never seen before. Almost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East. These decisions have been driven by cost, as all sectors seek the cheapest prices. But as every country in the world fights for finite supplies, a UK solution has been sought. The government and management consultancy Deloitte approached well known UK garment brands asking if they could help make PPE. They also requested that UK manufacturers complete a survey to share what they could make. Earlier this week, Barbour began distributing gowns from its factory in the north-east of England. Burberry is still making the final adjustments to its factory and production is expected to start next week. Getting a supply chain formalised using UK factories has been difficult. UK garment factories approached by the BBC have said the government does not fully understand what is possible in the UK, and which firms could produce what. This lack of understanding has caused production delays. Delays around certification of gowns for use is also slowing down the manufacturing process. Some factories say it could be another two weeks before the necessary paperwork is signed off and they can manufacture the gowns. This comes as factories around the UK are empty. Machinists and pattern cutters have been sent home and furloughed. To add to the frustration of factory bosses, they say they're getting upsetting calls from NHS hospitals and workers begging for gowns. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Adequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic."" Nearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said. ""There is also a 24-hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report supply disruption. ""We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need and it is crucial the guidance for protective equipment is followed closely,"" the spokesman added. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that a director of a large NHS trust had contacted the BBC with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff. The person concerned is not a director of a trust - the BBC has since been told he is currently part of a network of organisations helping to source personal protective equipment for some NHS trusts during the pandemic.

"People struggling with payday loans, car finance and pawn shop borrowing will be granted a payment holiday under plans by the City watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the measures would help borrowers who are experiencing money problems amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The FCA wants motor finance firms to grant a three-month freeze. It is also asking firms specialising in rent-to-own, buy-now-pay-later and pawnbroking loans to delay repayments. More newly-hired staff will get paid 'I lost my job, now we're on the bare minimum' You can't just stop paying rent, tenants told Those people with a payday loan will be given a one-month reprieveunder the FCA's plan,external. Last week, the watchdog announced a three-month freeze on loan and credit card repayments. ""We are very aware of the continued struggle people are facing as a result of the pandemic,"" said the FCA's interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard. ""These measures build on the interventions we announced last week and will provide much-needed relief to consumers during these difficult times."" The FCA will consult with finance firms and expects to finalise proposals by 24 April, ""with them coming into force shortly afterwards"". Motor finance companies have been asked not to repossess cars or end loan agreements with customers who are ""experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus"". The FCA also said companies should not alter contracts in an ""unfair"" way, such as using the temporary fall in car prices caused by the pandemic to change the so-called balloon payment expected at the end of an agreement. Meanwhile, pawnbrokers have been advised not to sell items that struggling customers have borrowed against. The FCA said: ""If the firm has already informed the consumer they intend to sell the item, they should suspend the sale during the payment freeze."" The watchdog said the proposed freeze on payday loan repayment was a shorter one-month period because it ""reflects both the much shorter length of most loans and, given interest rates tend to be higher than for other high-cost credit products, prevents firms from accruing additional interest during the freeze period"". But Sara Williams, an adviser who runs the blog Debt Camel, questioned why there was a difference in the length of payment holidays for different types of loans. ""I think these proposals are disappointing,"" she said. ""It's good that interest has to be stopped, but many people will find a one month break isn't long enough. ""The three month breaks being proposed for car finance and credit cards are both more helpful and more realistic for people with coronavirus problems."" However, she added: ""One month is better than nothing so if you need help phone up and ask for it."" Mr Woolard said: ""We have tailored our measures to specific products. For most of these proposals, firms and consumers should consider the amount of interest which may build up, and balance this against the need for immediate temporary support. ""If a payment freeze isn't in the customer's interests, firms should offer an alternative solution, potentially including the waiving of interest and charges or rescheduling the term of the loan.""

"A scientist tests for coronavirus at a lab in Greece In April, US State Department cables came to light showing embassy officials were worried about biosecurity at a virus lab in Wuhan, China. The lab is in the same city where the coronavirus outbreak was first detected. The office of the US national intelligence director says that the virus was not man-made or genetically modified. But intelligence officials are investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. So what, if anything, does this add to our understanding of the current pandemic? The Washington Post newspaper reported information obtained from diplomatic cables on 14 April. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officialssent two warnings to Washington about the lab.,externalThe column says the officials were worried about safety and management weaknesses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and called for more help. It also claims diplomats were concerned the lab's research on bat coronaviruses could risk a new Sars-like pandemic. The newspaper says the cables fuelled more recent discussions in the US government about whether the WIV or another lab in Wuhan could have been the source of the virus behind the current pandemic. In addition, Fox News issueda report promoting the lab origin theory.,external This video can not be played Donald Trump was recently asked if the virus emanated in a laboratory, rather than a market The outbreak came to light late last year when early cases were linked to a food market in Wuhan. But despite rampant online speculation, there is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) was released accidentally from a lab. On 30 April,the US national intelligence director's office issued a statement,externalrejecting the most extreme of the conspiracy theories about the virus's origins - that it was conceived as a bioweapon. It said the intelligence community was still examining whether the outbreak began ""through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan"". But President Donald Trump appeared to undercut that statementin a press briefing the same day. Asked whether he had seen anything to make him think the WIV was the source of the outbreak, he replied: ""Yes, I have. Yes, I have."" China rejects the idea and has criticised the US response to the crisis. Laboratories studying viruses and bacteria follow a system known as the BSL standards, where BSL stands for Biosafety Level. There are four levels, which depend on the types of biological agents being studied and the containment precautions needed to isolate them. Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) is the lowest and is used by labs studying well-known biological agents that pose no threat to humans. The containment precautions increase through the levels until you arrive at Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) which is the highest, and reserved for labs dealing with the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments: ebola, Marburg virus and - in the case of just two institutes in the US and Russia - smallpox. The BSL standards are applied internationally, but with some cosmetic variations. ""The Russians, for instance, label their highest containment labs as 1 and the lowest containment labs as 4, so the exact opposite of the standard, but the actual practices and infrastructure requirements are similar,"" says Dr Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King's College London. Laboratories like this one in Hungary follow a system of standards with four levels. These levels are based on the precautions needed to handle different pathogens But while the World Health Organization (WHO)has published a manual on the different levels,external, the standards are not enforced by any treaties. ""They've been developed to be in the best interest for working safely, for lab workers who don't want to infect themselves or their community, and for the environment to avoid accidental releases,"" says Dr Lentzos. But she adds: ""The 'stick' comes with the purse strings. If you want to do projects with international partners they require labs to be operating to certain standards. Or if you have products to sell in the market, or perform certain services, e.g. tests, then you are also required to operate to international standards."" Indeed, the WIV had received funding from the US, along with assistance from American research institutes. The cables recommended giving them even more help. The short answer is we don't know from the information provided in the Washington Post. But, generally speaking, there are multiple ways that safety measures can be breached at labs dealing with biological agents. According to Dr Lentzos, these include: ""Who has access to the lab, the training and refresher-training of scientists and technicians, procedures for record-keeping, signage, inventory lists of pathogens, accident notification practices, emergency procedures."" A number of early cases in the pandemic were linked to the Wuhan Seafood Market But how unusual were the concerns expressed in the diplomatic cables? Accidents happen. In 2014, forgottenvials of smallpox were found in a cardboard boxin a research centre near Washington. In 2015, the US military accidentallyshipped live anthrax samplesinstead of dead spores to as many as nine labs across the country and a military base in South Korea. In four instances between 2003 and 2004, the Sars virus was accidentally released at laboratories in Singapore, Taiwan and Beijing. There are variations in safety standards across the large number of labs at the lower end of the BSL scale and many lesser breaches don't make it into the news. But there are relatively few labs that are designated BSL-4. Wikipedia lists over 50 around the world, of which WIV was one, but there is no authoritative list. They have to be built to very high specifications because they deal with the most dangerous pathogens known to science. As a result, they generally have good safety records. So any concerns about procedures at one of these facilities would be more than noteworthy. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health Yes, almost as soon as the novel coronavirus came to light, there was speculation - much of it uninformed - about its origins. One online theory that surfaced in January suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon. This allegation has been repeatedly dismissed by scientists, whonote that studies show the virus originated in animals,external- most likely in bats. Viruses can also be engineered for the purposes of scientific research. For example, studies may improve the ability of a pathogen to cause disease, to investigate how viruses could mutate in future. But a US study of the coronavirus genome published in Marchfound no signs it had been engineered,external. ""By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that Sars-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,"" co-author Kristian Andersen, from Scripps Research in California, said at the time. The foundation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology - China's first BSL-4 lab - boosted the country's international prestige Pathogens can be made to mutate in a laboratory without the directed manipulation of their genes. In so-called ""passage experiments"", viruses or bacteria are passed from one lab animal to another in order to study how the agents adapt to their hosts. Past experiments have succeeded in making viruses more transmissible between animals using this low-tech method. But, again, there is no evidence that this played any role in the origin of the novel coronavirus. Then there is the allegation of an accidental release of a natural virus from a lab. The proximity of the Huanan Seafood and Wildlife Market in Wuhan, where the outbreak came to light, to at least two centres carrying out research on infectious diseases fuelled speculation about a link. In addition to the WIV, the city is home to another institute -  the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. That the WIV had carried out research on bat coronaviruses is a matter of public record. This work was entirely legitimate and published in international journals. Given the country's experience with the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s, this should come as no surprise. The virus is thought to have originated in wildlife - most likely in bats But the predominant narrative about an origin at the food market had been questioned as early as January.A paper published at the time in The Lancet,externalshowed that, while most of the early Covid-19 patients had been directly exposed to the market, many others had no known link. However, it's also possible those other patients were connected in ways that aren't yet understood. Dr Lentzos said the issue of the virus' origin was a ""very difficult question"", and added that ""there have been quiet, behind-the-scene discussions... in the biosecurity expert community, questioning the seafood market origin that has come out very strongly from China"". But there is currently no evidence that any research institute in Wuhan was the source of Sars-CoV-2. On 16 April, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijianaddressed the matter at a news conference,external, telling journalists the World Health Organization's officials ""have said multiple times there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory"". China has repeatedly been accused of lacking transparency in the early stages of the outbreak, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Beijing ""needs to come clean"" on what they know. Amid this war of words between the countries, the painstaking - and largely unseen - scientific work to trace the origin of the virus will continue.

It took Tim Fuge 19 hours to eat the 2.8kg (6.4lb) beef pasty in honour of Jowan's birth during lockdown.

He said there were more than 100 vaccine projects in development around the world but added: ""Each single project does not have a high probability of success"". He stressed that only when a vaccine had been successfully tested and proven to be safe could it be rolled out and then produced to scale, urging ""realism"" on current vaccine development.

It will be led by chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan van Tam, and made up of experts from across government, academia and industry. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists at the University of Oxford say they should have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine ready by September. They say they hope to have hundreds of millions of doses for use by the end of 2020. However, it is still uncertain whether the jab will work as the first patients are not expected to take part in trials until next week.

Separately the government has announced it has formed a vaccine taskforce to accelerate the development of a working vaccine. As chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, Jeremy Hunt has called for an increase in virus testing and contact tracing. He said contact tracing could be trialled in places such as Yorkshire or Cornwall today ""because those are parts of the country which have relatively few Covid cases"".

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Reopening US 'a beautiful puzzle' As Covid-19 continues to spread across the US, President Donald Trump has given governors guidance on reopening state economies in the coming months. The guidelines for ""Opening up America Again"" outline three phases for states to gradually ease their lockdowns. Mr Trump promised governors they would be handling the process themselves, with help from the federal government. There has been a mixed reception to the plans, with a leading Democrat calling them vague and inconsistent. The US currently has 654,301 confirmed cases and 32,186 deaths due to the virus, and Mr Trump has suggested some states could reopen this month. White House defends Ivanka travel amid lockdown A run through the 'warzone' of New York The daunting reality of getting US back to normal In his daily briefing on Thursday, President Trump declared ""the next front in our war - opening up America again"". ""America wants to be open and Americans want to be open,"" he said. ""A national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health He said that a prolonged lockdown risked inflicting a serious toll on public health. He warned of a ""sharp rise"" in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and other ""physical and mental"" problems. Mr Trump told reporters that healthy citizens would be able to return to work ""as conditions allow"". He said Americans would continue to be called upon to maintain social distancing measures and to stay home if they are unwell. New York city has recorded more than 11,000 deaths in the pandemic He said that reopening the US economy would be done ""one careful step at a time"" but he called on state governors to move ""very, very quickly, depending on what they want to do"". Shortly afterwards, leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, called the new guidelines ""vague and inconsistent"". She said the document did ""nothing to make up for the president's failure to listen to the scientists and produce and distribute national rapid testing"". The administration's 18-page guidance document details three phases to reopen state economies, with each phase lasting, at minimum, 14 days.The guidelines in full can be seen here,external. They include some recommendations across all three phases including good personal hygiene and employers developing policies to ensure social distancing, testing and contact tracing. Phase oneincludes much of the current lockdown measures such as avoiding non-essential travel and not gathering in groups. But it says large venues such as restaurants, places of worship and sports venues ""can operate under strict physical distancing protocols"". If there is no evidence of a resurgence of the coronavirus,phase twoallows non-essential travel to resume. The guidance says schools can reopen and bars can operate ""with diminished standing-room occupancy"". Underphase three, states which are still seeing a downward trend of symptoms and cases can allow ""public interactions"" with physical distancing and the unrestricted staffing of worksites. Visits to care homes and hospitals can resume and bars can increase their standing room capacity. Some regions could begin returning to normal after a month-long evaluation period, at the earliest, according to the document. In places where there are more infections or where rates begin to rise, it could take longer. The co-ordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, Dr Deborah Birx, told Thursday's briefing that as states worked through the three phases, they could allow for more and more employees to return to work in increments. Phase three would be the ""new normal"", she said, and would still include suggestions that vulnerable people should avoid crowded spaces. This video can not be played Coronavirus: The unexpected items deemed ""essential"" The president has argued with governors in recent days about the timing of easing restrictions and reopening businesses - but he has now conceded that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines. During Thursday's call, Mr Trump told governors: ""You're going to call your own shots."" ""You're going to be running it, we're going to be helping you,"" he added. On Wednesday, White House coronavirus task force leader Vice-President Mike Pence said 24% of the counties in the US have had no reported coronavirus cases. He added that half of US states have fewer than 2,500 cases. The Trump administration had previously pencilled in 1 May as a possible date to reopen the nation, and on Wednesday Mr Trump said some states may be able to reopen earlier than that. However, some health experts and state governors have cautioned against reopening the economy too soon. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, told AP news 1 May was ""a bit overly optimistic"" for many areas of the country, as a strong testing and tracing system would be needed before social distancing measures were lifted. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday that his state would remain under stay-at-home orders until 15 May. Officials in the state, which is the epicentre of the outbreak in the US, say the situation is showing signs of stabilising this week, though there are still hundreds of deaths daily. The governors of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky have announced they will work together to reopen the region. ""We recognise that our economies are all reliant on each other, and we must work together to safely reopen them so hardworking people can get back to work and businesses can get back on their feet,"" they said in a statement on Thursday. There was no timeline offered, but the governors said they planned to phase in sectors of the economy. In Michigan, which has seen over 1,700 deaths due to the virus, there has been pushback against Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stringent lockdown measures. On Wednesday, residents took to the streets after the governor announced the stay-at-home order would be extended.

"There was an unmistakable sense of conviction in Tom Moore's voice as he addressed the camera after completing his walk. ""To all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment,"" he said, addressing a British public who have seen life turned upside down by coronavirus. ""The sun will shine on you again, and the clouds will go away."" Moments before, the then 99-year-old war veteran had completed the 100th lap of a sponsored walk around his Bedfordshire garden. With service medals pinned to his breast pocket, and clutching his walking frame, he crossed the finish line at a slow but determined pace. In just a few days, Mr Moore, nicknamed Captain Tom by his growing legion of fans, had risen from nowhere to the status of near national treasure. When he had started fundraising for the walk, it had been with the modest aim of raising Â£1,000. Inspired by the dedicated work of medics, Captain Tom had wanted to thank the ""magnificent"" NHS staff who had helped him with cancer treatment and a broken hip. By the time he had reached the finish line, he had become a social media phenomenon and raised an astonishing Â£12m. By the teatime the same day, donations had risen to Â£15m. And the total keeps growing and growing and has now passed Â£30m. Alongside the donations, Captain Tom had inspired the sort of intense fandom more commonly associated with Instagram influencers. Schoolchildren had been inspired to send cards for his 100th birthday. Artists had produced illustrations celebrating his achievements. Artist Rebecca Osborne had her cartoon of Captain Tom liked more than 17,000 times Rebecca Osborne is one of those who fell under Captain Tom's spell. As the coronavirus headlines began to dominate, his fundraising gave her hope. ""We've been watching the figures go up, and instead of watching those figures go up I could watch the money go up for the NHS,"" she says, referring to Captain Tom's online fundraising page. Veteran's NHS fundraiser hits 'incredible' Â£14m In normal times, Rebecca sketches at live events. But since the outbreak, she has turned her artistic talents to drawing cartoons of key workers, asking people to donate to the NHS when they share them online. She didn't expect her sketch of Captain Tom, shown at the top of this page, to be liked more than thousands of times after it was shared from his Twitter account. He inspired her because, despite being in a vulnerable category, she says, he has chosen to do ""something that nobody else has done"". ""It's setting a very good example to everybody that we can all do something."" Fellow cartoonist Graeme Bandeira - whose office at the Yorkshire Post is about 20 miles from Captain Tom's hometown, Keighley - says he personifies the endurance that the country needs to get through this epidemic. He chose to depict Tom Moore crossing a red finish line to emphasise his ""phenomenal achievement"". ""He epitomises what Yorkshire folk are about: tough, gritty, stern exteriors. They sort of fight from within, you know? They're very proud people."" Born in 1920, Tom Moore trained as a civil engineer before enlisting in the Army for World War Two, rising to captain. He served in India and Burma. His military experience features prominently in the many messages of support he has received on social media. There have been calls for him to be knighted, online and on the notice board of at least one London Tube station, thanks to the anonymous duo All On The Board. One member of the pair, who both work for London Underground, says most people have ""huge admiration and respect for those who fought in the war"". Allow Instagram content?

""Those who survived it have seen the best and worst of humanity. So when someone like Captain Tom does what he has done it will galvanise people and work wonders. Individually we all have our own invisible enemies to fight, in regards to health and mental health and we are having to fight this invisible enemy too. We all have to unite to fight it."" It is clear that Captain Tom's appeal spans generations. In mid-April, Only Fools and Horses star John Challis called for him to be made an honorary Army major - prompting a flood of support from fans of the 1980s sitcom. ""100% agree,"" one Twitter user commented. ""He is a hero,"" wrote another. More than 150 miles from the Trotters' Peckham stomping ground, in Port Talbot, south Wales, eight-year-old Reegan Davies set up her own campaign to thank Captain Tom. In a video posted on Twitter, she asked children around the country to send him a card for his 100th birthday on 30 April. Reegan Davies, who started the campaign to send Captain Tom 100th birthday cards ""I had never [seen] a 100-year-old before,"" she says on the phone, explaining why she wrote her own card. He was a war hero. Now he's my hero and he's the nation's hero."" Her mum, Lisa Carter, says her daughter's campaign is evidence of young people ""giving back"". ""It finally shows the younger generation are looking up to the older generation,"" she says. ""There's always been something negative in the media - that they don't respect their elders, and things like that. I think it's just brought everyone together."" Kyle Dowling, from Sheffield, was inspired to draw his own cartoon of Captain Tom by the sense of patriotism he feels he has stirred. ""This hero has fought for our country and is now fighting again for our country by raising millions for our health service,"" he says. ""He's a true gent and really does put the great into Great Britain."" For Kyle, Captain Tom's assurance that ""the clouds will go away"" is a great comfort during the lockdown. ""It's helped me smile and thinkâ¦ it's not forever. Tomorrow is just another step towards it being over.""

"Macron's remarks came after a row over an article by a Chinese diplomat criticising Western response to coronavirus French President Emmanuel Macron has questioned China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Macron told the Financial Times it was ""naive"" to suggest China had dealt better with the crisis, adding things ""happened that we don't know about"". More people have died in the US and several European countries than in China where the virus emerged. The US and the UK have also cast doubt on China's figures and the speed with which it responded or alerted others. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised China's measures. Follow the latest coronavirus updates Worldwide, more than two million people have been infected and more than 145,000 have died. The US,France, Italy and Spain are amongst the worst affected countries. France has seen 141,000 cases of Covid-19 and nearly 18,000 deaths. China has recorded 4,632 deaths - including an extra 1,290 deaths announced on Friday in the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic started and where a strict lockdown has only recently been lifted. Local officials said early reporting there had been delayed and inaccurate. President Macron's interview came after a weekend of tension which saw the summoning of the Chinese ambassador to Paris by the French foreign ministry to express disapproval over an article on the Chinese embassy's website that said Western countries had left the elderly to die in care homes. The article - by an unnamed diplomat - was seen by France as a reference to the situation in its care homes,external, which make up a large number of deaths attributed to the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19.

Government spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had never made any negative comments about how France was coping with the epidemic ""and has no intention of making any"". Mr Macron was asked if China's authoritarian response to bring the outbreak under control had exposed the weakness of Western democracies, and responded that there was no comparison between open societies and those where truth was suppressed. ""Given these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let's not be so naive as to say it's been much better at handling this,"" he said.

You can't abandon your fundamental DNA on the grounds that there is a health crisis."" Many Western officials are coming under pressure to explain why the coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on their populations - proportionally much smaller than China's. The UK and the US have led the charge that China's figures and explanations cannot be trusted. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told a news conference on Thursday that ""hard questions"" would have be asked about how the outbreak started ""and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier"". He said there would have to be a ""deep dive"" into how the virus was able to spread from China and said it could not be ""business as usual"" after the crisis. US President Donald Trump has also taken a harder line against China. On Wednesday, asked why the US accounted for such a high proportion of the global death toll, he responded: ""Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?"" he said, naming China. This video can not be played Donald Trump was recently asked if the virus emanated in a laboratory, rather than market He said the US was also looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan rather than in a market in the city. Can we trust China claims of virus success? Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release theory? Fox News in the US, citing unnamed sources, has suggested that the coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols.

""We've had a lot of intelligence look at that. And I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain."" There is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus was released accidentally from a lab, says the BBC's science editor Paul Rincon.

"President Trump said lockdown protesters being treated ""rough"", after calling for the ""liberation"" of some states Vice-President Mike Pence said states have enough test kits to begin reopening today The WHO advised countries to plot a cautious path out of lockdown rather than relying on antibody tests The UK launched a vaccine taskforce, funding 21 research projects The UK death toll reached 14,576 as 847 new deaths are reported in hospitals Germany said its outbreak is under control - each virus carrier is infecting less than one other person on average China denies cover-up of Wuhan outbreak, where the pandemic began, despite revised death toll There have now been more than 2.15 million confirmed cases worldwide and 145,000 deaths Edited by Jude Sheerin Thanks for tuning in to today's live coverage. We're wrapping things up now but before we go, here's some of the biggest stories of the day. Trump says he hopes to get back on the campaign trail soon, and that social mitigation measures won't be required as they are in the White House press briefing room. Having half as many journalists in the room means his news conferences, ""loses, to me, a lot of flavour"", he says. ""I certainly hope we can have rallies,"" he adds, saying they are ""a tremendous way of getting the word out"". He ends by calling campaign rallies, ""an important part of politics actually"". Trump says he is pleased with the US response so far. He cites his decision to trust his vice-president and ""listening to my gut"". Trump repeats his assertion that if not for his administration's actions, at least two million Americans would have died, and maybe ""much more than that"". The president's critics accuse him of trying to spin tens of thousands of US deaths as a win. Trump, seen through the White House windows Trump disputes figures suggesting the US is leading the world in coronavirus-related deaths. ""We don't have the most-in-the-world deaths.  The most in the world has to be China,"" he says. Numbers released by Johns Hopkins University say the US is leading the world in total deaths. But on Friday China said it had recalculated the Wuhan death toll to be 4,000 higher, after changing its counting technique. A conservative reporter asks why the Obama administration gave a $3.7m grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where unnamed US officials have speculated in US media that the coronavirus may have leaked. ""Why would the US have a grant like that to China?"" asks the One America News Network journalist. Trump says: ""We will end that grant very quickly."" ""Who was president then, I wonder?"" says Trump, noting the grant was made in 2015. The Washington Post reported this week that US diplomats were concerned about safety protocols at the Wuhan lab and asked for more help. The French president said today there was no evidence for the Wuhan lab coronavirus origin theory. Trump is asked about an accusation by Washington Governor Jay Inslee that the president was fomenting rebellion by encouraging states to liberate themselves from lockdowns. He is asked how that squares with the ""sober and methodical guidance"" he issued yesterday. Trump says of certain stay-at-home orders: ""Elements of what theyâve done is too much."" He specifically mentions Virginia, which has closed firing ranges after designating them non-essential businesses. Asked if he is concerned that protesters will spread the disease, Trump says: âNo, these are people expressing their views. ""I see where they are and I see the way they are working. They seem to be very responsible to me. Theyâve been treated a little bit rough.â After President Trump steps out of the briefing room, top US infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci says totally unprompted that the government made mistakes in the early days of the pandemic. ""No doubt, no doubt that early on we had a problem,"" he says referring to the initial US inability to conduct mass testing. He adds: ""It was a problem that was a technical problem from within. ""It was an issue of embracing, the way we have now and should have, the private sector, who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them."" This is uncomfortable because the official who has been widely blamed for the testing setback - Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control - was also on stage at the briefing. Dr Fauci's comment is, yet again, unlikely to endear him to the president, who never likes to admit error. Trump recently shared a retweet with the hashtag ""#FireFauci"". Dr Fauci's lack of harmony with White House talking points has triggered attacks from some Trump supporters who see him as a disloyal globalist infiltrator. Dr Anthony Fauci says people may require as many as one test every other day to be sure they have not recently become infected. He says he himself was tested negative today. ""We've been hearing testing is everything and it isn't,"" he says, stressing that mitigation strategies tamp down outbreaks. Dr Fauci, the top US disease expert, points out it is not necessarily testing that contained the spread of other viruses like HIV/AIDS, but rather strict mitigation practices. Vice-President Mike Pence says states have enough test kits in supply to begin moving to phase one of the plan that the White House outlined on Thursday. He says that 120,000 tests are being done each day in hospitals around the US. But some experts have said the US will need to test millions of people daily before the nation can start returning to economic normality. Phase one calls for schools to remain shut and social distancing measure to stay in place. Businesses should continue teleworking and groups of 10 should remain banned. A coronavirus testing site in New York Trump notes that the federal government made available 2,900 extra hospital beds for New York City, but they did not end needing the capacity at the Javits Center or the US Navy hospital ship that was sent to Manhattan. He says âwe wanted to err on the side of caution - this is what the governors wantedâ. âWe did a spectacular job,â Trump says. âI think Iâd rather tell you that we were over-prepared, than we were under-prepared, and that was a good faith effort by New York,â he says. These appear to be gracious comments about Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo - the two were feuding just earlier today. Trump has been accused by critics of being under-prepared for the pandemic. While the government took action in late January by limiting travel from China, Mr Trump downplayed the virus for weeks, and did not advise all Americans to socially distance themselves until mid March.  Trump complains that ""very partisan and misleading voices in the media and politics"" have voiced concerns about how quickly the US has scaled up testing. Without naming New York state's governor, who said earlier today that the federal government must move quicker to provide testing, he says that some people have been ""demonstrating a complete failure to imagine the scope of the testing abilities we have brought online."" The US got off to the difficult start with testing for coronavirus -initially it tested far fewer people than other countries, and Dr Fauci said in March that the US was ""failing"" on testing. It has since massively ramped up its testing numbers, although somebusiness leaders have said that ""vastly more testing capacity"" is needed,externalto help get the economy back up and running.  Trump begins by saying he has been speaking with faith leaders about the plan he outlined yesterday, which calls for a ""phased, safe and gradual reopening of America"". He says the guidelines provide governors with the ""fact-driven and science based metrics they will need"" to end lockdowns in their states. Trump also announces a new $19bn (Â£15bn) relief programme for farmers and ranchers. It's called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Programme, and includes $16bn in direct payments, says Trump. The US government also plans to purchase $3bn in food products to distribute to food banks and Americans in need. Trump had already announced $28bn in aid for farmers affected by tariffs, as of the end of last year. Donald Trump is now hosting the White House coronavirus taskforce daily briefing. He is joined by taskforce co-ordinator Deborah Birx, top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Robert Redfield. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue is also on stage. You canwatch it live here. The Trump campaign team have confirmed they are planning to restart rallies on the campaign trail. However it is unclear when these rallies will start and whether they would implement social distancing. The campaign did not mention whether they would prioritise ""low risk"" states first. Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director, said: ""The coronavirus will pass and the president is looking forward to getting back out on the campaign trail and holding rallies."" The news comes a day after President Trump announced his plan to reopen America. The plan included guidance for governors on reopening state economies in the coming months. The daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefing is due to begin imminently. It comes as President Trump feuds with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo over whether the federal government is doing enough to help states fight the pandemic. Cuomo said on Friday that the federal government must be responsible for importing PPE and testing equipment from China, rather than each individual state. Trump swiftly hit back, saying Cuomo should stop ""complaining"" and be grateful for the federal assistance he has already received. On Thursday, the White House released guidelines for governors to consider when determining how to reopen their state. The three phases outlined by the White House call for robust testing for all medical workers - something the US has yet to accomplish on a wide scale - in order to move towards a ""new normal"". Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent A UK government scheme to release prisoners early in order to help jails cope with coronavirus has been suspended after six offenders were freed by mistake. The inmates were mistakenly let out of two ""open"" prisons - Leyhill in Gloucestershire and Sudbury, Derbyshire. A spokesperson for the prisons service said they were ""low-risk"" offenders who ""returned compliantly to prison when asked to do so"". However, the mistake is deeply embarrassing for Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who has emphasised the rigorous checks that would take place before inmates are let out. The prison service attributed the release to âhuman errorâ and said processes were being changed to reduce the likelihood of it happening again. Up to 4,000 prisoners, who are due to be freed within two months, are eligible for the early release programme across England and Wales. On Tuesday officials said four had been released with âhundredsâ more due to be freed this week. Fourteen pregnant prisoners and mothers with babies had also been freed early, by Tuesday. Sailors on the Roosevelt have their temperatures taken earlier this month (FILE PHOTO) The US Navy will begin antibody testing of the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier that has docked in Guam amid an outbreak of coronavirus. ""We have scheduled the outbreak investigation to begin Monday and we are seeking crew member volunteers to provide an additional swab sample and a routine blood draw for laboratory testing,"" announced Navy Surgeon General Rear Admiral Bruce Gillingham, adding that crew would be asked to answer a survey. The ship, which includes a crew of 5,000, has been allowed to wait in Guam as the sailors quarantine in local hotels. More than 500 crew members have so far tested positive, and one has died. Testing for antibodies, which tries to establish if someone has previously had coronavirus, has only been created in the past week. The accuracy of the tests is still questionable, and it's unclear whether the presence of antibodies in the blood does actually indicate immunity.The BBC's James Gallagher explained more a little earlier. Katy WatsonBBC South America correspondent In Ecuador, the death toll stands at 403 but new figures from one province suggest thousands have died. The government in Guayas province reported 6,700 deaths in the first two weeks of April, far more than the usual 1,000 deaths there in the same period. The first recorded case was of an Ecuadorean woman returning from Spain. It backs the perception in Latin America that Covid-19 is a rich person's disease - a virus introduced to the region by affluent parts of society who had been travelling abroad. The high death toll is also a devastating consequence of the combination of an overburdened healthcare system and a deeply unequal society which means not everybody is able - or willing - to socially distance and stop work. Authorities argue they were quick to impose strict regulations and people chose to disregard measures but experts argue more could be done - and one thing that could help is testing. While Ecuador is not the worst offender in the region, low testing rates have made it very difficult to understand how the virus has moved through communities, some of which have been devastated by the high death toll.

Hundreds of classical musicians and singers - from the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain and the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain - led a mass doorstep singalong to the legendary composer's most famous melody. Musicians of all levels, and playing any instrument, were invited to get involved in the rousing crowd-pleaser. And people of all ages, using string instruments to synthesisers, turned out in their droves. Here are a selection of some of the participants... Allow Twitter content?

Ninety-five people died with coronavirus in California in the latest 24-hour period, making it the state's deadliest day so far. Governor Gavin Newsom said that the spike was due to a few hotspots, including a nursing home in Tulare County, south-east of Fresno. Local media reported that the state'stotal death toll was expected to surpass 1,000,externalby the end of Friday. All of the losses are, of course, tragic. However, so far the death toll in California - a state of 40 million people - is a fraction of what experts predicted, the BBC's Regan Morris reports. Here she looks at how California kept ahead of the curve.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"There have been UK protests about the lack of PPE for nursing staff The health secretary has said that thousands of pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) will arrive in the UK on Friday as the government faces criticism over shortages. Matt Hancock said that 55,000 more gowns were due to arrive, but admitted there was ""a huge challenge"". He added: ""We are tight on gowns and that is the pressure point."" The government has been criticised for not providing enough PPE for healthcare workers during the coronavirus crisis. An earlier version of this story reported that a director of a large NHS trust had contacted the BBC with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff. The person concerned is not a director of a trust - the BBC has since been told he is currently part of a network of organisations helping to source PPE for some NHS trusts during the pandemic. For a number of weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and government ministers have said during press briefings and interviews that firms including Burberry will begin making personal protective equipment on behalf of the government as one of the answers to a critical shortage. Asked about the PPE produced by such manufacturers, Mr Hancock praised the ""national effort"" but urged more companies to come forward. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Mr Hancock said on Friday that PPE was a ""precious resource"" and that maintaining supplies was challenging due to the ""very high"" global demand. Latest statistics revealed the UK recorded another 861 coronavirus-related deaths in hospital, taking the total to 13,729. The overall figure does not include hundreds more who have died in residential and nursing homes. On Thursday, as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension of lockdown restrictions for ""at least"" another three weeks, he said there remained ""issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes"". Among five conditions he said must be met before curbs on daily life could be lifted were making sure the NHS could cope and ensuring PPE supplies could meet demand. In other developments: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have acknowledged the coronavirus pandemic is""stressful"" for many, and urged people to look after their mental health. Prince William also praised NHS workers, saying they were making the nation proud with their ""stoicism and determination"" People struggling with payday loans, car finance and pawn shop borrowing will begranted a payment holiday under plans by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak first began, has raised its death toll by 50% - equal to 1,290 cases - attributing it to updated reporting and more deaths from outside hospitals being counted Meanwhile, China, the world's second biggest economy, has reportedits worst economic performance in decades as the impact of the virus hits, with its GDP figures for the first quarter of 2020 showing its economy shrank 6.8% US President Donald Trump has issued guidance to governors for how they may gradually ease their state lockdown measures as part of his""Opening up America Again"" plan Last week, Mr Hancock said there was ""enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance"", adding there was a ""huge task"" to make sure those who need it get it. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. Has the NHS got enough PPE? 'Last resort' plans revealed for PPE reuse by health workers 'Herculean effort' to provide NHS protective gear The shortage of non-surgical gowns is a critical problem facing the NHS as it struggles to secure enough kit for frontline staff. A leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a ""last resort"". This video can not be played For a fourth week, people clap to show appreciation for health professionals and other key workers As the world fights coronavirus, the demand for gowns is at levels never seen before. Almost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East. These decisions have been driven by cost, as all sectors seek the cheapest prices. But as every country in the world fights for finite supplies, a UK solution has been sought. The government and management consultancy Deloitte approached well known UK garment brands asking if they could help make PPE. They also requested that UK manufacturers complete a survey to share what they could make. Earlier this week, Barbour began distributing gowns from its factory in the north-east of England. Burberry is still making the final adjustments to its factory and production is expected to start next week. Getting a supply chain formalised using UK factories has been difficult. UK garment factories approached by the BBC have said the government does not fully understand what is possible in the UK, and which firms could produce what. This lack of understanding has caused production delays. Delays around certification of gowns for use is also slowing down the manufacturing process. Some factories say it could be another two weeks before the necessary paperwork is signed off and they can manufacture the gowns. This comes as factories around the UK are empty. Machinists and pattern cutters have been sent home and furloughed. To add to the frustration of factory bosses, they say they're getting upsetting calls from NHS hospitals and workers begging for gowns. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Adequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic."" Nearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said. ""There is also a 24-hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report supply disruption. ""We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need and it is crucial the guidance for protective equipment is followed closely,"" the spokesman added. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that a director of a large NHS trust had contacted the BBC with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff. The person concerned is not a director of a trust - the BBC has since been told he is currently part of a network of organisations helping to source personal protective equipment for some NHS trusts during the pandemic.
