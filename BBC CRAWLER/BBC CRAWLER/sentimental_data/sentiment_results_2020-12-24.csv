"This video can not be played The rescue of the car-trapped couple from ""freezing"" flood water was ""touch and go"" say eyewitnesses A couple have been rescued from a submerged car in what onlookers called a ""Christmas miracle"". Footage showed fire crews removing a man and a woman from the vehicle at about 10:44 GMT on Christmas Eve near Norwich. Norfolk Police said they were investigating, and the couple were taken to hospital by ambulance. The county saw almost two inches of rain (50mm)causing major flash floodsacross south Norfolk. Alex and Matt Emmerson witnessed the drama unfold in the flooded lane next to their house Eyewitnesses Matt and Alex Emmerson, aged 42 and 44, noticed the car from their bathroom window about 15 minutes before the emergency services arrived. They had assumed the vehicle was empty until crews began their rescue. ""Whoever this poor couple were, they were in there for a long time - close to two hours. The water must have been freezing,"" said Mr Emmerson. The East of England Ambulance Service said both patients were transported to hospital for ""further assessment and treatment."" Fire crews rescued two people from a submerged car Mrs Emmerson said flooding near their home in Green Lane, Thorpe End, was a regular occurrence during heavy rain. ""I just assumed that there would be nobody in there,"" she added. ""Because normally people leap out and wade to safety before it gets to that point."" Her husband - who called the rescue a ""Christmas miracle"" - said a firefighter went straight into the water and smashed a car window to gain access ""despite the water coming up to his chin"". The couple said permanent signs, rather than temporary ones, were needed to warn drivers about the regular risk of flooding. One of the submerged car's occupants was believed to be aged 70 Two cars were found submerged under the bridge at Thorpe End, Norwich; one was empty Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said it had received more than 300 calls about flooding since Wednesday afternoon, as some areas received a month of rainfall in 24 hours. Tim Edwards of Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said a major incident had been declared and advised people to stay away from flooded areas. ""It's very difficult to know exact depths.

"This video can not be played Up to 10 sperm whales have been stranded on the East Yorkshire coast Ten sperm whales found washed up on the North Sea coast have died. The pod was first spotted on a beach between Tunstall and Withernsea, near Hull, at about 08:30 GMT. Members of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said poor weather conditions and the size of the whales meant it was impossible to save them. A spokesperson said the young whales were ""in very poor nutritional condition"" and had most likely suffered a ""navigation error"". They rarely survive long once stranded, the group said. The BDMLR has been involved in the rescue of marine wildlife since its formation in 1988 According to the BDMLR the size of the sperm whales - which can reach 65ft (20m) in length and weigh up to 80 tonnes - meant there were no safe methods for lifting and moving them. A member of the public called 999 to report the stranding, and the coastguard was despatched to the scene. Ch Supt Darren Downs, of Humberside Police, urged people to stay away from the area ""to allow teams from HM Coastguard to manage what is an extremely distressing scene"". He warned that gathering in groups posed a risk of spreading Covid-19. Marine expert Robin Petch said younger males can end up ""confused in shallower water off the east coast"" Robin Petch, a marine expert and Sea Watch Foundation ambassador, said: ""Sperm whales are a species that shouldn't come into this part of the North Sea, but a few come down that way. ""They are a deep-water animal that feed on squid and dive in the deep waters of the continental shelf. Often younger males can end up confused in the shallower water off the east coast. ""Once they are ashore, chances of survival are very slim, none of the rescue equipment can deal with whales that big. ""The loss of a large group, probably of young males, is catastrophic,"" Mr Petch added.

"The BBC has received 266 complaints about a scene in The Vicar Of Dibley, referencing the Black Lives Matter movement. In last week's Christmas episode, Dawn French's character, Reverend Geraldine Granger, took the knee and delivered a sermon about racism. The corporation has previously defended the sitcom scene. It said in a statement it ""was in keeping with the character and the theme of the show"". French's character is shown being filmed by parishioner and farmer Owen Newitt as she tells the audience she has been preoccupied with the ""horror show"" of thedeath of George Floyd, who died while in US police custody. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man, was killed in May while being arrested by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, sparking anti-racism protests around the world. In the scene, the vicar noted that Dibley, the fictional Oxfordshire village, is ""not the most diverse community"", and encouraged its residents to get behind the anti-racism campaign, which gained pace around the real world following Mr Floyd's death. Some viewers of the episode criticised it on social media. ""A lovely calm day, full of humanity, compassion and support all round..."" responded French, at the timeon Twitter,external.

"King Felipe VI delivered the traditional annual speech from Zarzuela Palace in Madrid Spain's King Felipe VI made a veiled allusion to his self-exiled father's scandals in his Christmas address, saying ""ethics are above family ties"". It was a small interlude in a speech centring on the coronavirus pandemic, where the king thanked health workers. The former king, Juan Carlos, fled to Abu Dhabi in August as corruption allegations mounted. Juan Carlos has denied wrongdoing but his departure heightened debate about the future of the country's monarchy. There has been much speculation as to whether Felipe VI would reference the controversy in the annual speech. According to El Pais newspaper, many felt it would be impossible to ignore in an end-of-year address, though no-one was sure how he would go about acknowledging the ""elephant in the room"". Spain's ex-king Juan Carlos confirmed to be in UAE Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune The king, his lover - and the elephant in the palace Though he did not specifically mention his father, many felt the connection was clear. ""In 2014, during my induction into parliament, I referred to the moral and ethical principles that citizens expect of us. Principles that apply to us all without exception, and that prevail over all considerations, whatever their nature may be, personal or familial,"" said the monarch. He recognised that many families were dealing with grief and spending the holidays apart. And he spoke of a ""great national effort"" was needed to overcome the difficulties Covid-19 had caused. He ruled for close to 40 years, before handing power to his son in 2014. This decision came after a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant-hunting holiday in the middle of Spain's financial crisis. In June this year, Spain's Supreme Court launched a further investigation into Juan Carlos's alleged involvement in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, after the ex-king lost his immunity from prosecution following his abdication. Then in August, the ex-king made the shock announcement that he was leaving Spain. He has denied all allegations against him and said he would be available for interviews with prosecutors.

"Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh was convicted of Daniel Pearl's murder in 2002 and was acquitted in 2020 A court in Pakistan has ordered the release of the British-born militant who was accused of killing an American journalist in 2002. Omar Sheikh was acquitted of Daniel Pearl's murder earlier this year but had remained in jail after an appeal against that decision began. The Sindh High Court in Karachi has now ruled that Mr Sheikh's temporary detention was illegal. A lawyer for Mr Sheikh said he could be released within the next 24 hours. The abduction and gruesome beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl in the southern city of Karachi prompted shock and outrage. No release for man acquitted of Daniel Pearl murder Parents of murdered journalist launch appeal in Pakistan Mr Sheikh was arrested days after Pearl's kidnapping and later convicted of the murder by an anti-terrorism court. He had been on death row since the conviction. But in April this year, the Sindh High Court downgraded Mr Sheikh's conviction to the lesser crime of kidnapping, and acquitted three other men connected to the case. Mr Sheikh's lawyer spoke to the media outside the Sindh High Court on Thursday The decision drew condemnation from Mr Pearl's family. They and the Pakistani government have challenged the decision, in a case that is ongoing. It is not yet clear if more measures can be used to keep Mr Sheikh in detention while the appeal is heard. The USstate department condemned the ruling,external, and said it had been assured the accused had not been released ""at this time"". Pledging to support the Pearl family, it said: ""We continue to honour Daniel Pearl's legacy as a courageous journalist."" Mr Pearl, who was the Wall Street Journal's South Asia bureau chief, went missing in January 2002. He had been researching links between Islamist militant activity in Karachi and Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a passenger plane using bombs hidden in his shoes. Prosecutors accused Mr Sheikh of luring him to a meeting with an Islamic cleric. Mr Pearl and Mr Sheikh had built a relationship discussing concerns about their wives, who were both pregnant at the time. Daniel Pearl went missing in Karachi in 2002 while researching extremism Soon after Mr Pearl disappeared, Pakistani and US news organisations received emails from the previously unknown National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty. The group made a list of demands, including better treatment for Pakistani prisoners in the US. Almost a month later, a video showing the 38-year-old's beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi. Born in London in 1973, Mr Sheikh attended an independent school before going on to study at the London School of Economics. He did not graduate, failing to return after driving aid to Bosnia after his first year. He was arrested in India in 1994 and served time in prison in connection with the kidnapping of four tourists - three British and one American. He was released from jail as part of demands by militants who hijacked a plane in 1999. In American media reports citing government officials, Mr Sheikh has been accused of transferring money to one of the militants involved in the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US.

"Prosecutors accused Michael Jackson of grooming children at the Neverland ranch, allegations he denied The Neverland ranch of the late pop star Michael Jackson has reportedly been sold to a billionaire investor for a quarter of its initial asking price. Ron Burkle, a former friend of Jackson, recently bought the estate in Los Olivos, California, his spokesman said. He paid $22m (Â£16.2m) for Neverland,the Wall Street Journal reported,external, citing public records and three people familiar with the deal. The 2,700-acre (1,100 hectare) compound was first listed for $100m in 2015. Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch up for sale Since then Neverland, north of Santa Barbara city, has been on and off the market, listed most recently last year for the lower price of $31m. Jackson originally paid about $19.5m for Neverland, which he named after a fictional island where children never grow up in âJM Barrie's Peter Pan story. Jackson bought the estate in 1987 but struggled to pay for it The Thriller singer bought Neverland in 1987, making it his home during the height of his fame. He turned the ranch into an entertainment complex, building a zoo and fairground on site, where he regularly entertained children and their families. In the 1990s and 2000s, Neverland became the centre of various investigations into child sexual assault allegations against Jackson. Jackson turned the ranch into a playground for children Jackson denied allegations by Santa Barbara prosecutors that he had used Neverland as a fantasy world to groom young boys. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of allegations he abused a 13-year-old boy at the ranch. Jackson never returned to Neverland. Four years later, in June 2009, Jackson died at another home in Los Angeles after suffering a cardiac arrest induced by a drug overdose. Since his death Jackson has been the subject of further abuse allegations, includingthose made in a documentary called Leaving Neverland in 2019. The estate had a zoo and fairground on site Neverland has been rebranded as Sycamore Valley Ranch and has undergone extensive redevelopment since Jackson's death. Mr Burkle's spokesman said the businessman saw the investment as a land banking opportunity. He spotted the estate from the air while looking at another location and contacted Tom Barrack, the founder of real-estate investment company Colony Capital LLC, to seal the sale. Mr Burkle, 68, is co-founder and managing partner of Yucaipa Companies, LLC, a private investment firm. His net worth as of 24 December 2020 was estimated to be $1.4bn,according to a profile by American business magazine Forbes,external.

"About 4,000 lorries have been parked at Manston Airport overnight It could take days to clear the backlog of lorries waiting to cross to France, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says. Drivers have been warned they may have to spend Christmas in their cabs. About 4,000 lorries are parked at Manston Airport in Kent, with another 2,300 being held on the M20 after the French closed their border with the UK. Crossings will continue over Christmas but all drivers are required to test negative for Covid-19 before being allowed into France. Tests are being administered by members of the military and French firefighters. Polish defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak saidin a tweet,externalthat a team of territorial soldiers was being sent to the UK to support the testing effort. Of the 2,367 drivers tested by 12:00 GMT, three have tested positive, Mr Shapps said. ""Spending days in a lorry on your own puts you in an extremely low risk category,"" he added. Croatian driver Ante Kostelac told the BBC: ""All hopes for Christmas with the family are over. ""I'm still waiting for testing at the airport, when asked when it will be, I got the answer 'who knows'."" ""I'll obviously be at this airport for Christmas."" Operation Stack has been put in place on the M20 allowing lorries queuing for the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel terminal to be held on the motorway. The Port of Dover said fewer than 100 freight vehicles had passed through overnight due to the restrictions on testing. ""However, now testing has fully mobilised at the port we anticipate that figure rising significantly throughout the day,"" a spokesman said. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Shapps said: ""It will take several days to clear the backlog."" ""The one thing that people can do is not turn up in Kent; it won't get you through faster, indeed it will make things more difficult on the ground. ""The testing is happening and the negative tests are coming through now, and with police's help clearing the entrance to Dover, the traffic is able to move, and with Eurotunnel's help, things are just starting to move. ""It's never going to be a quick operation."" The head of the Road Haulage Association said he sympathised with the small number of lorrydrivers who clashed with policein Dover on Wednesday. Richard Burnett said: ""I really feel for these drivers that have ended up being pawns in a larger game. ""Are they going to be held here until Boxing Day or beyond?"" Testing is under way at the Port of Dover with traffic slowly moving through this morning. Many of the drivers have spent two, three or even four nights in their cabs with no toilet or washing facilities. It's not just hauliers either. There are hundreds of vans full of workers from across Europe and families with small children trying to get home in time for Christmas. Some drivers queuing through the town centre told me they've only moved 100m since the port reopened. I saw a few arguments breaking out at junctions where drivers were perceived to be pushing in. The main routes through Dover are still largely blocked although there are definitely more police around today redirecting traffic away from the gridlock.

"The additional numbers will come from the UK's high readiness Standby Battalions An additional 800 military personnel are to be sent to Kent on Christmas Day to help clear a backlog of lorries waiting to cross to France. About 4,000 lorries are still waiting to cross the English Channel after the French closed their border with the UK. Drivers must test negative for Covid-19 before boarding a train or ferry. The extra support will take the number of military personnel delivering testing to drivers in Kent to about 1,100. French firefighters have been supporting the testing effort, while the Polish defence ministersaid in a tweet,externalthat a team of territorial army soldiers would be sent to Kent. A group of Polish medics was deployed to the UK on Thursday to help test drivers. the Polish news website TVN24 has reported. French firefighters have helped administer Covid tests at Dover Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that of the 2,367 drivers tested by 12:00 GMT on Christmas Eve, three have tested positive. Ferries will continue to operate from Dover over Christmas, but Mr Shapps said it could take several days to clear the backlog. The military will organise welfare facilities and the distribution of food and water. ""Our aim is to get foreign hauliers home with their families as quickly as we can,"" Mr Shapps said. ""I know it's been hard for many drivers cooped up in their cabs at this precious time of year, but I assure them that we are doing our utmost to get them home,"" he added. Volunteers have delivered thousands of meals and food parcels to drivers parked up at Manston Airport and along the M20 as many spend Christmas Day in their vehicles.

"Schools and universities may need to close, on top of tier 4 restrictions, to bring the new UK coronavirus variant under control, a rapid analysis says. The work,which is still preliminary,external, calculates the variant is spreading 56% faster than other forms of the virus. The researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine say whether schools can stay open is the key question for the New Year. Keeping children in school has been a political priority. The pandemic has disrupted the education of millions of children andaffected their mental health. The variant is thought to have emerged in Kent in Septemberand now accounts for around two-thirds of cases in London, the south-east and the east of England. This research suggests the variant could be causing 90% of cases in these areas by mid-January. It is already thought to have spread widely across the country - the latest Office for National Statistics data suggests 40% of cases in the south-west of England could be the variant. Sharp rises in infection levels in England, says ONS UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Covid variant find âdue to work of UK scientistsâ Work to understand how it behaves and what this means for the months ahead is happening at lightning speed. There is still much uncertainty and the study uses mathematical modelling to analyse trends in the variant's spread. It said data on people's movements, from surveys and Google, could not explain the variant's surge. Instead, the report said the evidence pointed to the new variant being more infectious ""with some evidence that the increase may be particularly marked in children"". As a result it concluded it will take more effort to control the virus. One of the worrying features is the variant spread during the English lockdown in November when the other versions of the virus were in decline. That lockdown was similar to the current Tier 4 and the report says the highest level of restrictions are ""unlikely"" to bring cases under control ""unless primary schools, secondary schools and universities are also closed"". It also warns that even if education is shut down ""it is possible that restrictions beyond Tier 4 may be required"". Dr Nick Davies, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said rapid vaccination should blunt the impact of the new variant. Allow Twitter content?

The work has come to roughly the same conclusions as those by Imperial College London which had suggested around a 70% increase in the spread of the virus. There is no evidence to suggest the variant is itself more dangerous or able to cause more severe disease. However, the concern is a virus that can infect more people in a shorter period of time would put increased pressure on the health service. Yesterday, Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England, said: ""The best way to stop infection is to stick to the rules - reduce your contacts, wash our hands, wear a face covering, keep our distance from others and ventilate indoor spaces .""

"Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the House to vote on the stimulus measures on Monday Democrats and Republicans have blocked each other's attempts to amend a vital $900bn (Â£665bn) stimulus package after President Donald Trump sent it back to Congress demanding changes. The coronavirus economic relief, which comes with a $1.4tn federal budget attached, was agreed by both sides. But Mr Trump said one-off payments to Americans should increase from $600 to $2,000, and foreign aid should be cut. Without the bill in force, many Americans face an uncertain Christmas. Unemployment benefits are due to expire on Saturday if the bill is not enacted, and a moratorium on evictions may not be extended. Legislators could pass a stopgap bill by Monday to prevent a partial government shutdown looming a day later, but this would not include coronavirus aid and Mr Trump would still have to sign it. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home Meeting on Thursday in response to Mr Trump's intervention, Democrats in the House of Representatives blocked Republican attempts to cut foreign aid from the federal spending bill, while Republicans refused to allow the increase in coronavirus payments to $2,000. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said in a letter to colleagues: ""House Democrats appear to be suffering from selective hearing."" While the haggling continues on Capitol Hill, the president is spending Christmas at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. A White House memo said he was working ""tirelessly"" with ""many meetings and calls"", though he was spotted at his golf course on Thursday morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the lower chamber would meet again next Monday to vote on the stimulus payments for Americans. This video can not be played Trump asks Congress to amend Covid aid bill On the same day, the House is also expected to vote on an unrelated, $740bn defence spending bill, which Mr Trump vetoed on Wednesday instead of signing into law. Lawmakers plan to override the president's veto and enact the legislation anyway, but to do so they need two-thirds of votes in both the House and Senate. Mr Trump is objecting to provisions in the defence bill that limit troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Europe and remove Confederate leaders' names from military bases. The $900bn coronavirus aid relief bill - with the larger budget bill rolled in - overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate on Monday but a day later Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package in a video statement as a ""disgrace"" full of ""wasteful"" items. He baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. Mr Trump's decision to bat the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he has largely stayed out of negotiations for a coronavirus aid bill that had stalled since last July. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many have questioned why the president waited until now to object. This video can not be played ""I'm not sure how we're going to survive"" The one-off payments of $600 and the federal jobless benefits are half the sum provided by the last major coronavirus aid bill in March, which contained $2.4tn in economic relief. Mr Trump's call for more generous one-off payments to Americans has found him in rare agreement with some liberal Democrats who are usually his sworn political foes. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: ""Glad to see the President is willing to support our legislation."" But many of the president's fellow Republicans are said to be dismayed that Democrats will now depict them as Scrooges for rejecting higher spending. On a conference call Wednesday, House Republicans said Mr Trump had thrown them under a bus, according to the Associated Press news agency. Georgia starts voting in pivotal senate battle Many of them now face the dilemma of choosing between the president and party. Though conservatives are protesting over the spiralling trillion-dollar US deficit, they and the president enacted tax cuts in 2017 that added to America's overdraft. The congressional gridlock comes amid runoff votes in Georgia for two Senate seats that will determine the balance of power in Washington next year. Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are fighting for their political lives in the 5 January special election. Both had backed the aid bill spurned by Mr Trump. If Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock can flip these two seats, their party will control all of Congress and the White House once President-elect Joe Biden takes office later next month.

"John Harding's customers have included Joan Collins, Vanessa Redgrave, Roger Moore and Kristina Tholstrup, and Rod Stewart For 35 years, the rich and famous came to John Harding's central London salon to get their hair cut, coloured, and styled. Joan Collins; Vanessa Redgrave; Rod Stewart; Tony Curtis; Kristina Tholstrup and occasionally husband Roger Moore; Sarah Churchill; and many more. The salon was on Elizabeth Street, Belgravia; a place where leafy garden squares reflect in the polished brass plates of embassies and hedge funds. ""There were lots of wealthy people in the area,"" says John, now 77. ""Lady this and Lady that."" But the actors, singers, and aristocrats who came to John's salon would not have guessed his secret. Unless, that is, they noticed that he rarely answered the phone. That's because, if he did answer, he might need to check the appointments book, or write something down. And that was a problem - because John Harding, hairdresser to the stars, was unable to read. John Harding and wife Heather, pictured about 30 years ago John grew up in Islington, north London, and went to Laycock School. He wasn't uninterested - ""I liked art, geography, history, and my maths was OK"" - but always found reading ""very difficult"". He soon found himself in D class, the bottom rung, and stayed there. He doesn't blame his teachers -""If there's 30 in a class, it's hard to help out"" - or his parents. ""My mum wasn't a very good reader, and my dad wasn't either,"" says John. ""My dad was a working class man - he was in the printing trade, a union man - and he didn't have a lot of vocabulary. He didn't have time to help me, but that was a man of that era."" John could recognise three-letter words from memory, but ""just didn't have any idea how to break longer words down"". ""I couldn't read something that was interesting like a history book or a geography book,"" he says. ""That was too far."" He doesn't think he had dyslexia, but he was never tested. So he stayed in D class, hiding it from friends, bluffing as best he could, until it was time to leave. How did those school days feel? ""It's more of an embarrassment, you know?"" he says. ""I used to get very edgy when it came up."" At 16, it was finally time to leave school. But what jobs were there for boys who couldn't read? He was good with his hands, but didn't want to be a carpenter, electrician, or plumber. ""You had to get up too early,"" he jokes. And so he took a job at the hairdressers round the corner - sweeping the floor, washing the hair, and avoiding the appointments book. John Harding in 1970, aged 28, after opening his first salon After Islington, John progressed to salons in Kennington, Pimlico, then Mayfair. But it was difficult to learn the trade - after all, who wants their hair cut by a beginner? So, in his own time, he went to academies in the evenings. He ""won a few competitions"" and, when John was 20, an ex-colleague asked him to join his new salon in Pimlico. ""He offered me good money,"" says John. ""I told him I'd do it - provided I didn't have to do any bookwork."" It proved a life-changing decision. At Pimlico, the receptionist introduced John to her sister, Heather, and they were soon married. She became one of the few people to know about John's illiteracy. ""She was very clever. She did all that stuff for me."" Looking back, says John, he should have learned to read then. But with a new wife, and soon a young family, he ""put it on the back burner"". It didn't affect his career - aged 25, he opened the successful salon on Elizabeth Street where he would stay for 35 years. But outside the salon, the challenges remained. ""If we went to a restaurant with friends, my wife would say 'You'd fancy this John', knowing full well I couldn't read it on the menu,"" he says. ""Basically, you bluff your way through life. It's crazy the things you make up."" So did any of his customers - Collins, Redgrave, Churchill, et al - know he couldn't read? ""None at all,"" he says. John Harding with daughter Fiona last Christmas In his 50s and 60s, John twice tried to learn at evening classes. ""But I felt I wasn't really getting very far,"" he says. ""It was difficult for the teachers to have time with you. The teacher would let you read alone, then give you 15 minutes of her time. Which is good, but not as good as one to one."" So John may have stayed illiterate. But then, eight years ago, he came home to find Heather - his wife of almost 50 years - dead in their lounge. She had suffered heart failure aged 69. One in six adults in England - about7 million people- has ""very poor literacy skills"", according to OECD statistics quoted by theNational Literacy Trust.,externalThe figure is one in four in Scotland, one in five in Northern Ireland, and one in eight in Wales. Read Easy,external- the group that helped John - says2.5 million adultsin England can ""barely read at all"". ""This has a massive impact on people's chances in life and affects them in so many ways,"" says Ginny Williams-Ellis, Read Easy's founder and chief executive. Without Heather to help him ""bluff"", John decided to try again. His children Gerard, now 53, and Fiona, 51, supported him, but he wanted to fix the problem that had plagued him since those long days at Laycock School. Three years ago he saw an advert forRead Easy,external, a non-profit group that uses volunteers to help teach adults in one-to-one sessions. ""I got in touch,"" says John. ""And I haven't looked back."" Because of Covid, the weekly one-on-one sessions with his coach, Yvonne Nicholas, now take place online, rather than in person - but the progress continues. John now reads the newspaper - ""the Daily Mail or the Daily Mirror; the Sunday Times might be a bit beyond me"" - and plans to read his first book. More importantly, he is ""much more confident"" in day-to-day life. It's a change his coach has noticed, too. ""Although he is naturally modest, I know he is proud of himself,"" says Yvonne. ""He really is a far more confident person now."" John still works at his daughter's salon in St Katherine's Dock in London - a business thatcarries his name,external. It might only be a few miles from Islington, but he has come a long way from sweeping the floor, aged 16, at his neighbourhood hairdresser. Before the interview ends, John mentions that another reading charity, Coram Beanstalk, has seen an 80% drop in the number of volunteers going into schools to help children read. Most of the volunteers are older, John explains, and they're having to shield or self-isolate. So how did John find out about this? ""I read it in theEvening Standard,externallast night,"" he says, as if it's the most normal thing in the world. âI was in prison at 20 - and a music executive by 28â Warehouse veg packer becomes top-flight footballer Conjoined twins: 'We always knew we were different' At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Black people are at greater risk from Covid than white people, studies show. Dr Moore, 52, passed away at another local hospital on Sunday. In her 4 December post on Facebook, she described how her pain had been downplayed by the doctor, whom she said was white, though she had been crying and having difficulty breathing. ""He did not even listen to my lungs, he didn't touch me in any way. He performed no physical exam. I told him you cannot tell me how I feel,"" she wrote. Why are African Americans hit so hard by virus? Black people 'twice as likely to catch Covid' A statement from the hospital said ""as an organisation committed to equity and reducing racial disparities in healthcare, we take accusations of discrimination very seriously and investigate every allegation"". ""We stand by the commitment and expertise of our caregivers and the quality of care delivered to our patients every day,"" it added. Dr Moore is survived by her 19-year-old son, Henry, and her parents, who suffer from dementia, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the family's expenses. The page has already raised more than $102,000 (Â£75,000). Dr Moore tested positive for Covid-19 on 29 November and was admitted with a high fever while she coughed up blood and struggled to breathe. But even as a physician herself, she said she had struggled with getting care. Dr Moore said she had had to plead for antiviral Remdesivir doses and request a scan of her chest. The doctor at one point reportedly told her she did not qualify for the drug and that she should go home. ""He made me feel like I was a drug addict,"" Dr Moore said in a Facebook video. ""And he knew I was a physician. I don't take narcotics. I was hurting."" Publisher apologises for 'racist' text in book The inequality in how women are treated for pain Why are black mothers at more risk of dying? Dr Moore wrote she had requested a medical advocate and had asked to be transferred elsewhere. She was eventually discharged but had to return hours later after experiencing a drop in blood pressure and fever. ""This is how black people get killed,"" Dr Moore said. ""When you send them home and they don't know how to fight for themselves."" Her post later included an update saying the hospital's chief medical officer had said staff would receive diversity training. But a promise for an apology from the doctor she accused of discrimination fell through. ""I put forward and I maintain, if I was white, I wouldn't have to go through that,"" she said. Dr Moore's experience and death has sparked an outcry over US healthcare disparities faced by black Americans. The virus has disproportionately affected black and other minority communities in the US. Black Americans are three times more likely to die from the virus than white Americans. An analysis by the Brookings Institution reported ""in every age category, black people are dying from Covid at roughly the same rate as white people more than a decade older"". Is everyone racist? A 2015 paper,externalpublished in the American Journal of Public Health found ""most health care providers appear to have implicit bias in terms of positive attitudes toward Whites and negative attitudes toward people of colour"".

We'll be winding down our live coverage soon - but here's a quick recap of what we know about the EU and UK's post-Brexit trade deal. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. But we don't know a lot of the detail yet because the full document - expected to be well over 1,000 pages long - has not been released. What we do know is that it means:  European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen says competition rules - designed to prevent one side gaining an unfair advantage - ""will be fair and remain so"". She says the UK and EU will ""continue co-operating in all areas of mutual interest, including things like climate change, energy, security and transport"". We also know the UK will not be taking part in the Erasmus exchange programme for university students anymore - although, as we've explained below, students at universities in Northern Ireland will still be eligible.

Erasmus is an EU programme that helps students study in other countries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced thatthe UK will not continue to participate in it and will be replacing it with a new scheme. He said leaving Erasmus had been a ""tough decision"" but that under the new scheme, students would ""have the opportunity... not just to go to European universities, but to go to the best universities in the world"". The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he regretted the decision. But the Republic of Ireland's higher education minister said his government was fulfilling a commitment to NI.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Santa is airborne, sprouts are being peeled, and the promised deal landed How fitting that this final chapter in the chronicles of Brexit should grind on for so long. Santa is airborne; sprouts are being peeled; the deal promised last night landing this afternoon. Make no mistake: this is a big moment. Think back. The referendum campaign and the harshest of contentions. The result, four and a half years ago, to the day â and David Cameronâs premiership prematurely aborted. Theresa Mayâs tortuous years wrestling with Brexit, where she, like her predecessor, came off second best. Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street 18 months ago without a mandate or a majority. But, after a collision with the courts, a snap election, a big majority and a pandemic that nearly cost him his life â a deal. Brexit was delivered legally at the end of January. It will be delivered practically at the end of next week â and with an overarching arrangement with the EU that even a matter of days ago looked far from certain. Vast amounts of detail wait to be found, no doubt, buried amid the subterranean depths of the huge deal document itself, which is yet to be scrutinised. And the consequences of Brexit, from the impact on the small export business to Scotlandâs place in the United Kingdom, remain vast and uncertain. But plenty will hope this is the final giant moment in what have been a turbulent few years. ""I think there will be a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen across the country tonight,"" said Barrie Deas, CEO of the UK National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. ""I think there was an expectation that the government would deliver quota shares that reflect the resources that are in UK waters,"" he told BBC News. Deas said he was also concerned that EU fishing boats would continue to operate up to six miles (10km) from the UK coast, when the fishing industry had hoped for a 12-mile limit. He said the compromises left the industry feeling let down. He added, however, that there were positive elements to the deal, including tariff-free trade. ""We hadn't wanted anything extraordinary,"" he said. ""Just the same relationship that the EU currently enjoys with Norway."" Read more about why fishing was so important in the Brexit negotiations. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? It's been more than four years since the UK voted to leave the European Union. And it's been quite a journey - with two changes of prime minister, two general elections, and more votes in parliament than anyone cares to remember. Here's a quick recap of how we got here - featuring politicians, Larry the Cat, and everyone's favourite Brenda from Bristol. Reality Check Boris Johnson claimed at his press conference that from 1 January âthere will be no non-tariff barriers to tradeâ. But thatâs not right. Non-tariff barriers are things like paperwork to be filled in or regulations that must be followed if trade is to go ahead. Thatâs different from tariffs, which is when countries charge taxes on imports of particular items from other countries. The deal agreed today means there will be no tariffs. But with the UK outside the EU single market and the custom union, there will be a host of new border checks and bureaucracy for the UK trade in goods, as well as significant limitations on the trade in services. The European Commission statement on the deal confirms that â despite the agreement â there will be, from 1 January 2021, âbig changesâ¦ this will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist todayâ. A subsequent statement from Downing Street has sought to clarify Mr Johnsonâs remarks. âWeâve always been clear that weâve left the customs union and single market, which means that there will be some friction in trade which we acknowledge,â it said. âWhat the PM means here, is that there will be no tariffs and no quotas."" So, no tariffs but plenty of new non-tariff barriers which will make trade more costly for both UK and EU businesses. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low-level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments. Read more here. Alastair Campbell (file photo) Alastair Campbell, the ex-adviser of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, has told BBC News  he thinks it was a mistake for Labour to back the deal. ""It would go through with Conservative votes, even if the real extremist Brexit voters decide they can't support it,"" Campbell said. ""Boris Johnson should be made to own it."" Borrowing a phrase from former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, he said the party should instead be abstaining and
explaining. ""Explain why it is bad deal for Britain, explain how it can be used as the basis of a different policy."" Otherwise, he said, when things start to go wrong, Boris Johnson will be able to say: ""Well, you voted for it."" ""Abstaining is never great option,"" Campbell added. ""I don't think they should vote against it... I do accept it's a difficult argument. But I really don't think they should do this."" This video can not be played Starmer: 'Labour will accept deal and vote for it' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed his party's position on the new post-Brexit trade deal - they will support it when it comes to the Commons. Watch a clip from his press conference above. The Rock relies on close economic ties with Spain Away from all the drama of the Brexit trade deal the
UK has also been negotiating future arrangements for Gibraltar, a UK territory, with
Spain. About 15,000 workers come and go daily across the
Spain-Gibraltar border. The Rockâs population is about 34,000 and 96% of
Gibraltarians voted Remain in the EU referendum. Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has told the BBC
heâs aiming to get Schengen terms for Gibraltar, to safeguard free movement of
people to and from Spain. Most EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, but the UK has never been in it. If
Gibraltar also joined it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen
country would avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK would have to
go through passport control, as is already the
case. âThe terms for mobility between us and UK
would remain exactly the same as they are now,â said Mr Picardo. Anyone
arriving from outside Schengen would have to show their passports, he added. âThe arrangement is NOT about the
nationality of the person arriving, but their point of departure.â âIf we can, we want to finalise this before the end of the
year,â he said, but added: âItâs not easyâ. Thevote to leave the EUâ back in June 2016 â took place on one
day. The process to actually leave the EU has taken a little bit
longer. To give you a sense of just how long, here is a quick
reminder of what was happening when we first decided to leave the European Union.  2016 was also the year when it felt like an unusually high number of celebrities died - David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Victoria Wood, Prince, George Michael and many more. The Northern Ireland Executive is to meet on Monday to discuss the UK-EU trade deal. Politicians have been reacting to the news in the meantime. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: ""Given the government's Northern Ireland Protocol, a sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland. ""Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union."" Deputy First Minister and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said: ""While we have distinctly different political positions on leaving the EU, we are all agreed that it's in no-one's interests to leave without a deal, therefore this announcement is good news which will be welcomed across the whole island."" Clarity is needed, she added, on ""what the agreement means for businesses and citizens"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""While the deal may seek to mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, it will not undo the damage of Brexit."" He said the ""best deal will always remain being at the heart of the European Union"". Read more here. Companies can now start to plan for the future but there are still short term pressures as a result of the timing of the deal, according to the Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders. Its director general Jonathan Geldart said: âA deal can draw a line under what has been a tumultuous few years for companies. ""It provides a stable basis for the future relationship with our biggest market, and directors are eager to sift through the detail to understand what may change"" He said ""the devil will be in the detail"" of the deal, but the end of ""political prevarication"" was welcome. The bureaucracy caused by Brexit will mean some seafood businesses will collapse, according to Seafood Scotland. The deal, while welcome, comes after the border problems of recent days, its chief executive Donna Fordyce says. ""With Brexit will come new, untested, and extremely complex processes that the seafood sector will have to comply with in just a weekâs time, at huge cost which they can ill afford just now,"" she says. Lorries will be delayed for too long by a ""bureaucratic blockade"", she adds. âWe expect it to be a good few months until everything beds in and in the meantime, seafood businesses will try their best to navigate the changes, but some will not survive.â Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC News it was a ""rotten deal"" for British fishermen, and that he was ""very concerned about the level playing field"". But he nevertheless described it as a ""massive step forward"", the ""end of Brexit wars"" and a ""big, historic, important moment"". ""The truth of it is, thereâll be a lot of people in the EU happy tonight with where things are,"" he said. ""Iâm not over the moon with this, but, weâve reached a point after years of trench warfare, division and bitterness, even I have to say - letâs just mark this moment, itâs not perfect, but itâs a lot better off than we were five years ago."" Felicity lives on the Irish border in South Armagh Felicity
McKee lives in South Armagh which is on the border between northern and
southern Ireland. As a PhD student at Swansea University she regularly drives
to Bristol to fly home via Dublin. As a woman who lives with multiple
disabilities she is concerned about how health insurance will work in the
future. âI
get ill when I travel and there is no way I could afford a hospital stay. The
cost of health insurance is higher anyway for disabled people and Iâve got ill
abroad before. It is very concerning âAs
far as I can see the European Health Insurance card (EHIC) is dead in the water
in the future and the issue of health insurance is messy. When it comes to the
NHS and health care I donât know how that will work if I got ill on the wrong
side of the border. âThereâs
data roaming; am I going to need two phones like I needed when I was in
secondary school? Paying for two contracts on a phone will add up. It's little
things but they make a big difference. âMy
European friends are concerned whether theyâll be able to stay. One of my
friends had their tyres slashed after the referendum result and Iâve noticed a
lot of anti-Irish sentiment too; I think itâs affected a lot of people. People
donât realise the consequences of Brexit. Itâs not the 70s or 80s anymore and
international links are beneficial to have."" Antony Payne is a retired software designer who voted for Brexit Antony Payne voted for Brexit. He said he had been ""complaining bitterly"" all day as there had been so much commentary before any announcement was actually made. He had some concerns about the Erasmus exchange programme and said he and his son, who is a university lecturer, had had discussions about it and also any loss of research investment from the EU. ""But with foreign policy and defence, yes there is a huge disparity in regards to how mainland Europe works compared to what the UK is doing"" he says. He adds: ""The UK was dominated by German thinking and that was about not getting into wars. But British activity has always involved helping out America."" When he was younger Mr Payne, who lives in Kirkcaldy in Scotland and frequently travels to Northern Ireland, voted to join the European Union. But now, in his retirement, his decision to vote for Brexit was not about commercial concerns, but foreign policy. He believes Europe needs to be more like a federation, and the UK part of it.

"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

"A post-Brexit deal has been agreed between the UK and the EU. The rules that will govern how both sides trade with each other in future - and so much more - have been outlined in hundreds of pages of dense legal text. It will be scrutinised to see who has given ground and in what areas. We don't have all the answers yet, but we do know that - despite this agreement - lots of things are going to change anyway. A new era begins on 1 January 2021, ending the relationship which has existed between the UK and the EU for nearly fifty years. In general, there will be more barriers between them. The UK will no longer be part of the EU's economic zone -the single market and the customs union- and that means there will be a lot more bureaucracy and delay for businesses and travellers crossing the border. The UK is introducinga new immigration systemwhich means that free movement of people to and from the EU comes to an end. EU citizens willno longer have the automatic right to settle in the UK, and British citizens will lose the automatic right to live, work and retire in the rest of Europe. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK will stop making annual budget contributions for membership of the EU, but it will continue to pay much smaller amounts as part of thefinancial settlement (or divorce bill)for a number of years. It will also have to pay for any access it wants to European programmes, in fields such as scientific research. This is not a normal trade agreement. Trade deals are designed to make trade easier and cheaper, by bringing countries closer together. This one is pushing the two sides further apart. It ends frictionless trade between the UK and its largest trading partner, creating extra costs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Outside the customs union, on the other hand, the UK will be able to negotiate its own trade deals around the world. The government says this is one of the big benefits of Brexit - the UK will be more nimble, able to make its own sovereign decisions. But any gains will be limited.New deals- over the next few years - will not replace trade that will be lost with the EU. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts thatover the long term, the UK economy will be 4% smaller,externalwith a new trade deal - than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. That's a bigger long term hit to the economy than the one caused by Covid-19. But with no deal at all, it would have been even bigger. Despite the limitations set by the clock, negotiators on both sides have done an incredible job in achieving so much in such a short time. Some people thought it couldn't be done. Agreements of this kind normally take years to negotiate. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But it isn't a particularly ambitious deal for neighbours that do so much trade with each other. Scope for closer cooperation was limited by the UK government's decision to break away from EU rules as much as possible. The UK's ambitions lie elsewhere. For three years after the 2016 referendum, arguments swirled in the UK about whether the country should pursue a soft or a hard form of Brexit. Both sides agree that this is about as hard a Brexit as you can get, while still having a deal. A softer form of Brexit - leaving the EU but staying in the single market, for example, like Norway - was debated in parliament but never attracted majority support. Boris Johnson campaigned in the 2019 general election on a harder form of Brexit and won. Earlier government promises that the UK would have 'exactly the same benefits' as it had inside the EU have not been delivered, and they never could have been. Northern Ireland will have adifferent relationship with the EU than the rest of the UKfrom 1 January, because it will remain in the EU single market for goods. That was part of the plan contained in theBrexit withdrawal agreementto keep the Irish land border between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) as open as it is now. Earlier this month EU and UK negotiators reached a separate agreement on how this will work in practice. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 Goods manufactured in Northern Ireland will continue to have seamless access to the EU, but as a result new bureaucracy will emerge within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There will be document and physical checks on some food supplies, for example (although a three month grace period will begin on 1 January for many traders, before new measures are applied in full). Pets being taken from Great Britain into Northern Ireland will also need an animal health certificate from a vet. And because Northern Ireland is being treated differently, this agreement could have longer term constitutional significance for the UK. Pro-independence politicians in Scotland will continue to ask why, if Northern Ireland can stay in parts of the single market, Scotland can't do the same. Just because a deal has been done, don't assume everything is settled. The UK is going to be negotiating with the EU for years to come, on a more or less constant basis. Resolving disputes as they arise will be a persistent focus, and a likely cause of tension. Arbitration systems will probably be tested to the limit. It's also worth remembering this deal is not just about trade. As the name suggests, it is a partnership agreement, involving all sorts of other issues such as road transport, aviation, climate change policy, and security cooperation. The UK will lose full access to a series of EU databases which police forces use on a constant basis - to check on things such as criminal records, fingerprints and lists of wanted or missing people. It won't lose access altogether, which would have happened without a deal. But security officials on both sides may well press for ways to improve cooperation in the future. The agreement on Northern Ireland will also come up for review in four years' time. So the talking isn't going to stop. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, takes effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement ismore than 1,200 pages long,,externalbut here are some of the key points. What the deal says There will be no taxes on goods (tariffs) or limits on the amount that can be traded (quotas) between the UK and the EU from 1 January Some new checks will be introduced at borders, such as safety checks and customs declarations. There are some newrestrictions on certain UK animal food products,external. For example, uncooked meats like sausages and burgers can't enter the EU unless they are frozen to -18C. What does that mean? Having a deal in place means that the fear that some goods could become more expensive has been avoided. However, businesses will still need to prepare for new procedures at ports, and if new paperwork is incomplete,it could lead to disruption. What the deal says: Businesses offering services, such as banking, architecture and accounting, will lose their automatic right of access to EU markets and will face some restrictions. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications for people such as doctors, chefs and architects. What does that mean? Rather than following one set of rules for the whole of the EU, UK businesses will need to comply with the regulations in each individual country. It will be harder for people with qualifications gained in the UK to sell their services in the EU. Individuals will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualification is still recognised. However, the UK and EU have pledged to keep talking to try to improve access for the service sector in the future. What the deal says: UK nationals will need a visa for stays of longer than90 days in the EU in a 180-day period. EUpet passportswill no longer be valid. European Health Insurance Cards, (EHIC) cardswill remain valid until they expire. The UK is no longer subject to the ban on additional roaming charges, although both sides will encourage operators to have""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. What does that mean? The UK government says EHIC will be replaced with a newUK Global Health Insurance Card,external, but full details have not been released yet. Pets will still be allowed in the EU, but it will be a more complicated process as owners will need to obtain an animal health certificate for each trip they make. UK mobile operators will be able to charge for roaming, so people should check with their mobile phone company before travelling. What the deal says: Over the next five-and-a-half years,the UK will gradually gain a greater share of the fish from its own waters. The UK could choose to ban EU fishing boats from 2026, but the EU would be allowed to introduce taxes on British fish in response. What does that mean? Fishing was the hardest and last issue to be resolved in the negotiation, and some UK fishermen are unhappy with the arrangement. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for example, says the deal does not give the UK enough control of its waters. Starting in 2026, the UK and the EU will hold regular talks on fishing access. So there could be more heated arguments ahead. What the deal says: There will be no role in the UK for the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest court in the EU. Disputes that cannot be resolved between the UK and the EU will be referred to an independent tribunal instead. What does that mean? Ending the role of the ECJ was a key UK demand as Brexit supporters said it would allow the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws. The ECJ could still have a role in Northern Ireland because it continues to follow some EU trade rules. If either side moves too far away from the current rules around product standards, tariffs (charges on imports) could be imposed on some goods in the future. What the deal says: The UK will no longer have automatic access to key security databases, but should be able to gain access upon request. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, but it will have a presence at its headquarters. The UK is no longer obliged to comply with EU standards of data protection, but data will continue to be exchanged in the same way for at least four months as long as the UK doesn't change its data protection rules. What does that mean? The UK's arrangement with Europol will be similar to the one the US currently has. Many of the rules about storing and processing data still need be decided. What the deal says: The UK will no longer participatein the Erasmus exchange programme, an EU scheme that helps students study in other countries. Students at universities in Northern Ireland will continue to participate in Erasmus, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. What does that mean? Students that have already started courses in the EU will continue to receive support for fees. A new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing,externalwill begin in September 2021. The government says it will be similar to Erasmus but will include countries across the world.

"In 2002 this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport UK pet owners used to be free to to take their dog or cat into EU countries and back again, provided they had a pet passport and were microchipped. But new rules have come into force since the UK left the European Union, and the situation is no longer so simple. You are still be able to travel with your pet dog, cat or even ferret from England, Scotland and Wales to the EU, but you now have to follow different rules. On 1 January 2021, the UK became an EU ""part two listed"" country. This means pets from England, Scotland and Wales can travel within the EU's borders as long as owners obtain an animal health certificate (AHC) first. The AHC confirms that your pet is microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. You need to get a new certificate each time you travel with your pet, and you must obtain itwithin 10 days of your departure date,external. The document is valid for four months but only covers a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. The certificate is issued by your vet, and is likely to cost around Â£100 - Â£150. For entry into Ireland, Finland, Malta and Norway, pet dogs must also be treated against a type of tapeworm called Echinococcus multilocularis, one to five days before arrival. When travelling with your pet, you must enter the EU through a designated travellers' point of entry, where your paperwork will be checked. These are listed onthe EU website,external. These rules apply to guide dogs as well. If you want to take your pet from England, Scotland or Wales to Northern Ireland, you must also obtain an AHC, as if you were going on holiday to the EU. Pet dogs must also be treated against the Echinococcus multilocularis tapeworm before entering Northern Ireland, one to five days before arrival. The AHC must be presented at one of the designated travellers' points of entry at Belfast Port, Larne Port, Belfast International Airport, Belfast City Airport or City of Derry Airport. However, no routine pet travel checks for travellers from GB to NI are currently taking place, as they have been delayed untilat least 1 October 2021,external. Northern Ireland's minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs announced the delay in June, ""to allow a further period for the ongoing UKG/EU discussions"". If you are a UK citizen who lives in the EU and has a pet passport issued by an EU member state, you will be able to use it to bring your pet to the UK. You can also use the EU-issued pet passport to return to the EU as well. If you are a UK citizen who lives in the EU and have a UK-issued pet passport, the government website recommends speaking to your vet to make sure you are following the rules.

"The UK's departure from the European Union single market at the end of December marks the final stage of the Brexit process, triggered by the majority vote to leave in the 2016 referendum. However, this does not mean that the debate about Brexit is over. Polls suggest voters remain as divided on the issue as they were at the start of 2020. YouGov has regularly asked people the question: ""In hindsight, do you think Britain was right or wrong to leave the European Union?"" During the last three months, on average, 39% have said that the decision was right, while 49% have stated it was wrong. These figures are similar to those recorded by YouGov in the three months leading up to the UK's formal withdrawal from the EU at the end of January. At that point, 40% said that the decision was right and 49% wrong. The divide looks even sharper when voters are asked how they would vote now in response to the question that appeared on the 2016 referendum ballot paper: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the EU or leave the EU?"" In recent months, a handful of polls by ComRes, Deltapoll and YouGov have posed that question again. On average, they have found that 53% would vote Remain and 47% Leave - the same as at the end of January. Of course, given that the UK has now left the EU, ""Remain"" is no longer an option. The question now is whether the UK should stay out of the EU or apply to rejoin. In a couple of their recent polls, Kantar asked people to choose between these two options -  51% backed staying out and 49% backed applying to rejoin. This points to a country that is still divided down the middle on Europe. Few voters have changed their minds since the referendum. As many as 86% of those who voted Remain in 2016 say they would vote the same way again, while 81% of those who backed Leave say they would vote for Brexit once more. Similarly, 89% of Remain voters believe the decision was wrong and 81% of Leave voters that it was right. Equally, according to Kantar, only one in eight (12%) Remain supporters say the UK should stay out of the EU, while just 8% of Leave supporters believe the UK should now apply to rejoin. Of course, the most immediate issue about Brexit has beenwhether the UK would agree a future relationship with the EU,or exit the EU single market without a deal. The polls had suggested that most voters would have preferred to leave with a deal than without one - but not at any price. Meanwhile, Remain and Leave supporters regarded the choice very differently. YouGov found people preferred a deal to no deal by 66% to 15%. Kantar, by contrast, put support for a deal at a more modest 44%, but still found only 21% backing no deal. The rest did not know which was better. Other polls have presented respondents with a more complex set of choices, but largely found the same picture. ComRes on average found that 37% preferred a deal compared with 21% who would have preferred no deal (19% preferred an extension of the transition period until a deal had been struck). Meanwhile Opinium reported that only 16% preferred no deal, while 26% backed a deal that would represent a ""clean break"" with the EU. Another 18% wanted a deal that left the UK closely aligned with the EU, while 26% felt rejoining would be the best option. However, support for leaving without a deal was much higher among Leave voters - and indeed might have been as popular as leaving with a deal. Kantar suggested 35% of Leave voters would have preferred to leave without a deal, while 34% backed having a deal. ComRes put support for the two options among Leave voters at 38% apiece. However, while most voters preferred to be leaving with a deal, it did not necessarily mean that they are opposed to leaving without a deal whatever the circumstances. When YouGov simply asked people whether they supported or opposed leaving without a deal, as many as 32% said they were in favour - much closer to the 44% who were opposed.  Among Leave voters, as many as 67% said they supported no deal. Meanwhile, when Opinium asked what should happen if the UK and the EU were to fail to reach an agreement by the end of 2020, as many as 35% of all voters - and 69% of Leave supporters - said the UK should leave without a deal. For some voters, the better course of action depended on the price to be paid. According to Deltapoll, 38% of all voters thought that the UK should be willing to compromise in order to strike a deal,  but rather more - 41% - say the UK should not make any more compromises. Among Leave voters, no less than 57% are opposed to making compromises.

"This video can not be played European Commission announces âfairâ post-Brexit trade deal A post-Brexit trade deal has been agreed between the EU and the UK, prompting relief, sadness and optimism for the future. European leaders have been reacting to the announcement. Here's what some of them have said. ""It was a long and winding road. But we have got a good deal to show for it. It is fair, it is a balanced deal, and it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides. Live: Reaction to the deal Boris Johnson hails free trade deal with EU ""Parting is such sweet sorrow. ""To all Europeans, I say: It's time to leave Brexit behind. Our future is made in Europe.""

""With the deal we create the basis for a new chapter of our relationship. The UK will continue to be an important partner for Germany and the EU outside of the European Union."" ""There is no such thing as a 'good Brexit' for Ireland. ""But we have worked hard to minimise the negative consequences. ""I believe the agreement reached today is the least bad version of Brexit possible, given current circumstances."" What will happen in Northern Ireland?

"Deer were among the animals slaughtered in central Portugal Portuguese officials have expressed outrage at the massacre of more than 500 deer and wild boar in a hunting zone in the centre of the country. Environment Minister JoÃ£o Fernandes said the killing by 16 Spanish hunters was ""vile"" and an ""environmental crime"" that should be prosecuted. Pictures of the slaughter were shared on social media. Hunting individual animals is allowed but in this incident most of the zone's deer population are said to have died. The killing is thought to have taken place on a farm in the Torrebela tourist hunting zone, near Azambuja, about 40km (24 miles) from the Portuguese capital Lisbon on 17 and 18 December.

"The government has begun inviting applications for the Turing scheme, which will enable UK students to study in other countries. The scheme is named after the mathematicianAlan Turing, and replaces Erasmus, a European Union (EU) programme which UK students can no longer take part in. The UK turned down an offer to continue participating in Erasmus after Brexit. Universities minister Michelle Donelan saidthe Turing scheme,externalwould ""enable up to 35,000 students throughout the UK to work or study across the globe"". The new scheme will provide funding ""towards placements and exchanges"" of students. Universities and other organisations in the UK can apply for grants to help cover travel expenses and living costs as well as the administrative costs of running the scheme. Applications have to be made by bodies such as universities, further education colleges and schools. If they are successful, these bodies can invite their own students to apply for individual funding. The Turing scheme will provide placements across the world. Erasmus covers placements across the EU and some non-EU countries that pay to be part of the scheme. Both schemes are open not only to university students but also those in vocational training, apprentices or those who are retraining through a college or school. Erasmus offers placements,externalfor teaching and college staff and youth workers as well, but the Turing scheme will not. The amount ofmoney you get under Erasmus,externaldepends on where you are going and whether you are a student, apprentice, trainee or staff. The Turing scheme,externalwill offer different amounts based on where you are going and for how long. For example, a university student going to France for six months would get Â£335 (â¬390) per month under the Turing scheme, while the Erasmus scheme paid Â£317 (â¬370) per month in 2020-21. UK students did not have to pay tuition fees when studying abroad under Erasmus because the scheme was reciprocal - it allowed EU students to come and study in the UK as well. The Turing scheme will not pay tuition fees for UK students studying abroad or for students from other countries studying in the UK. Instead, it expects the fees to be waived by the universities that take part. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan told the Today programme ""The way it'll work is our universities will partner with another university and they will waive the fees because they will be exchanging students."" The government has allocated Â£110m for the first year of the scheme, which starts in 2021/22, but it is not currently funded after that. Both schemes offer support. Erasmus pays an additional Â£103 (â¬120) per month - a total of Â£420 (â¬490) per month for a poorer student going to France for six months in the current academic year. The Turing scheme would pay Â£445â¯(â¬519) per month to the same student, but also contribute to travel costs (the amount will depend on how far the student is travelling). It will also provide poorer applicants with additional expenses, such as the costs of visas, passports, and health insurance. Again, both Erasmus and Turing offer support. The Turing scheme website says that, unlike Erasmus, it will ""cover preparatory visits to carry out risk assessments and ensure participants will be able to equally access and take part in all elements of a placement"". Students at universities in Northern Ireland will be able toparticipate in either scheme, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. Students at universities in Great Britain will only be eligible for Turing. Some UK students are still participating in Erasmus programmes using funding awarded before the end of 2020, which may allow them to continue until the end of the 2021-22 academic year, but no new funding will be available. Since Brexit, UK students have had to deal with immigration regulations in the EU. UK nationals are only able to stay in an EU country for 90 out of every 180 days without a visa (except for Ireland, which will still have free movement with the UK). The government haspublished guidance,externalfor UK nationals planning to study in the EU, and encourages students consider wider issues such as health and travel insurance. You can find UK governmentadvice on countries around the world here.,external Although coronavirus is now affecting student mobility, figures from before the pandemic showed that about half of UK university students who studied abroad did so through Erasmus. In 2017,,external16,561 UK students participated in Erasmus, while 31,727 EU nationals came to the UK. ""The Erasmus+ programme has delivered and continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK and we need to ensure the positives of the programme are not lost as we move into the next stage,"" Jane Racz, the director of the programme in the UK, told BBC News last year. ""Since 2014, almost â¬1bn [Â£900m] of funding has been distributed to UK Erasmus+ projects, with over 930,000 participants involved."" The National Union of Students has said the government's decision to replace Erasmus will ""damage"" the potential for many students to study abroad. ""Despite the claims of this government, they have not backed up the new Turing scheme with the funding required to support disadvantaged students to study abroad,"" Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice-president for higher education, said. ""This will harm the futures of thousands of students for years to come."" Kate Green MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, said government ""rhetoric on the Turing Scheme does not live up to the reality"". Correction: This piece has been updated to make it clear that students from other countries will be able to study in the UK but they will not receive funding under the Turing scheme.

"This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments. But while we wait for 2,000 pages of legal detail, that quote might help both explain a lot about the last four years, and map out some rocky moments ahead. It is possible that the prime minister has a different definition of what the phrase means. He seemed, when questioned to confuse them with technical standards for plugs. But any government confusion about this is about to meet a brick wall of reality from January. Industries are having to replicate regulatory processes for the UK market that previously existed only for the EU, doubling the cost. The deal mitigates the impact of some of this. But there is no precedent for the avalanche of new trade barriers that is coming. As retailers have said ""it is the biggest imposition of red tape in 50 years"". More than that, not only will those barriers now exist between the UK and EU, but some will also now occur within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as the news about seed potatoes shows. The government indeed is currently trying to advertise to thousands of business that these changes need to be prepared for, and urgently so. Failure to do so, still risks problematic congestion on key freight routes. But it also shows up the strategy of negotiators. Typically they carve up into defensive asks, where you manage your trade partners' access to your markets, and demand offensive asks about your access to their markets. The UK had few offensive asks. This was not a typical trade deal. For the UK, this was a means through which to establish regulatory independence, not to further share it and therefore increase trade, by reducing barriers. Details really matter here. A key question will be whether the most important exports qualify for tariff free status. The government claims a win here. The car companies are the ones best placed to judge that. The EU was playing hardball on this issue, even against the wishes of its own carmakers. Certainly, it has rejected the UK wish to count Japanese and Turkish parts as effectively ""made in Britain"". Accepting that means that there will be new trade barriers with the EU, though thankfully not actual tariffs. The challenge really is about whether the new freedoms the prime minister has won, can help more than make up for more trade friction with what is currently our main market. It means significant change, winners and losers. It means the government needs a proper strategic economic plan. This deal makes that process easier at an already challenging time. But it does not eliminate the economic challenge from this political win. Firms warn 'clock is ticking' to keep goods moving What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"A post-Brexit agreement on trade and other issues has been agreed, just a week before the transition period between the UK and the EU comes to an end. It avoids the disruption of a no-deal Brexit in the middle of the Covid pandemic, and marks a new era after more than 40 years of UK membership of the European Union. We've now seen a copy of the text - more than 1,000 pages of dense legal text which outline how the relationship will operate in the future. Here are 10 initial questions and answers: One of the most difficult issues in the negotiations: how many fish will EU boats be able to catch in UK waters in future, and how long will any transition period last before new measures come into full force? Officials involved in the negotiations say the UK initially wanted an 80% cut in the value of the fish caught by EU boats in UK waters, while the EU initially proposed an 18% cut. Who has given more ground? Answer:The value of the fish caught by the EU in UK waters will be cut by 25% - which is a lot less than the UK initially asked for. The cut will be phased in over a transition period lasting five-and-a-half years - which is a lot shorter than the EU initially asked for. Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters, and could make much deeper cuts. If it decides to exclude EU fishing boats they can be compensated for their losses, either through tariffs on UK fishing products (or other goods) exported to the EU, or by preventing UK boats from fishing in EU waters. Fishing was one of the most difficult areas of the negotiations What will the rules on fair competition look like, to ensure that businesses on one side don't gain an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other? The definition of what constitutes reasonable levels of state aid, or government subsidies for business, will be important. Answer:There are level playing field measures which commit both the UK and the EU to maintain common standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. This was a key EU demand. They don't have to be identical in the future, so the UK does not have to follow EU law, but they do have to be seen to protect fair competition. The UK has also agreed to stick to common principles on how state aid regimes work, and to an independent competition agency which will assess them. But it can choose to develop a system which only makes decisions once evidence of unfair competition is presented. That is different from the EU system which assesses the likely impact of subsidies before they are handed out. This will be the subject of years of negotiations to come. How will the deal actually be enforced if either side breaks any of the terms and conditions? If the UK chooses to move away more radically from EU rules in the future, how quickly can the EU respond? Will it have the ability to impose tariffs (or taxes on UK exports) in one area (for example on cars) in response to a breach of the agreement in another (fish, for example)? Answer:If either side moves away from common standards that exist on 31 December 2020, and if that has a negative impact on the other side, a dispute mechanism can be triggered which could mean tariffs (taxes on goods) being imposed. It is based around a ""rebalancing"" clause which gives both the EU and the UK the right to take steps if there are significant divergences. This clause is much stricter than measures found in other recent EU trade deals, and was a key demand on the European side. It is a mechanism we may hear a lot more about in the coming years. The overall policing of the trade agreement also means that tariffs can be targeted at a specific sector as a result of a dispute in another. There will be a binding arbitration system involving officials from both sides. It means that even though this is a tariff-free agreement, the threat that tariffs can be introduced as a result of future disputes will be a constant factor in UK-EU relations. The EU's highest court will remain the ultimate arbiter of European law. But the UK government has said the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in Britain will come to an end. So, will the European court play any role in overseeing the future relationship agreement? Answer:The EU has dropped its demand that the ECJ should play a direct role in policing the governance of the agreement in future. That was a clear British red line. One place where the ECJ will still play a role is Northern Ireland, which has a special status under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It will remain subject to EU single market and customs union rules, which means the European Court will remain the highest legal authority for some disputes in one part of the UK. What will the rules be for British people who want to travel to the EU from 1 January 2021? We already know some of the details but will there be any additional agreements on things like social security or vehicle insurance? And will there be any detail on any arrangement to replace the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)? Answer:UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. They will still be able to use theirEHICs which will remain valid until they expire.The UK government says they will be replaced by a new UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), but there are no further details yet on how to obtain it. Its advice,externalis to take out travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. EU pet passports willno longer be valid,but people will still be able to travel with pets, following a different and a more complicated process. The two sides agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming, but there is nothing in the agreement that would stop UK travellersbeing charged for using their phone in the EUand vice versa. The government also says British citizenswill not need an International Driver's Permit to drive in the EU(unless they still have a paper licence or a licence from the Isle of Man, Guernsey, Jersey or Gibraltar). But they will need to carry a green card to prove they have the right vehicle insurance. The trade agreement is primarily about the rules for goods crossing borders. It will say far less about the trade in services. Is there going to be a separate statement from the EU which will recognise UK rules governing financial services as roughly ""equivalent"" to EU rules? That would make it much easier for UK firms which export services to continue doing business in the EU market. Answer:There is, as expected, not a lot in this agreement for service companies to cheer about. The UK will still be hoping that the EU issues ""equivalence"" decisions on financial services in the near future, but service companies in general have not got as much help in this deal as the British government had been pushing for. The European Commission says a series of ""further clarifications"" will be needed from the UK, including more information on how it will diverge from EU rules after 31 December, before any decisions on equivalence can be made. There is an agreement to continue talking about financial services regulation in the future, but some companies may have to apply to specific EU countries to be allowed to operate there. The guaranteed access that UK companies had to the EU single market is over. This is a really important issue. What will the data protection rules be for UK companies which deal with data from the EU? Again, the UK is hoping the EU will issue separately what's known as a data adequacy decision recognising UK rules as equivalent to its own. But the detail will need to be scrutinised carefully. Answer:Both sides say they want data to flow across borders as smoothly as possible, but the agreement also stresses that individuals have a right to the protection of personal data and privacy and that ""high standards in this regard contribute to trust in the digital economy and to the development of trade"". That's why an EU decision to recognise formally that UK data rules are roughly the same as its own is so important - and we're still waiting for that. In the meantime the EU has agreed to a ""specified period"" of four months, extendable by a further two months, in which data can be exchanged in the same way it is now, as long as the UK makes no changes to its rules on data protection. We know there will be more bureaucracy and delays at borders in the future, for companies trading between the UK and the EU. But will the two sides agree any measures to make things a little easier? There's something called ""mutual recognition of conformity assessment"" which would mean checks on products standards would not need to be nearly as intrusive as they otherwise might be. Answer:There's no agreement on conformity assessment, even though the UK government had hoped there would be. It's just one reminder of how many new barriers to trade there are going to be. In future, if you want to sell your product in both the UK and the EU, you may have to get it checked twice to get it certified. On other border issues, there is also no agreement on recognising each other's sanitary and safety standards for exporting food of animal origin, which means there will have to be pretty intrusive and costly checks for products going into the EU single market. There will however be some measures which cut technical barriers to trade, and the mutual recognition of trusted trader schemes which will make it easier for large companies to operate across borders. A lot of people, from accountants to chefs, work in different EU countries and didn't have to worry about crossing borders multiple times while the UK was part of the EU. But will UK professional qualifications be recognised across the EU in the future, and what restrictions will there be? Answer:The short answer is no - they won't be recognised automatically. That will make it harder for UK citizens supplying any kind of service to work in the EU. They will often have to apply to individual countries to try to get their qualifications accepted, with no guarantee of success. There is a framework in the deal for the UK and EU to agree on mutually recognising individual qualifications but that's weaker than what professionals have now. It's not just about trade. The UK will lose automatic and immediate access to a variety of EU databases which the police use every day - covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons. So what kind of access will they have, and how will security co-operation work in the future? Europol's ""most wanted"" advent calendar, 2016 Answer:The UK loses access to some very key databases but will have continued access to others, including the system which cross-checks fingerprints across the continent. But overall, security co-operation will no longer be based on ""real time"" access. And in some cases, such as access to data on which flights people take, that data will only be made available under much stricter conditions. An agreement has been reached on extradition, and the UK's role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions. Both of these are positive, and on a par with the best other countries have achieved. Disagreements over data will be dealt with by a new committee, not by the European Court of Justice - again, a red line for the UK. But taken together, the speed with which the UK gets important data, and the influence it has on decisions, has been reduced. There are many other questions to answer - this agreement will form the basis for UK-EU relations for years if not decades to come. And the two sides will have to continue to talk about how to implement it most effectively. The team will continue to read through the text of the agreement and will add more to this story if necessary. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Have you put renewing your passport, doing a money makeover and getting travel insurance on your new year's resolutions to-do list for 2021? Thursday 31 December at 23:00 GMT marks the end of the transition period agreed between the UK and EU after Brexit. All the new rules have not yet been finalised, but there are some things you can do to get ready. For many of us, coronavirus restrictions this year have meant our passports have gathered dust in the back of the drawer. We will no doubt be desperate for a holiday once the rules are lifted, and countries in the EU are top destinations for Brits travelling abroad. But you don't want to turn up for that all-important flight only to be turned away from boarding at the very last minute. After Brexit, you will need at least six months left on your passport before it expires, and it will need to be less than 10 years old or you might not be able to travel. The new rules do not apply when travelling to Ireland. Read more on travelling to the EU after Brexithere. In the side of your wallet or purse, you might notice you have a blue card that has your name printed on it as well as the 12 stars that make up the European flag. That's your European Health Insurance card (EHIC) and it gives you the right to free emergency healthcare during a temporary stay in another EU country, and Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (the expiry date will be on the front of your card). The government said it will launch a new scheme called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), but it did not say when. The government's advice is to take out travel insurance - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. Read more on the changeshere. Will it be cheaper to buy a house? Will the cost of fish, chips and gravy from the chippy go up? Will the interest on your bank loan or mortgage go down? The simple answer is we don't know yet how the end of the transition period will affect the UK economy, but it might be a good time to look at your personal finances and consider a money makeover. The first thing to do is add up all the money you have coming in and going out, so you know where your finances stand. Then, top tips for saving money include checking you're in the right council tax band, switching where you buy your gas and electricity, and haggling before renewing things such as car insurance and mobile phone contracts. You should also consider switching credit cards to get a cheaper rate and changing your bank account to one that offers cash to switch and better interest rates,says Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis.,external British customers will still have 14 days to return unwanted online items they have bought from the EU, but from 1 January it might be more difficult to sort out any problems you have a dispute with a retailer,says consumer group Which?.,external Brits will no longer be able to use theEU's Online Dispute Resolution,externalscheme, which gives consumers access to tools to help resolve a complaint, and it might also be more difficult to take a retailer to court in the UK. So, if you're able to, it's worth buying items which cost between Â£100 and Â£30,000 with your credit card,according to Citizens Advice.,externalThis also applies to purchases you make while abroad. This is becauseSection 75 protection,externalapplies, which guarantees that if you buy a product from the EU and you don't receive it, you can claim the money back from your card provider. If you want your furry friend to come on holiday with you to the EU or Northern Ireland, then you will need to take a trip to the vet first. That's because the current EU pet passport issued in the UK will not be valid for travel from 1 January 2021. Instead, pet cats, dogs (including assistance dogs) and ferrets will need an animal health certificate (AHC). To get an AHC, your pet needs to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. The certificate will need to be signed by a qualified vet and you will need to get it 10 days before you travel. Find out more about the pet travel after Brexithere. Ringing and texting family to ask whether it's raining back home is a key part of many people's holidays when sunning themselves abroad in the EU. But you might want to check that you won't get a nasty mobile phone bill when you return. Free roaming is not guaranteed from next year, so get in touch with your provider before you go, to see if there will be any additional charges. You can read more on roaming charges after Brexithere. Thousands of British expats have been told theirbank accounts could be closedonce the Brexit transition period ends. This is because UK banks will no longer be allowed to provide services to customers in the EU without the right banking licences. Previously they have used a system known as passporting, which allows banks to trade freely in another other country in the European Economic Area (EEA) without the need for more authorisation. But this will no longer be in place after 1 January, so banks have been left needing to ensure they meet the rules for every EEA country's regulators. Some banks have decided it is not in their commercial interests to jump through these hoops and continue accounts for expats, so it may be worth checking with your bank to see whether you are affected.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces new deal between UK and EU The EU and UK have reached a post-Brexit trade deal, ending months of disagreements over fishing rights and future business rules. At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson said: ""We have taken back control of our laws and our destiny."" The text of the agreement has yet to be released, but the PM claimed it was a ""good deal for the whole of Europe"". The UK is set to exit EU trading rules next Thursday - a year after officially leaving the 27 nation bloc.

As the deal was announced, Mr Johnson - who had repeatedly said the UK would ""prosper mightily"" without a deal -tweeted a picture of himself,externalsmiling with both thumbs lifted in the air. In a press conference in Brussels, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen said: ""This was a long and winding road but we have got a good deal to show for it."" She said the deal was ""fair"" and ""balanced"" and it was now ""time to turn the page and look to the future"". The UK ""remains a trusted partner,"" she added. This video can not be played A round-up of the Brexit trade agreement At his press conference, Boris Johnson said the Â£668bn a year agreement would ""protect jobs across this country"" and ""enable UK goods to be sold without tariffs, without quotas in the EU market"". He acknowledged he had been forced to give ground on his demands on fishing. ""The EU began with I think wanting a transition period of 14 years, we wanted three years, we've ended up at five years,"" he said. And he said the UK had not got all it wanted on financial services, a vital part of the UK economy, but he insisted the deal was ""nonetheless going to enable our dynamic City of London to get on and prosper as never before"". Brexit: Firms âneed guidanceâ to keep goods moving Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI Most of the UK - except from Northern Ireland -will no longer participate in the Erasmus student exchange scheme, which Mr Johnson said was because it is ""extremely expensive"" - but a British option called the Turing Scheme will provide an alternative, he added. Students in NIwill still be able to take partthanks to an arrangement with the Irish government. The UK's chief trade negotiator Lord Frost said the full text of the free trade agreement would be published soon. The UK Parliament will be recalled on 30 December to vote on the deal - it will also need to be ratified by the European Parliament. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - said his party would vote for the deal in the Commons, ensuring it will pass. He said it was ""a thin agreement"" that ""does not provide adequate protections"" for jobs, manufacturing, financial services or workplace rights and ""is not the deal the government promised"". But with no time left to renegotiate, the only choice was between ""this deal or no deal,"" he added. No deal would have ""terrible consequences for this country and the Labour Party cannot allow that to happen"", said the Labour leader, and that was why he had decided to back it. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. What happens next with Brexit? Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford said a deal was better than no deal but criticised the timing just a week before the UK exits the EU single market and customs union. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Brexit is happening against Scotland's will - and there is no deal that will ever make up for what Brexit takes away from us. ""It's time to chart our own future as an independent, European nation."" Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he would study the text of the deal but added: ""From what we have heard today, I believe that it represents a good compromise and a balanced outcome."" Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage - who played a leading role in the campaign to get the UK out of the EU in the 2016 referendum - told the BBC the deal was ""far from perfect"" and that for fisheries in particular it was a ""rotten deal"" - but added: ""It's a lot better off than we were five years ago."" One fishing industry representative said the UK had made ""significant concessions on fish"", and ""there will be a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen tonight"". ""There will certainly be those that see this as selling out "", said Barrie Deas, the head of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. Negotiations in Brussels went down to the wire over what EU fishing boats are allowed to catch in UK waters. Fishing makes up just 0.12% of the UK's economy. It is a massive achievement for both sides that they have done such a huge trade deal on the timetable that was said to be impossible at the start. Whatever your personal view, there's a sense of vindication in the camp of those who campaigned to leave the EU - they got a free trade deal with zero quotas and zero tariffs (although there may be some before you scream) but the UK will not be under European law. It's no coincidence that David Frost's number two, Oliver Lewis, wrote the Vote Leave manifesto. No 10 believes the PM, who was propelled to his position by the Vote Leave tribe, has been able to keep his central Brexit promises. Look out for the ""rebalancing clause"" when the deal finally emerges - the mechanism where either side can request a change to the deal, or seek to punish the other side if they believe they are breaking the agreement. In short, the UK side believes it means they have been able to achieve two clear objectives: the deal applies to both sides, it's reciprocal, but there is the possibility of exit if things go wrong, without collapsing the whole shebang. But it's Christmas Eve, so I suspect you agree that's enough for now. The vote in Parliament is set for the 30th. The result is not in doubt, but the theory that's been agreed tonight, will only be tested in years to come. Read more from Lauraon Twitter,externaland herlatest blog here. The government's economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had warned that leaving without a deal would have shrunk the national income by 2% next year and led to major job losses. There were also concerns it would lead to higher prices in the shops for many imported goods. There are still big question marks about what the deal will mean for the rest of British business. Firms that trade with the 27 member states have carried on as normal for the past year during the so-called transition period that kicked in when Britain left the EU. They will still face extra paperwork when the country leaves the EU single market and customs union next week. But the threat of tariffs - import taxes - between the UK and its biggest trading partner will be removed. How will Brexit affect you? Do you have any questions about the trade deal?

"Levels of coronavirus are continuing to rise with one in 85 people in England infected, according to the Office for National Statistics. Figures for the week to 18 December estimate nearly 650,000 people have the virus, up from 570,000 the week before. London now has the highest percentage of people testing positive - more than 2%. In Wales, the virus is infecting one in 60 people - a sharp increase. Infection levels are also up in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased, equating to one in 140 people there with the virus, the ONS suggests. It comes as a total of 521,594 people have been vaccinated against coronavirus in England over the two weeks since roll-out started, with thousands more across the UK nations. People aged 80 and over received 70% of these doses. In Scotland 56,676 people have received the vaccine, in Wales the figure is 22,595 and in Northern Ireland it is 16,068. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon Six million people to enter tier 4 on Boxing Day According to the ONS figures,external, there are sharp rises in levels of positive tests in the capital, the east of England, and the South East, where a new variant of the virus is spreading at a dangerous rate, according to government ministers. About two-thirds of people testing positive in these areas could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate, the ONS says. Meanwhile, case rates in London have doubled in one week, figures from Public Health England show, to 602 per 100,000 people. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, said: ""This will not be a normal Christmas for any of us. ""By continuing to reduce your contacts you can help to slow the spread of Covid-19. Remember that about one in three people may never experience any symptoms so could infect others without realising it."" There are two variants causing concern at the moment - the first, which emerged in Kent, is thought to be driving a rapid growth in cases and hospital admissions in the south and east of England in recent weeks. Scientists advising government are worried the rest of the UK could experience the same thing, as the number of patients in hospital with Covid approaches levels of the spring peak. Schools 'may need to close to control new variant' This has led to strict rules being imposed on six million more people in England from 26 December when 40% of the country will be living under tier 4 restrictions. Scientists say the new variant spreads more easily than other forms of the virus although they don't believe it causes more serious disease. The second variant, which originated in South Africa and is causing a spike in cases there, was detected in two cases in the UK on Tuesday, promptinga ban on travel from the country. The R, or reproduction number of the virus, is now between 1.1 and 1.3 for the UK, with regions in the south and east of England even higher, signalling that the epidemic is growing fast. The ONS figures are based on tests of people in thousands of households across the UK whether they have symptoms or not, giving an accurate estimate of how many people are infected with the virus. Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, says the figure of one in 85 people with the virus in England is ""worryingly high"". But there is some good news - infection rates in the north of England have been falling in recent weeks. ""I hope that the new virus variant and any extra mixing of people over Christmas does not reverse the positive trends in those parts of the country,"" Prof McConway says. Daily UK government figures,externalshow there were 39,036 confirmed new cases on Thursday, slightly down from yesterday's record of 39,237. The total number of cases reported in the last week is nearly 50% higher than the week before. On the same day, the deaths of another 574 people were reported within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. It is almost inevitable that this figure will rise in the coming weeks as small numbers of those infected become seriously ill with the disease. The latest figures show 21,286 people in hospital with Covid-19 as of Tuesday. The first wave peak was 21,683 people in hospital on 12 April.

"The government has begun inviting applications for the Turing scheme, which will enable UK students to study in other countries. The scheme is named after the mathematicianAlan Turing, and replaces Erasmus, a European Union (EU) programme which UK students can no longer take part in. The UK turned down an offer to continue participating in Erasmus after Brexit. Universities minister Michelle Donelan saidthe Turing scheme,externalwould ""enable up to 35,000 students throughout the UK to work or study across the globe"". The new scheme will provide funding ""towards placements and exchanges"" of students. Universities and other organisations in the UK can apply for grants to help cover travel expenses and living costs as well as the administrative costs of running the scheme. Applications have to be made by bodies such as universities, further education colleges and schools. If they are successful, these bodies can invite their own students to apply for individual funding. The Turing scheme will provide placements across the world. Erasmus covers placements across the EU and some non-EU countries that pay to be part of the scheme. Both schemes are open not only to university students but also those in vocational training, apprentices or those who are retraining through a college or school. Erasmus offers placements,externalfor teaching and college staff and youth workers as well, but the Turing scheme will not. The amount ofmoney you get under Erasmus,externaldepends on where you are going and whether you are a student, apprentice, trainee or staff. The Turing scheme,externalwill offer different amounts based on where you are going and for how long. For example, a university student going to France for six months would get Â£335 (â¬390) per month under the Turing scheme, while the Erasmus scheme paid Â£317 (â¬370) per month in 2020-21. UK students did not have to pay tuition fees when studying abroad under Erasmus because the scheme was reciprocal - it allowed EU students to come and study in the UK as well. The Turing scheme will not pay tuition fees for UK students studying abroad or for students from other countries studying in the UK. Instead, it expects the fees to be waived by the universities that take part. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan told the Today programme ""The way it'll work is our universities will partner with another university and they will waive the fees because they will be exchanging students."" The government has allocated Â£110m for the first year of the scheme, which starts in 2021/22, but it is not currently funded after that. Both schemes offer support. Erasmus pays an additional Â£103 (â¬120) per month - a total of Â£420 (â¬490) per month for a poorer student going to France for six months in the current academic year. The Turing scheme would pay Â£445â¯(â¬519) per month to the same student, but also contribute to travel costs (the amount will depend on how far the student is travelling). It will also provide poorer applicants with additional expenses, such as the costs of visas, passports, and health insurance. Again, both Erasmus and Turing offer support. The Turing scheme website says that, unlike Erasmus, it will ""cover preparatory visits to carry out risk assessments and ensure participants will be able to equally access and take part in all elements of a placement"". Students at universities in Northern Ireland will be able toparticipate in either scheme, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. Students at universities in Great Britain will only be eligible for Turing. Some UK students are still participating in Erasmus programmes using funding awarded before the end of 2020, which may allow them to continue until the end of the 2021-22 academic year, but no new funding will be available. Since Brexit, UK students have had to deal with immigration regulations in the EU. UK nationals are only able to stay in an EU country for 90 out of every 180 days without a visa (except for Ireland, which will still have free movement with the UK). The government haspublished guidance,externalfor UK nationals planning to study in the EU, and encourages students consider wider issues such as health and travel insurance. You can find UK governmentadvice on countries around the world here.,external Although coronavirus is now affecting student mobility, figures from before the pandemic showed that about half of UK university students who studied abroad did so through Erasmus. In 2017,,external16,561 UK students participated in Erasmus, while 31,727 EU nationals came to the UK. ""The Erasmus+ programme has delivered and continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK and we need to ensure the positives of the programme are not lost as we move into the next stage,"" Jane Racz, the director of the programme in the UK, told BBC News last year. ""Since 2014, almost â¬1bn [Â£900m] of funding has been distributed to UK Erasmus+ projects, with over 930,000 participants involved."" The National Union of Students has said the government's decision to replace Erasmus will ""damage"" the potential for many students to study abroad. ""Despite the claims of this government, they have not backed up the new Turing scheme with the funding required to support disadvantaged students to study abroad,"" Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice-president for higher education, said. ""This will harm the futures of thousands of students for years to come."" Kate Green MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, said government ""rhetoric on the Turing Scheme does not live up to the reality"". Correction: This piece has been updated to make it clear that students from other countries will be able to study in the UK but they will not receive funding under the Turing scheme.

"This video can not be played Up to 10 sperm whales have been stranded on the East Yorkshire coast Ten sperm whales found washed up on the North Sea coast have died. The pod was first spotted on a beach between Tunstall and Withernsea, near Hull, at about 08:30 GMT. Members of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said poor weather conditions and the size of the whales meant it was impossible to save them. A spokesperson said the young whales were ""in very poor nutritional condition"" and had most likely suffered a ""navigation error"". They rarely survive long once stranded, the group said. The BDMLR has been involved in the rescue of marine wildlife since its formation in 1988 According to the BDMLR the size of the sperm whales - which can reach 65ft (20m) in length and weigh up to 80 tonnes - meant there were no safe methods for lifting and moving them. A member of the public called 999 to report the stranding, and the coastguard was despatched to the scene. Ch Supt Darren Downs, of Humberside Police, urged people to stay away from the area ""to allow teams from HM Coastguard to manage what is an extremely distressing scene"". He warned that gathering in groups posed a risk of spreading Covid-19. Marine expert Robin Petch said younger males can end up ""confused in shallower water off the east coast"" Robin Petch, a marine expert and Sea Watch Foundation ambassador, said: ""Sperm whales are a species that shouldn't come into this part of the North Sea, but a few come down that way. ""They are a deep-water animal that feed on squid and dive in the deep waters of the continental shelf. Often younger males can end up confused in the shallower water off the east coast. ""Once they are ashore, chances of survival are very slim, none of the rescue equipment can deal with whales that big. ""The loss of a large group, probably of young males, is catastrophic,"" Mr Petch added.

"Shana Grice reported Michael Lane five times to police before he murdered her The parents of a Brighton teenager stalked and murdered by her ex-boyfriend have lost a High Court bid for a full inquest into her death. Shana Grice, 19, reported Michael Lane five times to police before he cut her throat and killed her in August 2016. Her parents, Sharon Grice and Richard Green, said a ""full, independent and focused inquest"" was necessary. A High Court judge ruled that independent inquiries had ""sufficient element of public scrutiny"". Michael Lane murdered Ms Grice in her Brighton home and then attempted to set fire to her body. She had reported Lane to officers but was fined for wasting police time. Lane was jailed for life in 2017 and ordered to serve at least 25 years. Earlier in December, the parents of Ms Gricechallenged the decision of the senior coroner for Brighton and Hovenot to conduct a full inquest into her death. They said a ""full, independent and focused inquest"" was necessary. Michael Lane was jailed for life in 2017 after he slit Ms Grice's throat in her Brighton home In a High Court ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Garnham concluded the senior coroner for Brighton and Hove was right to rule previous inquiries were ""effective"". He also said the results of previous investigations ""established relevant facts"", which provided a ""sufficient element of public scrutiny"". Neil Hudgell, who represented Ms Grice's family, said in a statement: ""This ruling is hugely disappointing. ""It is also unfortunate coming on Christmas Eve, when thoughts naturally turn to our loved ones,"" he said. He added Ms Grice's family would consider the ruling and then decide on further action.

"Businesses have given a relieved welcome to the Brexit trade deal, but warned there was more work to be done. In a statement, Number 10 said: ""The deal is fantastic news for businesses in every part of the UK."" But Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said ""the clock is still very much ticking"" for firms and called for guidance. The CBI called for urgent confirmation of grace periods to give firms time to adapt to new rules from  1 January. ""We need to ensure we keep goods moving across borders,"" said Tony Danker, CBI director-general. He said the deal ""will come as a huge relief to British business at a time when resilience is at an all-time low"". ""But coming so late in the day, it is vital that both sides take instant steps to keep trade moving and services flowing while firms adjust."" Mr Geldart echoed the CBI's concerns and said digesting the practical changes required and adapting ""in the middle of a pandemic and the festive season, while border disruptions continue, is a huge ask"" for firms. After a last-minute titanic struggle over the economic minnow that is fish, a deal has finally been landed. The relief of avoiding no-deal is the perfect Christmas present for UK business. Having avoided what they considered the calamity of no-deal, minds will now turn to the detail in nearly 2,000 pages of text. And those who do business with the EU will not have long to peruse it. Even though a deal has been done, UK traders face a new raft of paperwork and cost. More than 200 million additional customs forms will need completing at a cost of more than Â£7bn a year. Haulage companies warn that many businesses are not ready for this new normal. That is perhaps understandable when you consider they have had several previous false alarms when they've stockpiled for no reason. They've been dealing with the worst health and economic disaster in living memory and have had precious little detail on exactly what they are facing until the very last minute. The elephant not in the room and barely mentioned in the deal is services. There is no automatic access to a market worth Â£100bn to UK firms last year. A huge sigh of relief, yes - but any celebrations may be brief. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, urged the EU and UK governments to work to implement the new arrangement as soon as possible. ""They must ensure there are no tariffs from Day One and find new ways to reduce the checks and red tape that we'll see from 1 January,"" she said. Brexit trade deal is done, says UK government Stock markets and pound rise ahead of Brexit deal ""Businesses are undoubtedly relieved to hear that a deal has been agreed and will be hoping that it will now be ratified by respective parliaments across Europe,' said Richard Burge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""However, in on-the-ground terms for business, there are likely to still be questions unanswered and operational detail missing."" Business group Logistics UK was optimistic about the deal. ""It removes the risk of tariffs being placed on almost every item imported from the EU, which would have raised prices and slowed the rate of economic growth,"" said Elizabeth de Jong, the group's policy director. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady was scathing. ""This deal is better than nothing, but not by much. It won't protect jobs and puts hard-won workers' rights on the line."" She called on the prime minister to ""make good on his promise to level up Britain"", saying: ""He needs to act fast. There can be no more pointing the finger at the EU."" Concerns were raised over the fact that financial services did not form part of the trade deal. ""The agreement should be less criticised for what it contains than what it does not contain - namely the future of financial services,"" said Daniel Pinto, chief executive of Stanhope Capital Group. He said the City now needed to take its future in its own hands. ""Post-Brexit, it should lure international companies and revamp its regulatory framework to make it much more flexible."" Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, said the deal was positive news for financial services. ""While financial services has never been covered by the trade negotiations, this vital breakthrough bodes well for the conversations happening around equivalences and delegation,"" he said. ""Until now, the souring negotiating mood on the future relationship was putting these important financial footbridges across the Channel under great pressure and there was a risk of collapse.""

"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

Thanks for tuning in. Todayâs live page was brought to you by writers Sophie Williams, Lauren
Turner, Owen Amos and Ritu Prasad. Martha Buckley was todayâs editor. Thanks for joining us on this Christmas Eve as we've brought you all the latest coronavirus news. Here's a recap of the top stories from the UK today.  If you're having a break from the news for a few days now, then have a very Happy Christmas.  Thanks for tuning into our live page today. Here's a round-up of the major headlines from around the world: The number of people estimated to have Covid in Scotland has fallen over the last week, according to official figures. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimated the new, more easily transmittable strain of the virus was responsible for 38% of the positive cases in Scotland. It found about 37,100 (one in 140) people in Scotland had the virus in the seven days to 18 December. That figure has fallen from 52,500 (one in 100) in the week up to 11 December. The ONS said data on the new variant should be treated with caution due to the small numbers involved. It found that 7% of positive tests showed the new variant in the week beginning 7 December, and that rose to 14% the following week.  Mexico has started its mass vaccination programme, just a day
after the first doses arrived in the country. About 3,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived on
Wednesday. A 59-year-old nurse in Mexico City had her injection televised. Doses of the vaccine are being guarded by the military to stop them from falling into
the hands of criminals, AFP reports. More than 120,000 people have died and 1.3 million infections have
been recorded in Mexico since the pandemic began. One of the worst-affected London boroughs says the most significant rise in cases of coronavirus is in those of working age. London now has the highest percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. It's now estimated 2.1% of people in private households have the virus. Jason Strelitz, director of public health in Newham, one of the worst-affected boroughs of the city, said: ""The most significant age group in terms of our local epidemic is people of working age. ""The vast majority of cases are amongst people aged 20-50 and that group has seen also the fastest acceleration. ""There's also been growth in children of secondary school age and slow growth amongst older people but it really is right across the population."" It comes as the weekly surveillance report from Public Health England shows London's rate of new cases of Covid-19 has trebled in just two weeks. The rate stood at 602.2 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to December 20, up from 200.3 in the seven days to December 6.  A 52-year-old black US doctor who accused a suburban hospital physician of racist treatment has died due to Covid-19. In a video shared on Facebook while she was in hospital, Susan Moore said a white doctor had downplayed her pain and made her ""feel like I was a drug addict"". ""All I can do is cry I was in so much pain,"" she wrote in the post. ""He said you can just go home right now. Of note he did not even listen to my lungs, he didnât touch me in any way. He performed no physical exam. I told him, 'You cannot tell me how I feel.'"" Moore said even though she herself was a physician, she was not treated respectfully. In the video, Moore said: ""I put forth and I maintain if I was white, I wouldnât have to go through that."" The case has sparked an outcry over the treatment of black Americans in the US health system. Research has detailed the biases that can be present when black patients seek care - particularly treatment for pain. On Sunday, Moore passed away from complications due to the virus, her sontold the New York Times,external. The hospital has not offered comment, citing privacy laws. On Wednesday, the US set a new record high in hospital admissions, with more than 119,400 in hospital with Covid-19 nationwide. The country has had more than 100,000 people in hospital due to the virus every day since 2 December, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Across the US, states are facing staff shortages even as hospital admissions rise and intensive care units fill up. Experts worry that a spike following the holiday season - which has already seen millions of Americans travel against advice - could overwhelm health centres. A man whose family was told he would not survive Covid-19 says he is looking forward to a""glorious Christmas"". Father of five Neil McCafferty was admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry in October with a gall bladder infection. The 67-year-old was also treated for sepsis before developing Covid-19 and spending several weeks in intensive care. He is now in rehab and ""delighted to be alive"". Neil and wife Bridie traditionally have 17 family members at their home on Boxing Day. Although different this year, it ""will be glorious"", said Neil, who is recovering in Derry's Waterside hospital. ""I'll get to see them. I am sat on the ground floor, by the window. They are all coming down on Christmas morning,"" he said. He's learning to walk again and on Wednesday he shaved himself for the first time in months. ""That was a big achievement. It's all the small things that didn't seem important before.""  The University of Washington's latestInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model,externalprojects the US could see more than 567,000 deaths by 1 April. It's an increase from its previous estimate of 562,000. The model, updated on Wednesday, shows that if 95% of the country started wearing masks the death toll would be diminished by almost 50,000. A rapid vaccine roll-out would also save an estimated 45,000 lives. On the other hand, if states stop following virus restrictions, IHME predicts the US death toll will pass 731,000 by April. As it stands, the US has seen 326,242 deaths due to the virus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Ferry operator DFDS says it has been able to transport only a fraction of the lorries it had capacity for across the Channel in the last two days because of congestion in Dover. It said: ""The borders were reopened for freight drivers with a negative test as at midnight on Tuesday and since then DFDS has had capacity to ship up to 4,000 trucks; due to the logistical issues that have prevented freight getting to the port we have unfortunately only been able to transport 144 trucks out of Dover."" It says it is ""ready to transport freight drivers and their vehicles and any passengers who have valid essential reasons to travel"", if they have a negative Covid test and in line with French government guidelines. ""The company shares the frustration and disappointment that our freight customers have felt in not being able to travel, and we fully understand the issues that this has created for local residents in Dover and the wider East Kent area,"" they said. Extra sailings have been added to today's sailing schedule and the Port of Dover is remaining open over Christmas. Customers cannot enter the port without a negative Covid test result, however. The latest figures from Wednesday showed 6,000 drivers were still stranded in Kent as a repercussion of the travel ban. Nomsa MasekoBBC Southern Africa correspondent Hospitals in South Africaâs Western Cape
province are under severe pressure from rising Covid-19 infections and trauma
cases, as the country experiences a second wave of the virus. Yesterday the country recorded more
than 14,000 new infections, the highest number of cases in a single day, as well as 411 deaths. The Western Cape government says the
second coronavirus wave is proving to be significantly bigger than the first
one in terms of hospital admissions. Scientists in South Africa announced
the discovery of a new coronavirus variant last week. Itâs thought the new variant is
transmitted more easily than previous versions, and this could be driving the
second wave. Some hospitals in the Western Cape are
now at full capacity, with some at 140% capacity. Trauma cases related to alcohol, car
crashes and crime are also putting pressure on the system. The health department is in the
process of adding extra beds in the province and might also have to bring in
the military for assistance. Following the discovery of South
Africaâs new coronavirus variant, the UK government has suspended all flights between
South Africa and the UK. Two cases of the South African variant
have been found in the UK. The South Africa mutation is different
to the new variant recently discovered in the UK, but both are thought to be
more easily transmitted. Scientists say more research is needed
to establish whether the new variants are more severe than previous ones. In a bit of happier news - there's a birthday to celebrate. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US's chief infectious disease researcher who has become the face of the country's pandemic response, turns 80 today. Well wishes for his birthday have poured in on social media. The Mayor of Washington DC declared the day Dr Anthony S Fauci Day. But how is the doctor - who has worked non-stop since January - spending this Christmas Eve? Typically, he'd have an Italian dinner with his family,he told the Washington Post,external, even making the intensive, cheese-egg-meat-filled baked pasta dish timpano. But this year, as he advises all Americans to do, he'll be staying at home with his wife in DC, celebrating with his daughters via Zoom. Concerns have been raised over safety at a half marathon in Cornwall, where 250 runners crossed the line in a mass start. The Indian Queens Half Marathon, held on Sunday, did not feature a staggered start as recommended by Covid-19 safety advice. One runner in the event, John Barnes, said he was ""surprised"" to see so many people congregating at the start. The race director said she believed she had followed guidance and any breach was unintentional. Current advice fromUK Athletics and Run Britain,externalstates ""mass starts are not permitted"", suggesting staggered starts instead. Cornwall Council confirmed it had allowed the event to go ahead after being told a staggered start would be in operation. Read more here. Brazil has announced it is suspending flights arriving in the
country from the UK and banning anyone who has visited the UK over the past two
weeks. Flights passing through the UK will also be banned, a note in the
official gazette on Wednesday confirmed. A number of countries have suspended flights from the UK after a
new strain was identified in the UK. Earlier this week, Britainâs Foreign Office advised against all
but essential travel to Brazil due to its latest assessment of Covid-19 risks. Brazil has recorded more than 189,000 deaths and 7.3 million cases
since the pandemic began. From 26 December, the Isles of Scilly will be the only part of England in tier one - the lowest level of virus restrictions. Cornwall, Herefordshire and the Isle of Wight have been moved to tier two, leaving the islands - 28 miles off the Cornish coast - as the only place with a ""medium"" alert. ""It's a very strange early Christmas present,"" local councillor Steve Sims told the PA news agency. ""Whilst it is a relief, it's a very sobering situation and I remain apprehensive as I'm sure most of my fellow islanders will be."" The islands, which have a population of around 2,000, have had only two recorded cases, he added. Mr Sims's wife, Beth Hilton, edits local magazine Scilly Now & Then and said: ""I don't think we're jumping up and down celebrating the fact that we are still tier one - although it is very welcome news and means we can still go out socially at Christmas if we wish to do so."" An aerial shot of Tresco Abbey Garden in the Isles of Scilly This video can not be played A 101-year-old war veteran has received thousands of Christmas cards and presents from around the world after speaking about the loss of his wife on BBC Breakfast. John Lister and his wife Ella were married for 70 years before she died from coronavirus in February. His care home in Norfolk hoped cards would help him get through his first Christmas without her. Global cases have reached 78 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There are concerns that cases could continue to rise rapidly due to gatherings over Christmas and new year. Europe and North America are seeing the largest increase in cases. The UK has seen levels of the virus continuing to rise with one in 85 people in England infected, according to the Office for National Statistics. A number of European nations, including Italy, have ordered new lockdowns in order to curb the spread. The US has been hit hard by the pandemic. It has the highest case load and number of deaths in the world. California's governor has warned that thousands of people in the state could be hospitalised next month.

France shut the border on Sunday, in response to surging cases of the new virus variant in London and the South East. Drivers now have to test negative before being allowed into France. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said this morning it would take ""several days"" to clear the backlog. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Schools and universities may have to close, in addition to current tier four restrictions, to bring the new variant of coronavirus under control in the UK. That's the verdict of preliminary rapid analysis work. It calculates the variant is spreading 56% faster than other forms of the virus. The researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine say whether schools can stay open is the key question for the new year. Keeping children in school has been a political priority up until now, with the pandemic having disrupted the education of millions of children. The variant is thought to have emerged in Kent in September and now accounts for around two-thirds of cases in London, the South East and the East of England. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Shana Grice reported Michael Lane five times to police before he murdered her The parents of a Brighton teenager stalked and murdered by her ex-boyfriend have lost a High Court bid for a full inquest into her death. Shana Grice, 19, reported Michael Lane five times to police before he cut her throat and killed her in August 2016. Her parents, Sharon Grice and Richard Green, said a ""full, independent and focused inquest"" was necessary. A High Court judge ruled that independent inquiries had ""sufficient element of public scrutiny"". Michael Lane murdered Ms Grice in her Brighton home and then attempted to set fire to her body. She had reported Lane to officers but was fined for wasting police time. Lane was jailed for life in 2017 and ordered to serve at least 25 years. Earlier in December, the parents of Ms Gricechallenged the decision of the senior coroner for Brighton and Hovenot to conduct a full inquest into her death. They said a ""full, independent and focused inquest"" was necessary. Michael Lane was jailed for life in 2017 after he slit Ms Grice's throat in her Brighton home In a High Court ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Garnham concluded the senior coroner for Brighton and Hove was right to rule previous inquiries were ""effective"". He also said the results of previous investigations ""established relevant facts"", which provided a ""sufficient element of public scrutiny"". Neil Hudgell, who represented Ms Grice's family, said in a statement: ""This ruling is hugely disappointing. ""It is also unfortunate coming on Christmas Eve, when thoughts naturally turn to our loved ones,"" he said. He added Ms Grice's family would consider the ruling and then decide on further action.

"This video can not be played Agreement is ""better than no deal"", says First Minister Mark Drakeford The post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU is a ""thin deal' for Wales, says the first minister. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed it as a ""good deal"" after months of talks ended in an agreement, just days before the end-of-year-deadline. But Mark Drakeford said it was not what Wales was ""promised"". The Welsh Conservative MS Darren Millar said it was ""great news"" for people and businesses in Wales. Brexit trade deal is done, says UK government 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal How to get ready for Brexit in 2021 Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales he welcomed certainty for businesses but said it was a difficult deal for Wales. ""It will still be a difficult deal for Wales but it provides a platform to which we can return to argue for improvements in the future,"" he said. A request by the first minister to recall the Senedd next Wednesday to discuss the deal has been agreed by Presiding Officer Elin Jones. ""I think it's very important that before the Houses of Parliament vote on any deal they know the views of the devolved parliament here in Wales,"" Mr Drakeford said. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline. It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long? The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead. Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. Read more:What happens next with Brexit? There would still be new barriers to trade, he said, but ""at least we know how things are going to be done"". ""As far as Wales is concerned, Welsh citizens will see a difference,"" he added. ""It will not be as easy to travel into Europe as it has been. Welsh students will not have access to universities in Europe in the way that we have enjoyed."" This video can not be played European Commission announces âfairâ post-Brexit trade deal In a further statement to MSs Mr Drakeford said: ""We have not seen the text of the agreement and clearly will need to analyse and scrutinise the detail before we are able to take a considered view."" It was ""already clear,"" he said however, this was not a deal ""which would have protected jobs, the economy and the rights of our citizens."" ""Faced by a binary choice of this deal or no deal, this deal, despite its very serious shortcomings, is the better outcome."" This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces new deal between UK and EU Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the deal was done by negotiators ""from every part of the UK and it will benefit every part of our United Kingdom"". He said the deal meant ""a new stability and certainty in what has sometimes been a fractious and difficult relationship"" with the EU. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said it was a ""fair and balanced"" deal. In a press conference in Brussels, she said: ""This was a long and winding road but we have got a good deal to show for it."" Farmers' unions have welcomed the deal but warned of friction at borders Farmers' unions and business leaders in Wales welcomed a deal, saying it was a ""relief"" and provided some certainty, but said problems in the detail could be ""significant"". Farmers' Union of Wales president Glyn Roberts said a no-deal Brexit would have been ""catastrophic"" for farming. He called the deal ""our Christmas present in the agriculture industry"". He said: ""It's very good that there are no tariffs and quotas on this deal, because if there had been tariffs on our lambs - we export 30% of our lambs to Europe - there would be roughly about 50% tariff on those lambs and that would have a devastating effect on the economy of agriculture, and on the economy of rural areas as a whole."" What just happened with Brexit? How do voters feel about Brexit now? National Farmers' Union Cymru deputy president Aled Jones said the deal was ""long awaited"" but there would be ""friction at the borders post-Brexit"". ""The problems of whatever might be in the small print will be significant,"" he said. ""It'll be something that we'll have to work on - so undoubtedly the first year, the first six months will be the worst probably, in making sure that we can get through the paperwork, the bureaucracy concerned as a trading nation."" Meat Promotion Wales chief executive Gwyn Howells called the deal ""excellent news"", but said it would be nothing like trading with the EU as a full member. ""There will be border inspections, more paperwork in terms of exports and health certification and therefore, there will be more friction at the border,"" he said. ""We hope that will be a minimum in terms of not only time but also cost."" Jerry Percy said the fishing industry felt betrayed But representatives of the Welsh fishing industry said they felt ""betrayed."" The UK government said it had taken back control of UK waters and the EU said there would be ""full predictability"" for European fishing communities for five-and-a-half years. Chief executive of Pembrokeshire-based New Under Ten Fishermen's Association, Jerry Percy, said: ""Reading between the lines, they seem to have got a lot of what they want but five-and-a-half years is a nonsense. ""We need changes to safeguard and develop the UK fishing industry, and the Welsh one in particular, and kicking the can down the road, which is effectively what's happened, is not helpful."" The general feeling among the fishing community was of ""massive disappointment"", he said. ""We were promised control and it appears that's not going to happen for five-and-a-half years,"" he said. Alan Brayley of Swansea Bay Business Club said the detail had yet to be seen Airbus, which has a wing assembly plant in Broughton, Flintshire, said it needed to analyse the consequences of the deal for its business, but was pleased ""potential disruption"" from a no-deal had ""been avoided."" Chief executive Guillaume Faury said: ""Airbus welcomes the news that an agreement has been reached between the EU and UK. ""We are delighted to continue to work with our many stakeholders in the spirit of collaboration and long-term partnership."" Alan Brayley, president of the Swansea Bay Business Club, said while it was early days and detail had yet to be announced, the deal gave business owners ""certainty"". Ben Francis, from the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales, said the agreement was a ""huge relief"" for small businesses. ""Given the huge historic and future importance of EU markets to smaller Welsh exporters, this will be a relief and welcomed by those businesses which are also dealing with the huge pressures of coronavirus,"" he said. He said he now wanted to see the Welsh and UK government joining efforts ""to support smaller businesses to adapt to this new relationship with our biggest export market"". Melanie Owen campaigned for the UK to leave the EU and says the deal is positive Brexit campaigner Melanie Owen, from Aberystwyth said: ""I'm looking forward to the possibilities that are ahead for the UK to be able to trade with other countries on our own terms."" This could ""only be a positive"" she said. Welsh Conservative Senedd member Darren Millar responded: ""Yet again, Boris Johnson has proved the doomsayers wrong by delivering a comprehensive free trade agreement that respects UK sovereignty, protects jobs, and takes back control of our money and our borders"". ""Politicians across the political spectrum in Wales should now put their differences over Brexit behind, embrace this new relationship, and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said while details are still unknown, the agreement was ""worlds away"" from what was promised in the 2016 referendum and 2019 general election. ""Wales was told that we would continue to have the exact same benefits, that we would not receive a penny less, and that our farmers would be able to sell their produce to the rest of Europe as before,"" said the MP. She accused the Conservatives of breaking promises, saying the agreement would impose ""significant"" new costs and complex bureaucracy on Welsh businesses. ""It is appalling that the UK government has decided to cause further disruption to people and businesses when our economy and society are already struggling due to the pandemic."" But she said an agreement gave ""minimal stability"" and would be a relief to many. For Welsh farmers the overwhelming response will be relief. Their industry - as UK government ministers have themselves acknowledged - would have been one of the most severely affected had the trade talks failed. The Farmers' Union of Wales had warned of ""civil unrest"", Meat Promotion Wales that the impact would be ""off the Richter scale"" and result in ""carnage"". Ministers had been preparing a ""crisis payments scheme"" to compensate sheep farmers. The deal means exports to the continent of iconic Welsh lamb and beef - and other agricultural products too - won't now face punishing tariffs. But there will be new, additional paperwork and some checks carried out from January 1st - which farming leaders say will be costly and disruptive. The UK government argues this will be worth it in the longer term as they look to open up new markets around the world for Welsh produce. Wales' fishermen - a fleet of small boats specialising in lobster, crab, whelks and mussels - will also be relieved they won't now face tariffs. Over 90% of their catch is currently exported to the EU. But any compromises made over fishing rights in the negotiations will be closely scrutinised as they had hoped Brexit would bring about a renaissance of the wider fishing industry - beyond just catching shellfish - in Wales.

"HMS Northumberland monitored the Russian destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov off the west coast of Scotland last month The crew of a Royal Navy warship has been forced to return to shore and isolate over Christmas after ""a number of suspected Covid cases"" on board. HMS Northumberland, which has specialist sensors to hunt for foreign submarines, had been on call to protect UK waters over the festive period. But she was forced to return to Devonport Naval Base, near Plymouth, on Wednesday. The Navy said it will still meet all of its ""operational tasks"" over Christmas. A spokesman said: ""Following a number of suspected Covid cases onboard HMS Northumberland, the crew are now following health guidelines and protocols to isolate."" He added: ""The Royal Navy continues to meet all operational tasks over Christmas, as it has done throughout this pandemic."" Last month, the Type 23 frigate escorted the Russian destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov as she sailed off the west coast of Scotland. Ministers and senior military officers have warned of a significant increase in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic over the past few years. The Ministry of Defence saidthe Royal Navy monitored nine Russian vessels near UK waters,externalover a two-week period in late November and early December.

"1,645 days after the UK voted to leave the EU, 328 days after we actually departed, the shape of our relationship with our nearest neighbours has been drawn and agreed - only days before the status quo will disappear. The deal that will determine how we do business with our biggest trading partner. The deal that both sides desperately wanted to achieve. But the deal that was not, even though political logic suggested it, inevitable. Certainly the prime minister always said he would be willing to walk away, claiming repeatedly that the UK would ""prosper mightily"" if there was no agreement in the end. It is true that he and his allies sometimes scoffed at the nature of the widespread warnings about the potential damage abandoning the status quo without a deal could wreak. It is also true that some of the positions the EU was putting forward even in the closing weeks of the talks were seen as intolerable by the UK side, which was even in some moments surprised by what appeared to be a hardening of attitudes late in the day. But it is also true that the prime minister, the vast majority of ministers and MPs were concerned about the risk of taking a step into the unknown. They wanted to avoid the disruption of leaving a relationship that has lasted four decades without a ready replacement. To rip off the tentacles spread into almost every feature of how the country is run overnight could have caused major pain. Even with a deal, changes are on the way that may not feel smooth. But a sudden no-deal departure from the EU's rules could have been a disruptive at best, disastrous at worst, for some very concerned industries, adding to the country's difficulties during a pandemic that has caused so much pain. The 1,500 or so pages of the deal (if you're stuck for Christmas reading, there'll be plenty to keep you busy!) have not yet been published, far less has there been time to comb through the actual detail. In the coming days, without doubt, there will be a rhetorical bidding war over which side has given more ground, ""lost"" or ""won"". There will have been compromises on both sides. But both the UK and the EU have put pragmatism over firm principle, and agreed an historic accord that will affect so many aspects of how we live. Boris Johnson has so often been accused of failing to keep the promises that he has made. The details of the deal may well contain more evidence that some of his vows on Brexit will be broken. But he has managed to keep perhaps his biggest commitment after taking us out of the European Union - securing a deal - a huge political and personal relief, perhaps, for the man whose name and reputation will be forever linked with the UK's decision to leave the EU. What happens now that a deal's been done? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks?

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

Richard Williams said neighbours helped build a barricade in front of his house in Mathern, Monmouthshire, after water started rushing in off nearby fields. ""It was a Dunkirk spirit when the call went out, the village rallied together, people we don't even know,"" he said. ""Mathern does have that community spirit so we shouldn't expect anything less.

Because the club house is lower than the golf course, water often runs off the course into the club house. ""The rain was so bad that the pumps in the cellar couldn't deal with it,"" he said. The cellar was submerged in about a foot of water, but it could have been a lot worse. ""You do fear the worst when the pumps are over capacity but I have seen the cellar flood quite badly before with barrels bobbing up and down,"" Mr Thomas added. Allow Twitter content?

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

She says the UK and EU will ""continue co-operating in all areas of mutual interest, including things like climate change, energy, security and transport"".

Erasmus is an EU programme that helps students study in other countries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced thatthe UK will not continue to participate in it and will be replacing it with a new scheme. He said leaving Erasmus had been a ""tough decision"" but that under the new scheme, students would ""have the opportunity... not just to go to European universities, but to go to the best universities in the world"". The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he regretted the decision. But the Republic of Ireland's higher education minister said his government was fulfilling a commitment to NI.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Santa is airborne, sprouts are being peeled, and the promised deal landed How fitting that this final chapter in the chronicles of Brexit should grind on for so long. Santa is airborne; sprouts are being peeled; the deal promised last night landing this afternoon. Make no mistake: this is a big moment. Think back. The referendum campaign and the harshest of contentions. The result, four and a half years ago, to the day â and David Cameronâs premiership prematurely aborted. Theresa Mayâs tortuous years wrestling with Brexit, where she, like her predecessor, came off second best. Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street 18 months ago without a mandate or a majority. But, after a collision with the courts, a snap election, a big majority and a pandemic that nearly cost him his life â a deal. Brexit was delivered legally at the end of January. It will be delivered practically at the end of next week â and with an overarching arrangement with the EU that even a matter of days ago looked far from certain. Vast amounts of detail wait to be found, no doubt, buried amid the subterranean depths of the huge deal document itself, which is yet to be scrutinised. And the consequences of Brexit, from the impact on the small export business to Scotlandâs place in the United Kingdom, remain vast and uncertain. But plenty will hope this is the final giant moment in what have been a turbulent few years. ""I think there will be a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen across the country tonight,"" said Barrie Deas, CEO of the UK National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. ""I think there was an expectation that the government would deliver quota shares that reflect the resources that are in UK waters,"" he told BBC News. Deas said he was also concerned that EU fishing boats would continue to operate up to six miles (10km) from the UK coast, when the fishing industry had hoped for a 12-mile limit. He said the compromises left the industry feeling let down. He added, however, that there were positive elements to the deal, including tariff-free trade. ""We hadn't wanted anything extraordinary,"" he said. ""Just the same relationship that the EU currently enjoys with Norway."" Read more about why fishing was so important in the Brexit negotiations. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? It's been more than four years since the UK voted to leave the European Union. And it's been quite a journey - with two changes of prime minister, two general elections, and more votes in parliament than anyone cares to remember. Here's a quick recap of how we got here - featuring politicians, Larry the Cat, and everyone's favourite Brenda from Bristol. Reality Check Boris Johnson claimed at his press conference that from 1 January âthere will be no non-tariff barriers to tradeâ. But thatâs not right. Non-tariff barriers are things like paperwork to be filled in or regulations that must be followed if trade is to go ahead. Thatâs different from tariffs, which is when countries charge taxes on imports of particular items from other countries. The deal agreed today means there will be no tariffs. But with the UK outside the EU single market and the custom union, there will be a host of new border checks and bureaucracy for the UK trade in goods, as well as significant limitations on the trade in services. The European Commission statement on the deal confirms that â despite the agreement â there will be, from 1 January 2021, âbig changesâ¦ this will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist todayâ. A subsequent statement from Downing Street has sought to clarify Mr Johnsonâs remarks. âWeâve always been clear that weâve left the customs union and single market, which means that there will be some friction in trade which we acknowledge,â it said. âWhat the PM means here, is that there will be no tariffs and no quotas."" So, no tariffs but plenty of new non-tariff barriers which will make trade more costly for both UK and EU businesses. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low-level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments.

""It would go through with Conservative votes, even if the real extremist Brexit voters decide they can't support it,"" Campbell said. ""Boris Johnson should be made to own it."" Borrowing a phrase from former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, he said the party should instead be abstaining and
explaining. ""Explain why it is bad deal for Britain, explain how it can be used as the basis of a different policy."" Otherwise, he said, when things start to go wrong, Boris Johnson will be able to say: ""Well, you voted for it."" ""Abstaining is never great option,"" Campbell added. ""I don't think they should vote against it... I do accept it's a difficult argument. But I really don't think they should do this.""

Watch a clip from his press conference above. The Rock relies on close economic ties with Spain Away from all the drama of the Brexit trade deal the
UK has also been negotiating future arrangements for Gibraltar, a UK territory, with
Spain. About 15,000 workers come and go daily across the
Spain-Gibraltar border. The Rockâs population is about 34,000 and 96% of
Gibraltarians voted Remain in the EU referendum. Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has told the BBC
heâs aiming to get Schengen terms for Gibraltar, to safeguard free movement of
people to and from Spain. Most EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, but the UK has never been in it. If
Gibraltar also joined it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen
country would avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK would have to
go through passport control, as is already the
case. âThe terms for mobility between us and UK
would remain exactly the same as they are now,â said Mr Picardo. Anyone
arriving from outside Schengen would have to show their passports, he added. âThe arrangement is NOT about the
nationality of the person arriving, but their point of departure.â âIf we can, we want to finalise this before the end of the
year,â he said, but added: âItâs not easyâ. Thevote to leave the EUâ back in June 2016 â took place on one
day. The process to actually leave the EU has taken a little bit
longer. To give you a sense of just how long, here is a quick
reminder of what was happening when we first decided to leave the European Union.  2016 was also the year when it felt like an unusually high number of celebrities died - David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Victoria Wood, Prince, George Michael and many more. The Northern Ireland Executive is to meet on Monday to discuss the UK-EU trade deal. Politicians have been reacting to the news in the meantime. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: ""Given the government's Northern Ireland Protocol, a sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland. ""Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union."" Deputy First Minister and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said: ""While we have distinctly different political positions on leaving the EU, we are all agreed that it's in no-one's interests to leave without a deal, therefore this announcement is good news which will be welcomed across the whole island."" Clarity is needed, she added, on ""what the agreement means for businesses and citizens"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""While the deal may seek to mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, it will not undo the damage of Brexit."" He said the ""best deal will always remain being at the heart of the European Union"". Read more here. Companies can now start to plan for the future but there are still short term pressures as a result of the timing of the deal, according to the Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders. Its director general Jonathan Geldart said: âA deal can draw a line under what has been a tumultuous few years for companies. ""It provides a stable basis for the future relationship with our biggest market, and directors are eager to sift through the detail to understand what may change"" He said ""the devil will be in the detail"" of the deal, but the end of ""political prevarication"" was welcome. The bureaucracy caused by Brexit will mean some seafood businesses will collapse, according to Seafood Scotland. The deal, while welcome, comes after the border problems of recent days, its chief executive Donna Fordyce says. ""With Brexit will come new, untested, and extremely complex processes that the seafood sector will have to comply with in just a weekâs time, at huge cost which they can ill afford just now,"" she says. Lorries will be delayed for too long by a ""bureaucratic blockade"", she adds. âWe expect it to be a good few months until everything beds in and in the meantime, seafood businesses will try their best to navigate the changes, but some will not survive.â Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC News it was a ""rotten deal"" for British fishermen, and that he was ""very concerned about the level playing field"". But he nevertheless described it as a ""massive step forward"", the ""end of Brexit wars"" and a ""big, historic, important moment"". ""The truth of it is, thereâll be a lot of people in the EU happy tonight with where things are,"" he said. ""Iâm not over the moon with this, but, weâve reached a point after years of trench warfare, division and bitterness, even I have to say - letâs just mark this moment, itâs not perfect, but itâs a lot better off than we were five years ago.""

He said he had been ""complaining bitterly"" all day as there had been so much commentary before any announcement was actually made. He had some concerns about the Erasmus exchange programme and said he and his son, who is a university lecturer, had had discussions about it and also any loss of research investment from the EU. ""But with foreign policy and defence, yes there is a huge disparity in regards to how mainland Europe works compared to what the UK is doing"" he says. He adds: ""The UK was dominated by German thinking and that was about not getting into wars. But British activity has always involved helping out America."" When he was younger Mr Payne, who lives in Kirkcaldy in Scotland and frequently travels to Northern Ireland, voted to join the European Union. But now, in his retirement, his decision to vote for Brexit was not about commercial concerns, but foreign policy. He believes Europe needs to be more like a federation, and the UK part of it.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen are said to have been working to reach an agreement before Christmas Boris Johnson is expected to announce later that the UK has reached an agreement with the EU over post-Brexit trade and security. Officials in Brussels are believed to be finalising the details of a deal that will come into force when the UK leaves EU trading rules next week. It follows months of often fraught negotiations between the two sides. The PM will speak to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen by phone to sign off the deal. Mr Johnson is then expected to hold a press conference in Downing Street to announce it. LIVE: EU and UK on verge of deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? EU to allow post-Brexit UK farm produce exports The announcement had been expected earlier, but it has been delayed while final haggling between the two sides continues. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTE Radio there had been ""some sort of last-minute hitch"" over the small print of the fishing quotas agreement but a deal was still expected later. A deal would end the prospect of the two sides imposing widespread import taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods from 1 January, which could have affected prices. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke four times on Wednesday to get a deal ""over the line"". She said negotiators were ""still haggling over some fine details"", including catch quotas for more than 100 species of fish in UK waters. It is understood the agreement does not have a role for the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, and the two sides have agreed a system to sort out disputes that follows international law, rather than EU law, our political editor said. In addition, she said the two sides have agreed to phase new fishing arrangements over five years, with the UK catching as much as two-thirds of the fish in UK waters by the end of the transition. The deal document is thought to be around 2,000 pages long. It is expected that the UK Parliament will be recalled to vote on a law implementing a deal before 31 December, when the Brexit transition period ends. On the EU side, leaders can decide to apply a deal provisionally before the European Parliament holds a ratification vote early next year. It could also need eventual approval in national EU parliaments, depending on the exact contents of the deal. BBC Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said Mrs von der Leyen was also due to speak later to set out details of the deal. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? It is believed one of the final obstacles being discussed include quotas for particular types of fish. The UK has insisted on having control over fishing in its waters from 1 January and retaining a larger share of the catch from them than under the current quota system. But the EU wanted to phase in a new fishing system over a longer period and retain more of its access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other member states. The sides also disagreed over whether UK firms should continue to follow the same rules as companies within the EU - and on how future trading disputes should be resolved. The pizzas arrived as the negotiations continued into the evening By Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe correspondent As afternoon gave way to evening and evening gave way to night in Brussels optimism that agreement was close never dwindled, but never quite turned into a deal either. At one point pizzas arrived for the weary officials - a delivery man on a bike turning up at the front gates of the European Commission. It was understood that negotiators were still haggling over precise quotas of individual species of fish that EU boats will be allowed to catch in British waters. The governments of individual EU member states must consider the details of any deal but they have been briefed regularly throughout the process and shouldn't find much if anything to surprise them. The issue of how to promote the deal for public consumption is much more pressing for the British side than the European. For the EU there are legal loose ends to be tied up but the European Parliament will only vote on a deal retrospectively at some point in the New Year. In the UK the government will have to get any deal through parliament before 31 December. UK ministers have repeatedly ruled outany extension to the transition period, under which the UK has continued to follow Brussels's trade rules since it left the EU on 31 January. Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays UK, said he welcomed an agreement, which would bring ""clarity"" for business. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said planning for a new trading relationship with the EU had been ""the overriding issue for businesses over the last two years"". ""This was pure politics. It was always the last minute sort of rabbit from the hat,"" he added. The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its group of lawyers to analyse any deal that is reached. The group was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would ""scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"".

"Have you put renewing your passport, doing a money makeover and getting travel insurance on your new year's resolutions to-do list for 2021? Thursday 31 December at 23:00 GMT marks the end of the transition period agreed between the UK and EU after Brexit. All the new rules have not yet been finalised, but there are some things you can do to get ready. For many of us, coronavirus restrictions this year have meant our passports have gathered dust in the back of the drawer. We will no doubt be desperate for a holiday once the rules are lifted, and countries in the EU are top destinations for Brits travelling abroad. But you don't want to turn up for that all-important flight only to be turned away from boarding at the very last minute. After Brexit, you will need at least six months left on your passport before it expires, and it will need to be less than 10 years old or you might not be able to travel. The new rules do not apply when travelling to Ireland. Read more on travelling to the EU after Brexithere. In the side of your wallet or purse, you might notice you have a blue card that has your name printed on it as well as the 12 stars that make up the European flag. That's your European Health Insurance card (EHIC) and it gives you the right to free emergency healthcare during a temporary stay in another EU country, and Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (the expiry date will be on the front of your card). The government said it will launch a new scheme called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), but it did not say when. The government's advice is to take out travel insurance - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. Read more on the changeshere. Will it be cheaper to buy a house? Will the cost of fish, chips and gravy from the chippy go up? Will the interest on your bank loan or mortgage go down? The simple answer is we don't know yet how the end of the transition period will affect the UK economy, but it might be a good time to look at your personal finances and consider a money makeover. The first thing to do is add up all the money you have coming in and going out, so you know where your finances stand. Then, top tips for saving money include checking you're in the right council tax band, switching where you buy your gas and electricity, and haggling before renewing things such as car insurance and mobile phone contracts. You should also consider switching credit cards to get a cheaper rate and changing your bank account to one that offers cash to switch and better interest rates,says Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis.,external British customers will still have 14 days to return unwanted online items they have bought from the EU, but from 1 January it might be more difficult to sort out any problems you have a dispute with a retailer,says consumer group Which?.,external Brits will no longer be able to use theEU's Online Dispute Resolution,externalscheme, which gives consumers access to tools to help resolve a complaint, and it might also be more difficult to take a retailer to court in the UK. So, if you're able to, it's worth buying items which cost between Â£100 and Â£30,000 with your credit card,according to Citizens Advice.,externalThis also applies to purchases you make while abroad. This is becauseSection 75 protection,externalapplies, which guarantees that if you buy a product from the EU and you don't receive it, you can claim the money back from your card provider. If you want your furry friend to come on holiday with you to the EU or Northern Ireland, then you will need to take a trip to the vet first. That's because the current EU pet passport issued in the UK will not be valid for travel from 1 January 2021. Instead, pet cats, dogs (including assistance dogs) and ferrets will need an animal health certificate (AHC). To get an AHC, your pet needs to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. The certificate will need to be signed by a qualified vet and you will need to get it 10 days before you travel. Find out more about the pet travel after Brexithere. Ringing and texting family to ask whether it's raining back home is a key part of many people's holidays when sunning themselves abroad in the EU. But you might want to check that you won't get a nasty mobile phone bill when you return. Free roaming is not guaranteed from next year, so get in touch with your provider before you go, to see if there will be any additional charges. You can read more on roaming charges after Brexithere. Thousands of British expats have been told theirbank accounts could be closedonce the Brexit transition period ends. This is because UK banks will no longer be allowed to provide services to customers in the EU without the right banking licences. Previously they have used a system known as passporting, which allows banks to trade freely in another other country in the European Economic Area (EEA) without the need for more authorisation. But this will no longer be in place after 1 January, so banks have been left needing to ensure they meet the rules for every EEA country's regulators. Some banks have decided it is not in their commercial interests to jump through these hoops and continue accounts for expats, so it may be worth checking with your bank to see whether you are affected.

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

"For months, the government has been urging businesses to get ready for a new era in trading with the EU. But it was only on Boxing Day that details of all the new rules were actually published. Business groups are relieved that the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would have meant tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border with the EU, has been removed. But companies that trade with the EU are still facing a lot of new bureaucracy. And the disruption in mid-December, caused by border closures related to the new variant of Covid-19, was a reminder of how dependent the UK economy is on trade across the English Channel. From 1 January 2021, goods entering the EU from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) face large amounts of new paperwork and checks, including: customs declarations rules of origin checks product safety certificates food inspections This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Hauliers will also need to make sure they have the right transportation paperwork before they drive to the border. There is particular focus on the ""short straits"" route between Dover and Calais, and the nearby Channel Tunnel, which taken together handle about four million lorries a year. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" says William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. Full controls on British exports to the EU began on 1 January. Thefirst day of the new regimeappears to have gone relatively smoothly. But it's feared that later in the year, the new controls could cause disruption, even though new border infrastructure has been built at ports such as Calais, to help process vehicles more efficiently. There are some mitigating measures though. In response to the Covid crisis, the government is delaying full controls on goods entering Great Britain from the EU for a further six months. There will be checks from 1 January on controlled substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and traders deemed to be a risk will also be asked to fill in customs declarations. But most checks on goods coming in from the EU will be delayed until 1 July, a deadline that could in theory be extended. ""I think we will want to monitor it,"" the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Jim Harra, told MPs in November. ""Hopefully we will not still be in a situation where Covid-19 is consuming as much of people's attention."" Other measures to tackle potential disruption include diverting trade to other ports around the country and opening lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. Some of these contingencies were put into action early, to deal with the Covid border closures in December. Operation Brock, for example, involved changing the layout of a section of the M20, using a concrete barrier to allow lorries heading for mainland Europe to queue safely on the motorway. Thousands of lorries were also diverted to temporary parking at a disused airport at Manston. From 1 January drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to acquire a Kent Access Permit before they enter the county. They will have to show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. But that doesn't deal with the challenge of the thousands of vans that cross the Channel every week. ""What has been serially misunderstood by various parts of government is the scale of the complexity for people on the ground dealing with the paperwork,"" says Duncan Buchanan, the Policy Director of the Road Haulage Association. That could mean that instead of queues on motorways, many traders won't be able to leave their depots. ""Either they won't be able to get vets to sign off on their meat exports, or they won't be able to get their permit because they don't have the right bits of paper,"" says Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Storage Federation. ""We might see a quite significant holding off of trading - people just not moving stuff in the first few weeks."" Eighty-five per cent of the volume of trade between the EU and Great Britain is carried by EU hauliers, who are often paid not by the hour, but by the kilometre. If they think there will be too many delays, many may simply not come. The government says the readiness of traders to deal with the new system remains its biggest concern. Lorries parked on the M20 in Kent ""The sheer scale of the overall operation means there are literally many millions of moving parts,"" permanent secretary of the cabinet office Alex Chisholm told MPs. ""Inevitably there are going to be some difficulties for some individual people as they adjust to the new regime."" The government has also announced a new Border Operations Centre as part of plans ""for the UK to have the world's most effective border by 2025"". Questions have been asked about how changes at the border might affect food supply. The short answer is no-one can say for sure, but nearly 30% of all the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU. The good news is that there is a deal, which makes a big difference. But the challenge is particularly acute because the UK grows relatively small amounts of fruit and vegetables in January and February and is most dependent on supplies from southern Europe at this time of year. So, if there are delays, they could cause some shortages on the shelves. ""Some gaps are possible but we're not going to run out of food - that's not going to happen"" says Ian Wright. When it comes to non-perishable items, there had been some stockpiling in preparation for either outcome, but extra supplies won't last forever. ""The crunch point is probably not going to be in the first few days or weeks of January,"" William Bain argues. ""Towards the end of the month, when new orders start being placed and delivered, we will start to see the processes in Kent and the other ports really tested."" And it's not only about food. Other retailers, which are used to moving their stock freely around the EU customs union, have had to create separate supply chains for the UK. That is costing them more money, and their new systems have yet to be tested properly. It's not just about trade across the English Channel. Trade across the Irish Sea between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland will be subject to the same pressures, while Northern Ireland will be a special case under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods, and unlike the rest of the UK it will continue to enjoy frictionless trade with the EU with no checks of any kind at the land border with the Republic. But there is a price to pay for that - new bureaucracy within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU, for example, has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter the single market (and, from 1 January, Northern Ireland) through a border control post where paperwork is checked, and a proportion of goods physically inspected. There will be a grace period of three months for supermarkets and their suppliers, but some smaller traders may have to get used to thenew rules,externalstraight away. All shipments from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will also need a safety and security declaration, and a customs declaration from a new IT system which none of the traders have used before. The government has set up a Trader Support Service to help. The details of the new trading arrangements for Northern Ireland were announced separately in early December, and provided some clarity. They include an agreement which means the vast majority of goods being shipped from GB to NI will not be at risk of having tariffs imposed. But there are plenty of unresolved issues. Traders are seeking answers about how to send parcels from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and someonline retailers have already suspended deliveries. The trade from British to Northern Irish ports often involves multiple small shipments on a single lorry - all of which will need the right paperwork. ""We need clear rules for everyone in the supply chain,"" says Duncan Buchanan, ""and when you scratch the surface it is just not ready."" It is expected that many checks will be carried out on a 'light touch' basis to begin with. But anyone trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to have to get used to a new way of working very quickly. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces new deal between UK and EU The EU and UK have reached a post-Brexit trade deal, ending months of disagreements over fishing rights and future business rules. At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson said: ""We have taken back control of our laws and our destiny."" The text of the agreement has yet to be released, but the PM claimed it was a ""good deal for the whole of Europe"". The UK is set to exit EU trading rules next Thursday - a year after officially leaving the 27 nation bloc. It will mean big changes for business, with the UK and EU forming two separate markets, and the end of free movement. LIVE: EU and UK agree trade deal Kuenssberg: Johnson gets the deal both sides wanted to achieve What just happened with Brexit? How EU leaders reacted to post-Brexit trade deal But the trade deal will come as a major relief to many British businesses, already reeling from the impact of coronavirus, who feared disruption at the borders and the imposition of tariffs, or taxes on imports. As the deal was announced, Mr Johnson - who had repeatedly said the UK would ""prosper mightily"" without a deal -tweeted a picture of himself,externalsmiling with both thumbs lifted in the air. In a press conference in Brussels, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen said: ""This was a long and winding road but we have got a good deal to show for it."" She said the deal was ""fair"" and ""balanced"" and it was now ""time to turn the page and look to the future"". The UK ""remains a trusted partner,"" she added. This video can not be played A round-up of the Brexit trade agreement At his press conference, Boris Johnson said the Â£668bn a year agreement would ""protect jobs across this country"" and ""enable UK goods to be sold without tariffs, without quotas in the EU market"". He acknowledged he had been forced to give ground on his demands on fishing. ""The EU began with I think wanting a transition period of 14 years, we wanted three years, we've ended up at five years,"" he said. And he said the UK had not got all it wanted on financial services, a vital part of the UK economy, but he insisted the deal was ""nonetheless going to enable our dynamic City of London to get on and prosper as never before"". Brexit: Firms âneed guidanceâ to keep goods moving Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI Most of the UK - except from Northern Ireland -will no longer participate in the Erasmus student exchange scheme, which Mr Johnson said was because it is ""extremely expensive"" - but a British option called the Turing Scheme will provide an alternative, he added. Students in NIwill still be able to take partthanks to an arrangement with the Irish government. The UK's chief trade negotiator Lord Frost said the full text of the free trade agreement would be published soon. The UK Parliament will be recalled on 30 December to vote on the deal - it will also need to be ratified by the European Parliament. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - said his party would vote for the deal in the Commons, ensuring it will pass. He said it was ""a thin agreement"" that ""does not provide adequate protections"" for jobs, manufacturing, financial services or workplace rights and ""is not the deal the government promised"". But with no time left to renegotiate, the only choice was between ""this deal or no deal,"" he added. No deal would have ""terrible consequences for this country and the Labour Party cannot allow that to happen"", said the Labour leader, and that was why he had decided to back it. A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. What happens next with Brexit? Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford said a deal was better than no deal but criticised the timing just a week before the UK exits the EU single market and customs union. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Brexit is happening against Scotland's will - and there is no deal that will ever make up for what Brexit takes away from us. ""It's time to chart our own future as an independent, European nation."" Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he would study the text of the deal but added: ""From what we have heard today, I believe that it represents a good compromise and a balanced outcome."" Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage - who played a leading role in the campaign to get the UK out of the EU in the 2016 referendum - told the BBC the deal was ""far from perfect"" and that for fisheries in particular it was a ""rotten deal"" - but added: ""It's a lot better off than we were five years ago."" One fishing industry representative said the UK had made ""significant concessions on fish"", and ""there will be a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen tonight"". ""There will certainly be those that see this as selling out "", said Barrie Deas, the head of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. Negotiations in Brussels went down to the wire over what EU fishing boats are allowed to catch in UK waters. Fishing makes up just 0.12% of the UK's economy. It is a massive achievement for both sides that they have done such a huge trade deal on the timetable that was said to be impossible at the start. Whatever your personal view, there's a sense of vindication in the camp of those who campaigned to leave the EU - they got a free trade deal with zero quotas and zero tariffs (although there may be some before you scream) but the UK will not be under European law. It's no coincidence that David Frost's number two, Oliver Lewis, wrote the Vote Leave manifesto. No 10 believes the PM, who was propelled to his position by the Vote Leave tribe, has been able to keep his central Brexit promises. Look out for the ""rebalancing clause"" when the deal finally emerges - the mechanism where either side can request a change to the deal, or seek to punish the other side if they believe they are breaking the agreement. In short, the UK side believes it means they have been able to achieve two clear objectives: the deal applies to both sides, it's reciprocal, but there is the possibility of exit if things go wrong, without collapsing the whole shebang. But it's Christmas Eve, so I suspect you agree that's enough for now. The vote in Parliament is set for the 30th. The result is not in doubt, but the theory that's been agreed tonight, will only be tested in years to come. Read more from Lauraon Twitter,externaland herlatest blog here. The government's economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had warned that leaving without a deal would have shrunk the national income by 2% next year and led to major job losses. There were also concerns it would lead to higher prices in the shops for many imported goods. There are still big question marks about what the deal will mean for the rest of British business. Firms that trade with the 27 member states have carried on as normal for the past year during the so-called transition period that kicked in when Britain left the EU. They will still face extra paperwork when the country leaves the EU single market and customs union next week. But the threat of tariffs - import taxes - between the UK and its biggest trading partner will be removed. How will Brexit affect you? Do you have any questions about the trade deal?

"Deer were among the animals slaughtered in central Portugal Portuguese officials have expressed outrage at the massacre of more than 500 deer and wild boar in a hunting zone in the centre of the country. Environment Minister JoÃ£o Fernandes said the killing by 16 Spanish hunters was ""vile"" and an ""environmental crime"" that should be prosecuted. Pictures of the slaughter were shared on social media. Hunting individual animals is allowed but in this incident most of the zone's deer population are said to have died. The killing is thought to have taken place on a farm in the Torrebela tourist hunting zone, near Azambuja, about 40km (24 miles) from the Portuguese capital Lisbon on 17 and 18 December.

"HMS Northumberland monitored the Russian destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov off the west coast of Scotland last month The crew of a Royal Navy warship has been forced to return to shore and isolate over Christmas after ""a number of suspected Covid cases"" on board. HMS Northumberland, which has specialist sensors to hunt for foreign submarines, had been on call to protect UK waters over the festive period. But she was forced to return to Devonport Naval Base, near Plymouth, on Wednesday. The Navy said it will still meet all of its ""operational tasks"" over Christmas.

"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to â¬1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning. It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36. The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday. The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday. Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. UK-EU trade talks continue ahead of expected deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as Â£600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds.

"Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Charles Kushner US President Donald Trump has pardoned his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, ex-adviser Roger Stone and the father of Mr Trump's son-in-law. Mr Manafort was convicted in 2018 in an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Mr Trump had previously commuted the prison sentence of Mr Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress. They are among 29 people to benefit from Mr Trump's latest pardons before he leaves office next month. Twenty-six of them won full pardons on Wednesday night, while another three received commutations. A commutation usually takes the form of a reduced prison term, but does not erase the conviction or imply innocence. A pardon is an expression of the president's forgiveness that confers extra privileges, such as restoring the convict's right to vote. Presidents often grant pardons in their final days of office. US 'bribes-for-pardon' inquiry unveiled Mr Trump's pardon for Manafort spared his former campaign chairman from serving most of his seven-and-a-half year prison term for financial fraud and conspiring to obstruct the investigation into himself. He had been serving his term under home confinement since being released from federal prison in Mayover fears of coronavirus, but is now a free man. The grateful political operative responded by tweeting: ""Mr President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are."" Mr Manafort (C) with Mr Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress about his attempts to contact Wikileaks, the website that released damaging emails about Mr Trump's 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday night, the long-time Trump friend and adviser welcomed his upgrade from a commutation to full pardon. He said he had been the victim of a ""Soviet-style show trial on politically motivated charges"", reports Politico. Stone has been urging Mr Trump on his way out of the White House to also pardon Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Roger Stone: Trump ally and Russia probe defendant Another pardon went to Charles Kushner, a real estate magnate who is the father ofIvanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, a White House adviser. Kushner Sr - whose family boasts a portfolio of 20,000 properties from New York to Virginia - was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering. The witness tampering charge arose from Kushner Sr's retaliation against his brother-in-law, who was co-operating with authorities against him. Kushner Sr hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, recorded their encounter with hidden cameras and sent it to his own sister. This video can not be played Roger Stone speaks to reporters reacting to Trump's decision to grant clemency It was the president's second wave of clemency orders in as many days. On Tuesday nighthe pardoned 15 people and bestowed commutations on five others. They included two other figures who were convicted in the US special counsel inquiry into alleged Russian election interference, three Republican ex-members of Congress, and four Blackwater military contractors who were involved in a 2007 massacre in Iraq. Trump condemned for pardoning Blackwater guards In November, Mr Trump pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was also convicted in the special counsel's Russia inquiry. Mr Flynn had admitted lying to the FBI before attempting to retract his guilty plea. The president has now pardoned five figures convicted as a result of the special counsel inquiry, which he always condemned as a witch hunt. Robert Mueller's 22-month investigation concluded in May last year without a single figure in Mr Trump's orbit facing any charge of conspiracy with the Kremlin during the 2016 US election. Notably absent from Mr Trump's wave of Christmas pardons are two other figures who were convicted in the Mueller probe: Manafort's deputy, Rick Gates, and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Both men co-operated extensively with prosecutors. Cohen, who was released from prison in May over coronavirus concerns, took to Twitter to vent about the pardons. ""What happened tonight shows how broken the whole criminal justice sustem [sic] is,"" he tweeted. This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? The constitution allows the sitting president the ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment"". Mr Trump has granted fewer acts of clemency - under 100 so far -  than any president in modern history apart from George HW Bush. Barack Obama, for instance, granted 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations during his two terms in office in 2009-17. But Mr Trump's critics say he has bypassed the usual process of consulting the Department of Justice (DOJ) unit that makes such recommendations, and conferred clemency on more political cronies than his predecessors have done. Adam Schiff, the Democratic head of the influential House Intelligence Committee, tweeted: ""During the Mueller investigation, Trump's lawyer floated a pardon to Manafort. Manafort withdrew his co-operation with prosecutors, lied, was convicted, and then Trump praised him for not 'ratting'. ""Trump's pardon now completes the corrupt scheme. Lawless until the bitter end,"" Mr Schiff said. Meanwhile, the first Republican Senator to criticise the move was Ben Sasse. He said in a statement that ""felons like Manafort and Stone"" had ""flagrantly and repeatedly violated the law,externaland harmed Americans"", adding: ""This is rotten to the core.""

"Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Charles Kushner US President Donald Trump has pardoned his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, ex-adviser Roger Stone and the father of Mr Trump's son-in-law. Mr Manafort was convicted in 2018 in an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Mr Trump had previously commuted the prison sentence of Mr Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress. They are among 29 people to benefit from Mr Trump's latest pardons before he leaves office next month. Twenty-six of them won full pardons on Wednesday night, while another three received commutations. A commutation usually takes the form of a reduced prison term, but does not erase the conviction or imply innocence. A pardon is an expression of the president's forgiveness that confers extra privileges, such as restoring the convict's right to vote. Presidents often grant pardons in their final days of office. US 'bribes-for-pardon' inquiry unveiled Mr Trump's pardon for Manafort spared his former campaign chairman from serving most of his seven-and-a-half year prison term for financial fraud and conspiring to obstruct the investigation into himself. He had been serving his term under home confinement since being released from federal prison in Mayover fears of coronavirus, but is now a free man. The grateful political operative responded by tweeting: ""Mr President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are.""

"Pilots and crew have to quarantine after each flight A New Zealand pilot blamed for causing Taiwan's first domestic coronavirus transmission in months, has been fired by the island's Eva Air. On Tuesday, a contact of the pilot tested positive, ending Taiwan's 253-day streak without a local case. Some public Christmas activities have since been suspended and the government has suggested people should stay at home during New Year's Eve. Overall, Taiwan has recorded only 777 infections and seven deaths. The pilot is thought to have contracted the coronavirus earlier in December but remained asymptomatic. Pilots returning to the island after a flight are meant to remain in quarantine for three days but are not tested unless they show symptoms. Unaware that he carried the virus, he continued to fly and was reportedly coughing on a flight to Taiwan from the US. He tested positive on 20 December. Virus 'success' Taiwan wary despite vaccine Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Two days later, Taiwan discovered its first domestic infection in months. Authorities traced back that the infected woman had been in contact with the pilot. This video can not be played Flying is a very different experience in the age of coronavirus Authorities fined the man 300,000 Taiwanese dollars ($10,600, Â£7,900) for failing to properly declare contacts and activities to officials. Eva Air said the pilot was fired for violating operational principles, including his failure to wear a mask in the cockpit. Other than the woman, he is thought to have infected two of his colleagues, a pilot from Japan and one from Taiwan. Neither authorities nor the airline have named the pilot but Eva Air said in a statement ""the behaviour of an individual employee has undermined everyone's efforts at epidemic prevention"" and had brought ""serious damage to the company's reputation and image"". In the wake of the new case, authorities are considering toughening the Covid safety requirements for airlines. Taiwan's early response has kept the virus well in check Health authorities have traced around 170 people who had contact with the infected woman and they are either in home quarantine or being monitored for symptoms. The shops the pilot and the woman visited have been disinfected and anyone who had also visited the store has been asked to get tested. The company where the woman works has shut its gym, cafÃ© and canteen, restricted employees from eating at their desk and banned visitors from entering its premises. Taiwan has been one of the most successful places in the world in dealing with Covid-19, largely attributed to its early and strict border controls, a ban on foreign visitors and mandatory quarantine for all Taiwanese returning home. The island's 23 million people have also proactively been wearing face masks, even before they were required to do so.

"Christmas is different for everyone this year but especially for the thousands of UK families who have lost relatives to Covid-19. Here, nine people reveal how they plan to remember the loved ones who are no longer here to celebrate the season with them. Dean, Cardiff ""My father was an entrepreneur, raconteur and creative maverick - but he also had a huge heart,"" says neuroscientist and author Dean Burnett. ""He was also pathologically obsessed with gravy."" Peter Burnett died in April at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. He was 58. In the 1980s and 90s, Dean's parents ran a pub in Pontycymer, in the Garw Valley north of Bridgend. ""My dad was a big community figure and his exploits are still talked about today,"" says Dean. ""It was a bit like growing up in Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights, but with different accents."" Peter and Dean Burnett, and a pan of Dean's gravy Last Christmas, Dean received a video message from his dad - which was just him delivering festive tidings while stirring a large vat of gravy. ""He always used to practise the gravy beforehand,"" says Dean. ""He'd make it in a big saucepan on the stove, tweaking his secret recipe a little each time."" This year, Dean's in charge of the gravy. He too has practised in advance. ""I hope I can do my dad proud - and that my wife and children like it!"" Gail, Cheshire ""Harry thought of himself as a bit of a Bear Grylls. He was a passionate canoeist and loved being in charge of a good barbecue,"" says Gail, of her late husband. Harry worked for Manchester University for nearly 40 years, before taking early retirement a year ago. He died in May aged 62. ""My sister in Sydney was always sending him Hawaiian shirts - and the week before he fell ill, he'd posed in a different one each day for Facebook."" At Harry's funeral, each of Gail's sons wore one of Harry's shirts. Harry (L) and Gail with her three sons Gail joined a widows' support group, but says it was the couple's seven-year-old dachshund - Daisy - who helped her most through the past few months. ""She saved me through the grief. She's part of him now. She's always looking out, wondering where he is."" Harry with Daisy the dachshund Gail is spending Christmas with one of her sons - and Daisy of course. A new album filled with photos of Harry - and the Hawaiian shirts - will be open for the family to look through. ""We'll make sure we toast Harry and do our best to remember him."" Heather, County Down ""Mum came to us every Christmas and I'd make her a hamper of nice things. Her favourite jam, lovely smellies, things that she really liked,"" says Heather, who's a teacher in Belfast. ""A few weeks ago, it struck me that I wouldn't be able to make her a hamper this year."" Andree died with Covid in hospital in June. She was 92.Heather wanted to carry on the hamper tradition. Andree with her daughter Heather ""I suppose because of my grief over Mum, it made me think of the number of elderly people alone,"" she says. On Facebook, Heather asked friends and family to become a ""Silver Santa"" and provide a personalised present, for about Â£10, for care home residents. But her initial post travelled far and wide. ""Within one week I had 800 offers!"" ""Because of data protection, we only had the resident's initials, gender and what their favourite things were. One elderly man liked Manchester United and brandy."" The gifts have been delivered to more than 40 care homes in North Down. Heather delivers some of the donated gifts Andree was always on her sewing machine. When Heather cleared her house after her death, she found hundreds of handicrafts her mum had made over the years. ""I put some of Mum's crafts into a few of the gifts. A little bit of Mum is living on and doing good this Christmas."" Dorothy, Birmingham ""He was a wonderful son, brother and uncle. He'd buy me lunch and take me shopping. He was always there, always thinking of other people."" Stephen died at the end of March. He was 39. His family weren't able to bury him until May. ""It was terrible, we were in bits. He was all alone and we couldn't see his body,"" says Dorothy. ""And then one night I had a dream. I was holding him and he told me, 'Mum don't worry, I'm all right.' I felt like I'd said goodbye."" Stephen with Dorothy. and his personal items At Christmas, the family will light 12 candles and say a prayer for Stephen. His brothers and sisters have already each taken one of his personal possessions - ""gifts from him for Christmas"", says Dorothy who has kept a few things for herself. ""A necklace with a lion's head which he had in the hospital - and one of his favourite T-shirts with Bob Marley on the front."" Rhys, Nottinghamshire ""My mum was the agony aunt of Kimberley,"" says Tina's son, Rhys. Tina had worked for most of her adult life in two supermarkets in the small Nottinghamshire town. She knew everyone. She died aged 53. Rhys and his brother Anthony were allowed to sit by her bedside, in PPE, until the very end. Their father, Tina's partner Mick, was recovering at home after his own battle with Covid-19. Tina Cooke, funeral tributes and enjoying a family meal out On the day of her funeral, hundreds of people stood outside their homes waving football flags and blowing whistles. Tina was a big supporter of the Rams - Derby County FC. Her football shirt would end up on her seat at Pride Park Stadium for some of the remaining games of the 2019-20 season. Christmas will be tough says Rhys, but the family are working towards a fitting tribute. Tina will be remembered on an engraved memorial brick at the football ground, with her ashes interred inside. Kazeema, West Midlands ""We got married on the same day to two brothers. I looked after her kids and she looked after mine. She was my heart and soul,"" says Kazeema of her sister Areema. A newly qualified nurse at the age of 36, Areema died where she worked - at Walsall Manor Hospital. ""She started at the hospital as a housekeeper in 2003,"" says Kazeema. ""Sixteen years later she fulfilled her dream of becoming a nurse."" Areema Nasreen with her sisters and at graduation, and Kazeema Afzal (r) Kazeema is a healthcare assistant in the department where Areema worked. Inspired by her sister, she's now trying to become a nurse herself. ""I want Areema to be proud of me. It's so difficult for some British Asian girls to get into higher education and study. They're expected to bring up families. This is so important."" The hospital trust has set up a scholarship in Areema's name, which will fully fund a nursing degree for someone who cannot afford the fees. Kazeema says work has kept her sane since Areema died - and over Christmas she'll be on shift. ""Areema would have worked too if she was here,"" she says. Joanne, East Lothian ""My mum was a bit of a shopaholic. She used to get taxis to the shops and banter with the drivers,"" says Joanne. ""When she died, I had nice messages from them saying they'd miss her blunt Glaswegian wit. She was funny, but I don't think she always realised it."" Josie died in April. She was 77. Joanne lived near her mum in Dunbar, to the east of Edinburgh. She and her two daughters have bought a wreath and wicker robin to put on Josie's grave - and a new ornament for their Christmas tree. Josie, Joanne and the angel ornaments and robin ""So we now have angel wings on the tree sitting together. One for Mum - and one for Dad, who died in 2008."" With money her mum left her, Joanne has bought her daughters a final Christmas gift from their granny - some jewellery. ""Mum was a very bland eater. She always insisted on soup and roast beef for Christmas dinner. It's going to be strange not having her to focus on. We'll all miss her at the table."" Denise, Cornwall In the corner of a country garden, barely a mile from steep cliffs that overlook the sea, there's a newly planted crab apple tree. It has already borne a couple of handfuls of bright red fruit and Denise is looking forward to spring - when it will come alive with scented, white blossom. She planted it in memory of her husband John. He always liked fruit trees. John was 78 and had a long-term, painful medical condition. He was admitted to a hospital ward thought to be Covid-free - but soon developed symptoms. He died in the early hours of a Monday morning. ""That was the longest night of my life,"" says Denise. The couple moved to their smallholding 20 years ago. For much of that time they reared a flock of sheep. Now though, there are just three animals to look after. John and Denise in 2000, their sheep, and the crab apple tree she has planted in his memory Denise has seen few people in the months since John's death, but she's hoping to see family at Christmas. She likes to sit on a bench close to John's tree. ""We'd like to scatter his ashes around the tree. I want the family to be there and they'd want to be there too. But if it can't be done at Christmas, I'm prepared to wait until spring - when the blossom arrives."" Ven, West Yorkshire ""Hard-working, that's how I would describe my father,"" says Ven. ""On the day of his burial, we passed through Pontefract Hospital. Some NHS staff and managers were waiting to pay their respects. It was very moving."" Policarpio, who was originally from the Philippines, died in April aged 67. He was a nurse for more than 40 years before his recent retirement. For the last 18 years of his career he worked for Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust. Policarpio with his granddaughter and as a younger man Since Policarpio's funeral in the spring, the family - who are Catholic - have visited the cemetery every day. Over Christmas, they'll do the same. ""It's very traditional. In the cemetery we take our rosary beads and recite a special prayer for the deceased - the 'Panalangin para sa mga Yumao'.

"Travel by visitors to the UK from South Africa has been banned amid concern over a variant of Covid-19 linked to the country. People who have been in or transited through South Africa in the last 10 days are no longer allowed into the UK. The new rule does not apply to British and Irish nationals - but they will have to self-isolate. The variant was found in London and north-west England, both in contacts of people who had been in South Africa. The Department for Transport said the ban reflects the ""increased risk"" from the new variant, but will be kept under review. The travel ban came into effect at 09:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Anyone required to quarantine will need to do so for 10 days, along with members of their household. UK visa holders and permanent residents arriving from South Africa will not be affected - but they will also need to self-isolate. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Six million people to enter tier 4 on Boxing Day Covid variant find âdue to work of UK scientistsâ What's happening to the numbers in Africa? The government had already ordered anyone in the UK who has travelled to South Africa in the past fortnight, and anyone they have been in contact with, to quarantine immediately, along with their households. This video can not be played More tier 4 areas, a new variant and a message of hope - three things from the Downing Street press conference At a Downing Street press briefing on Wednesday, Health Secretary Hancock said the new variant linked to South Africa was ""highly concerning"". He said those required to quarantine ""must restrict all contact with any other person whatsoever"". The variant was detected for the first time in the UK on Tuesday. Scientists in South Africa say,externalit is still being analysed, but the data are consistent with it spreading more quickly. It shares some similarities with another new Covid variant that hasalready been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? On Wednesday, a further 39,237 people in the UK tested positive for virus - an all-time high - and there were 744 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to government figures. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Six million more people in England are beingmoved into the highest tier four restrictions on 26 December. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)suggests levels of coronavirus are continuing to rise,with one in 85 people in England infected. About two-thirds of people testing positive in London, the east of England, and the South East could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate based on genes detected by the tests, the ONS says. In Wales, about one in 60 people are infected - a sharp increase. The percentage of people testing positive in Northern Ireland is also up, but in Scotland numbers are down. New York City orders international visitors to quarantine Sharp rises in infection levels in England Meanwhile,more than 6,000 lorries are still being held in Kentin south-east England, with drivers being tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to cross the Channel. France had imposed a temporary travel ban earlier in the week over concerns about the new UK variant of Covid-19. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said more than 2,300 drivers have now tested negative, while three were positive. The Department for Transport did not give figures on how many drivers have left so far, but the flow of traffic has increased since Wednesday night when, according to the Port of Dover, fewer than 100 left. More than 50 other countries, including Germany, Italy, India and Pakistan, are continuing to block travellers from the UK.

"Pilots and crew have to quarantine after each flight A New Zealand pilot blamed for causing Taiwan's first domestic coronavirus transmission in months, has been fired by the island's Eva Air. On Tuesday, a contact of the pilot tested positive, ending Taiwan's 253-day streak without a local case. Some public Christmas activities have since been suspended and the government has suggested people should stay at home during New Year's Eve. Overall, Taiwan has recorded only 777 infections and seven deaths. The pilot is thought to have contracted the coronavirus earlier in December but remained asymptomatic. Pilots returning to the island after a flight are meant to remain in quarantine for three days but are not tested unless they show symptoms. Unaware that he carried the virus, he continued to fly and was reportedly coughing on a flight to Taiwan from the US. He tested positive on 20 December. Virus 'success' Taiwan wary despite vaccine Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Two days later, Taiwan discovered its first domestic infection in months. Authorities traced back that the infected woman had been in contact with the pilot. This video can not be played Flying is a very different experience in the age of coronavirus Authorities fined the man 300,000 Taiwanese dollars ($10,600, Â£7,900) for failing to properly declare contacts and activities to officials. Eva Air said the pilot was fired for violating operational principles, including his failure to wear a mask in the cockpit. Other than the woman, he is thought to have infected two of his colleagues, a pilot from Japan and one from Taiwan. Neither authorities nor the airline have named the pilot but Eva Air said in a statement ""the behaviour of an individual employee has undermined everyone's efforts at epidemic prevention"" and had brought ""serious damage to the company's reputation and image"". In the wake of the new case, authorities are considering toughening the Covid safety requirements for airlines. Taiwan's early response has kept the virus well in check Health authorities have traced around 170 people who had contact with the infected woman and they are either in home quarantine or being monitored for symptoms. The shops the pilot and the woman visited have been disinfected and anyone who had also visited the store has been asked to get tested. The company where the woman works has shut its gym, cafÃ© and canteen, restricted employees from eating at their desk and banned visitors from entering its premises. Taiwan has been one of the most successful places in the world in dealing with Covid-19, largely attributed to its early and strict border controls, a ban on foreign visitors and mandatory quarantine for all Taiwanese returning home. The island's 23 million people have also proactively been wearing face masks, even before they were required to do so.

"The UK government has told the agricultural industry that the EU will allow almost all food and plant exports from Great Britain to continue after Brexit. As a first step, the UK has to be awarded ""third country"" listed status to be allowed to export to the EU. A Defra letter says the EU will confirm this legally on Monday, with effect from 1 January. This will apply irrespective of a post-Brexit deal. If no deal were struck, taxes on imports both ways would apply too, while new red tape such as export health certificates will be introduced. ""Third country listing"" is essential to permit continuing exports of, for example, Welsh lamb or live chicks. The National Farmers Union said it was a ""critical step forward"". While almost all UK plant exports are also listed, there is a delay on some exports of seeds. Pound gains on hopes a Brexit trade deal is close Truckers clear of Covid board ferries for France How dependent is the UK on the EU for food? And whereas the export of Ware potatoes for eating is still permitted, there will be a ban on exporting seed potatoes - that is, potatoes which are not meant to be consumed, but are planted in order to grow more potatoes. The Defra letter says: ""Unfortunately the EU have confirmed they will not accept our case for a permanent change to the prohibition on seed potatoesâ¦ on the grounds that there is no agreement for GB to be dynamically aligned with EU rules"". This is an industry significantly focused on Scotland and the north of England. Exports of seed potatoes will also be barred from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. A continuity trade deal with Egypt will protect the largest market for British exports. Scottish government rural spokesman Fergus Ewing said it would be ""disastrous for our world leading industry"". It was a delay to the process of granting third country listed status that led to the Government accusing the EU of threatening to ""blockade"" Northern Ireland.  This news guarantees that access for almost everything. Pound gains on hopes a Brexit trade deal is close Truckers clear of Covid board ferries for France How dependent is the UK on the EU for food?

"Levels of coronavirus are continuing to rise with one in 85 people in England infected, according to the Office for National Statistics. Figures for the week to 18 December estimate nearly 650,000 people have the virus, up from 570,000 the week before. London now has the highest percentage of people testing positive - more than 2%. In Wales, the virus is infecting one in 60 people - a sharp increase. Infection levels are also up in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased, equating to one in 140 people there with the virus, the ONS suggests. It comes as a total of 521,594 people have been vaccinated against coronavirus in England over the two weeks since roll-out started, with thousands more across the UK nations. People aged 80 and over received 70% of these doses. In Scotland 56,676 people have received the vaccine, in Wales the figure is 22,595 and in Northern Ireland it is 16,068. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon Six million people to enter tier 4 on Boxing Day According to the ONS figures,external, there are sharp rises in levels of positive tests in the capital, the east of England, and the South East, where a new variant of the virus is spreading at a dangerous rate, according to government ministers. About two-thirds of people testing positive in these areas could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate, the ONS says. Meanwhile, case rates in London have doubled in one week, figures from Public Health England show, to 602 per 100,000 people. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, said: ""This will not be a normal Christmas for any of us. ""By continuing to reduce your contacts you can help to slow the spread of Covid-19. Remember that about one in three people may never experience any symptoms so could infect others without realising it."" There are two variants causing concern at the moment - the first, which emerged in Kent, is thought to be driving a rapid growth in cases and hospital admissions in the south and east of England in recent weeks. Scientists advising government are worried the rest of the UK could experience the same thing, as the number of patients in hospital with Covid approaches levels of the spring peak. Schools 'may need to close to control new variant' This has led to strict rules being imposed on six million more people in England from 26 December when 40% of the country will be living under tier 4 restrictions. Scientists say the new variant spreads more easily than other forms of the virus although they don't believe it causes more serious disease. The second variant, which originated in South Africa and is causing a spike in cases there, was detected in two cases in the UK on Tuesday, promptinga ban on travel from the country. The R, or reproduction number of the virus, is now between 1.1 and 1.3 for the UK, with regions in the south and east of England even higher, signalling that the epidemic is growing fast. The ONS figures are based on tests of people in thousands of households across the UK whether they have symptoms or not, giving an accurate estimate of how many people are infected with the virus. Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, says the figure of one in 85 people with the virus in England is ""worryingly high"". But there is some good news - infection rates in the north of England have been falling in recent weeks. ""I hope that the new virus variant and any extra mixing of people over Christmas does not reverse the positive trends in those parts of the country,"" Prof McConway says. Daily UK government figures,externalshow there were 39,036 confirmed new cases on Thursday, slightly down from yesterday's record of 39,237. The total number of cases reported in the last week is nearly 50% higher than the week before. On the same day, the deaths of another 574 people were reported within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19. It is almost inevitable that this figure will rise in the coming weeks as small numbers of those infected become seriously ill with the disease. The latest figures show 21,286 people in hospital with Covid-19 as of Tuesday. The first wave peak was 21,683 people in hospital on 12 April.

"The deepfake Queen looks very like the real one This year's Channel 4 alternative Christmas message will be delivered by a deepfake of the Queen. While the Queen is delivering her traditional message on the BBC and ITV, her digitally created doppelgÃ¤nger will be sharing its ""thoughts"" on Channel 4. Buckingham Palace told the BBC it had no comment on the broadcast. Channel 4 said the intention was to give a ""stark warning"" about fake news in the digital age. Deepfake technology can be used to create convincing yet entirely fictional video content, and is often used to spread misinformation. In the message, the deepfake will try its hand at a TikTok viral dance challenge. The five-minute message will refer to a number of controversial topics, including the decision by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave the UK. It will also allude to the Duke of York's decision to step down from royal duties earlier this year after an interview he gave to the BBC about his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell was not impressed: ""There have been countless imitations of the Queen. This isn't a particularly good one. ""The voice sounds what it is - a rather poor attempt to impersonate her. What makes it troubling is the use of video technology to attempt to sync her lips to the words being spoken."" This video can not be played WATCH: Channel 4 says its deepfake video of the Queen is meant to act as a warning Some members of the public have also suggested the video is ""disrespectful"" via posts on social media. The media watchdog Ofcom said it had received ""a small number of complaints"", but because it is a post-transmission regulator could not consider them at this time. While current technology does allow for voice deepfakes, the voice of this deepfake will be dubbed by British actress Debra Stephenson. The TV star was previously the voice of a puppet of the monarch in the 2020 revival of satirical sketch show Spitting Image. Stephenson said: ""As an actress it is thrilling but it is also terrifying if you consider how this could be used in other contexts."" The deepfake has been created by Oscar-winning VFX studio Framestore. Deepfakes first rose to prominence in early 2018. At the time, a developer adapted cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques to create software that swapped one person's face for another. However, the process has since become much more accessible. There are now numerous apps that require just a single photo in order to substitute a Hollywood actor for that of the user. Earlier this year, Microsoft unveiled a tool that can spot deepfakes. The firm said it hoped to help combat disinformation, but experts warned it was at risk of becoming outdated due to advances in technology. Nina Schick, author of Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse, told the BBC there was growing concern about the other malicious ways deepfake technology could be used. ""While it offers tremendous commercial and creative opportunities, transforming entire industries from entertainment to communication, it is also a technology that will be weaponised. ""Used maliciously, AI-generated synthetic media, or deepfakes, are sophisticated forms of visual disinformation."" The Alternative Christmas Message will be shown on Channel 4 at 15:25 GMT on 25 December. Deepfake videos: Can you really believe what you see?

"Travellers will face heavy fines for breaking New York's new quarantine restrictions New York City has introduced quarantine rules for international travellers following emergence of new Covid variants in countries like the UK. Mayor Bill de Blasio said all visitors would be ordered to stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. He said anyone arriving from the UK would be visited by sheriff's deputies to ensure they abide by the rules. Those who breach them will be fined $1,000 (Â£737) a day, Mr de Blasio warned. About 18.4m coronavirus cases and more than 326,000 deaths have been recorded across the US, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Dozens of countries - including nearly all 27 EU states - have already imposed restrictions on travel from the UK, as governments clamp down on the spread of coronavirus over the Christmas period. This week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that a new strain of coronavirus was behind a surge in cases in the country. Then on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yet another variant - originating in South Africa - had been detected in the country. The UK has said the new coronavirus strains are more virulent than their predecessors The two variants are still being analysed, but the government said it was confident that both are more easily transmittable than other strains. But the UK government said its new, tougher lockdown measures would help to contain the spread. America continues to report the world's highest total cases and Covid-related deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. In all, about 5% of the US population are known to have been infected since the pandemic began. Daily cases have been at record levels since early November, and many states are overwhelmed with hospitalisation numbers. US regulators have recently approved two vaccines - one by Moderna, and another by Pfizer and BioNTech - and over 9.4 million doses have been shipped nationwide, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered The government has also signed a deal with Pfizer to buy an additional 100 million doses of the its vaccine. But last week, a US general in charge of distributing the jabs apologised after many states learned they would be receiving fewer vaccines than expected. As of Wednesday, over one million Americans had had their first jab, the CDC said. Earlier this year, the government pledged to inoculate 20 million people by the end of 2020.

"Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Charles Kushner US President Donald Trump has pardoned his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, ex-adviser Roger Stone and the father of Mr Trump's son-in-law. Mr Manafort was convicted in 2018 in an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Mr Trump had previously commuted the prison sentence of Mr Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress. They are among 29 people to benefit from Mr Trump's latest pardons before he leaves office next month. Twenty-six of them won full pardons on Wednesday night, while another three received commutations. A commutation usually takes the form of a reduced prison term, but does not erase the conviction or imply innocence. A pardon is an expression of the president's forgiveness that confers extra privileges, such as restoring the convict's right to vote. Presidents often grant pardons in their final days of office. US 'bribes-for-pardon' inquiry unveiled Mr Trump's pardon for Manafort spared his former campaign chairman from serving most of his seven-and-a-half year prison term for financial fraud and conspiring to obstruct the investigation into himself. He had been serving his term under home confinement since being released from federal prison in Mayover fears of coronavirus, but is now a free man. The grateful political operative responded by tweeting: ""Mr President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are."" Mr Manafort (C) with Mr Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress about his attempts to contact Wikileaks, the website that released damaging emails about Mr Trump's 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday night, the long-time Trump friend and adviser welcomed his upgrade from a commutation to full pardon. He said he had been the victim of a ""Soviet-style show trial on politically motivated charges"", reports Politico. Stone has been urging Mr Trump on his way out of the White House to also pardon Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Roger Stone: Trump ally and Russia probe defendant Another pardon went to Charles Kushner, a real estate magnate who is the father ofIvanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, a White House adviser. Kushner Sr - whose family boasts a portfolio of 20,000 properties from New York to Virginia - was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering. The witness tampering charge arose from Kushner Sr's retaliation against his brother-in-law, who was co-operating with authorities against him. Kushner Sr hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, recorded their encounter with hidden cameras and sent it to his own sister. This video can not be played Roger Stone speaks to reporters reacting to Trump's decision to grant clemency It was the president's second wave of clemency orders in as many days. On Tuesday nighthe pardoned 15 people and bestowed commutations on five others. They included two other figures who were convicted in the US special counsel inquiry into alleged Russian election interference, three Republican ex-members of Congress, and four Blackwater military contractors who were involved in a 2007 massacre in Iraq. Trump condemned for pardoning Blackwater guards In November, Mr Trump pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was also convicted in the special counsel's Russia inquiry. Mr Flynn had admitted lying to the FBI before attempting to retract his guilty plea. The president has now pardoned five figures convicted as a result of the special counsel inquiry, which he always condemned as a witch hunt. Robert Mueller's 22-month investigation concluded in May last year without a single figure in Mr Trump's orbit facing any charge of conspiracy with the Kremlin during the 2016 US election. Notably absent from Mr Trump's wave of Christmas pardons are two other figures who were convicted in the Mueller probe: Manafort's deputy, Rick Gates, and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Both men co-operated extensively with prosecutors. Cohen, who was released from prison in May over coronavirus concerns, took to Twitter to vent about the pardons. ""What happened tonight shows how broken the whole criminal justice sustem [sic] is,"" he tweeted. This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? The constitution allows the sitting president the ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment"". Mr Trump has granted fewer acts of clemency - under 100 so far -  than any president in modern history apart from George HW Bush. Barack Obama, for instance, granted 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations during his two terms in office in 2009-17. But Mr Trump's critics say he has bypassed the usual process of consulting the Department of Justice (DOJ) unit that makes such recommendations, and conferred clemency on more political cronies than his predecessors have done. Adam Schiff, the Democratic head of the influential House Intelligence Committee, tweeted: ""During the Mueller investigation, Trump's lawyer floated a pardon to Manafort. Manafort withdrew his co-operation with prosecutors, lied, was convicted, and then Trump praised him for not 'ratting'. ""Trump's pardon now completes the corrupt scheme. Lawless until the bitter end,"" Mr Schiff said. Meanwhile, the first Republican Senator to criticise the move was Ben Sasse. He said in a statement that ""felons like Manafort and Stone"" had ""flagrantly and repeatedly violated the law,externaland harmed Americans"", adding: ""This is rotten to the core.""

"How likely are snowy scenes in any given Christmas? Are you dreaming of a white Christmas? All it takes is for a single snowflake to be observed falling at any time on Christmas Day somewhere in the UK. So, an official white Christmas may not appear snowy at all, while snow lying on the ground is no guarantee. But while most festive films, songs and cards feature snowy scenes, how likely is a white Christmas in Wales' mild - and warming - climate? 'Plan ahead' before Covid Christmas getaway starts Should you see your family at Christmas? In the 60 years since the Met Office has recorded the data locally, 23 Christmases have officially been white in Wales. This equates to roughly four in every decade, or a white Christmas every two to three years. However, more than a quarter of these white Christmases have seen snow fall in only one location. Only six Christmas Days have seen snowfall in more than 10 locations over this period, and all of these were in an 11-year span. White Christmases do not guarantee good sledging The first of these was in 1993, when 24 weather stations reported snowfall, before this peaked at 38 locations in 1995. Other white Christmases followed in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2004. But a white Christmas does not necessarily mark the arrival of snowmen in gardens and parks. Couple become Mr and Mrs White-Christmas Your pictures: Wales in the snow The most recent significant amount of lying snow recorded in Wales on Christmas Day was in 2009, when 16cm (6in) was recorded at the Llanglunllo station in rural Powys. That year saw the longest spell of freezing and snowy weather over the Christmas period in 28 years, according to Oli Claydon, from the Met Office. He added: ""Although we're recording white Christmases, they're not exactly 'get your sledge out territory'."" Wales was blanketed in snow in 2009, but only four weather stations recorded snowfall on Christmas Day It can be tough to definitively say where has seen the most snowy Christmas days in Wales, as some weather stations have opened more recently than others, and Met Office stations do not cover all areas. Since records started in 1960, the weather station at Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog, in Wrexham county, has seen 11 out of 60 white Christmases - and all in the last 30 years. Dinorwic in Gwynedd and Llangunllo and Velindre in Powys have all recorded eight. Typically, snow is more common later in the winter, with January, February and March all seeing more days of slow and sleet on average in the UK. Snow in Wales is more likely in March than December, as the ""Beast from the East"" showed Earlier this month,Met Office analysis suggested snowy winters may become a thing of the pastin the UK within the next 20 to 40 years.

"The UK's departure from the European Union single market at the end of December marks the final stage of the Brexit process, triggered by the majority vote to leave in the 2016 referendum. However, this does not mean that the debate about Brexit is over. Polls suggest voters remain as divided on the issue as they were at the start of 2020. YouGov has regularly asked people the question: ""In hindsight, do you think Britain was right or wrong to leave the European Union?"" During the last three months, on average, 39% have said that the decision was right, while 49% have stated it was wrong. These figures are similar to those recorded by YouGov in the three months leading up to the UK's formal withdrawal from the EU at the end of January. At that point, 40% said that the decision was right and 49% wrong. The divide looks even sharper when voters are asked how they would vote now in response to the question that appeared on the 2016 referendum ballot paper: ""Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the EU or leave the EU?"" In recent months, a handful of polls by ComRes, Deltapoll and YouGov have posed that question again. On average, they have found that 53% would vote Remain and 47% Leave - the same as at the end of January. Of course, given that the UK has now left the EU, ""Remain"" is no longer an option. The question now is whether the UK should stay out of the EU or apply to rejoin. In a couple of their recent polls, Kantar asked people to choose between these two options -  51% backed staying out and 49% backed applying to rejoin. This points to a country that is still divided down the middle on Europe. Few voters have changed their minds since the referendum. As many as 86% of those who voted Remain in 2016 say they would vote the same way again, while 81% of those who backed Leave say they would vote for Brexit once more. Similarly, 89% of Remain voters believe the decision was wrong and 81% of Leave voters that it was right. Equally, according to Kantar, only one in eight (12%) Remain supporters say the UK should stay out of the EU, while just 8% of Leave supporters believe the UK should now apply to rejoin. Of course, the most immediate issue about Brexit has beenwhether the UK would agree a future relationship with the EU,or exit the EU single market without a deal. The polls had suggested that most voters would have preferred to leave with a deal than without one - but not at any price. Meanwhile, Remain and Leave supporters regarded the choice very differently. YouGov found people preferred a deal to no deal by 66% to 15%. Kantar, by contrast, put support for a deal at a more modest 44%, but still found only 21% backing no deal. The rest did not know which was better. Other polls have presented respondents with a more complex set of choices, but largely found the same picture. ComRes on average found that 37% preferred a deal compared with 21% who would have preferred no deal (19% preferred an extension of the transition period until a deal had been struck). Meanwhile Opinium reported that only 16% preferred no deal, while 26% backed a deal that would represent a ""clean break"" with the EU. Another 18% wanted a deal that left the UK closely aligned with the EU, while 26% felt rejoining would be the best option. However, support for leaving without a deal was much higher among Leave voters - and indeed might have been as popular as leaving with a deal. Kantar suggested 35% of Leave voters would have preferred to leave without a deal, while 34% backed having a deal. ComRes put support for the two options among Leave voters at 38% apiece. However, while most voters preferred to be leaving with a deal, it did not necessarily mean that they are opposed to leaving without a deal whatever the circumstances. When YouGov simply asked people whether they supported or opposed leaving without a deal, as many as 32% said they were in favour - much closer to the 44% who were opposed.  Among Leave voters, as many as 67% said they supported no deal. Meanwhile, when Opinium asked what should happen if the UK and the EU were to fail to reach an agreement by the end of 2020, as many as 35% of all voters - and 69% of Leave supporters - said the UK should leave without a deal. For some voters, the better course of action depended on the price to be paid. According to Deltapoll, 38% of all voters thought that the UK should be willing to compromise in order to strike a deal,  but rather more - 41% - say the UK should not make any more compromises. Among Leave voters, no less than 57% are opposed to making compromises.

The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. But we don't know a lot of the detail yet because the full document - expected to be well over 1,000 pages long - has not been released. What we do know is that it means:  European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen says competition rules - designed to prevent one side gaining an unfair advantage - ""will be fair and remain so"". She says the UK and EU will ""continue co-operating in all areas of mutual interest, including things like climate change, energy, security and transport"".

Erasmus is an EU programme that helps students study in other countries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced thatthe UK will not continue to participate in it and will be replacing it with a new scheme. He said leaving Erasmus had been a ""tough decision"" but that under the new scheme, students would ""have the opportunity... not just to go to European universities, but to go to the best universities in the world"". The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he regretted the decision. But the Republic of Ireland's higher education minister said his government was fulfilling a commitment to NI.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Santa is airborne, sprouts are being peeled, and the promised deal landed How fitting that this final chapter in the chronicles of Brexit should grind on for so long. Santa is airborne; sprouts are being peeled; the deal promised last night landing this afternoon. Make no mistake: this is a big moment. Think back. The referendum campaign and the harshest of contentions. The result, four and a half years ago, to the day â and David Cameronâs premiership prematurely aborted. Theresa Mayâs tortuous years wrestling with Brexit, where she, like her predecessor, came off second best. Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street 18 months ago without a mandate or a majority. But, after a collision with the courts, a snap election, a big majority and a pandemic that nearly cost him his life â a deal. Brexit was delivered legally at the end of January. It will be delivered practically at the end of next week â and with an overarching arrangement with the EU that even a matter of days ago looked far from certain. Vast amounts of detail wait to be found, no doubt, buried amid the subterranean depths of the huge deal document itself, which is yet to be scrutinised. And the consequences of Brexit, from the impact on the small export business to Scotlandâs place in the United Kingdom, remain vast and uncertain. But plenty will hope this is the final giant moment in what have been a turbulent few years. ""I think there will be a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen across the country tonight,"" said Barrie Deas, CEO of the UK National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. ""I think there was an expectation that the government would deliver quota shares that reflect the resources that are in UK waters,"" he told BBC News. Deas said he was also concerned that EU fishing boats would continue to operate up to six miles (10km) from the UK coast, when the fishing industry had hoped for a 12-mile limit. He said the compromises left the industry feeling let down. He added, however, that there were positive elements to the deal, including tariff-free trade. ""We hadn't wanted anything extraordinary,"" he said. ""Just the same relationship that the EU currently enjoys with Norway."" Read more about why fishing was so important in the Brexit negotiations.

Here's a quick recap of how we got here - featuring politicians, Larry the Cat, and everyone's favourite Brenda from Bristol. Reality Check Boris Johnson claimed at his press conference that from 1 January âthere will be no non-tariff barriers to tradeâ. But thatâs not right. Non-tariff barriers are things like paperwork to be filled in or regulations that must be followed if trade is to go ahead. Thatâs different from tariffs, which is when countries charge taxes on imports of particular items from other countries. The deal agreed today means there will be no tariffs. But with the UK outside the EU single market and the custom union, there will be a host of new border checks and bureaucracy for the UK trade in goods, as well as significant limitations on the trade in services. The European Commission statement on the deal confirms that â despite the agreement â there will be, from 1 January 2021, âbig changesâ¦ this will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist todayâ. A subsequent statement from Downing Street has sought to clarify Mr Johnsonâs remarks. âWeâve always been clear that weâve left the customs union and single market, which means that there will be some friction in trade which we acknowledge,â it said. âWhat the PM means here, is that there will be no tariffs and no quotas."" So, no tariffs but plenty of new non-tariff barriers which will make trade more costly for both UK and EU businesses. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low-level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments.

""It would go through with Conservative votes, even if the real extremist Brexit voters decide they can't support it,"" Campbell said. ""Boris Johnson should be made to own it."" Borrowing a phrase from former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, he said the party should instead be abstaining and
explaining. ""Explain why it is bad deal for Britain, explain how it can be used as the basis of a different policy."" Otherwise, he said, when things start to go wrong, Boris Johnson will be able to say: ""Well, you voted for it."" ""Abstaining is never great option,"" Campbell added. ""I don't think they should vote against it... I do accept it's a difficult argument. But I really don't think they should do this.""

Watch a clip from his press conference above. The Rock relies on close economic ties with Spain Away from all the drama of the Brexit trade deal the
UK has also been negotiating future arrangements for Gibraltar, a UK territory, with
Spain. About 15,000 workers come and go daily across the
Spain-Gibraltar border. The Rockâs population is about 34,000 and 96% of
Gibraltarians voted Remain in the EU referendum. Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has told the BBC
heâs aiming to get Schengen terms for Gibraltar, to safeguard free movement of
people to and from Spain. Most EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, but the UK has never been in it. If
Gibraltar also joined it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen
country would avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK would have to
go through passport control, as is already the
case. âThe terms for mobility between us and UK
would remain exactly the same as they are now,â said Mr Picardo. Anyone
arriving from outside Schengen would have to show their passports, he added. âThe arrangement is NOT about the
nationality of the person arriving, but their point of departure.â âIf we can, we want to finalise this before the end of the
year,â he said, but added: âItâs not easyâ. Thevote to leave the EUâ back in June 2016 â took place on one
day. The process to actually leave the EU has taken a little bit
longer. To give you a sense of just how long, here is a quick
reminder of what was happening when we first decided to leave the European Union.  2016 was also the year when it felt like an unusually high number of celebrities died - David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Victoria Wood, Prince, George Michael and many more. The Northern Ireland Executive is to meet on Monday to discuss the UK-EU trade deal. Politicians have been reacting to the news in the meantime. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: ""Given the government's Northern Ireland Protocol, a sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland. ""Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union."" Deputy First Minister and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said: ""While we have distinctly different political positions on leaving the EU, we are all agreed that it's in no-one's interests to leave without a deal, therefore this announcement is good news which will be welcomed across the whole island."" Clarity is needed, she added, on ""what the agreement means for businesses and citizens"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""While the deal may seek to mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, it will not undo the damage of Brexit."" He said the ""best deal will always remain being at the heart of the European Union"". Read more here. Companies can now start to plan for the future but there are still short term pressures as a result of the timing of the deal, according to the Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders. Its director general Jonathan Geldart said: âA deal can draw a line under what has been a tumultuous few years for companies. ""It provides a stable basis for the future relationship with our biggest market, and directors are eager to sift through the detail to understand what may change"" He said ""the devil will be in the detail"" of the deal, but the end of ""political prevarication"" was welcome. The bureaucracy caused by Brexit will mean some seafood businesses will collapse, according to Seafood Scotland. The deal, while welcome, comes after the border problems of recent days, its chief executive Donna Fordyce says. ""With Brexit will come new, untested, and extremely complex processes that the seafood sector will have to comply with in just a weekâs time, at huge cost which they can ill afford just now,"" she says. Lorries will be delayed for too long by a ""bureaucratic blockade"", she adds. âWe expect it to be a good few months until everything beds in and in the meantime, seafood businesses will try their best to navigate the changes, but some will not survive.â Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC News it was a ""rotten deal"" for British fishermen, and that he was ""very concerned about the level playing field"". But he nevertheless described it as a ""massive step forward"", the ""end of Brexit wars"" and a ""big, historic, important moment"". ""The truth of it is, thereâll be a lot of people in the EU happy tonight with where things are,"" he said. ""Iâm not over the moon with this, but, weâve reached a point after years of trench warfare, division and bitterness, even I have to say - letâs just mark this moment, itâs not perfect, but itâs a lot better off than we were five years ago."" Felicity lives on the Irish border in South Armagh Felicity
McKee lives in South Armagh which is on the border between northern and
southern Ireland. As a PhD student at Swansea University she regularly drives
to Bristol to fly home via Dublin. As a woman who lives with multiple
disabilities she is concerned about how health insurance will work in the
future. âI
get ill when I travel and there is no way I could afford a hospital stay. The
cost of health insurance is higher anyway for disabled people and Iâve got ill
abroad before. It is very concerning âAs
far as I can see the European Health Insurance card (EHIC) is dead in the water
in the future and the issue of health insurance is messy. When it comes to the
NHS and health care I donât know how that will work if I got ill on the wrong
side of the border. âThereâs
data roaming; am I going to need two phones like I needed when I was in
secondary school? Paying for two contracts on a phone will add up. It's little
things but they make a big difference. âMy
European friends are concerned whether theyâll be able to stay. One of my
friends had their tyres slashed after the referendum result and Iâve noticed a
lot of anti-Irish sentiment too; I think itâs affected a lot of people. People
donât realise the consequences of Brexit. Itâs not the 70s or 80s anymore and
international links are beneficial to have."" Antony Payne is a retired software designer who voted for Brexit Antony Payne voted for Brexit. He said he had been ""complaining bitterly"" all day as there had been so much commentary before any announcement was actually made. He had some concerns about the Erasmus exchange programme and said he and his son, who is a university lecturer, had had discussions about it and also any loss of research investment from the EU. ""But with foreign policy and defence, yes there is a huge disparity in regards to how mainland Europe works compared to what the UK is doing"" he says. He adds: ""The UK was dominated by German thinking and that was about not getting into wars. But British activity has always involved helping out America."" When he was younger Mr Payne, who lives in Kirkcaldy in Scotland and frequently travels to Northern Ireland, voted to join the European Union. But now, in his retirement, his decision to vote for Brexit was not about commercial concerns, but foreign policy. He believes Europe needs to be more like a federation, and the UK part of it.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen are said to have been working to reach an agreement before Christmas Boris Johnson is expected to announce later that the UK has reached an agreement with the EU over post-Brexit trade and security. Officials in Brussels are believed to be finalising the details of a deal that will come into force when the UK leaves EU trading rules next week. It follows months of often fraught negotiations between the two sides. The PM will speak to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen by phone to sign off the deal. Mr Johnson is then expected to hold a press conference in Downing Street to announce it. LIVE: EU and UK on verge of deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? EU to allow post-Brexit UK farm produce exports The announcement had been expected earlier, but it has been delayed while final haggling between the two sides continues. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTE Radio there had been ""some sort of last-minute hitch"" over the small print of the fishing quotas agreement but a deal was still expected later. A deal would end the prospect of the two sides imposing widespread import taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods from 1 January, which could have affected prices. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke four times on Wednesday to get a deal ""over the line"". She said negotiators were ""still haggling over some fine details"", including catch quotas for more than 100 species of fish in UK waters. It is understood the agreement does not have a role for the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, and the two sides have agreed a system to sort out disputes that follows international law, rather than EU law, our political editor said. In addition, she said the two sides have agreed to phase new fishing arrangements over five years, with the UK catching as much as two-thirds of the fish in UK waters by the end of the transition. The deal document is thought to be around 2,000 pages long. It is expected that the UK Parliament will be recalled to vote on a law implementing a deal before 31 December, when the Brexit transition period ends. On the EU side, leaders can decide to apply a deal provisionally before the European Parliament holds a ratification vote early next year. It could also need eventual approval in national EU parliaments, depending on the exact contents of the deal. BBC Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said Mrs von der Leyen was also due to speak later to set out details of the deal. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? It is believed one of the final obstacles being discussed include quotas for particular types of fish. The UK has insisted on having control over fishing in its waters from 1 January and retaining a larger share of the catch from them than under the current quota system. But the EU wanted to phase in a new fishing system over a longer period and retain more of its access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other member states. The sides also disagreed over whether UK firms should continue to follow the same rules as companies within the EU - and on how future trading disputes should be resolved. The pizzas arrived as the negotiations continued into the evening By Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe correspondent As afternoon gave way to evening and evening gave way to night in Brussels optimism that agreement was close never dwindled, but never quite turned into a deal either. At one point pizzas arrived for the weary officials - a delivery man on a bike turning up at the front gates of the European Commission. It was understood that negotiators were still haggling over precise quotas of individual species of fish that EU boats will be allowed to catch in British waters. The governments of individual EU member states must consider the details of any deal but they have been briefed regularly throughout the process and shouldn't find much if anything to surprise them. The issue of how to promote the deal for public consumption is much more pressing for the British side than the European. For the EU there are legal loose ends to be tied up but the European Parliament will only vote on a deal retrospectively at some point in the New Year. In the UK the government will have to get any deal through parliament before 31 December. UK ministers have repeatedly ruled outany extension to the transition period, under which the UK has continued to follow Brussels's trade rules since it left the EU on 31 January. Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays UK, said he welcomed an agreement, which would bring ""clarity"" for business. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said planning for a new trading relationship with the EU had been ""the overriding issue for businesses over the last two years"". ""This was pure politics. It was always the last minute sort of rabbit from the hat,"" he added. The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its group of lawyers to analyse any deal that is reached. The group was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would ""scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"".

Thanks for tuning in. Todayâs live page was brought to you by writers Sophie Williams, Lauren
Turner, Owen Amos and Ritu Prasad. Martha Buckley was todayâs editor. Thanks for joining us on this Christmas Eve as we've brought you all the latest coronavirus news. Here's a recap of the top stories from the UK today.  If you're having a break from the news for a few days now, then have a very Happy Christmas.  Thanks for tuning into our live page today. Here's a round-up of the major headlines from around the world: The number of people estimated to have Covid in Scotland has fallen over the last week, according to official figures. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimated the new, more easily transmittable strain of the virus was responsible for 38% of the positive cases in Scotland. It found about 37,100 (one in 140) people in Scotland had the virus in the seven days to 18 December. That figure has fallen from 52,500 (one in 100) in the week up to 11 December. The ONS said data on the new variant should be treated with caution due to the small numbers involved. It found that 7% of positive tests showed the new variant in the week beginning 7 December, and that rose to 14% the following week.  Mexico has started its mass vaccination programme, just a day
after the first doses arrived in the country. About 3,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived on
Wednesday. A 59-year-old nurse in Mexico City had her injection televised. Doses of the vaccine are being guarded by the military to stop them from falling into
the hands of criminals, AFP reports. More than 120,000 people have died and 1.3 million infections have
been recorded in Mexico since the pandemic began. One of the worst-affected London boroughs says the most significant rise in cases of coronavirus is in those of working age. London now has the highest percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. It's now estimated 2.1% of people in private households have the virus. Jason Strelitz, director of public health in Newham, one of the worst-affected boroughs of the city, said: ""The most significant age group in terms of our local epidemic is people of working age. ""The vast majority of cases are amongst people aged 20-50 and that group has seen also the fastest acceleration. ""There's also been growth in children of secondary school age and slow growth amongst older people but it really is right across the population."" It comes as the weekly surveillance report from Public Health England shows London's rate of new cases of Covid-19 has trebled in just two weeks. The rate stood at 602.2 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to December 20, up from 200.3 in the seven days to December 6.  A 52-year-old black US doctor who accused a suburban hospital physician of racist treatment has died due to Covid-19. In a video shared on Facebook while she was in hospital, Susan Moore said a white doctor had downplayed her pain and made her ""feel like I was a drug addict"". ""All I can do is cry I was in so much pain,"" she wrote in the post. ""He said you can just go home right now. Of note he did not even listen to my lungs, he didnât touch me in any way. He performed no physical exam. I told him, 'You cannot tell me how I feel.'"" Moore said even though she herself was a physician, she was not treated respectfully. In the video, Moore said: ""I put forth and I maintain if I was white, I wouldnât have to go through that."" The case has sparked an outcry over the treatment of black Americans in the US health system. Research has detailed the biases that can be present when black patients seek care - particularly treatment for pain. On Sunday, Moore passed away from complications due to the virus, her sontold the New York Times,external. The hospital has not offered comment, citing privacy laws. On Wednesday, the US set a new record high in hospital admissions, with more than 119,400 in hospital with Covid-19 nationwide. The country has had more than 100,000 people in hospital due to the virus every day since 2 December, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Across the US, states are facing staff shortages even as hospital admissions rise and intensive care units fill up. Experts worry that a spike following the holiday season - which has already seen millions of Americans travel against advice - could overwhelm health centres. A man whose family was told he would not survive Covid-19 says he is looking forward to a""glorious Christmas"". Father of five Neil McCafferty was admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry in October with a gall bladder infection. The 67-year-old was also treated for sepsis before developing Covid-19 and spending several weeks in intensive care. He is now in rehab and ""delighted to be alive"". Neil and wife Bridie traditionally have 17 family members at their home on Boxing Day. Although different this year, it ""will be glorious"", said Neil, who is recovering in Derry's Waterside hospital. ""I'll get to see them. I am sat on the ground floor, by the window. They are all coming down on Christmas morning,"" he said. He's learning to walk again and on Wednesday he shaved himself for the first time in months. ""That was a big achievement. It's all the small things that didn't seem important before.""  The University of Washington's latestInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model,externalprojects the US could see more than 567,000 deaths by 1 April. It's an increase from its previous estimate of 562,000. The model, updated on Wednesday, shows that if 95% of the country started wearing masks the death toll would be diminished by almost 50,000. A rapid vaccine roll-out would also save an estimated 45,000 lives. On the other hand, if states stop following virus restrictions, IHME predicts the US death toll will pass 731,000 by April. As it stands, the US has seen 326,242 deaths due to the virus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Ferry operator DFDS says it has been able to transport only a fraction of the lorries it had capacity for across the Channel in the last two days because of congestion in Dover. It said: ""The borders were reopened for freight drivers with a negative test as at midnight on Tuesday and since then DFDS has had capacity to ship up to 4,000 trucks; due to the logistical issues that have prevented freight getting to the port we have unfortunately only been able to transport 144 trucks out of Dover."" It says it is ""ready to transport freight drivers and their vehicles and any passengers who have valid essential reasons to travel"", if they have a negative Covid test and in line with French government guidelines. ""The company shares the frustration and disappointment that our freight customers have felt in not being able to travel, and we fully understand the issues that this has created for local residents in Dover and the wider East Kent area,"" they said. Extra sailings have been added to today's sailing schedule and the Port of Dover is remaining open over Christmas. Customers cannot enter the port without a negative Covid test result, however. The latest figures from Wednesday showed 6,000 drivers were still stranded in Kent as a repercussion of the travel ban. Nomsa MasekoBBC Southern Africa correspondent Hospitals in South Africaâs Western Cape
province are under severe pressure from rising Covid-19 infections and trauma
cases, as the country experiences a second wave of the virus. Yesterday the country recorded more
than 14,000 new infections, the highest number of cases in a single day, as well as 411 deaths. The Western Cape government says the
second coronavirus wave is proving to be significantly bigger than the first
one in terms of hospital admissions. Scientists in South Africa announced
the discovery of a new coronavirus variant last week. Itâs thought the new variant is
transmitted more easily than previous versions, and this could be driving the
second wave. Some hospitals in the Western Cape are
now at full capacity, with some at 140% capacity. Trauma cases related to alcohol, car
crashes and crime are also putting pressure on the system. The health department is in the
process of adding extra beds in the province and might also have to bring in
the military for assistance. Following the discovery of South
Africaâs new coronavirus variant, the UK government has suspended all flights between
South Africa and the UK. Two cases of the South African variant
have been found in the UK. The South Africa mutation is different
to the new variant recently discovered in the UK, but both are thought to be
more easily transmitted. Scientists say more research is needed
to establish whether the new variants are more severe than previous ones. In a bit of happier news - there's a birthday to celebrate. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US's chief infectious disease researcher who has become the face of the country's pandemic response, turns 80 today. Well wishes for his birthday have poured in on social media. The Mayor of Washington DC declared the day Dr Anthony S Fauci Day. But how is the doctor - who has worked non-stop since January - spending this Christmas Eve? Typically, he'd have an Italian dinner with his family,he told the Washington Post,external, even making the intensive, cheese-egg-meat-filled baked pasta dish timpano. But this year, as he advises all Americans to do, he'll be staying at home with his wife in DC, celebrating with his daughters via Zoom. Concerns have been raised over safety at a half marathon in Cornwall, where 250 runners crossed the line in a mass start. The Indian Queens Half Marathon, held on Sunday, did not feature a staggered start as recommended by Covid-19 safety advice. One runner in the event, John Barnes, said he was ""surprised"" to see so many people congregating at the start. The race director said she believed she had followed guidance and any breach was unintentional. Current advice fromUK Athletics and Run Britain,externalstates ""mass starts are not permitted"", suggesting staggered starts instead. Cornwall Council confirmed it had allowed the event to go ahead after being told a staggered start would be in operation. Read more here. Brazil has announced it is suspending flights arriving in the
country from the UK and banning anyone who has visited the UK over the past two
weeks. Flights passing through the UK will also be banned, a note in the
official gazette on Wednesday confirmed. A number of countries have suspended flights from the UK after a
new strain was identified in the UK. Earlier this week, Britainâs Foreign Office advised against all
but essential travel to Brazil due to its latest assessment of Covid-19 risks. Brazil has recorded more than 189,000 deaths and 7.3 million cases
since the pandemic began. From 26 December, the Isles of Scilly will be the only part of England in tier one - the lowest level of virus restrictions. Cornwall, Herefordshire and the Isle of Wight have been moved to tier two, leaving the islands - 28 miles off the Cornish coast - as the only place with a ""medium"" alert. ""It's a very strange early Christmas present,"" local councillor Steve Sims told the PA news agency. ""Whilst it is a relief, it's a very sobering situation and I remain apprehensive as I'm sure most of my fellow islanders will be."" The islands, which have a population of around 2,000, have had only two recorded cases, he added. Mr Sims's wife, Beth Hilton, edits local magazine Scilly Now & Then and said: ""I don't think we're jumping up and down celebrating the fact that we are still tier one - although it is very welcome news and means we can still go out socially at Christmas if we wish to do so."" An aerial shot of Tresco Abbey Garden in the Isles of Scilly This video can not be played A 101-year-old war veteran has received thousands of Christmas cards and presents from around the world after speaking about the loss of his wife on BBC Breakfast. John Lister and his wife Ella were married for 70 years before she died from coronavirus in February. His care home in Norfolk hoped cards would help him get through his first Christmas without her. Global cases have reached 78 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There are concerns that cases could continue to rise rapidly due to gatherings over Christmas and new year. Europe and North America are seeing the largest increase in cases. The UK has seen levels of the virus continuing to rise with one in 85 people in England infected, according to the Office for National Statistics. A number of European nations, including Italy, have ordered new lockdowns in order to curb the spread. The US has been hit hard by the pandemic. It has the highest case load and number of deaths in the world. California's governor has warned that thousands of people in the state could be hospitalised next month. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Queues of lorries remain in Kent after border closures The border between the UK and France is now open - but as this video shows, the queues of lorries and vans remain. France shut the border on Sunday, in response to surging cases of the new virus variant in London and the South East. Drivers now have to test negative before being allowed into France. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said this morning it would take ""several days"" to clear the backlog. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Schools and universities may have to close, in addition to current tier four restrictions, to bring the new variant of coronavirus under control in the UK. That's the verdict of preliminary rapid analysis work. It calculates the variant is spreading 56% faster than other forms of the virus. The researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine say whether schools can stay open is the key question for the new year. Keeping children in school has been a political priority up until now, with the pandemic having disrupted the education of millions of children. The variant is thought to have emerged in Kent in September and now accounts for around two-thirds of cases in London, the South East and the East of England. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Chinese tech giant Alibaba is being investigated by regulators over monopolistic practices. China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) made the announcement on Thursday. Regulators have previously warned Alibaba about forcing merchants to sign exclusive deals which prevent them from offering products on rival platforms. Financial regulators will also meet with Alibaba's financial technology offshoot Ant Group in the coming days. Alibaba says its technology won't target Uighurs China to clamp down on internet giants Singles Day: 3m people, 4,000 planes and ships The investigation into monopolistic behaviour centres on the so-called ""choosing one from two"" practice. This requires merchants (sellers) to sign exclusive co-operation pacts, preventing them from offering products on rival platforms China's tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent are facing increased scrutiny by the Chinese government, which is concerned about their growing size and power. Regulators are worried about the millions of users they have amassed and the influence they have over daily life in China, including shopping and payments. This video can not be played How a little Ant became a financial giant Alibaba, founded by the flamboyant Jack Ma, has already felt the wrath of regulators from a coordinated crackdown. Last month, the Ant Group, which was previously called Alipay, was forced to halt its stock market listing, which would have been the world's biggest launch. Regulators made the decision to block the IPO just days before the launch, after raising concerns about its micro-lending services. But many believe the real reason behind the decision was a talk Mr Ma gave in late October that was critical of China's regulators and banking system. The billionaire said Chinese banks operated with a ""pawnshop"" mentality, and some feel he is paying the price now for those comments. Since then, tough new antitrust rules have also been introduced across the tech sector and have triggered a decline of about $140bn (Â£103bn), or 17%, in the market value of Mr Ma's Alibaba. The meeting with the Ant Group is to ""guide Ant Group to implement financial supervision, fair competition and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers"", a statement from the People's Bank of China said. Following notice by regulators, Ant said that it will ""seriously study and strictly comply with all regulatory requirements and commit full efforts to fulfil all related work"". The Chinese government has become increasingly concerned with parts of Ant's sprawling empire, particularly its lucrative credit business.

Michel Barnier, EU's chief negotiator:""Today is a day of relief, but tinged by some sadness as we compare what came before with what lies ahead.""

We'll be winding down our live coverage soon - but here's a quick recap of what we know about the EU and UK's post-Brexit trade deal. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. But we don't know a lot of the detail yet because the full document - expected to be well over 1,000 pages long - has not been released. What we do know is that it means:  European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen says competition rules - designed to prevent one side gaining an unfair advantage - ""will be fair and remain so"". She says the UK and EU will ""continue co-operating in all areas of mutual interest, including things like climate change, energy, security and transport"". We also know the UK will not be taking part in the Erasmus exchange programme for university students anymore - although, as we've explained below, students at universities in Northern Ireland will still be eligible.

Erasmus is an EU programme that helps students study in other countries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced thatthe UK will not continue to participate in it and will be replacing it with a new scheme. He said leaving Erasmus had been a ""tough decision"" but that under the new scheme, students would ""have the opportunity... not just to go to European universities, but to go to the best universities in the world"". The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he regretted the decision. But the Republic of Ireland's higher education minister said his government was fulfilling a commitment to NI.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Santa is airborne, sprouts are being peeled, and the promised deal landed How fitting that this final chapter in the chronicles of Brexit should grind on for so long. Santa is airborne; sprouts are being peeled; the deal promised last night landing this afternoon. Make no mistake: this is a big moment. Think back. The referendum campaign and the harshest of contentions. The result, four and a half years ago, to the day â and David Cameronâs premiership prematurely aborted. Theresa Mayâs tortuous years wrestling with Brexit, where she, like her predecessor, came off second best. Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street 18 months ago without a mandate or a majority. But, after a collision with the courts, a snap election, a big majority and a pandemic that nearly cost him his life â a deal. Brexit was delivered legally at the end of January. It will be delivered practically at the end of next week â and with an overarching arrangement with the EU that even a matter of days ago looked far from certain. Vast amounts of detail wait to be found, no doubt, buried amid the subterranean depths of the huge deal document itself, which is yet to be scrutinised. And the consequences of Brexit, from the impact on the small export business to Scotlandâs place in the United Kingdom, remain vast and uncertain. But plenty will hope this is the final giant moment in what have been a turbulent few years. ""I think there will be a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen across the country tonight,"" said Barrie Deas, CEO of the UK National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. ""I think there was an expectation that the government would deliver quota shares that reflect the resources that are in UK waters,"" he told BBC News. Deas said he was also concerned that EU fishing boats would continue to operate up to six miles (10km) from the UK coast, when the fishing industry had hoped for a 12-mile limit. He said the compromises left the industry feeling let down. He added, however, that there were positive elements to the deal, including tariff-free trade. ""We hadn't wanted anything extraordinary,"" he said. ""Just the same relationship that the EU currently enjoys with Norway."" Read more about why fishing was so important in the Brexit negotiations. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? It's been more than four years since the UK voted to leave the European Union. And it's been quite a journey - with two changes of prime minister, two general elections, and more votes in parliament than anyone cares to remember. Here's a quick recap of how we got here - featuring politicians, Larry the Cat, and everyone's favourite Brenda from Bristol. Reality Check Boris Johnson claimed at his press conference that from 1 January âthere will be no non-tariff barriers to tradeâ. But thatâs not right. Non-tariff barriers are things like paperwork to be filled in or regulations that must be followed if trade is to go ahead. Thatâs different from tariffs, which is when countries charge taxes on imports of particular items from other countries. The deal agreed today means there will be no tariffs. But with the UK outside the EU single market and the custom union, there will be a host of new border checks and bureaucracy for the UK trade in goods, as well as significant limitations on the trade in services. The European Commission statement on the deal confirms that â despite the agreement â there will be, from 1 January 2021, âbig changesâ¦ this will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist todayâ. A subsequent statement from Downing Street has sought to clarify Mr Johnsonâs remarks. âWeâve always been clear that weâve left the customs union and single market, which means that there will be some friction in trade which we acknowledge,â it said. âWhat the PM means here, is that there will be no tariffs and no quotas."" So, no tariffs but plenty of new non-tariff barriers which will make trade more costly for both UK and EU businesses. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low-level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments. Read more here. Alastair Campbell (file photo) Alastair Campbell, the ex-adviser of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, has told BBC News  he thinks it was a mistake for Labour to back the deal. ""It would go through with Conservative votes, even if the real extremist Brexit voters decide they can't support it,"" Campbell said. ""Boris Johnson should be made to own it."" Borrowing a phrase from former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, he said the party should instead be abstaining and
explaining. ""Explain why it is bad deal for Britain, explain how it can be used as the basis of a different policy."" Otherwise, he said, when things start to go wrong, Boris Johnson will be able to say: ""Well, you voted for it."" ""Abstaining is never great option,"" Campbell added. ""I don't think they should vote against it... I do accept it's a difficult argument. But I really don't think they should do this."" This video can not be played Starmer: 'Labour will accept deal and vote for it' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed his party's position on the new post-Brexit trade deal - they will support it when it comes to the Commons. Watch a clip from his press conference above. The Rock relies on close economic ties with Spain Away from all the drama of the Brexit trade deal the
UK has also been negotiating future arrangements for Gibraltar, a UK territory, with
Spain. About 15,000 workers come and go daily across the
Spain-Gibraltar border. The Rockâs population is about 34,000 and 96% of
Gibraltarians voted Remain in the EU referendum. Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has told the BBC
heâs aiming to get Schengen terms for Gibraltar, to safeguard free movement of
people to and from Spain. Most EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, but the UK has never been in it. If
Gibraltar also joined it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen
country would avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK would have to
go through passport control, as is already the
case. âThe terms for mobility between us and UK
would remain exactly the same as they are now,â said Mr Picardo. Anyone
arriving from outside Schengen would have to show their passports, he added. âThe arrangement is NOT about the
nationality of the person arriving, but their point of departure.â âIf we can, we want to finalise this before the end of the
year,â he said, but added: âItâs not easyâ. Thevote to leave the EUâ back in June 2016 â took place on one
day. The process to actually leave the EU has taken a little bit
longer. To give you a sense of just how long, here is a quick
reminder of what was happening when we first decided to leave the European Union.  2016 was also the year when it felt like an unusually high number of celebrities died - David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Victoria Wood, Prince, George Michael and many more. The Northern Ireland Executive is to meet on Monday to discuss the UK-EU trade deal. Politicians have been reacting to the news in the meantime. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: ""Given the government's Northern Ireland Protocol, a sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland. ""Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union."" Deputy First Minister and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said: ""While we have distinctly different political positions on leaving the EU, we are all agreed that it's in no-one's interests to leave without a deal, therefore this announcement is good news which will be welcomed across the whole island."" Clarity is needed, she added, on ""what the agreement means for businesses and citizens"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""While the deal may seek to mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, it will not undo the damage of Brexit."" He said the ""best deal will always remain being at the heart of the European Union"". Read more here. Companies can now start to plan for the future but there are still short term pressures as a result of the timing of the deal, according to the Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders. Its director general Jonathan Geldart said: âA deal can draw a line under what has been a tumultuous few years for companies. ""It provides a stable basis for the future relationship with our biggest market, and directors are eager to sift through the detail to understand what may change"" He said ""the devil will be in the detail"" of the deal, but the end of ""political prevarication"" was welcome. The bureaucracy caused by Brexit will mean some seafood businesses will collapse, according to Seafood Scotland. The deal, while welcome, comes after the border problems of recent days, its chief executive Donna Fordyce says. ""With Brexit will come new, untested, and extremely complex processes that the seafood sector will have to comply with in just a weekâs time, at huge cost which they can ill afford just now,"" she says. Lorries will be delayed for too long by a ""bureaucratic blockade"", she adds. âWe expect it to be a good few months until everything beds in and in the meantime, seafood businesses will try their best to navigate the changes, but some will not survive.â Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC News it was a ""rotten deal"" for British fishermen, and that he was ""very concerned about the level playing field"". But he nevertheless described it as a ""massive step forward"", the ""end of Brexit wars"" and a ""big, historic, important moment"". ""The truth of it is, thereâll be a lot of people in the EU happy tonight with where things are,"" he said. ""Iâm not over the moon with this, but, weâve reached a point after years of trench warfare, division and bitterness, even I have to say - letâs just mark this moment, itâs not perfect, but itâs a lot better off than we were five years ago."" Felicity lives on the Irish border in South Armagh Felicity
McKee lives in South Armagh which is on the border between northern and
southern Ireland. As a PhD student at Swansea University she regularly drives
to Bristol to fly home via Dublin. As a woman who lives with multiple
disabilities she is concerned about how health insurance will work in the
future. âI
get ill when I travel and there is no way I could afford a hospital stay. The
cost of health insurance is higher anyway for disabled people and Iâve got ill
abroad before. It is very concerning âAs
far as I can see the European Health Insurance card (EHIC) is dead in the water

NHS and health care I donât know how that will work if I got ill on the wrong
side of the border. âThereâs
data roaming; am I going to need two phones like I needed when I was in
secondary school? Paying for two contracts on a phone will add up. It's little
things but they make a big difference. âMy
European friends are concerned whether theyâll be able to stay. One of my
friends had their tyres slashed after the referendum result and Iâve noticed a
lot of anti-Irish sentiment too; I think itâs affected a lot of people. People
donât realise the consequences of Brexit. Itâs not the 70s or 80s anymore and
international links are beneficial to have."" Antony Payne is a retired software designer who voted for Brexit Antony Payne voted for Brexit. He said he had been ""complaining bitterly"" all day as there had been so much commentary before any announcement was actually made. He had some concerns about the Erasmus exchange programme and said he and his son, who is a university lecturer, had had discussions about it and also any loss of research investment from the EU. ""But with foreign policy and defence, yes there is a huge disparity in regards to how mainland Europe works compared to what the UK is doing"" he says. He adds: ""The UK was dominated by German thinking and that was about not getting into wars. But British activity has always involved helping out America."" When he was younger Mr Payne, who lives in Kirkcaldy in Scotland and frequently travels to Northern Ireland, voted to join the European Union. But now, in his retirement, his decision to vote for Brexit was not about commercial concerns, but foreign policy. He believes Europe needs to be more like a federation, and the UK part of it.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen are said to have been working to reach an agreement before Christmas Boris Johnson is expected to announce later that the UK has reached an agreement with the EU over post-Brexit trade and security. Officials in Brussels are believed to be finalising the details of a deal that will come into force when the UK leaves EU trading rules next week. It follows months of often fraught negotiations between the two sides. The PM will speak to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen by phone to sign off the deal. Mr Johnson is then expected to hold a press conference in Downing Street to announce it. LIVE: EU and UK on verge of deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? EU to allow post-Brexit UK farm produce exports The announcement had been expected earlier, but it has been delayed while final haggling between the two sides continues. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTE Radio there had been ""some sort of last-minute hitch"" over the small print of the fishing quotas agreement but a deal was still expected later. A deal would end the prospect of the two sides imposing widespread import taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods from 1 January, which could have affected prices. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke four times on Wednesday to get a deal ""over the line"". She said negotiators were ""still haggling over some fine details"", including catch quotas for more than 100 species of fish in UK waters. It is understood the agreement does not have a role for the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, and the two sides have agreed a system to sort out disputes that follows international law, rather than EU law, our political editor said. In addition, she said the two sides have agreed to phase new fishing arrangements over five years, with the UK catching as much as two-thirds of the fish in UK waters by the end of the transition. The deal document is thought to be around 2,000 pages long. It is expected that the UK Parliament will be recalled to vote on a law implementing a deal before 31 December, when the Brexit transition period ends. On the EU side, leaders can decide to apply a deal provisionally before the European Parliament holds a ratification vote early next year. It could also need eventual approval in national EU parliaments, depending on the exact contents of the deal. BBC Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said Mrs von der Leyen was also due to speak later to set out details of the deal. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? It is believed one of the final obstacles being discussed include quotas for particular types of fish. The UK has insisted on having control over fishing in its waters from 1 January and retaining a larger share of the catch from them than under the current quota system. But the EU wanted to phase in a new fishing system over a longer period and retain more of its access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other member states. The sides also disagreed over whether UK firms should continue to follow the same rules as companies within the EU - and on how future trading disputes should be resolved. The pizzas arrived as the negotiations continued into the evening By Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe correspondent As afternoon gave way to evening and evening gave way to night in Brussels optimism that agreement was close never dwindled, but never quite turned into a deal either. At one point pizzas arrived for the weary officials - a delivery man on a bike turning up at the front gates of the European Commission. It was understood that negotiators were still haggling over precise quotas of individual species of fish that EU boats will be allowed to catch in British waters. The governments of individual EU member states must consider the details of any deal but they have been briefed regularly throughout the process and shouldn't find much if anything to surprise them. The issue of how to promote the deal for public consumption is much more pressing for the British side than the European. For the EU there are legal loose ends to be tied up but the European Parliament will only vote on a deal retrospectively at some point in the New Year. In the UK the government will have to get any deal through parliament before 31 December. UK ministers have repeatedly ruled outany extension to the transition period, under which the UK has continued to follow Brussels's trade rules since it left the EU on 31 January. Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays UK, said he welcomed an agreement, which would bring ""clarity"" for business. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said planning for a new trading relationship with the EU had been ""the overriding issue for businesses over the last two years"". ""This was pure politics. It was always the last minute sort of rabbit from the hat,"" he added. The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its group of lawyers to analyse any deal that is reached. The group was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would ""scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"".

Here's a recap of the top stories from the UK today.  If you're having a break from the news for a few days now, then have a very Happy Christmas.  Thanks for tuning into our live page today. Here's a round-up of the major headlines from around the world: The number of people estimated to have Covid in Scotland has fallen over the last week, according to official figures. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimated the new, more easily transmittable strain of the virus was responsible for 38% of the positive cases in Scotland. It found about 37,100 (one in 140) people in Scotland had the virus in the seven days to 18 December. That figure has fallen from 52,500 (one in 100) in the week up to 11 December. The ONS said data on the new variant should be treated with caution due to the small numbers involved. It found that 7% of positive tests showed the new variant in the week beginning 7 December, and that rose to 14% the following week.  Mexico has started its mass vaccination programme, just a day
after the first doses arrived in the country. About 3,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived on
Wednesday. A 59-year-old nurse in Mexico City had her injection televised. Doses of the vaccine are being guarded by the military to stop them from falling into
the hands of criminals, AFP reports. More than 120,000 people have died and 1.3 million infections have
been recorded in Mexico since the pandemic began. One of the worst-affected London boroughs says the most significant rise in cases of coronavirus is in those of working age. London now has the highest percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. It's now estimated 2.1% of people in private households have the virus. Jason Strelitz, director of public health in Newham, one of the worst-affected boroughs of the city, said: ""The most significant age group in terms of our local epidemic is people of working age. ""The vast majority of cases are amongst people aged 20-50 and that group has seen also the fastest acceleration. ""There's also been growth in children of secondary school age and slow growth amongst older people but it really is right across the population."" It comes as the weekly surveillance report from Public Health England shows London's rate of new cases of Covid-19 has trebled in just two weeks. The rate stood at 602.2 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to December 20, up from 200.3 in the seven days to December 6.  A 52-year-old black US doctor who accused a suburban hospital physician of racist treatment has died due to Covid-19. In a video shared on Facebook while she was in hospital, Susan Moore said a white doctor had downplayed her pain and made her ""feel like I was a drug addict"". ""All I can do is cry I was in so much pain,"" she wrote in the post. ""He said you can just go home right now. Of note he did not even listen to my lungs, he didnât touch me in any way. He performed no physical exam. I told him, 'You cannot tell me how I feel.'"" Moore said even though she herself was a physician, she was not treated respectfully. In the video, Moore said: ""I put forth and I maintain if I was white, I wouldnât have to go through that."" The case has sparked an outcry over the treatment of black Americans in the US health system. Research has detailed the biases that can be present when black patients seek care - particularly treatment for pain. On Sunday, Moore passed away from complications due to the virus, her sontold the New York Times,external. The hospital has not offered comment, citing privacy laws. On Wednesday, the US set a new record high in hospital admissions, with more than 119,400 in hospital with Covid-19 nationwide. The country has had more than 100,000 people in hospital due to the virus every day since 2 December, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Across the US, states are facing staff shortages even as hospital admissions rise and intensive care units fill up. Experts worry that a spike following the holiday season - which has already seen millions of Americans travel against advice - could overwhelm health centres. A man whose family was told he would not survive Covid-19 says he is looking forward to a""glorious Christmas"". Father of five Neil McCafferty was admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry in October with a gall bladder infection. The 67-year-old was also treated for sepsis before developing Covid-19 and spending several weeks in intensive care. He is now in rehab and ""delighted to be alive"". Neil and wife Bridie traditionally have 17 family members at their home on Boxing Day. Although different this year, it ""will be glorious"", said Neil, who is recovering in Derry's Waterside hospital. ""I'll get to see them. I am sat on the ground floor, by the window. They are all coming down on Christmas morning,"" he said. He's learning to walk again and on Wednesday he shaved himself for the first time in months. ""That was a big achievement. It's all the small things that didn't seem important before.""  The University of Washington's latestInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model,externalprojects the US could see more than 567,000 deaths by 1 April. It's an increase from its previous estimate of 562,000. The model, updated on Wednesday, shows that if 95% of the country started wearing masks the death toll would be diminished by almost 50,000. A rapid vaccine roll-out would also save an estimated 45,000 lives. On the other hand, if states stop following virus restrictions, IHME predicts the US death toll will pass 731,000 by April. As it stands, the US has seen 326,242 deaths due to the virus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Ferry operator DFDS says it has been able to transport only a fraction of the lorries it had capacity for across the Channel in the last two days because of congestion in Dover. It said: ""The borders were reopened for freight drivers with a negative test as at midnight on Tuesday and since then DFDS has had capacity to ship up to 4,000 trucks; due to the logistical issues that have prevented freight getting to the port we have unfortunately only been able to transport 144 trucks out of Dover."" It says it is ""ready to transport freight drivers and their vehicles and any passengers who have valid essential reasons to travel"", if they have a negative Covid test and in line with French government guidelines. ""The company shares the frustration and disappointment that our freight customers have felt in not being able to travel, and we fully understand the issues that this has created for local residents in Dover and the wider East Kent area,"" they said. Extra sailings have been added to today's sailing schedule and the Port of Dover is remaining open over Christmas. Customers cannot enter the port without a negative Covid test result, however. The latest figures from Wednesday showed 6,000 drivers were still stranded in Kent as a repercussion of the travel ban. Nomsa MasekoBBC Southern Africa correspondent Hospitals in South Africaâs Western Cape
province are under severe pressure from rising Covid-19 infections and trauma
cases, as the country experiences a second wave of the virus. Yesterday the country recorded more
than 14,000 new infections, the highest number of cases in a single day, as well as 411 deaths. The Western Cape government says the
second coronavirus wave is proving to be significantly bigger than the first
one in terms of hospital admissions. Scientists in South Africa announced
the discovery of a new coronavirus variant last week. Itâs thought the new variant is
transmitted more easily than previous versions, and this could be driving the
second wave. Some hospitals in the Western Cape are
now at full capacity, with some at 140% capacity. Trauma cases related to alcohol, car
crashes and crime are also putting pressure on the system. The health department is in the
process of adding extra beds in the province and might also have to bring in
the military for assistance. Following the discovery of South
Africaâs new coronavirus variant, the UK government has suspended all flights between
South Africa and the UK. Two cases of the South African variant
have been found in the UK. The South Africa mutation is different
to the new variant recently discovered in the UK, but both are thought to be
more easily transmitted. Scientists say more research is needed
to establish whether the new variants are more severe than previous ones. In a bit of happier news - there's a birthday to celebrate. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US's chief infectious disease researcher who has become the face of the country's pandemic response, turns 80 today. Well wishes for his birthday have poured in on social media. The Mayor of Washington DC declared the day Dr Anthony S Fauci Day. But how is the doctor - who has worked non-stop since January - spending this Christmas Eve? Typically, he'd have an Italian dinner with his family,he told the Washington Post,external, even making the intensive, cheese-egg-meat-filled baked pasta dish timpano. But this year, as he advises all Americans to do, he'll be staying at home with his wife in DC, celebrating with his daughters via Zoom. Concerns have been raised over safety at a half marathon in Cornwall, where 250 runners crossed the line in a mass start. The Indian Queens Half Marathon, held on Sunday, did not feature a staggered start as recommended by Covid-19 safety advice. One runner in the event, John Barnes, said he was ""surprised"" to see so many people congregating at the start. The race director said she believed she had followed guidance and any breach was unintentional. Current advice fromUK Athletics and Run Britain,externalstates ""mass starts are not permitted"", suggesting staggered starts instead. Cornwall Council confirmed it had allowed the event to go ahead after being told a staggered start would be in operation. Read more here. Brazil has announced it is suspending flights arriving in the
country from the UK and banning anyone who has visited the UK over the past two
weeks. Flights passing through the UK will also be banned, a note in the
official gazette on Wednesday confirmed. A number of countries have suspended flights from the UK after a
new strain was identified in the UK. Earlier this week, Britainâs Foreign Office advised against all
but essential travel to Brazil due to its latest assessment of Covid-19 risks. Brazil has recorded more than 189,000 deaths and 7.3 million cases
since the pandemic began. From 26 December, the Isles of Scilly will be the only part of England in tier one - the lowest level of virus restrictions. Cornwall, Herefordshire and the Isle of Wight have been moved to tier two, leaving the islands - 28 miles off the Cornish coast - as the only place with a ""medium"" alert. ""It's a very strange early Christmas present,"" local councillor Steve Sims told the PA news agency. ""Whilst it is a relief, it's a very sobering situation and I remain apprehensive as I'm sure most of my fellow islanders will be."" The islands, which have a population of around 2,000, have had only two recorded cases, he added. Mr Sims's wife, Beth Hilton, edits local magazine Scilly Now & Then and said: ""I don't think we're jumping up and down celebrating the fact that we are still tier one - although it is very welcome news and means we can still go out socially at Christmas if we wish to do so."" An aerial shot of Tresco Abbey Garden in the Isles of Scilly This video can not be played A 101-year-old war veteran has received thousands of Christmas cards and presents from around the world after speaking about the loss of his wife on BBC Breakfast. John Lister and his wife Ella were married for 70 years before she died from coronavirus in February. His care home in Norfolk hoped cards would help him get through his first Christmas without her. Global cases have reached 78 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There are concerns that cases could continue to rise rapidly due to gatherings over Christmas and new year. Europe and North America are seeing the largest increase in cases. The UK has seen levels of the virus continuing to rise with one in 85 people in England infected, according to the Office for National Statistics. A number of European nations, including Italy, have ordered new lockdowns in order to curb the spread. The US has been hit hard by the pandemic. It has the highest case load and number of deaths in the world. California's governor has warned that thousands of people in the state could be hospitalised next month.

France shut the border on Sunday, in response to surging cases of the new virus variant in London and the South East. Drivers now have to test negative before being allowed into France. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said this morning it would take ""several days"" to clear the backlog. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Schools and universities may have to close, in addition to current tier four restrictions, to bring the new variant of coronavirus under control in the UK. That's the verdict of preliminary rapid analysis work. It calculates the variant is spreading 56% faster than other forms of the virus. The researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine say whether schools can stay open is the key question for the new year. Keeping children in school has been a political priority up until now, with the pandemic having disrupted the education of millions of children. The variant is thought to have emerged in Kent in September and now accounts for around two-thirds of cases in London, the South East and the East of England. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Travel by visitors to the UK from South Africa has been banned amid concern over a variant of Covid-19 linked to the country. People who have been in or transited through South Africa in the last 10 days are no longer allowed into the UK. The new rule does not apply to British and Irish nationals - but they will have to self-isolate. The variant was found in London and north-west England, both in contacts of people who had been in South Africa. The Department for Transport said the ban reflects the ""increased risk"" from the new variant, but will be kept under review. The travel ban came into effect at 09:00 GMT on Christmas Eve. Anyone required to quarantine will need to do so for 10 days, along with members of their household. UK visa holders and permanent residents arriving from South Africa will not be affected - but they will also need to self-isolate. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Six million people to enter tier 4 on Boxing Day Covid variant find âdue to work of UK scientistsâ What's happening to the numbers in Africa? The government had already ordered anyone in the UK who has travelled to South Africa in the past fortnight, and anyone they have been in contact with, to quarantine immediately, along with their households. This video can not be played More tier 4 areas, a new variant and a message of hope - three things from the Downing Street press conference At a Downing Street press briefing on Wednesday, Health Secretary Hancock said the new variant linked to South Africa was ""highly concerning"". He said those required to quarantine ""must restrict all contact with any other person whatsoever"". The variant was detected for the first time in the UK on Tuesday. Scientists in South Africa say,externalit is still being analysed, but the data are consistent with it spreading more quickly. It shares some similarities with another new Covid variant that hasalready been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? On Wednesday, a further 39,237 people in the UK tested positive for virus - an all-time high - and there were 744 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to government figures. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. Six million more people in England are beingmoved into the highest tier four restrictions on 26 December. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)suggests levels of coronavirus are continuing to rise,with one in 85 people in England infected. About two-thirds of people testing positive in London, the east of England, and the South East could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate based on genes detected by the tests, the ONS says. In Wales, about one in 60 people are infected - a sharp increase. The percentage of people testing positive in Northern Ireland is also up, but in Scotland numbers are down. New York City orders international visitors to quarantine Sharp rises in infection levels in England Meanwhile,more than 6,000 lorries are still being held in Kentin south-east England, with drivers being tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to cross the Channel. France had imposed a temporary travel ban earlier in the week over concerns about the new UK variant of Covid-19. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said more than 2,300 drivers have now tested negative, while three were positive. The Department for Transport did not give figures on how many drivers have left so far, but the flow of traffic has increased since Wednesday night when, according to the Port of Dover, fewer than 100 left. More than 50 other countries, including Germany, Italy, India and Pakistan, are continuing to block travellers from the UK.

"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to â¬1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning. It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36. The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday. The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday. Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. UK-EU trade talks continue ahead of expected deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as Â£600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds. ""It's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side.""

We'll be winding down our live coverage soon - but here's a quick recap of what we know about the EU and UK's post-Brexit trade deal. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. But we don't know a lot of the detail yet because the full document - expected to be well over 1,000 pages long - has not been released. What we do know is that it means:  European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen says competition rules - designed to prevent one side gaining an unfair advantage - ""will be fair and remain so"". She says the UK and EU will ""continue co-operating in all areas of mutual interest, including things like climate change, energy, security and transport"". We also know the UK will not be taking part in the Erasmus exchange programme for university students anymore - although, as we've explained below, students at universities in Northern Ireland will still be eligible.

Erasmus is an EU programme that helps students study in other countries. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced thatthe UK will not continue to participate in it and will be replacing it with a new scheme. He said leaving Erasmus had been a ""tough decision"" but that under the new scheme, students would ""have the opportunity... not just to go to European universities, but to go to the best universities in the world"". The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he regretted the decision. But the Republic of Ireland's higher education minister said his government was fulfilling a commitment to NI.

Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Santa is airborne, sprouts are being peeled, and the promised deal landed How fitting that this final chapter in the chronicles of Brexit should grind on for so long. Santa is airborne; sprouts are being peeled; the deal promised last night landing this afternoon. Make no mistake: this is a big moment. Think back. The referendum campaign and the harshest of contentions. The result, four and a half years ago, to the day â and David Cameronâs premiership prematurely aborted. Theresa Mayâs tortuous years wrestling with Brexit, where she, like her predecessor, came off second best. Boris Johnson arrived in Downing Street 18 months ago without a mandate or a majority. But, after a collision with the courts, a snap election, a big majority and a pandemic that nearly cost him his life â a deal. Brexit was delivered legally at the end of January. It will be delivered practically at the end of next week â and with an overarching arrangement with the EU that even a matter of days ago looked far from certain. Vast amounts of detail wait to be found, no doubt, buried amid the subterranean depths of the huge deal document itself, which is yet to be scrutinised. And the consequences of Brexit, from the impact on the small export business to Scotlandâs place in the United Kingdom, remain vast and uncertain. But plenty will hope this is the final giant moment in what have been a turbulent few years. ""I think there will be a lot of disappointed and frustrated fishermen across the country tonight,"" said Barrie Deas, CEO of the UK National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. ""I think there was an expectation that the government would deliver quota shares that reflect the resources that are in UK waters,"" he told BBC News. Deas said he was also concerned that EU fishing boats would continue to operate up to six miles (10km) from the UK coast, when the fishing industry had hoped for a 12-mile limit. He said the compromises left the industry feeling let down. He added, however, that there were positive elements to the deal, including tariff-free trade. ""We hadn't wanted anything extraordinary,"" he said. ""Just the same relationship that the EU currently enjoys with Norway."" Read more about why fishing was so important in the Brexit negotiations. This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? It's been more than four years since the UK voted to leave the European Union. And it's been quite a journey - with two changes of prime minister, two general elections, and more votes in parliament than anyone cares to remember. Here's a quick recap of how we got here - featuring politicians, Larry the Cat, and everyone's favourite Brenda from Bristol. Reality Check Boris Johnson claimed at his press conference that from 1 January âthere will be no non-tariff barriers to tradeâ. But thatâs not right. Non-tariff barriers are things like paperwork to be filled in or regulations that must be followed if trade is to go ahead. Thatâs different from tariffs, which is when countries charge taxes on imports of particular items from other countries. The deal agreed today means there will be no tariffs. But with the UK outside the EU single market and the custom union, there will be a host of new border checks and bureaucracy for the UK trade in goods, as well as significant limitations on the trade in services. The European Commission statement on the deal confirms that â despite the agreement â there will be, from 1 January 2021, âbig changesâ¦ this will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist todayâ. A subsequent statement from Downing Street has sought to clarify Mr Johnsonâs remarks. âWeâve always been clear that weâve left the customs union and single market, which means that there will be some friction in trade which we acknowledge,â it said. âWhat the PM means here, is that there will be no tariffs and no quotas."" So, no tariffs but plenty of new non-tariff barriers which will make trade more costly for both UK and EU businesses. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low-level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments. Read more here. Alastair Campbell (file photo) Alastair Campbell, the ex-adviser of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, has told BBC News  he thinks it was a mistake for Labour to back the deal. ""It would go through with Conservative votes, even if the real extremist Brexit voters decide they can't support it,"" Campbell said. ""Boris Johnson should be made to own it."" Borrowing a phrase from former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, he said the party should instead be abstaining and
explaining. ""Explain why it is bad deal for Britain, explain how it can be used as the basis of a different policy."" Otherwise, he said, when things start to go wrong, Boris Johnson will be able to say: ""Well, you voted for it."" ""Abstaining is never great option,"" Campbell added. ""I don't think they should vote against it... I do accept it's a difficult argument. But I really don't think they should do this."" This video can not be played Starmer: 'Labour will accept deal and vote for it' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed his party's position on the new post-Brexit trade deal - they will support it when it comes to the Commons. Watch a clip from his press conference above. The Rock relies on close economic ties with Spain Away from all the drama of the Brexit trade deal the
UK has also been negotiating future arrangements for Gibraltar, a UK territory, with
Spain. About 15,000 workers come and go daily across the
Spain-Gibraltar border. The Rockâs population is about 34,000 and 96% of
Gibraltarians voted Remain in the EU referendum. Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has told the BBC
heâs aiming to get Schengen terms for Gibraltar, to safeguard free movement of
people to and from Spain. Most EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, but the UK has never been in it. If
Gibraltar also joined it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen
country would avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK would have to
go through passport control, as is already the
case. âThe terms for mobility between us and UK
would remain exactly the same as they are now,â said Mr Picardo. Anyone
arriving from outside Schengen would have to show their passports, he added. âThe arrangement is NOT about the
nationality of the person arriving, but their point of departure.â âIf we can, we want to finalise this before the end of the
year,â he said, but added: âItâs not easyâ. Thevote to leave the EUâ back in June 2016 â took place on one
day. The process to actually leave the EU has taken a little bit
longer. To give you a sense of just how long, here is a quick
reminder of what was happening when we first decided to leave the European Union.  2016 was also the year when it felt like an unusually high number of celebrities died - David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Victoria Wood, Prince, George Michael and many more. The Northern Ireland Executive is to meet on Monday to discuss the UK-EU trade deal. Politicians have been reacting to the news in the meantime. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: ""Given the government's Northern Ireland Protocol, a sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland. ""Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union."" Deputy First Minister and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said: ""While we have distinctly different political positions on leaving the EU, we are all agreed that it's in no-one's interests to leave without a deal, therefore this announcement is good news which will be welcomed across the whole island."" Clarity is needed, she added, on ""what the agreement means for businesses and citizens"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""While the deal may seek to mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, it will not undo the damage of Brexit."" He said the ""best deal will always remain being at the heart of the European Union"". Read more here. Companies can now start to plan for the future but there are still short term pressures as a result of the timing of the deal, according to the Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders. Its director general Jonathan Geldart said: âA deal can draw a line under what has been a tumultuous few years for companies. ""It provides a stable basis for the future relationship with our biggest market, and directors are eager to sift through the detail to understand what may change"" He said ""the devil will be in the detail"" of the deal, but the end of ""political prevarication"" was welcome. The bureaucracy caused by Brexit will mean some seafood businesses will collapse, according to Seafood Scotland. The deal, while welcome, comes after the border problems of recent days, its chief executive Donna Fordyce says. ""With Brexit will come new, untested, and extremely complex processes that the seafood sector will have to comply with in just a weekâs time, at huge cost which they can ill afford just now,"" she says. Lorries will be delayed for too long by a ""bureaucratic blockade"", she adds. âWe expect it to be a good few months until everything beds in and in the meantime, seafood businesses will try their best to navigate the changes, but some will not survive.â Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC News it was a ""rotten deal"" for British fishermen, and that he was ""very concerned about the level playing field"". But he nevertheless described it as a ""massive step forward"", the ""end of Brexit wars"" and a ""big, historic, important moment"". ""The truth of it is, thereâll be a lot of people in the EU happy tonight with where things are,"" he said.

He said he had been ""complaining bitterly"" all day as there had been so much commentary before any announcement was actually made. He had some concerns about the Erasmus exchange programme and said he and his son, who is a university lecturer, had had discussions about it and also any loss of research investment from the EU. ""But with foreign policy and defence, yes there is a huge disparity in regards to how mainland Europe works compared to what the UK is doing"" he says. He adds: ""The UK was dominated by German thinking and that was about not getting into wars. But British activity has always involved helping out America."" When he was younger Mr Payne, who lives in Kirkcaldy in Scotland and frequently travels to Northern Ireland, voted to join the European Union. But now, in his retirement, his decision to vote for Brexit was not about commercial concerns, but foreign policy. He believes Europe needs to be more like a federation, and the UK part of it.

"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to â¬1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning. It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36. The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday. The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday. Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. UK-EU trade talks continue ahead of expected deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as Â£600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds. ""It's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side.""

This video can not be played Brexit deal: How did we get here? It's been more than four years since the UK voted to leave the European Union. And it's been quite a journey - with two changes of prime minister, two general elections, and more votes in parliament than anyone cares to remember. Here's a quick recap of how we got here - featuring politicians, Larry the Cat, and everyone's favourite Brenda from Bristol. Reality Check Boris Johnson claimed at his press conference that from 1 January âthere will be no non-tariff barriers to tradeâ. But thatâs not right. Non-tariff barriers are things like paperwork to be filled in or regulations that must be followed if trade is to go ahead. Thatâs different from tariffs, which is when countries charge taxes on imports of particular items from other countries. The deal agreed today means there will be no tariffs. But with the UK outside the EU single market and the custom union, there will be a host of new border checks and bureaucracy for the UK trade in goods, as well as significant limitations on the trade in services. The European Commission statement on the deal confirms that â despite the agreement â there will be, from 1 January 2021, âbig changesâ¦ this will create barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that do not exist todayâ. A subsequent statement from Downing Street has sought to clarify Mr Johnsonâs remarks. âWeâve always been clear that weâve left the customs union and single market, which means that there will be some friction in trade which we acknowledge,â it said. âWhat the PM means here, is that there will be no tariffs and no quotas."" So, no tariffs but plenty of new non-tariff barriers which will make trade more costly for both UK and EU businesses. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor This is a political victory for the prime minister with up front control ""taken back"" in a deal struck in a very short time. In economic terms, it prevents the equivalent of a low-level tariff trade war with our biggest trading partner breaking out, in the middle of an historic recession and health crisis. The UK has stayed in a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Russia, as Vote Leave promised ahead of the referendum. But his manifest error in declaring there are ""no non-tariff barriers"" for trade with the EU had business leaders falling off their chairs. This is patently not the case. The government has entire websites informing the public and businesses of tens of millions of new customs declarations, export health checks, regulatory checks, rules of origin checks, conformity assessments. Read more here. Alastair Campbell (file photo) Alastair Campbell, the ex-adviser of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, has told BBC News  he thinks it was a mistake for Labour to back the deal. ""It would go through with Conservative votes, even if the real extremist Brexit voters decide they can't support it,"" Campbell said. ""Boris Johnson should be made to own it."" Borrowing a phrase from former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, he said the party should instead be abstaining and
explaining. ""Explain why it is bad deal for Britain, explain how it can be used as the basis of a different policy."" Otherwise, he said, when things start to go wrong, Boris Johnson will be able to say: ""Well, you voted for it."" ""Abstaining is never great option,"" Campbell added. ""I don't think they should vote against it... I do accept it's a difficult argument. But I really don't think they should do this."" This video can not be played Starmer: 'Labour will accept deal and vote for it' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed his party's position on the new post-Brexit trade deal - they will support it when it comes to the Commons. Watch a clip from his press conference above. The Rock relies on close economic ties with Spain Away from all the drama of the Brexit trade deal the
UK has also been negotiating future arrangements for Gibraltar, a UK territory, with
Spain. About 15,000 workers come and go daily across the
Spain-Gibraltar border. The Rockâs population is about 34,000 and 96% of
Gibraltarians voted Remain in the EU referendum. Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has told the BBC
heâs aiming to get Schengen terms for Gibraltar, to safeguard free movement of
people to and from Spain. Most EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, but the UK has never been in it. If
Gibraltar also joined it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen
country would avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK would have to
go through passport control, as is already the
case. âThe terms for mobility between us and UK
would remain exactly the same as they are now,â said Mr Picardo. Anyone
arriving from outside Schengen would have to show their passports, he added. âThe arrangement is NOT about the
nationality of the person arriving, but their point of departure.â âIf we can, we want to finalise this before the end of the
year,â he said, but added: âItâs not easyâ. Thevote to leave the EUâ back in June 2016 â took place on one
day. The process to actually leave the EU has taken a little bit
longer. To give you a sense of just how long, here is a quick
reminder of what was happening when we first decided to leave the European Union.  2016 was also the year when it felt like an unusually high number of celebrities died - David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Victoria Wood, Prince, George Michael and many more. The Northern Ireland Executive is to meet on Monday to discuss the UK-EU trade deal. Politicians have been reacting to the news in the meantime. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: ""Given the government's Northern Ireland Protocol, a sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland. ""Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union."" Deputy First Minister and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said: ""While we have distinctly different political positions on leaving the EU, we are all agreed that it's in no-one's interests to leave without a deal, therefore this announcement is good news which will be welcomed across the whole island."" Clarity is needed, she added, on ""what the agreement means for businesses and citizens"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""While the deal may seek to mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, it will not undo the damage of Brexit."" He said the ""best deal will always remain being at the heart of the European Union"". Read more here. Companies can now start to plan for the future but there are still short term pressures as a result of the timing of the deal, according to the Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders. Its director general Jonathan Geldart said: âA deal can draw a line under what has been a tumultuous few years for companies. ""It provides a stable basis for the future relationship with our biggest market, and directors are eager to sift through the detail to understand what may change"" He said ""the devil will be in the detail"" of the deal, but the end of ""political prevarication"" was welcome. The bureaucracy caused by Brexit will mean some seafood businesses will collapse, according to Seafood Scotland. The deal, while welcome, comes after the border problems of recent days, its chief executive Donna Fordyce says. ""With Brexit will come new, untested, and extremely complex processes that the seafood sector will have to comply with in just a weekâs time, at huge cost which they can ill afford just now,"" she says. Lorries will be delayed for too long by a ""bureaucratic blockade"", she adds. âWe expect it to be a good few months until everything beds in and in the meantime, seafood businesses will try their best to navigate the changes, but some will not survive.â Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC News it was a ""rotten deal"" for British fishermen, and that he was ""very concerned about the level playing field"". But he nevertheless described it as a ""massive step forward"", the ""end of Brexit wars"" and a ""big, historic, important moment"". ""The truth of it is, thereâll be a lot of people in the EU happy tonight with where things are,"" he said. ""Iâm not over the moon with this, but, weâve reached a point after years of trench warfare, division and bitterness, even I have to say - letâs just mark this moment, itâs not perfect, but itâs a lot better off than we were five years ago.""

""It would go through with Conservative votes, even if the real extremist Brexit voters decide they can't support it,"" Campbell said. ""Boris Johnson should be made to own it."" Borrowing a phrase from former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, he said the party should instead be abstaining and
explaining. ""Explain why it is bad deal for Britain, explain how it can be used as the basis of a different policy."" Otherwise, he said, when things start to go wrong, Boris Johnson will be able to say: ""Well, you voted for it."" ""Abstaining is never great option,"" Campbell added. ""I don't think they should vote against it... I do accept it's a difficult argument. But I really don't think they should do this."" This video can not be played Starmer: 'Labour will accept deal and vote for it' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed his party's position on the new post-Brexit trade deal - they will support it when it comes to the Commons. Watch a clip from his press conference above. The Rock relies on close economic ties with Spain Away from all the drama of the Brexit trade deal the
UK has also been negotiating future arrangements for Gibraltar, a UK territory, with
Spain. About 15,000 workers come and go daily across the
Spain-Gibraltar border. The Rockâs population is about 34,000 and 96% of
Gibraltarians voted Remain in the EU referendum. Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has told the BBC
heâs aiming to get Schengen terms for Gibraltar, to safeguard free movement of
people to and from Spain. Most EU states are in the passport-free Schengen zone, but the UK has never been in it. If
Gibraltar also joined it, EU citizens arriving from Spain or another Schengen
country would avoid passport checks, while arrivals from the UK would have to
go through passport control, as is already the
case. âThe terms for mobility between us and UK
would remain exactly the same as they are now,â said Mr Picardo. Anyone
arriving from outside Schengen would have to show their passports, he added. âThe arrangement is NOT about the
nationality of the person arriving, but their point of departure.â âIf we can, we want to finalise this before the end of the
year,â he said, but added: âItâs not easyâ. Thevote to leave the EUâ back in June 2016 â took place on one
day. The process to actually leave the EU has taken a little bit
longer. To give you a sense of just how long, here is a quick
reminder of what was happening when we first decided to leave the European Union.  2016 was also the year when it felt like an unusually high number of celebrities died - David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Victoria Wood, Prince, George Michael and many more. The Northern Ireland Executive is to meet on Monday to discuss the UK-EU trade deal. Politicians have been reacting to the news in the meantime. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: ""Given the government's Northern Ireland Protocol, a sensible trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union was always the most favourable outcome for Northern Ireland. ""Moving forward, we will continue to work to seize the opportunities and address the challenges which arise from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union."" Deputy First Minister and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said: ""While we have distinctly different political positions on leaving the EU, we are all agreed that it's in no-one's interests to leave without a deal, therefore this announcement is good news which will be welcomed across the whole island."" Clarity is needed, she added, on ""what the agreement means for businesses and citizens"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""While the deal may seek to mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, it will not undo the damage of Brexit."" He said the ""best deal will always remain being at the heart of the European Union"". Read more here. Companies can now start to plan for the future but there are still short term pressures as a result of the timing of the deal, according to the Institute of Directors, which represents business leaders. Its director general Jonathan Geldart said: âA deal can draw a line under what has been a tumultuous few years for companies. ""It provides a stable basis for the future relationship with our biggest market, and directors are eager to sift through the detail to understand what may change"" He said ""the devil will be in the detail"" of the deal, but the end of ""political prevarication"" was welcome. The bureaucracy caused by Brexit will mean some seafood businesses will collapse, according to Seafood Scotland. The deal, while welcome, comes after the border problems of recent days, its chief executive Donna Fordyce says. ""With Brexit will come new, untested, and extremely complex processes that the seafood sector will have to comply with in just a weekâs time, at huge cost which they can ill afford just now,"" she says. Lorries will be delayed for too long by a ""bureaucratic blockade"", she adds. âWe expect it to be a good few months until everything beds in and in the meantime, seafood businesses will try their best to navigate the changes, but some will not survive.â Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC News it was a ""rotten deal"" for British fishermen, and that he was ""very concerned about the level playing field"". But he nevertheless described it as a ""massive step forward"", the ""end of Brexit wars"" and a ""big, historic, important moment"". ""The truth of it is, thereâll be a lot of people in the EU happy tonight with where things are,"" he said. ""Iâm not over the moon with this, but, weâve reached a point after years of trench warfare, division and bitterness, even I have to say - letâs just mark this moment, itâs not perfect, but itâs a lot better off than we were five years ago."" Felicity lives on the Irish border in South Armagh Felicity
McKee lives in South Armagh which is on the border between northern and
southern Ireland. As a PhD student at Swansea University she regularly drives
to Bristol to fly home via Dublin. As a woman who lives with multiple
disabilities she is concerned about how health insurance will work in the
future. âI
get ill when I travel and there is no way I could afford a hospital stay. The
cost of health insurance is higher anyway for disabled people and Iâve got ill
abroad before. It is very concerning âAs
far as I can see the European Health Insurance card (EHIC) is dead in the water
in the future and the issue of health insurance is messy. When it comes to the
NHS and health care I donât know how that will work if I got ill on the wrong
side of the border. âThereâs

secondary school? Paying for two contracts on a phone will add up. It's little
things but they make a big difference. âMy
European friends are concerned whether theyâll be able to stay. One of my
friends had their tyres slashed after the referendum result and Iâve noticed a
lot of anti-Irish sentiment too; I think itâs affected a lot of people. People
donât realise the consequences of Brexit. Itâs not the 70s or 80s anymore and
international links are beneficial to have."" Antony Payne is a retired software designer who voted for Brexit Antony Payne voted for Brexit. He said he had been ""complaining bitterly"" all day as there had been so much commentary before any announcement was actually made. He had some concerns about the Erasmus exchange programme and said he and his son, who is a university lecturer, had had discussions about it and also any loss of research investment from the EU. ""But with foreign policy and defence, yes there is a huge disparity in regards to how mainland Europe works compared to what the UK is doing"" he says. He adds: ""The UK was dominated by German thinking and that was about not getting into wars. But British activity has always involved helping out America."" When he was younger Mr Payne, who lives in Kirkcaldy in Scotland and frequently travels to Northern Ireland, voted to join the European Union. But now, in his retirement, his decision to vote for Brexit was not about commercial concerns, but foreign policy. He believes Europe needs to be more like a federation, and the UK part of it.

"Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Charles Kushner US President Donald Trump has pardoned his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, ex-adviser Roger Stone and the father of Mr Trump's son-in-law. Mr Manafort was convicted in 2018 in an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Mr Trump had previously commuted the prison sentence of Mr Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress. They are among 29 people to benefit from Mr Trump's latest pardons before he leaves office next month. Twenty-six of them won full pardons on Wednesday night, while another three received commutations. A commutation usually takes the form of a reduced prison term, but does not erase the conviction or imply innocence. A pardon is an expression of the president's forgiveness that confers extra privileges, such as restoring the convict's right to vote. Presidents often grant pardons in their final days of office. US 'bribes-for-pardon' inquiry unveiled Mr Trump's pardon for Manafort spared his former campaign chairman from serving most of his seven-and-a-half year prison term for financial fraud and conspiring to obstruct the investigation into himself. He had been serving his term under home confinement since being released from federal prison in Mayover fears of coronavirus, but is now a free man. The grateful political operative responded by tweeting: ""Mr President, my family & I humbly thank you for the Presidential Pardon you bestowed on me. Words cannot fully convey how grateful we are."" Mr Manafort (C) with Mr Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress about his attempts to contact Wikileaks, the website that released damaging emails about Mr Trump's 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday night, the long-time Trump friend and adviser welcomed his upgrade from a commutation to full pardon. He said he had been the victim of a ""Soviet-style show trial on politically motivated charges"", reports Politico. Stone has been urging Mr Trump on his way out of the White House to also pardon Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Roger Stone: Trump ally and Russia probe defendant Another pardon went to Charles Kushner, a real estate magnate who is the father ofIvanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, a White House adviser. Kushner Sr - whose family boasts a portfolio of 20,000 properties from New York to Virginia - was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering. The witness tampering charge arose from Kushner Sr's retaliation against his brother-in-law, who was co-operating with authorities against him. Kushner Sr hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, recorded their encounter with hidden cameras and sent it to his own sister. This video can not be played Roger Stone speaks to reporters reacting to Trump's decision to grant clemency It was the president's second wave of clemency orders in as many days. On Tuesday nighthe pardoned 15 people and bestowed commutations on five others. They included two other figures who were convicted in the US special counsel inquiry into alleged Russian election interference, three Republican ex-members of Congress, and four Blackwater military contractors who were involved in a 2007 massacre in Iraq. Trump condemned for pardoning Blackwater guards In November, Mr Trump pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was also convicted in the special counsel's Russia inquiry. Mr Flynn had admitted lying to the FBI before attempting to retract his guilty plea. The president has now pardoned five figures convicted as a result of the special counsel inquiry, which he always condemned as a witch hunt. Robert Mueller's 22-month investigation concluded in May last year without a single figure in Mr Trump's orbit facing any charge of conspiracy with the Kremlin during the 2016 US election. Notably absent from Mr Trump's wave of Christmas pardons are two other figures who were convicted in the Mueller probe: Manafort's deputy, Rick Gates, and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Both men co-operated extensively with prosecutors. Cohen, who was released from prison in May over coronavirus concerns, took to Twitter to vent about the pardons. ""What happened tonight shows how broken the whole criminal justice sustem [sic] is,"" he tweeted. This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? The constitution allows the sitting president the ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment"". Mr Trump has granted fewer acts of clemency - under 100 so far -  than any president in modern history apart from George HW Bush. Barack Obama, for instance, granted 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations during his two terms in office in 2009-17. But Mr Trump's critics say he has bypassed the usual process of consulting the Department of Justice (DOJ) unit that makes such recommendations, and conferred clemency on more political cronies than his predecessors have done. Adam Schiff, the Democratic head of the influential House Intelligence Committee, tweeted: ""During the Mueller investigation, Trump's lawyer floated a pardon to Manafort. Manafort withdrew his co-operation with prosecutors, lied, was convicted, and then Trump praised him for not 'ratting'. ""Trump's pardon now completes the corrupt scheme. Lawless until the bitter end,"" Mr Schiff said. Meanwhile, the first Republican Senator to criticise the move was Ben Sasse. He said in a statement that ""felons like Manafort and Stone"" had ""flagrantly and repeatedly violated the law,externaland harmed Americans"", adding: ""This is rotten to the core.""

"More than 100 people have been killed by unknown attackers in a village in western Ethiopia, the country's human rights commission has said. A nurse at a local clinic told the BBC that more than 30 people had been admitted to the facility, including some in a critical condition. Some of the victims were shot, while others were stabbed, the nurse added. Wednesday's attack in the Benishangul-Gumuz region came a day after a visit by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. In a statement, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said the attack took place in the village of Bekuji, near Bulen town, which lies in an area home to multiple ethnic groups. ""More than 100 people have been killed in fires and shooting perpetrated by armed men"" during the pre-dawn attack, the commission said. Beyene Melese, a spokesperson for the state government, blamed what he called ""anti-peace elements"" for the attack. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Abiy travelled to the region to discuss the recurrence of ethnic-based violence in recent months. ""The desire by enemies to divide Ethiopia along ethnic & religious lines still exists,""the prime minister wrote on Twitter after his visit,external. ""This desire will remain unfulfilled."" Benishangul-Gumuz has witnessed at least four deadly attacks since September, including a gun attack on a passenger bus in November that killed 34 people. The violence in the area is not thought to be related to a ground and air offensive launched by the government in the northern Tigray region last month.

"How likely are snowy scenes in any given Christmas? Are you dreaming of a white Christmas? All it takes is for a single snowflake to be observed falling at any time on Christmas Day somewhere in the UK. So, an official white Christmas may not appear snowy at all, while snow lying on the ground is no guarantee. But while most festive films, songs and cards feature snowy scenes, how likely is a white Christmas in Wales' mild - and warming - climate? 'Plan ahead' before Covid Christmas getaway starts Should you see your family at Christmas? In the 60 years since the Met Office has recorded the data locally, 23 Christmases have officially been white in Wales. This equates to roughly four in every decade, or a white Christmas every two to three years. However, more than a quarter of these white Christmases have seen snow fall in only one location. Only six Christmas Days have seen snowfall in more than 10 locations over this period, and all of these were in an 11-year span. White Christmases do not guarantee good sledging The first of these was in 1993, when 24 weather stations reported snowfall, before this peaked at 38 locations in 1995. Other white Christmases followed in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2004. But a white Christmas does not necessarily mark the arrival of snowmen in gardens and parks. Couple become Mr and Mrs White-Christmas Your pictures: Wales in the snow The most recent significant amount of lying snow recorded in Wales on Christmas Day was in 2009, when 16cm (6in) was recorded at the Llanglunllo station in rural Powys. That year saw the longest spell of freezing and snowy weather over the Christmas period in 28 years, according to Oli Claydon, from the Met Office. He added: ""Although we're recording white Christmases, they're not exactly 'get your sledge out territory'."" Wales was blanketed in snow in 2009, but only four weather stations recorded snowfall on Christmas Day It can be tough to definitively say where has seen the most snowy Christmas days in Wales, as some weather stations have opened more recently than others, and Met Office stations do not cover all areas. Since records started in 1960, the weather station at Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog, in Wrexham county, has seen 11 out of 60 white Christmases - and all in the last 30 years. Dinorwic in Gwynedd and Llangunllo and Velindre in Powys have all recorded eight. Typically, snow is more common later in the winter, with January, February and March all seeing more days of slow and sleet on average in the UK. Snow in Wales is more likely in March than December, as the ""Beast from the East"" showed Earlier this month,Met Office analysis suggested snowy winters may become a thing of the pastin the UK within the next 20 to 40 years. It said most of southern England would no longer see sub-zero days from 2040, while by 2060 only northern Scotland would likely experience such temperatures. The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest What will climate change look like in your area? 2021 will be cooler but still in top six warmest Mr Claydon said there were already signs of a reduction in snow. ""Snow days and ice days are going to reduce as we go forward. Ice days mean temperatures don't climb above 0C,"" he said. ""That enables lying snow to stay around for longer. Without this, the chances of lying snow reduce. ""Under a high emission scenario, by the time we get to the end of the century we are likely to see a reduction in lying snow in the UK.""

The 17-year-old, from Durham,was detained in Januaryafter his conviction for several neo-Nazi terror offences. He has not been publicly named due to his age and his legal team has applied for him to remain anonymous when he turns 18. Only a small number of criminals have ever been granted ongoing anonymity. Manchester Crown Court was told that a hearing in early January would deal with the application. The County Durham teenager's trial heard he was an adherent of ""occult neo-Nazism"" and had described himself as a ""natural sadist"". His attack preparations included researching explosives, listing potential targets, and trying to obtain a bomb-making chemical. He is currently serving a sentence of six years and eight months. In a separate hearing at Leeds Youth Court, the boy was given another custodial term for unrelated child sexual offences. Appearing via video link, he was given an 18-month sentence for five sexual assaults against a girl. The boy had denied the offences but was found guilty at trial earlier this year. District Judge Richard Kitson told the teenager the term would run concurrently with his current sentence, saying the offences were ""so serious"" that only immediate custody was appropriate. Courts can ban the publication of a child defendant's identity but such orderscease to apply once they reach 18,external. In 2019, a boy from Blackburn, who had admitted inciting a terrorist attack in Australia when he was 14,was allowed to remain anonymous after the High Court ruledthat naming him was likely to cause ""serious harm"". Lifelong anonymity has also been granted after release to the Newcastle child killer Mary Bell; Maxine Carr, who obstructed police investigating the 2002 Soham murders by her partner Ian Huntley; and Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who murdered Liverpool toddler James Bulger.

"This video can not be played More tier 4 areas, a new variant and a message of hope - three things from the Downing Street press conference Six million more people in the east and south east of England are to enter tier four on Boxing Day, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced. The places moving into the highest level of restrictions - which include a ""stay at home"" order - border the areas already in tier four. A number of areas will also move up into tiers three and two. Mr Hancock also revealed thatanother new coronavirus variant from South Africa has been detected in the UK. He said anyone who had been there in the last two weeks must quarantine immediately. On Wednesday, a further 39,237 people in the UK tested positive for virus - an all-time high - and there were 744 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according togovernment figures,external. However, cases were thought to be higher in the UK during the spring peak when testing was much more limited. What are you allowed to do in tier four areas? First trucks start leaving lorry park amid delays Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? The health secretary told the Downing Street briefing the old tiering system was not enough to control the new variant of the virus. Across the country, cases have risen 57% in the last week, he said, and hospital admissions are at their highest level since mid-April. The rises have been in places neighbouring areas already in tier four, he said, adding that East Anglia had seen a ""significant number"" of cases caused by the new fast-spreading variant. Areas moving to tier four are:Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, with the exception of the New Forest, and the parts ofEssexandSurreynot already in the toughest restrictions. The additional six million going into tier four takes the total number of people under the toughest restrictions to 24 million, or 43% of England's population. A further 24.8 million will be in tier three. Mr Hancock said: ""This Christmas and the start of 2021 is going to be tough. The new variant makes everything much harder because it spreads so much faster. ""But we mustn't give up now, we know that we can control this virus, we know we can get through this together, we're going to get through it by suppressing the virus until a vaccine can make us safe."" Under tier four, non-essential shops, gyms, hairdressers and indoor entertainment venues must close. People in these areas also cannot meet other people indoors, unless they live with them or they are part of their support bubble, even on Christmas Day, when rules on household mixing are relaxed across the rest of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hancock also announced that other areas would move into higher tiers. Areas moving to tier three are:Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset, including theNorth Somerset council area, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, the New Forest and Northamptonshire as well as Cheshire and Warrington. Cornwall and Herefordshirewill move into tier two. The UK's devolved administrations have alsotightened restrictions to combat a rise in cases, withWales going into another lockdown earlier than plannedover the weekend. MainlandScotlandandNorthern Irelandstart new lockdowns on Boxing Day. The British Medical Association union said the new restrictions in England were a ""necessary step to control the virus and prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed"". But the British Retail Consortium called on the government to extend the business rates holiday for retailers and the hospitality sector beyond April next year. The trade body also said testing should be increased and the vaccination programme ""stepped up"". Anyone singing In the Bleak Midwinter may want to write another verse. It's likely the NHS will soon be dealing with more Covid patients than at the peak in April. The new variants are causing concern - especially as the one detected first in the UK continued to spread even during the November lockdown. And cases, numbers in hospital and deaths are all going up. Vaccines will be the solution, but they take time to roll out and until then it is going to be rough. The only other tool we have to stop the virus spreading is reducing our contacts with other people. That's why millions more of us are moving up the tiers on Boxing Day. The hope is that come spring the virus's grip on our lives will start to ease. The health secretary also said two cases have been detected of another new variant of the coronavirus in the UK. Both were contacts of cases who have travelled from South Africa over the past few weeks, he said. He said: ""This new variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant that has been discovered in the UK."" The health secretary said both cases and close contacts of the cases have been quarantined. There are immediate restrictions on travel from South Africa and the government is telling those who have been in contact with anyone who has been in South Africa in the last fortnight that they must quarantine. The measures were temporary, he said, while the new variant was analysed by scientists at the government's research centre at Porton Down. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? The health secretary also announced an expansion of mass testing and the vaccination programme. Community testing will carried out in areas with the highest infection rates, he said, with 116 areas signing up. Vaccinations have now begun in care homes, Mr Hancock said, with Chelsea pensioners among those set to receive the jab. Mr Hancock also revealed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has now submitted full data to the regulator for approval. He said: ""Amid all this difficulty, the great hope for 2021 is of course the vaccine. ""The vaccine is our route out of all this and however tough this Christmas and this winter is going to be, we know that the transforming force of science is helping to find a way through"", he said. It comes as thefirst trucks began leaving a temporary lorry park in Kent, where they had been stuck since France closed its UK border on Sunday amid concern about the new variant. France has ended its ban on UK arrivals on condition of them having a negative coronavirus test less than 72 hours before departure. On Wednesday, Northern Ireland becamethe latest country to confirm the presence of the new strain. It has already been detected in England, Scotland and Wales, as well as a number of countries on the continent.

"The Crewe family in Austria are expecting a quieter Christmas this year It's no surprise that this Christmas will be different. With coronavirus restrictions affecting everyone, plans have had to change and the usual traditions postponed or altered. But there can be comfort in knowing others are going through something similar. That's why the BBC has spoken to five families in five different countries about how their festive celebrations have changed, and how they're finding ways to enjoy the holiday season despite everything that's happening. The family moved north to a Swedish mountain town in July Michaela and Emil Boson, and sons Lucas, six, and Casper, 13 ...in Are, northern Sweden Despite average daily temperatures of -2C (28.4F), the Boson family are ""probably going to be outside all the time that it's light"" over Christmas. They'll keep warm by skiing and sledging, eating porridge, cooking a barbecued lunch and drinkingGlogg, Sweden's festive, boozy hot wine which is often spiced-up with spirits, fruit and nuts. This will be their first Christmas living in Are, a mountain town around 400 miles (643km) north of Stockholm. The family relocated there in July after Michaela lost most of her work in the hospitality industry which was hit hard by the pandemic. ""We'd been talking about moving for a few years, but now it was just like 'OK, we need to do it',"" she said. One of her brothers and his two children will join them for their snow-based activities, but they will stay in a nearby hotel in order to reduce the risk of infection. Other relatives will join them throughout the day via video call. ""It's a bit boring to not be with the whole family,"" said Michaela, who used to host up to 20 people for Christmas lunch. But she added that she wouldn't want to be back in the city. ""Sometimes it feels like I'm a bit too happy. It's a cheaper lifestyle [and] we just love being outside."" The family decorated the Christmas tree earlier than usual this year Kenza Mekouar and Juan Olaizola, and children, Ivan, 12, and Sofia, eight ...in Madrid, Spain For Kenza and Juan, who have friends and family scattered around the world, 2020 has been a particularly strange year. Kenza is originally from Rabat, Morocco but lives in Juan's hometown of Madrid with their two children. Their multicultural background means that English, French and Spanish are all spoken at home. Seven ways to get through Christmas on your own What is Europe doing about Covid and Christmas? Tracking the global coronavirus outbreak They usually divide much of the Christmas period between Madrid and Marbella. But a three-month lockdown in the spring, home-schooling their children and a swathe of cancelled plans have made this year different. ""I wanted to make things a bit more fun this year,"" Kenza said. ""We're trying to make things a little more festive, happier."" She decorated the Christmas tree earlier than usual and has been sending out Christmas cards by post for the first time in years. A marathon session of the drawing game Pictionary is also on the cards for Christmas Eve. But with restrictions on movement between many Spanish regions, the usual trip to Marbella, with the customary hiking in the nearby mountains, is looking unlikely. One aspect of Christmas that is not going to change is the food. Having developed a British turkey recipe while living in London, the family give their Christmas Eve dinner a Spanish twist by adding seafood. A French-Moroccan flourish is then added in the form of a BÃ»che de NoÃ«l (chocolate log) for dessert. But that's about as far as it goes in terms of preparations, both for Christmas and New Year. ""It's the first time I've had no idea what we're going to do,"" Kenza said. ""That's a very Spanish thing,"" added Juan. ""We're not going to plan anything!"" The family, pictured last Christmas, keep both Austrian and British traditions Eva and Graham Crewe and their children, Amelie,11, Elena, 9, and Matilda, 5 ...in Salzburg, Austria Eva is Austrian and Graham is from the UK. Usually Graham's parents would come and visit them, but this year that isn't possible. Instead, the family are hoping to see Eva's parents. ""We can only see them and not the big family. So it will be very small and reduced,"" she said. ""We also can't see my grandmother who is 97, so that will be very different."" The family keeps both Austrian and British Christmas traditions, celebrating with presents on the evening of 24 December, and with Christmas stockings on the morning of the 25th. ""Normally we'd have a big English lunch with turkey and so on,"" Graham said. ""But this year we're going to save a lot of money because we'll have a chicken instead - and there's just us."" ""Everything's cancelled, really,"" he said. ""It'll just be quieter."" But the family have adapted to ensure some traditions can be kept up. Amelie plays the piano and Elena plays the violin, and they would usually perform in Christmas concerts at this time of year. ""I think they're going to record a video [of them playing] and send it to our parents,"" Eva explained. ""There'll be a lot more Zoom and FaceTime. It's better than nothing, but of course we miss the personal contact,"" Graham said. ""It's actually an opportunity because we wouldn't see them all anyway. So there are some opportunities as well, some bright spots."" ""We're already making plans for next summer,"" he added. ""The thing I'm looking forward to next year is much more physical contact with all our friends and family around the world."" Nadia's large family usually spend Christmas back home in southern Italy Nadia and Simone, and their two sons, Samuele, 7, and Sebastian, 5 ...in Rome, Italy ""It's not going to be like any previous Christmas,"" said Nadia. ""My family is very big. Mamma is the head of the family, and it really means everything to her that we're all there for lunch [back home in Calabria] on Christmas Day."" ""It's the first time in my life we won't all be home."" Usually, the whole family would gather for a prayer on Christmas Day. ""This year we'll do it all on Whatsapp; we'll have a video call and pray together,"" she said. ""We'll make a toast together and we'll chat a bit."" After a difficult year, Nadia also decided to buy a puppy for her family because they had wanted one for a long time. ""The kids are overjoyed,"" she said. ""If all goes to plan, we'll have him just before Christmas. We'll feel a bit less lonely!"" ""It'll be the four of us at the table with the dog on Christmas Day,"" she added. ""Even if there are just the four of us, I'll make a special table. I'll cook lunch and try to respect traditions and make more or less the same things we eat down south."" That means antipasto, pasta dishes, various types of meat, vegetables, then dessert and fruit. ""Then at five o'clock you get hungry and start again,"" Nadia said. ""We eat constantly!"" Natalia says this Christmas will be very different from last year Natalia Khartukova and Vladimir Kriveelsky ...in Moscow, Russia Natalia is a health worker in the Russian capital, Moscow, who has been working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic. ""It was really difficult,"" she said. ""This year will be really different,"" she explained. ""Last year, I went to a restaurant with my whole family and we were there all night and ended up dancing and having fun. Two years ago, I went to China with my husband. So it will be different."" ""We'll invite maybe two people over on 31 December [when Russia's big New Year celebrations take place] and that's all,"" she said. ""Our parents won't come over because they're afraid of the virus. I'm a medical worker, so I'm more high-risk."" Natalia will video-call her parents for Orthodox Christmas a week later instead. ""We're not going to gather all together in our apartment. No way,"" she said. But she believes Russians are more in need of a celebration now than ever - even if it is on a much smaller scale. ""People want to feel happy, more than they did last year, because it's been so hard and so tough. ""It's more important than ever,"" she said.

"UK stock markets have closed for the Christmas break in an upbeat mood. The FTSE 250 jumped 1.15% to 20,531, hours before the Brexit trade deal with the EU was announced. But the blue-chip FTSE 100 ended the day's trading up just 0.01% at 6,502 as traders waited for confirmation of the deal to emerge. Market positivity will give a seasonal boost to investors, including the millions who have a financial stake in stock markets through their pensions. The pound was up, showing a gain of about 0.7% against the dollar to touch $1.36 before falling back slightly. It also gained 0.5% against the euro, rising to â¬1.1136. Across Europe, shares were also on the rise, although the key Frankfurt stock market was closed. Asian markets closed positively with Japan's Nikkei gaining 0.54%, while markets in Australia, South Korea and Singapore also saw modest rises. Sterling has always been the most reliable of Brexit trade deal sentiment - the pound rose against the US dollar yesterday and continued that rise this morning. It started the week worth $1.34, dropped to $1.32 as hopes of a deal faded, and this morning climbed to $1.36. The stock market reaction today has been muted - the FTSE 100 was barely changed this morning, but much of the reaction to the looming deal took place yesterday. The FTSE 250, a stock market index that is regarded as more representative of the UK economy, climbed nearly 2% on Wednesday. Lloyds Bank, which investors have come to see as a bellwether of sentiment towards a trade deal, rose 7% yesterday and another 6% this morning. An agreement on fishing rights has been the main stumbling block of the trade talks as an end-of-year deadline looms. The pound has seen plenty of volatility in recent weeks as negotiations between UK and European ministers have stalled and deadlines missed. Last week, it had hit a two-year high above $1.36. The British currency had surged almost 1% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak in what has been a roller-coaster ride. UK-EU trade talks continue ahead of expected deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? ""Sentiment improved after headlines started appearing that the United Kingdom and European Union have finally reached a provisional Brexit trade agreement."" said Jeffrey Halley at foreign exchange firm Oanda. If your reaction to ""market movements"" is that you are not directly affected because you do not invest money, think again. You are likely to be one of the millions of people with a pension - either privately or through work - who have their savings invested by pension schemes. As much as Â£600bn is held in defined contribution pensions at the moment. Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest their money to help it grow. But that means the value of your savings pot is influenced by the performance of the investments. So rises or falls in shares can affect your pension and effectively your savings, which is why you are affected by major market movements. However, it's worth bearing in mind that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet, so short-term market fluctuations are not something to panic about. ""There's a huge difference between knowing you're connected to the stock market and panicking about it,"" says Sarah Coles from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Stock markets always go up and down over the short term,"" she adds. ""It's important to bear in mind that investors have lived through major ups and downs in the past and come out the other side.""

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen are said to have been working to reach an agreement before Christmas Boris Johnson is expected to announce later that the UK has reached an agreement with the EU over post-Brexit trade and security. Officials in Brussels are believed to be finalising the details of a deal that will come into force when the UK leaves EU trading rules next week. It follows months of often fraught negotiations between the two sides. The PM will speak to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen by phone to sign off the deal. Mr Johnson is then expected to hold a press conference in Downing Street to announce it. LIVE: EU and UK on verge of deal How do voters feel about Brexit now? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? EU to allow post-Brexit UK farm produce exports The announcement had been expected earlier, but it has been delayed while final haggling between the two sides continues. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTE Radio there had been ""some sort of last-minute hitch"" over the small print of the fishing quotas agreement but a deal was still expected later. A deal would end the prospect of the two sides imposing widespread import taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods from 1 January, which could have affected prices. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke four times on Wednesday to get a deal ""over the line"". She said negotiators were ""still haggling over some fine details"", including catch quotas for more than 100 species of fish in UK waters. It is understood the agreement does not have a role for the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, and the two sides have agreed a system to sort out disputes that follows international law, rather than EU law, our political editor said. In addition, she said the two sides have agreed to phase new fishing arrangements over five years, with the UK catching as much as two-thirds of the fish in UK waters by the end of the transition. The deal document is thought to be around 2,000 pages long. It is expected that the UK Parliament will be recalled to vote on a law implementing a deal before 31 December, when the Brexit transition period ends. On the EU side, leaders can decide to apply a deal provisionally before the European Parliament holds a ratification vote early next year. It could also need eventual approval in national EU parliaments, depending on the exact contents of the deal. BBC Europe correspondent Gavin Lee said Mrs von der Leyen was also due to speak later to set out details of the deal. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? It is believed one of the final obstacles being discussed include quotas for particular types of fish. The UK has insisted on having control over fishing in its waters from 1 January and retaining a larger share of the catch from them than under the current quota system. But the EU wanted to phase in a new fishing system over a longer period and retain more of its access to UK waters for boats from France, Spain and other member states. The sides also disagreed over whether UK firms should continue to follow the same rules as companies within the EU - and on how future trading disputes should be resolved. The pizzas arrived as the negotiations continued into the evening By Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe correspondent As afternoon gave way to evening and evening gave way to night in Brussels optimism that agreement was close never dwindled, but never quite turned into a deal either. At one point pizzas arrived for the weary officials - a delivery man on a bike turning up at the front gates of the European Commission. It was understood that negotiators were still haggling over precise quotas of individual species of fish that EU boats will be allowed to catch in British waters. The governments of individual EU member states must consider the details of any deal but they have been briefed regularly throughout the process and shouldn't find much if anything to surprise them. The issue of how to promote the deal for public consumption is much more pressing for the British side than the European. For the EU there are legal loose ends to be tied up but the European Parliament will only vote on a deal retrospectively at some point in the New Year. In the UK the government will have to get any deal through parliament before 31 December. UK ministers have repeatedly ruled outany extension to the transition period, under which the UK has continued to follow Brussels's trade rules since it left the EU on 31 January. Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays UK, said he welcomed an agreement, which would bring ""clarity"" for business. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said planning for a new trading relationship with the EU had been ""the overriding issue for businesses over the last two years"". ""This was pure politics. It was always the last minute sort of rabbit from the hat,"" he added. The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its group of lawyers to analyse any deal that is reached. The group was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would ""scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"".

"The 2007 incident in Baghdad's Nisoor Square caused an international outcry The UN has sharply criticised President Donald Trump's decision to pardon four former Blackwater contractors jailed over the killing of 14 Iraqi civilians. Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard opened fire in Baghdad's Nisoor Square in 2007 while guarding an American diplomatic convoy. The UN Human Rights Office warned that the pardons would serve to embolden others to commit similar crimes. The father of a nine-year boy who died said Mr Trump ""broke my life again"". There was no immediate response from the Iraqi government. Slatten, Slough, Liberty and Heard were among 19 Blackwater private security contractors assigned to guard a convoy of four heavily-armoured vehicles carrying US personnel on 16 September 2007. According to the US justice department,external, at about noon that day several of the contractors opened fire in and around Nisoor Square, a busy roundabout that was immediately adjacent to the heavily-fortified Green Zone. When they stopped shooting, at least 14 Iraqi civilians were dead - 10 men, two women and two boys, aged nine and 11. Iraqi authorities put the toll at 17. Witness History: Blackwater killed my son Blackwater incident: What happened,external US prosecutors said Slatten was the first to fire, without provocation, killing Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubiay, an aspiring doctor who was driving his mother to an appointment. The contractors said they mistakenly believed that they were under attack. The incident caused international outrage, strained relations between the US and Iraq, and sparked a debate over the role of contractors in warzones. By John Simpson, BBC world affairs editor It was one of the worst incidents in a conflict which never lost its ability to shock. A couple of days afterwards, the wreckage of a dozen or so cars was still lying around and there were patches of dry blood on the ground. The story told to me by eyewitnesses followed a familiar pattern: in the heavy traffic a frightened and inexperienced driver ignored warnings to stop, and carried on towards a convoy of American officials protected by Blackwater agents. Several witnesses insisted that the contractors had panicked and opened fire indiscriminately. Among those who died was a nine-year-old boy who was sitting in the back of his father's car and was hit in the head. Again and again during the war in Iraq I witnessed lesser versions of the Nisoor Square incident, when American soldiers and contractors assumed they were being fired on, and retaliated in devastating and often uncontrolled fashion. But Nisoor Square had a particularly powerful effect on Iraqi opinion which persists to this day. By pardoning the four men involved, President Trump has reignited the hatred and resentment caused by the incident. In 2014, a US federal court found Slatten guilty of murder, while Slough, Liberty and Heard were convicted of voluntary manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and other charges. Slatten was sentenced to life in prison, and the other three were handed 30-year terms. However, the US Court of Appeals reversed Slatten's conviction and ordered that the three others be resentenced for their roles in the crime. Slatten was retried in 2018, but a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The second retrial began later that year and Slatten was found guilty of committing first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2019. Slough, Liberty and Heard subsequently had their sentences reduced to 15, 14 and 12 years respectively. A White House statement,externalsaid Slatten, Slough, Liberty and Heard had a ""long history of service to the nation"" as veterans of the US Army and US Marine Corps, and that their pardons were ""broadly supported by the public... and elected officials"". It added that the Court of Appeals ""ruled that additional evidence should have been presented at Mr Slatten's trial"", and that prosecutors recently disclosed ""that the lead Iraqi investigator, who prosecutors relied heavily on to verify that there were no insurgent victims and to collect evidence, may have had ties to insurgent groups himself"". Brian Heberlig, a lawyer for Paul Slough, said the contractors ""didn't deserve to spend one minute in prison"" and that he was ""overwhelmed with emotion at this fantastic news"". Mohammed Kinani, a US-Iraqi dual citizen whose nine-year-old son Ali was killed in Nisoor Square,told the BBC that President Trump's decision ""broke my life again"". ""He broke the law. He broke everything. He broke the court. He broke the judge,"" he said. ""Before [this] I felt that no-one [was] above the law."" A spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office, Marta Hurtado, expressed deep concern and said pardoning the guards ""contributes to impunity and has the effect of emboldening others to commit such crimes in the future"". ""The UN Human Rights Office calls on the US to renew its commitment to fighting impunity for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, as well as to uphold its obligations to ensure accountability for such crimes,"" she added. Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project, said Mr Trump had ""hit a disgraceful new low with the Blackwater pardons"". ""President Trump insults the memory of the Iraqi victims and further degrades his office with this action,"" she added. Democratic US Senator Chris Murphytweeted,external: ""Pardoning these murderers is a disgrace. They shot women and kids who had their hands in the air."" ""But it's all part of a plan to limit [President-elect Joe] Biden's national security tools. These pardons will greatly damage U.S.-Iraq relations, at a critical moment.""

"The EU and UK appear close to striking a post-Brexit trade deal, with Boris Johnson briefing his cabinet on the progress of talks in Brussels. Disputes over fishing rights and future business competition rules have been the major hurdles to agreement during months of often fraught talks. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Downing Street now seemed ""very confident"" of a deal. Negotiators are now thought to be thrashing out the final details. The official announcement of a deal is expected on Thursday morning. The document is thought to be around 2,000 pages long, with both sides having until 31 December - when the UK leaves EU trading rules - get it approved by parliamentarians. Brexit: If the boat comes in How do voters feel about Brexit now? Brexit: Can the talks be extended? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? A deal would end the prospect of the two sides imposing widespread import taxes - tariffs - on each other's goods from 1 January, which could have affected prices. EU sources said the UK prime minister and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had been in contact in an attempt to break the deadlock before the expected pause in negotiations for Christmas. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months.

The European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs has promised to reconvene its ""star chamber"" of lawyers - which was highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU - to analyse any deal that is reached. Chairman Mark Francois and deputy chairman David Jones said it would ""scrutinise it in detail, to ensure that its provisions genuinely protect the sovereignty of the United Kingdom"".

"McLaughlan completed the 25-mile journey on 11 December A man who rode from Scotland to the Isle of Man by jet ski to see his girlfriend has left the island by ferry upon his release from jail. Dale McLaughlan made the four-and-a-half hour crossing from the Isle of Whithorn to Ramsey on 11 December. He then walked another 15 miles (25km) to his girlfriend's home in Douglas. The 28-year-old - who served part of afour-week sentencefor the Covid-19 border control breach - told the BBC he was ""happy to be going home"". Under current Isle of Man coronavirus laws McLaughlan, from Irvine in North Ayrshire, was required to leave the island after his release or face further prosecution. Speaking toIsle of Man Newspapers,external, his girlfriend Jessica Radcliffe said: ""I don't understand why he's been told to leave when he's isolated for two weeks before he came over with a negative test. ""He had a negative test in jail, he didn't put any of the public at risk, and he's done isolation in jail. ""That's four weeks already, so why does he need to leave the island? To punish him this much, they shouldn't be doing that."" McLaughlan was arrested two days after his arrival, having spent time mixing with people in two busy nightclubs, his court case heard. Douglas Courthouse heard it was the first time he had used a jet ski. Only non-residents given special permission are currently allowed to enter the island. McLaughlan's defence advocate said he suffered from depression and was not coping with being unable to see his partner. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the sentence sent""a strong signal"" to potential lawbreakers. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external?

"Rapid tests for coronavirus are a ""useful"" public health tool despite only picking up half as much virus as tests done in a lab, a group of scientists has said. The 30-minute test has been criticised for how it measures up to the tests processed in the government's mega-labs. But the scientists cautioned against comparing them directly. The tests serve different purposes in different contexts, they explained. And rapid tests may be a better guide to who is currently infectious. During a testing pilot in Liverpool, the devices picked up two-thirds of the most infectious cases - all people who would not have otherwise been tested at all. The pilot, which made tests available to anyone in the city who wanted one, picked up 1,300 infections in people without symptoms in a population of about half a million. Prof Louise Kenny at the University of Liverpool said even if one in three infections was missed, that left two infections which would not otherwise have been found. No test was perfect, she said, but she warned against ""making perfection the enemy of the good"". However, the evaluation of the Liverpool pilot found there was ""no clear evidence that the introduction of 'mass' testing in Liverpool impacted on Covid-19 cases or hospital admissions."" The scientists on the panel included those involved in evaluating rapid tests in Liverpool, Oxford and the Porton Down research facility. Standard lab tests, also known as PCR tests, pick up some infections that rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests miss, particularly in the early stages of infection. These are the tests you'll have if you have symptoms. PCR tests are very important for use in diagnosing people - by the time someone turns up at a hospital they may not have much virus in their nose or throat, as it migrates to the lungs. So in these situations having a very sensitive test is useful. They are crucial for use in surveillance of the virus, and they're also important for contact-tracing since, even if that individual is no longer infectious, they may have passed it on to others who are. But the downside is they pick up small fragments of inactive virus, meaning some people might be told to isolate when they are no longer capable of infecting anyone. Rapid or lateral flow tests, on the other hand, are not good at picking up relatively small amounts of virus. Overall, the Liverpool study found the devices only picked up 40% of cases - less than expected. This means the tests will miss people in the day or two before they are about to become infectious, as well as those who have cleared the infection from their systems. But they do find the majority of the most infectious cases - and lateral flow tests have the major advantage of not needing to be taken to a lab. They work by dipping a nose and throat swab in special solution and then dropping that fluid onto a plastic stick a bit like a pregnancy test. ""The time and scale gained by having a low-cost test that returns results within an hour without a laboratory is a valuable new tool for tackling Covid-19,"" according to Prof Iain Buchan, who led the Liverpool evaluation. This allows for many more people to access testing, including those without symptoms - people for whom it is ""this or nothing"", Prof Kenny said. Screening asymptomatic people in the community is potentially nothing but positive, provided people don't change their behaviour after a negative result - and isolate after a positive one. It's a more difficult question once you are using them to clear people to do something - for examplevisit a care home residentorcross the border into France. Missing perhaps a third of infections - although it can be less if the test is done by a trained person - might be too high a risk in those cases. But even if you are allowing someone to do something they wouldn't have otherwise, the tests can allow people to balance risk with harm. They might provide reassurance to allow someone in a care home who has been deprived of social contact to have a visitor wearing PPE. Or, if there is one Covid case in a school year, it could be used to prevent a whole class from having to isolate and miss face-to-face education. They don't eliminate risk, but they can reduce it in situations where there is enough benefit. And their accuracy can be improved by screening people regularly, Prof Kenny explained - perhaps once or twice a week in schools, universities and specific workplaces. Prof Jacqui Ramagge, who led student testing efforts at the University of Durham, said ""the chances of someone being positive when they are repeatedly testing negative is very, very low"".

"UK cabinet ministers are to hold a conference call to discuss a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU UK and EU negotiating teams are still in talks to finalise an agreement on fishing rights. UK PM Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also held talks earlier Three ""critical issues"" needed to be resolved - fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced If they agree to a deal they have just over a week to get the deal formally approved in London and Brussels The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year If a deal is not signed off by then, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force After months of talks, UK cabinet ministers are understood to be gathering on a conference call to discuss a Brexit deal with the EU. Our political editor Laura Kuenssberg says that âwouldnât

are talking about specific details for future fishing rights â on catches of
specific species of fish. Earlier, EU sources
said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen had also been in contact in an attempt to break the deadlock. Hello and thanks for joining us. In the next few hours, UK and EU leaders will reach a deal
that will govern their future relations after Brexit. Weâre here to take you through tonightâs developments, and
