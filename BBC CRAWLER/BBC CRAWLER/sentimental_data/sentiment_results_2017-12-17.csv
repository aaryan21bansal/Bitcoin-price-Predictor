"This video can not be played Passengers reacted with delight when the lights came back on Passengers at the world's busiest airport faced a second day of disruption on Monday after a power cut led to hundreds of cancellations. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport lost power on Sunday, affecting tens of thousands of people. Passengers were left in darkened terminals or on board planes. Power was restored overnight and a handful of passenger flights resumed just after 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Monday. Hundreds of other flights, however, were cancelled. The airport is the world's busiest, handling more than 250,000 passengers and almost 2,500 flights every day. But during its first hour of operation on Monday morning, fewer than a dozen commercial flights departed. A number of cargo flights had operated during the partial shutdown. Many hundreds of flights have been cancelled Thousands remain stranded in the airport awaiting rescheduled flights. In a statement, the airport said it had distributed more than 5,000 meals to waiting passengers. Security processing began at about 03:30 local time, it said, but those with tickets dated Sunday would need to reprint them to pass through checkpoints. The airport advised passengers to check the status of their particular flight directly with their airline. In a statement, the airport confirmed it had suffered a power cut shortly after 13:00 on Sunday. Many flights scheduled to arrive from other airports were diverted elsewhere, or held at their departure airport. Georgia Power, which supplies the airport's electricity, said it believed a fire at an underground electrical facility had caused the power cut. Officials said a piece of its switchgear could have failed and started the fire, causing cable damage. Power was fully restored to the airport around midnight on Sunday. Allow Instagram content?

Atlanta's mayor confirmed the fire's cause was under investigation, and apologised to the thousands affected. A number of major airlines, including United, Southwest and American Airlines, completely suspended their operations on Sunday. Each had at least some flights scheduled to depart Monday. Images shared on social media showed passengers waiting in darkness. Some reported being stuck on board aircraft for six hours. One passenger, Jannifer Lee, was travelling to Minnesota from Florida with her 10-year-old pet rescue cat Penny. Her first flight was stuck for almost four hours at the gate. Ms Lee and her cat spent four hours stuck at the gate on her connecting flight from Florida ""I was hoping to have a really smooth flight, especially with a cat,"" she told the BBC. ""I've only ever flown with her for two or three hours before, not a 12-hour journey! I guess animals can be a lot more resilient than people."" She and thousands of others were left stranded without information from airlines about onward travel. ""There was a lot of confusion on the flight, because the national news knew more about the situation than we did,"" Ms Lee said. Another passenger, Naomi Harm, was stranded on the tarmac on a Delta flight from Sacramento, California. She told the BBC that airline staff had kept the passengers in good spirits by communicating regularly and handing out any food and drinks they had available. She said one passenger seated close to her had been escorted down to the aircraft's cargo area to give insulin to his diabetic pet dog in the hold by an air marshal. After almost four hours she was guided out in darkness after portable steps were found for them to disembark. ""Inside the terminal there were thousands all over, children crying,""  she said. ""The air conditioning wasn't working and it was very hot inside."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The local police department confirmed it had sent extra officers to help the airport with the situation. About 30,000 passengers were reportedly affected by the power cut.

"Honey and Barry Sherman were renowned for their charity fundraising The family of a Canadian billionaire and his wife have hit back at reports surrounding their recent deaths. Police are treating the deaths of Barry Sherman, 75, and his wife Honey, whose bodies were found in their Toronto home on Friday, as ""suspicious"" but say no suspects are being sought. Canadian media, citing police sources, say the case is being investigated as a possible murder-suicide. But a family statement said no-one close to the couple believed this. ""Our parents shared an enthusiasm for life and commitment to their family and community totally inconsistent with the rumours regrettably circulated in the media as to the circumstances surrounding their deaths,"" it read. The statement went on to call for a ""thorough, intensive and objective criminal investigation"" and for the media to stop reporting on the cause of the deaths until the investigation was finished. The Shermans were found dead at their home in Toronto The couple's bodies were found by their estate agent, who had been trying to sell the property. There was no sign of forced entry. Police say they are awaiting the results of post-mortem exams before deciding on their next steps. Several Canadian newspapers say they were told investigators were working on the assumption Mr Sherman had killed his wife before killing himself. Tributes have meanwhile been pouring in for the pair, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting ""condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit"". One of Canada's richest men, Mr Sherman was the founder and chairman of pharmaceutical giant Apotex, which sells generic medicines around the world. A gifted student, Mr Sherman entered the trade through his uncle's Empire Laboratories, working for him while still at university before buying the company when his uncle died. He went on to sell Empire, creating Apotex, the company that made him a billionaire and which now employs more than 10,000 people. But he became embroiled in a family dispute, with his uncle's children seeking a stake in Apotex, arguing they had been cheated. A judge threw out their claim earlier this year. He also faced an investigation as to whether he had improperly held a fundraiser for Justin Trudeau before he became prime minister. Mrs Sherman was a board member for several hospitals, charities and Jewish organisations. The couple had four children and have given millions to charity.

"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had always refused to recognise pilots' unions Ryanair pilots have suspended a pre-Christmas one-day strike, union bosses have announced. The Impact union, which represents Irish-based pilots, has agreed to meet Ryanair's management on Tuesday ahead of the planned action on Wednesday. It follows Ryanair's decision on Friday to recognise unions, in a bid to avert strikes across its European operations. Unions in other countries had already halted action, but Impact said Irish pilots wanted more clarification. In a statement on Sunday, the union said: ""Impact has this evening suspended a planned one-day strike of Ryanair pilots next Wednesday after company management agreed to recognise the union as the representative of Irish-based pilots. ""The union has agreed to meet management on Tuesday evening, but says it is available to meet sooner. ""The union asked management to release its Ryanair pilot representatives to prepare for and attend the meeting. ""The union acknowledged the principled determination of Ryanair pilots."" Ryanair in union offer to avoid strikes Ryanair pilots to strike before Christmas The airline has offered to recognise trade unions for the first time after pilots in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal threatened walkouts. Ryanair said on Saturday that it would meet the German pilots' union for talks on Wednesday.

The Dublin-based airline announced on Friday that it would recognise the unions ""as long as they establish committees of Ryanair pilots... as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines"". It is the first time Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has extended such an invitation to union leaders in the 32 years the company has been flying. Britain's Balpa union said on Saturday said it had accepted Ryanair's offer to represent British-based pilots, but only if the TUC federation of British trade unions was allowed to attend future talks. This video can not be played Ryanair tells Today the airline is moving to recognise unions as it's ""time for change"" Friday's announcement led to Italian pilots' union Anpac and Portuguese union Spac calling off strike action due to take place next week. Pilots in Germany had voted to take industrial action some time during the Christmas period. German union Vereinigung Cockpit said the onus was now on Ryanair to ""prove that this announcement is serious"". In Spain, there are no strikes planned for pilots but ground staff unions have not ruled out action on 30 December. In October, Mr O'Leary wrote to his airline's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions after Ryanair was forced to cancel thousands of flights.

"This video can not be played FranÃ§ois Gabart was welcomed back to France by a flotilla of local boats escorting him home A French sailor has set a new world record for the fastest solo round-the-world navigation, beating the previous time by more than six days. FranÃ§ois Gabart finished his circuit of the globe early on Sunday, in a time of 42 days, 16 hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds. He completed the journey non-stop, confined to his trimaran sailing yacht since 4 November. Gabart broke the record set by his countryman Thomas Coville last year. The record was held at one stage by British national Dame Ellen MacArthur. Gabart's new record has yet to be verified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council, which will check the ship's GPS data before confirming the result. Gabart celebrated aboard his trimaran as he reached port in Brest He crossed the finish line near the western limit of the English Channel at about 01:45 GMT, before turning his ship homeward. Capturing the drama just ahead of the finish, Gabart said in a video recorded in front of an on-board computer monitor: ""The little blue bit is us, the red line is the finish. We should cross it any time now, the computer says 30 seconds."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Then he reported: ""I've just crossed the finish line. It's pretty crazy. It's pretty unreal. I'm a bit overwhelmed. Just now I couldn't move I was at such a loss about what to do next. I'm in the dark. There are cargo ships and fishing boats around me. It's a pretty weird atmosphere and at the same time it's pretty extraordinary... ""I'm proud and happy to have made this pretty voyage around the planet."" As he arrived in the town of Brest in France's north-west several hours later, his yacht was escorted into port by a host of local boats in celebration of his accomplishment. Gabart's success is partly down to good luck with weather, which can dramatically influence sailing speeds. FranÃ§ois Gabart spent 42 days alone on his ship AFP news agency reports that, while chasing the global speed record, Gabart broke several others for solo racing, including the fastest navigation of the Pacific and the longest distance covered in 24 hours - 1,575km (851 miles). But his 30m (98ft) boat was also custom-designed for the purpose, using the latest technology, and reached speeds of 35 knots (65km/h) during the journey, it said. Gabart posted photos and video on social media frequently during his 42 days at sea, sharing his sunset views or his success at fishing with fans. Allow Instagram content?

Well-known sailor Michel Desjoyeaux told the AFP news agency it was not surprising that Gabart had broken Coville's record. ""The one thing we can be sure of is that Francois has a faster boat than Thomas had and if they raced head-to-head then he would be faster,"" he said. ""And he has spent a great deal of time on a multi-hull and is completely unafraid of high speeds.""

"Who could choose between Sarah Lynn and James White? The latest series of The Apprentice has reached a surprise climax. Lord Sugar has chosen both finalists to be his business partners, for the first time in the BBC show's history. The business mogul said he ""genuinely couldn't decide"" between sweet firm owner Sarah Lynn, 35, and James White, 26, who runs an IT recruitment company. As a result, both candidates receive a Â£250,000 business investment and 50/50 partnership with Lord Sugar, who called them ""fantastically skilled people"". ""This particular year, I'm going to double my investment,"" Lord Sugar told them. ""I'm going to start a business with both of you."" Usually, Lord Sugar gives Â£250,000 to just one winner. According to the BBC, this surprise double ""hiring"" does not constitute a format change. But some fans were unhappy with the conclusion and reacted strongly on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

An audience of 6.5 million tuned into the final to see Lynn, from London, go up against White, from Birmingham. Over the course of the 12-week series, the pair had seen off 16 other candidates to compete with each other for the privilege of becoming Lord Sugar's business partner. How long can The Apprentice keep going? Apprentice winner 'let Lord Sugar down' The final episode saw Lynn and White pitch their business plans to Lord Sugar and his panel of experts. ""It is quite obvious that there are two fantastically skilled people there,"" said the 70-year-old magnate before reaching his decision. ""Deciding on a winner was the most difficult decision I have had to make in all 13 series of The Apprentice to date,"" said Lord Sugar in a statement. Lord Sugar (centre) reached his decision after consulting Karren Brady and Claude Littner ""James and Sarah were extremely impressive and their proposed business plans were very different but equally strong. ""I genuinely couldn't decide between them, so after deliberating long and hard, I decided to stump up Â£500,000 and invest in them both."" Lynn said she felt ""shocked and amazed"" to be declared the joint victor alongside White, who said it was ""very, very humbling"" to be Lord Sugar's business partner.

"Police are investigating the deaths of four newborn babies who died within 90 minutes of each other in an intensive care ward in South Korea. The babies all went into cardiac arrest while lying in incubators at Seoul's Ewha Womans University Medical Centre. Staff performed CPR but efforts to revive the babies were unsuccessful, a hospital official said. Family members told local media they were concerned about the health of the infants before they died on Saturday. They said the babies all had bloated stomachs and difficulty breathing. Hospital staff say they do not know what caused the cardiac arrests but told police they did ""not seem to have originated from a contagious cause."" South Korea birth rate at record low Officials said the four babies had already died by the time police arrived at the hospital, which is in the Mok-dong area of western Seoul. The 12 remaining babies who were in the intensive care unit at the time of the incident have either been discharged or transferred to other hospitals. Police have been searching the hospital. They said autopsies are expected to be conducted on Monday to determine the babies' cause of death. South Korea has spent about $70bn (Â£53bn) trying to boost the country's birth rate over the past decade, handing out baby bonuses, improving paternity leave and paying for infertility treatment.

"The alleged plot targeted St Petersburg's Kazan Cathedral Information provided by the CIA helped Russian security services foil an attack on St Petersburg's Kazan cathedral, US and Russian leaders say. President Vladimir Putin phoned Donald Trump to thank him for the information, the White House and Kremlin confirmed. The attack was allegedly planned to take place on Saturday, Russia says. A White House statement said ""terrorists"" were captured prior to an attack ""that could have killed large numbers of people"". Russia's FSB security service said in a statement on Friday that it had detained seven members of a cell of Islamic State supporters and seized a significant amount of explosives, weapons and extremist literature. The cell was planning to carry out a suicide attack at a religious institution and kill citizens on Saturday,the FSB statement said (in Russian),external. The group was preparing explosions targeting the cathedral and other public places in Russia's second city, the Kremlin statement said on Sunday. Mr Putin told Mr Trump that Russia's special services would hand over information on terror threats to their US counterparts, it added. Mr Putin had asked the US president to pass on his thanks to the CIA director and the operatives involved, both countries said. US intelligence agencies, including the CIA, believe that Russia tried to sway last year's US presidential election in favour of Mr Trump - claims rejected by the Republican. A special counsel is investigating whether anyone from the Trump campaign colluded. The two leaders most recently met at a summit in Vietnam last month While Mr Trump categorically denies colluding with Russia,he has talked about the importance of working together ""constructively"". Sunday's conversation between the two presidents marks the second time the two men have spoken in a week. On Thursday they discussed North Korea,externaland Mr Trump thanked Mr Putin ""for acknowledging America's strong economic performance"" in his annual press conference, according to the White House. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Trump Russia scandal 'harms US' - Putin The White House said that the two leaders agreed in Sunday's phone call that the co-operation was ""an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together"". An explosion on St Petersburg's metro system in April killed at least 13 peopleand is thought to be linked to jihadists. Returning militants from Syria pose a real threat to Russia, the head of the FSB was quoted as saying on Tuesday. Security services had already prevented 18 terrorist attacks in 2017, Alexander Bortnikov said in comments reported by Itar-Tass news agency.

As locals find out what happened, they all say how tragic it is that six people should die so close to Christmas. It is not yet known what caused the crash, but people are telling me there has long been a problem with speeding and racing on this road and the adjoining Bristol Street.

"Waiters are among the workers who have been enrolled in recent years Every worker aged 18 or over will begin saving into a workplace pension unless they opt out, under government plans to extend its automatic enrolment scheme. At present, the scheme means employers must enrol staff aged 22 and over and earning above Â£10,000 into a pension. Ministers hope to reduce the minimum age to 18 in the mid 2020s, and say it will affect about 900,000 young people. The system has been credited with ensuring more prepare for older age, but it means extra costs for employers. It has been introduced gradually since October 2012. Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been ""greater saving for pensions"" since automatic enrolment came into effect. ""We want to extent that to young people under 22. ""I think we will get more people into the habit of saving."" He admitted increases in contributions from next year ""might put people off"", but added ""the evidence is that opt-out rates have been lower than people predicted"". Olly Browning, 21, welcomed the encouragement to save, adding that pensions had ""not really crossed my mind yet"". He told the BBC: ""I think especially in London, [I have] moved jobs quite frequently, tend not to stay in one place too long, so pensions have always sort of been lower down the list of things I've been conscious of."" However, one industry figure was unimpressed by aspects of the Department of Work and Pensions' wider pensions review. Ex-pensions minister Steve Webb, director of policy at pensions firm Royal London, said: ""There are some great ideas in this review, including starting pension saving at age 18 and making sure that every pound that you earn is pensionable. ""But the proposed pace of change is shockingly lethargic. ""Talking about having reforms in place by the mid 2020s risks leaving a whole generation of workers behind."" Unless they are already signed up to a workplace pension, a slice of a worker's pay packet is automatically diverted to a pension savings pot, which is invested until retirement. Their employer also makes a contribution, as does the government. Individuals have the option to opt out if they wish to, although that will mean losing the employers' contribution. Anyone on a short-term contract, working where an agency pays their wages, or who is on maternity, adoption or carer's leave should still be eligible. The total minimum contribution is currently set at 2% of earnings (0.8% from the worker, 1% from an employer, and 0.2% as tax relief from the government). From April 2018, it will increase to 5% of earnings (2.4% from the worker, 2% from the employer, and 0.6% as tax relief). From April 2019 onwards, it will rise to 8% of earnings (4% from the individual, 3% from the employer, and 1% as tax relief). The plan to lower the starting age follows a review of the system. Those earning less than Â£10,000 can ask their employer to enrol them. Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money blog, said the move was still inadequate in solving a long-term pension crisis for the young. She said that school leavers, facing a ""storm of financial pressures"", should have the same National Living Wage as those aged 25 and over, if they were expected to contribute into a pension. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The move will require legislation, as will the proposed other changes to the system including: Contributions calculated as a proportion of all earnings up to Â£45,000 (the threshold of the higher rate of tax) rather than the current system which calculates it as a proportion of earnings between Â£5,876 and Â£45,000. This will help those with multiple jobs Annual reviews of the trigger point for automatic enrolment (at present, when a worker earns Â£10,000 or more). Contribution levels will also be reviewed Exploring the use of technology to encourage the UK's 4.8 million self-employed people to save for retirement The proposals will cost employers an extra Â£1.4bn a year, and the government an extra Â£600m in tax relief a year. ""Requiring employers to contribute from the first pound of earnings, will mean that, by 2019, hundreds of thousands of small employers will have to pay up to Â£180 more per employee each year,"" said Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses. More than nine million people in the UK have been automatically enrolled into a pension so far, adding to the 10.8 million already contributing to a workplace pension. However,  the average proportion of earnings put into an investment-based defined contribution pension has fallen from about 9% of earnings before auto-enrolment, to 4% now. The DWP's review, led by industry representatives, estimated that 12 million people are not saving enough for their retirement, representing 38% of the working age population.

Gabart's new record has yet to be verified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council, which will check the ship's GPS data before confirming the result. Gabart celebrated aboard his trimaran as he reached port in Brest He crossed the finish line near the western limit of the English Channel at about 01:45 GMT, before turning his ship homeward. Capturing the drama just ahead of the finish, Gabart said in a video recorded in front of an on-board computer monitor: ""The little blue bit is us, the red line is the finish. We should cross it any time now, the computer says 30 seconds."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

I'm in the dark. There are cargo ships and fishing boats around me. It's a pretty weird atmosphere and at the same time it's pretty extraordinary... ""I'm proud and happy to have made this pretty voyage around the planet."" As he arrived in the town of Brest in France's north-west several hours later, his yacht was escorted into port by a host of local boats in celebration of his accomplishment. Gabart's success is partly down to good luck with weather, which can dramatically influence sailing speeds. FranÃ§ois Gabart spent 42 days alone on his ship AFP news agency reports that, while chasing the global speed record, Gabart broke several others for solo racing, including the fastest navigation of the Pacific and the longest distance covered in 24 hours - 1,575km (851 miles). But his 30m (98ft) boat was also custom-designed for the purpose, using the latest technology, and reached speeds of 35 knots (65km/h) during the journey, it said. Gabart posted photos and video on social media frequently during his 42 days at sea, sharing his sunset views or his success at fishing with fans. Allow Instagram content?

Well-known sailor Michel Desjoyeaux told the AFP news agency it was not surprising that Gabart had broken Coville's record. ""The one thing we can be sure of is that Francois has a faster boat than Thomas had and if they raced head-to-head then he would be faster,"" he said.

"This MoJ picture shows how small the phones - which are often smuggled internally - can be Online retailers should ban the sale of miniature mobile phones designed to be smuggled into prisons, the justice secretary has said. David Lidington said the devices were advertised as being able to go undetected by the body orifice security scanners used in England and Wales. ""Beat the BOSS"" phones can be bought for Â£25, but are reportedly changing hands for up to Â£500 inside jails. About 20,000 illicit phones and Sim cards were recovered by guards in 2016. It is estimated that up to a third of mobiles found are ""beat the BOSS"" phones, the Ministry of Justice says. Some as small as a lipstick, the mini mobiles are readily available from online marketplaces. They are marketed as being virtually metal-free and therefore able to beat the detectors anyone entering a prison must pass through. ""It's pretty clear that these miniature phones are being advertised and sold with the purpose of being smuggled,"" Mr Lidington will say in a speech on Monday. ""I am calling on online retailers and trading websites to take down products that are advertised to evade detection measures in prisons."" Why are mobile phones still in prisons? New tech to block phones in jails Mobile phones, which are banned in prisons, can be used to facilitate more crime and intimidate victims from behind bars, the Ministry of Justice says. It says it has invested Â£2m in detection equipment, including portable detection devices, which can be used to find mobiles in prisons. It is has also acquired new powers to block specific phones from accessing communications networks. Mini phones are listed for sale on websites including Amazon, Gumtree and eBay. EBay said it had made the decision to stop selling them some months ago and would make sure the justice secretary was aware it was ""already going above and beyond"" ahead of his intervention. The firm said it would continue to manually remove any items that slip through. The BBC has also contacted Amazon and Gumtree for comment. Just as those of us ""on the outside"" can't live without our phones, in prison they have become ubiquitous, prized possessions. They are used to organise the lives of inmates intent on continuing illegal activity, be that the smuggling of contraband into prisons or ongoing criminal activities outside. Prison staff can't listen to mobile phone calls as they do legitimate calls that prisoners make to their families. Mini phones like those worrying the justice secretary were among the material seized froma gang recently jailed for smuggling Â£1m of prohibited items into jails. And they're even harder for prisons to stamp out because they can be hidden inside people's bodies - hence the need for body orifice - or BOSS - scanners.

"The prime minister has said the government is ""proving the doubters wrong"" with its Brexit negotiations. EU leaders agreed talks can move on to the next stage in the new year, shortly after Theresa Maysuffered her first Commons defeaton Brexit. Writing in two Sunday papers, she vowed she would ""not be derailed"" from securing an ""ambitious"" deal. Labour's Diane Abbott told the BBC the Brexit negotiations were ""a mess"" and were causing concern. Writing inthe Sunday Telegraph,externalandSunday Express,external, Mrs May said the last 10 days had ""marked a watershed"" in the Brexit process and that the government would now ""begin to build that new, deep and special partnership"" with the EU. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external ""This is the exciting part of the negotiations and there is no limit on our ambition and creativity,"" she said. She said talks would now start on the implementation period for Brexit and the future of trading relationships. ""Amid all the noise, we are getting on with the job,"" she added. UK must not be EU 'colony' after Brexit Move to head off another Tory rebellion Reality Check: Guidelines for the next stage of talks Cabinet ministers are due to discuss their stance on the relationship they want with the EU - the UK's ""end state"" - in the coming days, but some ministers are thought to favour a closer alignment than others. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson,  who was a leading voice in the referendum Leave campaign,has argued that the UK cannot mirror EU law in the long term,external. TheEU's guidelines for phase two of the negotiations,externalsay the UK would ""continue to participate in the customs union and the single market during the transition"" - a period of up to two years after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 - and remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Mr Johnson said if the UK ended up being forced to mirror EU laws ""we would have gone from being a member state to a vassal state"". This video can not be played Diane Abbott says she does not want a second referendum on a final Brexit deal He said the UK needed ""something new and ambitious, which allows zero tariffs and frictionless trade"" but maintains the freedom to ""decide our own regulatory framework and own laws"". Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke said any final trade deal between the UK and EU must ""maximise"" access to the EU market. ""We are not looking for an EEA-type (European Economic Area) arrangement so that, essentially, it's continuity as far as the end state is concerned,"" he said. ""But it is also important that we maximise our access to the European markets, that is really important to the UK."" Lib Dem Leader Sir Vince Cable told BBC Radio 5live it was difficult to say where the prime minister stood on what the UK's final ""end state"" relationship with the EU would be. He told Pienaar's Politics that his impression, in his five years working with Mrs May during the 2010-2015 coalition government, when she was home secretary, was that she was ""not terribly interested in economic matters"". He added that that ""makes her quite difficult to place"" on whether she would prefer a close single market-type arrangement, the so-called Norway model, or a ""more distant"" variant like Canada. ""I've no idea how she would react to that because she was preoccupied, I would say, obsessed with, immigration as an issue and that was her job"". Meanwhile, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was asked whether Labour would back a Norway-style deal for the UK. Norway is not in the EU but has access to the single market, in return for a financial contribution and accepting the majority of EU laws. She said Labour was ""not conducting this negotiation"" but it would not back anything ""that damages jobs and the economy"". Pressed on whether the UK may have to make payments to get access to the single market, she replied: ""We may have to do so, but we have to see how the Tories' negotiations go"". The prime minister lost in the Commons earlier this week when MPs - including 11 from her own party - voted to give Parliament a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. Following the vote, there were calls for the Tory rebels to be deselected by the party and some received death threats. Tory peers Baroness Altmann and Baroness Wheatcroft havewritten in the Observer,externalthat such threats ""are worrying symptoms of the toxic atmosphere which has been created in our country"" and the Lords would be ""unlikely to be receptive to bullying over a restricted timetable or vigorous whipping to toe the party line"". But former chancellor Ken Clarke, who was among the 11 rebels, said reports of de-selection threats were ""all nonsense"". ""I think it's caused by all the rubbish that keeps appearing in the right-wing newspapers, which have completely lost their heads over the whole thing,"" he said.

"Nine Boeing P-8A maritime patrol aircraft are among the vehicles the MoD is due to purchase Plans to buy new military equipment - including warships and jets - could be under threat, as MPs expressed ""serious doubts"" over whether the Ministry of Defence can afford them. TheCommons Defence Select Committee says,externalthe department will struggle to find the Â£7.3bn in savings required to pay for the new hardware. It said the MoD had proved ""incapable"" of making such savings in the past. The MoD said it was making ""good progress"" on its efficiency target. This latest report echoesa warning from Januaryof this year from government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office. The cross-party committee of MPs backed the findings of the NAO that the defence equipment plan was at ""greater risk"" than at any time since 2012. What was included in the 2015 defence review? UK shipyards: Five frigates at centre of new strategy Royal Navy could lose 'fight on beaches' ships in planned cuts In 2016, the government pledged to spend Â£178bn on new military equipment over the next 10 years. But that is on the assumption it can also find Â£7.3bn of efficiency savings - on top of Â£7.1bn previously announced -  by selling off property and other efficiencies. The committee chairman, Conservative MP Julian Lewis, said this was now ""extremely doubtful"" from an ""already stretched budget"". ""This will inevitably lead either to a reduction in the numbers of ships, aircraft and vehicles or to even greater delays in their acquisition,"" he added. But the MoD said that in the face of ""intensifying threats"", its Â£178bn equipment plan ""continues to deliver the cutting-edge kit to keep the UK safe"". The new equipment covered by the plan includes eight Type 26 frigates for the Royal Navy, new mechanised infantry vehicles and nine Boeing P-8A maritime patrol aircraft. Eight Type 26 frigates will be bought by the MoD as part of its Â£178bn equipment plan The committee also called for clarity on the ""difference between genuine improvements and efficiency"" and cuts to ""personnel, equipment and capability"".

"It is the first time anyone has been charged under Australia's Weapons of Mass Destruction Act A man has been arrested in Sydney for allegedly acting as an economic agent for North Korea, Australian Federal Police (AFP) have said. Chan Han Choi, 59, has been charged with brokering illegal exports from the country and discussing the supply of weapons of mass destruction. Police allege he has broken both UN and Australian sanctions. The case against the suspect, who has lived in Australia for more than 30 years, is a first for the country. Never before has someone been charged under the country's 1995 Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act. Police say there was evidence that Chan Han Choi had been in contact with ""high ranking officials in North Korea"". North Korea crisis in 300 words Nine charts that tell you all you need to know about North Korea They allege he had brokered services related to North Korea's weapons programme, including the sale of specialist services including ballistic missile technology to foreign entities, in order to generate income for the North Korean regime. Chan Han Choi also was charged with brokering the sale of coal from North Korea to groups in Indonesia and Vietnam. He is facing six charges in total after being arrested at his home on Saturday night. The arrest was made in the Eastwood area of Sydney on Saturday In a Sunday news conference, police confirmed the man was a naturalised Australian citizen of Korean origin who had been in the country for over 30 years. They described him as a ""loyal agent"" who ""believed he was acting to serve some higher patriotic purpose"". But police insisted the man's actions did not pose any ""direct risk"" to Australians, with the actions occurring offshore. ""I know these charges sound alarming. Let me be clear we are not suggesting there are any weapons or missile component that ever came to Australian soil,"" AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said. ""Any individual who attempts to fly in the face of sanctions cannot and will not go unnoticed in Australia."" The suspect could face up to 10 years in prison and has been denied bail. In Octoberthe Australian government said they had received a letter from North Korea urging Canberra to distance itself from the Trump administration. Pyongyang had previously warned that Australia would ""not be able to avoid a disaster"" if it followed US policies towards Kim Jong-un's regime.

"The area in Chile's lake district is sparsely populated A landslide caused by torrential rain has killed at least five people in southern Chile and has destroyed dozens of houses. Fifteen people are missing in the remote village of Villa Santa LucÃ­a in the country's lake region, popular with tourists. President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency in the area. Thousands remain without electricity and cut off from the rest of Chile. ""I have ordered rescue workers to put all the resources necessary towards protecting the people of Villa Santa Lucia,"" said Ms Bachelet. Most of the village was destroyed by the landslide Part of the valley where the village lies, some 1,100km (690 miles) south of the capital, Santiago, was engulfed by a huge amount of mud from surrounding mountains. Local media reported that the region had experienced unusually heavy rain for the previous 24 hours. Dozens of people have been airlifted and taken to the neighbouring town of ChaitÃ©n. Rescue teams are searching for survivors. The village is near Corcovado National Park, popular with tourists for its volcanoes, fjords and forests. The mud has blocked roads linking the area to the rest of Chile The mudslide happened on Saturday morning, on the eve of therun-off election to choose Chile's next president. The authorities say the vote is going ahead as planned. Some 14 million Chileans are eligible to choose between the centre-right candidate, SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, and Alejandro Guillier, who is endorsed by Ms Bachelet.

"The two contenders are Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa Votes are being counted in a leadership election for South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC), currently run by President Jacob Zuma. About 5,000 delegates cast their votes in a bitterly fought race between Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ex-minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Emotions have run high, with delegates shouting each other down as they raised objections over voting rules. The ANC has governed South Africa since it attained democracy 23 years ago. Read the latest developments here Who are the main candidates? The eventual winner will be in a strong position to become national president after elections in 2019. But the leadership battle has caused fierce political infighting, raising fears the party may split before then. It has not been speedy. It had been hoped a result could come on Sunday but the voting only got under way in the early hours of Monday and went on through the night. This video can not be played The ANC was the party of Nelson Mandela but have people lost faith under Jacob Zuma? More than 4,700 delegates are at the four-day ANC elective conference at the Expo Centre in Johannesburg and they are not just voting for a leader, but for five other top posts. Accusations of bogus delegates being given accreditation have not helped matters. Nevertheless, the ANC was able to confirm at about midday local time (10:00 GMT) on Monday that voting had ended and counting had begun, with a result to be announced later in the day. Cyril Ramaphosa is one of the country's wealthiest men and a former leading trade unionist. He led the talks in the 1990s to end apartheid rule, before turning to a business career. The 65-year-old has spoken out strongly against state corruption and for re-energising the economy. This video can not be played What advice should South Africa's ruling party take on board? For this, he has the backing of the business community. Party chief whip Jackson Mthembu took to Twitter to say he had voted for Mr Ramaphosa, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, 68, is Mr Zuma's ex-wife and has his support. A veteran politician, she has been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businessesand has vowed to tackle what she says is continuing racial inequality. She served as Nelson Mandela's health minister, bringing in laws banning smoking in public areas, and later as foreign minister. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula tweeted that he had voted for her. It would seem so. Many are saying there could be just the smallest of margins between winning and losing, says the BBC's Lebo Diseko at the conference. There was a fractious atmosphere as delegates disputed voting procedures The leadership contest is also conducted in secret, and legal challenges are possible. Early rumours of a modest Ramaphosa lead were quickly reflected by a rise in the financial markets. But correspondents say there was a lot of singing in support of Ms Dlamini-Zuma on Sunday, and not much for Mr Ramaphosa. Whoever wins would be a massive favourite for the 2019 presidential elections. Why ANC leadership vote matters The trials of Jacob Zuma The outcome also matters hugely to the future of the ANC. Mr Zuma is expected to stay as president until the 2019 election, despite the vote Mr Zuma, who has been in power since 2009, has himself warned that the party is under threat and at a ""crossroads"". In his final speech as party leader at Saturday's conference opening, Mr Zuma denounced the party's ""petty squabbling"" during the leadership battle. The party has overwhelmingly won every election since the country moved to democracy in 1994 under Mr Mandela. But Mr Zuma said last year's disappointing results in local elections, when it polled only 54%, ""were a stark reminder that our people are not happy with the state of the ANC"". The BBC's Andrew Harding says a question remains whether the party is in terminal decline, and what that might mean for South Africa's stability and its future.

"A taxi driver and two passengers were among those killed in the crash in Birmingham Six people have been killed in a ""horrific"" crash in Birmingham. Three vehicles were involved in the accident on Belgrave Middleway, near Edgbaston, at about 01:00 GMT. Three men in one car died at the scene and a fourth is critically injured in hospital. The driver of a taxi and his two passengers were also killed. West Midlands Police described dealing with the wreckage as ""very difficult and upsetting"" and said officers were investigating how the crash happened. Three vehicles were involved in the accident on Belgrave Middleway, while another three were damaged trying to avoid it The road has been closed and police have appealed for witnesses. The first car in the crash had suffered extensive damage but, ""astonishingly"", the man and the woman inside managed to get out with relatively minor injuries, an ambulance service spokesman said. ""The second vehicle, a black cab, was on its side. Sadly, there was nothing that could be done to save the driver and he was confirmed dead at the scene."" The taxi driver has been named locally as father of six Imtiaz Mohammed, who worked for Castle Cars. The female passenger was also confirmed dead at the scene, while her male companion died at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. This video can not be played Officers were dealing with ""a very harrowing scene"", Supt Sean Phillips said There were four men in the third car, and all had been thrown from the vehicle, the ambulance spokesman said. ""Tragically, three of them were confirmed dead at the scene."" The fourth was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and is in a critical condition. Blue tents can be seen where forensic teams are working Police are working to reopen Belgrave and Lee Bank Middleway by Monday morning Three other cars were caught up in the crash and suffered minor damage trying to avoid it. Michelle Brotherton, from the ambulance service, said her staff had dealt with 13 patients in total. As well as those who died and the man in a critical condition, four people were taken to Heartlands Hospital where their condition is believed to be non-life threatening. A further two patients were ""discharged on scene"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Supt Sean Phillips said the police officer in charge of the investigation had described the wreckage as ""very harrowing"". He said it was ""too early"" to speculate on the cause of the accident. ""It will take some time to unpick and just understand exactly what's happened. It would be unfair for me to speculate at this time,"" he said. He confirmed the road had been gritted at 17:00 GMT the previous evening. Metres of police cordon tape and a number of vehicles have been used to seal off the road, and blue forensic tents can be seen below in the underpass. The cordon stretches at least 100 metres either side of the Middleway and I can see numerous police officers. As locals find out what happened, they all say how tragic it is that six people should die so close to Christmas. It is not yet known what caused the crash, but people are telling me there has long been a problem with speeding and racing on this road and the adjoining Bristol Street. A car involved in a separate crash nearby just a week ago is still on the side of the road. The accident happened below the underpass on the A38/Bristol Road, where Belgrave Middleway meets Lee Bank Middleway. The stretch of road from Islington Row to Bristol Street has been closed and is likely to remain so throughout Sunday, police said. The wreckage was described by police as ""harrowing"" One resident who lives opposite said she woke at about 02:00 and saw the emergency crews. ""This road is really dangerous. Young kids like to challenge themselves and go really fast,"" she said. ""I can't believe six people have died, and so close to Christmas and New Year."" The road has two lanes either side and a 40mph speed limit. Police have said it ""will take some time to unpick"" what caused the crash Area Commander Jason Campbell, of West Midlands Fire Service, described it as a ""horrific"" incident. He said the crash site was complex and ""spread over some distance"". Any witnesses have been asked to contact West Midlands Police. Allow Twitter content?

"The European Council has said that Brexit talks can enter the second phase following last week's agreement. As a result it haspublished its guidelines,externalfor the next stage of talks. Here are some of the key phrases from that document. Don't forget that there are plenty of crucial details that still need to be resolved before negotiations on a withdrawal agreement come to an end. That means the financial settlement, citizens' rights and of course, the Irish border. Sufficient progress is not the end of the story, but the text also makes it clear that there will be a concerted effort to lock in what has been agreed so far - and that if the EU detects any reluctance or backsliding from the UK then that will have a negative effect on discussions about the future. Theresa May has already agreed that a transition of about two years will take place under existing EU rules and regulations, but the EU's text makes crystal clear what it believes that means. The UK will have to accept all EU law (that's what the acquis means) including new laws passed during the transition itself. But it will no longer have a seat at the table when those laws are made. To put it brutally - the UK will, for a while, become a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. Both sides talk of a strictly time-limited transition period, so there doesn't appear to be much appetite at the moment for extending it. Quite what happens if a future trade deal isn't ready by the end of the transition, a scenario many experts think is quite possible, will have to be debated in the future. During the transition, the UK will have to accept the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and all four freedoms - including the freedom of movement of people. The EU says the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union during a transition, while the UK insists that it will leave both on Brexit day. This could become a semantic argument, because by accepting all rules and regulations - in other words, the status quo - the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union whether it likes it or not. The British government has suggested that some things - like dispute resolution mechanisms - could change during the transition as agreement is made on future co-operation. But there's little appetite in the EU for that - in its view, you're either in or you're out. The EU 27 stress that they want a close partnership with the UK in the future, but here they are setting out the limits of what they could mean. The further away the UK wants to be from the rules and regulations of the single market the less access it will have - there is no such thing as partial membership. This gets us back to the unresolved debate about what ""full alignment"" at the Irish border really means in practice. The phrase ""preserve a level playing field"" is important too. The EU is anxious to ensure that the UK doesn't try to undercut the EU in any way by having looser regulations in certain key areas, and, if it does, then there will be consequences. EU negotiators won't have the authority to start discussions with the UK on future relations (including trade and also things like security and foreign policy) until another set of guidelines is adopted in March 2018. That gives the two sides not much more than six months to agree the text of a broad political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship. The EU hopes to get that finalised by October 2018, but it emphasises that formal trade negotiations can only begin after the UK has left the EU. Informal contacts on what the future might look like are probably taking place already, but the EU is still waiting for greater clarity from London about what exactly the UK government hopes to achieve in the long term. The UK is trying to be as ambitious as possible about what can be done before Brexit actually happens. The EU, though, emphasises that trade talks will have to continue long after the UK has left.

"This video can not be played Who waltzed off with the Strictly glitterball? Former Holby City actor Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones have lifted the glitterball trophy and been crowned Strictly Come Dancing champions. The pair beat finalists Alexandra Burke, Gemma Atkinson and Debbie McGee and their partners after each couple had danced three times. The Glaswegian, 42, said he had not expected to win ""in a million years"". The final was watched by 13.1 million viewers at its peak, with an average audience of 11.6 million. McFadden, who won the public vote, is the oldest champion of the show, which was in its 15th series. ""It feels completely surreal and I'm so in awe of everyone who started all of those weeks ago,"" he said. He called Jones an ""amazing woman"", adding ""thank you for sticking with me and persevering"". His partner Jones said: ""You did it, you are so brilliant."" Joe McFadden: Child star to dance champion How Strictly has changed finalists' lives Reality Check: Did we predict the finalists? Why some men won't dance Behind the scenes at Blackpool Joe McFadden is the 15th winner of Strictly It was a grand final which featured top-scoring dances from three of the four contestants - only Atkinson missed out. McFadden and Jones performed the final dance of the series, a Charleston, and claimed a perfect score of 40. He finished second on the leaderboard, one point behind singer Burke, with McGee and Atkinson third and fourth respectively, but topped the public vote. Following his final dance, head judge Shirley Ballas said: ""You've done things I never thought you would be able to do. You have truly turned into a magnificent dancer."" Jones was competing in only her second series after finishing sixth last year with former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who tweeted his congratulations following her victory. He hailed his former partner as a ""genius"" and described McFadden as ""brilliant"". Prime Minister Theresa May also tweeted her congratulations to McFadden, along with commiserations to McGee, who lives in her constituency in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Allow Twitter content?

The oldest person to have won previously was BBC presenter Chris Hollins in 2009, at the age of 38. There was a 50/50 chance that this year's winner would be the oldest contestant to be crowned in the show's history with 59-year-old McGee, widow of magician Paul Daniels, also in the final. The star-studded final narrowly missed out on matching last year's viewing figures, which peaked at 13.3 million. Alexandra Burke topped the leaderboard with partner Gorka after two perfect scores in the final During the final, each duo performed a showdance - where there were no rules and contestants were allowed to perform any moves they chose. They also revisited the judges' favourite dance of theirs from the series, as well as their own personal favourite, which was only revealed on the night. Former X Factor winner Burke has impressed the judges throughout the series. Her American smooth set the tone for the night, scoring four 10s, and judge Craig Revel Horwood joked that it was ""absolutely dreadful because I couldn't find a single thing wrong with the routine"".

"The victim was hit on a pedestrian crossing on the South Circular Road Five drivers who may have been involved in a hit-and-run which killed a woman in south London have all been traced. The 29-year-old Polish national was hit by a lorry on a pedestrian crossing on Norwood Road, Tulse Hill, on Monday. It is thought she was then struck by another lorry and up to three cars. None of the drivers stopped at the crash site, the Met said. The identity of the victim, who was staying in Wandsworth, has not yet been released. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple injuries. The 49-year-old driver of the first lorry was interviewed under caution earlier in the week. The driver of the second car - a 52-year-old man - was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and released under investigation. Police said the drivers of the first car and second lorry have now been spoken to, as has the driver of a third car which officers believe may also have struck the woman. None of the three have been arrested. The force is appealing for witnesses to the crash, which happened at about 06:50 GMT and when the lights were on green. Acting Det Sgt Alastair Middleton, said: ""Even though we have traced all the vehicles that we believe were involved, I continue to appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision and the moments afterwards to contact us immediately. ""We are particularly interested in any dashcam footage that may have captured some of the incident before or after the collision.""

Former Holby City actor Joe McFadden and his partner Katya Jones have lifted the glitterball trophy and been crowned Strictly Come Dancing champions. The pair beat finalists Alexandra Burke, Gemma Atkinson and Debbie McGee and their partners after each couple had danced three times. The Glaswegian, 42, said he had not expected to win ""in a million years"". The final was watched by 13.1 million viewers at its peak, with an average audience of 11.6 million. McFadden, who won the public vote, is the oldest champion of the show, which was in its 15th series. ""It feels completely surreal and I'm so in awe of everyone who started all of those weeks ago,"" he said. He called Jones an ""amazing woman"", adding ""thank you for sticking with me and persevering"". His partner Jones said: ""You did it, you are so brilliant."" Joe McFadden: Child star to dance champion How Strictly has changed finalists' lives Reality Check: Did we predict the finalists? Why some men won't dance Behind the scenes at Blackpool Joe McFadden is the 15th winner of Strictly It was a grand final which featured top-scoring dances from three of the four contestants - only Atkinson missed out. McFadden and Jones performed the final dance of the series, a Charleston, and claimed a perfect score of 40. He finished second on the leaderboard, one point behind singer Burke, with McGee and Atkinson third and fourth respectively, but topped the public vote. Following his final dance, head judge Shirley Ballas said: ""You've done things I never thought you would be able to do. You have truly turned into a magnificent dancer."" Jones was competing in only her second series after finishing sixth last year with former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who tweeted his congratulations following her victory. He hailed his former partner as a ""genius"" and described McFadden as ""brilliant"". Prime Minister Theresa May also tweeted her congratulations to McFadden, along with commiserations to McGee, who lives in her constituency in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Allow Twitter content?

The oldest person to have won previously was BBC presenter Chris Hollins in 2009, at the age of 38. There was a 50/50 chance that this year's winner would be the oldest contestant to be crowned in the show's history with 59-year-old McGee, widow of magician Paul Daniels, also in the final. The star-studded final narrowly missed out on matching last year's viewing figures, which peaked at 13.3 million. Alexandra Burke topped the leaderboard with partner Gorka after two perfect scores in the final During the final, each duo performed a showdance - where there were no rules and contestants were allowed to perform any moves they chose. They also revisited the judges' favourite dance of theirs from the series, as well as their own personal favourite, which was only revealed on the night. Former X Factor winner Burke has impressed the judges throughout the series. Her American smooth set the tone for the night, scoring four 10s, and judge Craig Revel Horwood joked that it was ""absolutely dreadful because I couldn't find a single thing wrong with the routine"". Debbie McGee was the oldest contestant remaining in the contest McGee scored a perfect 40 with her final performance of the night, an Argentine tango, and was praised by judge Bruno Tonioli for being an inspiration to an older generation.

"Nine Boeing P-8A maritime patrol aircraft are among the vehicles the MoD is due to purchase Plans to buy new military equipment - including warships and jets - could be under threat, as MPs expressed ""serious doubts"" over whether the Ministry of Defence can afford them. TheCommons Defence Select Committee says,externalthe department will struggle to find the Â£7.3bn in savings required to pay for the new hardware. It said the MoD had proved ""incapable"" of making such savings in the past. The MoD said it was making ""good progress"" on its efficiency target. This latest report echoesa warning from Januaryof this year from government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office. The cross-party committee of MPs backed the findings of the NAO that the defence equipment plan was at ""greater risk"" than at any time since 2012. What was included in the 2015 defence review? UK shipyards: Five frigates at centre of new strategy Royal Navy could lose 'fight on beaches' ships in planned cuts In 2016, the government pledged to spend Â£178bn on new military equipment over the next 10 years. But that is on the assumption it can also find Â£7.3bn of efficiency savings - on top of Â£7.1bn previously announced -  by selling off property and other efficiencies. The committee chairman, Conservative MP Julian Lewis, said this was now ""extremely doubtful"" from an ""already stretched budget"". ""This will inevitably lead either to a reduction in the numbers of ships, aircraft and vehicles or to even greater delays in their acquisition,"" he added. But the MoD said that in the face of ""intensifying threats"", its Â£178bn equipment plan ""continues to deliver the cutting-edge kit to keep the UK safe"". The new equipment covered by the plan includes eight Type 26 frigates for the Royal Navy, new mechanised infantry vehicles and nine Boeing P-8A maritime patrol aircraft. Eight Type 26 frigates will be bought by the MoD as part of its Â£178bn equipment plan The committee also called for clarity on the ""difference between genuine improvements and efficiency"" and cuts to ""personnel, equipment and capability"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has already beenwarned of a Tory revoltover cuts to army numbers and naval capability, and suggested he will be asking the chancellor for more money. The Cabinet Office is currently carrying out a defence and security review which is due to report by the end of the year.

"President Trump has been critical of the investigation and denies any wrongdoing A lawyer for a group set up to help Donald Trump's transition to the White House has accused special counsel Robert Mueller of unlawfully obtaining thousands of emails. Kory Langhofer made the comments in a letter to congressional committees. But a spokesperson for Mr Mueller said the ""appropriate criminal process"" had been followed. Mr Mueller is investigating allegations of collusion between Mr Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. Mr Langhofer works for the Trump for America (TFA) group. It used the facilities, including email hosting, of a government agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), in the period between Donald Trump's election in November 2016 and inauguration in January. In his letter, Mr Langhofer, says GSA staff ""unlawfully produced TFA's private materials, including privileged communications, to the special counsel's office"". Read the letter in full,external The GSA, he complains, ""did not own or control the records in question"" and the constitutional rights of transition officials were violated. Mr Langhofer goes on to ask Congress to act to protect future presidential transitions from having ""private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives"". The emails obtained reportedly involve 13 Trump transition officials, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI earlier this month. Why attacks on Robert Mueller are mounting A spokesperson for Mr Mueller said they had done nothing wrong. ""When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process,"" Peter Carr said.

GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt has denied another of Mr Langhofer's accusations, that the GSA assured that requests for Trump transition records would go through the group's lawyers. He told BuzzFeed that the transition group knew materials would have to be provided to law enforcement ""therefore, no expectation of privacy can be assumed"".,external Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell tweeted that the accusations were ""another attempt to discredit Mueller as his #TrumpRussia probe tightens"". US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to tip the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump - a charge denied by both Russia and the US president. Mr Trump has called Mr Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt""while other Republicans accuse it of bias.

In October, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his business associate Rick Gates were accused of conspiring to defraud the US in dealings with Ukraine. Both deny the charges, which centre on relations with a former Ukrainian president who was very close to Russia. On Friday, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, said he feared Republican members wanted to shut down their own investigation.

"Women could take a second pill at home away from medical supervision Anti-abortion campaigners claim they have ""no alternative"" but to mount a legal challenge if the Scottish government approves plans for women to take abortion medication at home. The Society of the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC), said it had already sought legal advice. It said it had been assured ""a good chance of success"". The Scottish government said it had worked hard to ensure women could always access clinically-safe services. In October the chief medical officer told health boardsthe drug misoprostol could be taken outside a clinical setting. Dr Catherine Calderwood said it was ""significant progress"" that women in Scotland who are up to nine weeks pregnant could take the second dose of the drug at home if they wanted, saying this would allow them ""more privacy, more dignity"". Campaign groups including Engender, Amnesty Scotland and Rape Crisis Scotland welcomed the move, while Prof Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) described it as ""admirable"". Misoprostol is sold under the brand name Cytotec, among others But the SPUC's John Deighan claimed that the potential health risks for women were ""horrific"". He said: ""There would be no medical oversight and this development will result in dreadful threats to women's health."" SPUC said it had received detailed legal advice from an advocate who specialises in human rights cases, who said that under the law the medication could not be taken without some form of medical supervision. The advocate stated: ""In my view, the taking of the abortifacient drugs must be done under the supervision either of a registered medical practitioner, or by some other suitable member of staff who is acting under the control of a medical practitioner. ""It cannot be done by a patient unsupervised, at home or elsewhere."" He added: ""As the approval anticipates the patient administering the drug to herself without medical supervision, that approval proceeds upon a misdirection as to the requirements of the 1967 Act, and is accordingly unlawful."" The tablet will be given out at a clinic but can be taken at home Mr Deighan added: ""Our advice is clear and we really have no alternative but to challenge these proposals which go to the core of our beliefs in the right to life for unborn children and the health and wellbeing of their mothers."" The government plans are not a change to abortion law but to powers available within the Abortion Act 1967. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We've worked hard to ensure women are always able to access clinically safe services. ""Scotland is the only part of the UK to offer women the opportunity to take misoprostol at home, when this is clinically appropriate, a decision that allows women to be in control of their treatment and as comfortable as possible during this procedure.""

"Firefighters are dropping red flame retardant to try to quench the flames Authorities in California have issued new evacuation orders as a huge wildfire flares up again in Santa Barbara County. Meteorologists said fresh northerly winds were likely to drive the flames from the fire - named Thomas - towards the Pacific coast. The blaze, the state's third largest on record, has now burnt almost 1,000 sq km (405 sq miles) since 4 December. Two people are reported to have died as a result of the fire. Fire apparatus engineer Cory Iverson was killed tackling the blaze last week, along with a woman, Virginia Rae Pesola, who was in a car crash as she evacuated. Governor brands fires 'new normal' Sentinel satellite tracks wildfire smoke plume The resurgence of strong ""sundowner"" winds combined with low humidity forecast for Sunday could fuel the flames and has prompted new mandatory evacuation orders for several Santa Barbara communities, including hillside homes in Montecito and Summerland.

"Sebastian Kurz (R) has agreed a coalition deal with far-right party leader Heinz-Christian Strache The far-right Freedom Party has secured the key posts of foreign, interior and defence in Austria's new coalition government for its nominees. Governing with the conservative People's Party, the move makes Austria the only country in Western Europe to have a far-right party in power. Austria's president approved the new coalition on Saturday, two months after inconclusive elections. People's Party leader Sebastian Kurz, 31, will be Austria's new chancellor. He will become the world's youngest head of government. What propels young leaders to power? Introducing the new government, and the 180-page document setting out its agenda, Mr Kurz said the two parties had agreed ""on a clear pro-European outlook"". Although it is the junior coalition partner, the anti-immigration Freedom Party has secured several key posts in the new cabinet. Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache will be vice-chancellor. His party colleagues will run the interior, defence and health and social security ministries. The new foreign minister will be Middle East expert and writer Karin Kneissl, who is not a Freedom Party member but was nominated by the party. Mr Kurz's People Party won 32% of the vote in October's elections, securing the largest number of seats (62) in the 183-seat national council. The Freedom Party came third, securing 26% of the vote and 51 seats. At the request of Austria's president, the posts of justice minister and interior minister would not be held by the same party, Mr Kurz said. The chancellor-designate was quick to retweet congratulations from his fellow youthful conservative prime minister, Ireland's Leo Varadkar. Allow Twitter content?

Analysis byBethany Bell, BBC News, Vienna Unlike most of Europe's populist parties, the Freedom Party, a major player in Austria for years, has managed to translate its success at the ballot box into real political power. That's reflected in the key posts that it has secured in this government: the interior, defence and foreign ministries. The opposition has expressed concern that the police and the security apparatus are now all firmly in the hands of the Freedom Party. In recent years, the party has toned down some of its more extreme rhetoric. But many analysts believe that, in or out of government, it has helped set a right-wing agenda, not just in Austria - but in other countries across Europe as well. When the far-right Freedom Party last entered a coalition in Austria in 2000, its fellow EU member states froze bilateral diplomatic relations in response. They were lifted months later, and such measures are unlikely to happen again, as resurgent right-wing populist groups have been promoting anti-immigration and Eurosceptic agendas across much of the EU. But unlike the Freedom Party, those other parties have struggled to convert electoral success into real power: Earlier this year, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front party lost the French presidential election comprehensively. Ms Le Pen was defeated by Emmanuel Macron, a liberal centrist and strong supporter of the European Union Elsewhere, the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party of Geert Wilders was defeated by liberal leader Mark Rutte In Germany, the nationalist and populist right of Alternative for Germany (AfD) gained seats in the national parliament, where it is now the third biggest party, but it is not in the frame for coalition talks Chancellor:Sebastian Kurz, People's Party. The 31-year-old was foreign minister in the outgoing Austrian government. Interior minister:Herbert Kickl, Freedom Party. The party's general secretary and campaign director, 49, was a speechwriter for the late party leader JÃ¶rg Haider and is a close confidant of the current leader, Heinz-Christian Strache. Foreign minister:Karin Kneissl, nominated by the Freedom Party but not a member. The former foreign ministry employee and Middle East expert, 52, speaks eight languages and is not afraid of controversy, according to Austrian media.

"It looks simple - a pretty blue cornflower - but this plant is causing controversy in Austria.   It's the chosen flower of the far-right Freedom Party, even though it was once associated with the Nazis. Dieter Dorner takes a long sip of hisGemischtes, a mix of dark beer and lager, and smiles. We are sitting in an inn in Untersiebenbrunn, a little town east of Vienna, where he is a councillor for the far-right Freedom Party. Over a meal of sausage, chips and locally grown white asparagus, he tells me about a planned dance. In true Austrian fashion, it's to be a ball - the local Freedom party's first Cornflower Ball,Der Kornblumenball. ""We've never had a Freedom Party Ball in Untersiebenbrunn before,"" he explains. ""So we said to ourselves, let's do something, let's have a ball. The band will play dance music. My favourite is the slow waltz."" A poster for the Austrian Freedom Party's Cornflower Ball The ball was arranged last September, but the timing is felicitous, because these days the Freedom Party in Untersiebenbrunn has a lot to celebrate. In the first round of voting in Austria's presidential election in April, 53% of people here voted for the Freedom Party candidate, Norbert Hofer. Dotted through the town's leafy streets are the blue Freedom Party campaign placards and posters for the Kornblumenball, featuring a silhouette of a dancing couple in evening dress. ""Hasn't there been some controversy about the blue cornflower?"" I ask. ""Something to do with the Nazis?"" Dieter shakes his head. ""The cornflower is simply the Freedom Party flower and we like it,"" he says. ""To discuss what happened 80 years ago, or what didn't happen or perhaps happened doesn't bring us forward. There is certainly nothing deliberately nasty about it."" From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 But other Austrians are not so sure. ""The cornflower is a complicated symbol,"" Vienna historian, Bernhard Weidinger, tells me. ""It was the German Kaiser Wilhelm's favourite flower, and was used by pan-German nationalists in the 19th Century. ""Then between 1934 and 1938, when the Nazis were a banned party in Austria, it was the secret symbol they used to wear in order to recognise each other."" Austrian Freedom Party members Heinz Christian Strache and Martin Graf, 2008 Nowadays, it's traditional for Austrian MPs to wear a flower in their buttonholes at the opening of parliament, he explains. The colour of the Freedom Party is blue, so they wear a cornflower. ""You are not a neo-Nazi if you wear a cornflower,"" he continues. ""But it is fair to say that the Freedom Party cultivates a certain ambivalence when it comes to the past."" Their presidential hopeful, Norbert Hofer, continues to face sharp criticism about his occasional choice of floral decoration. In response to a question last week, he declared that he wanted nothing to do with the Nazis, and wouldn't let them take away things like the cornflower. Latin name:Centaurea cyanus,also known as bachelor's buttons Native to the Mediterranean and Europe National flower of Estonia Worn in France as a ""le bleuet"" a symbol of remembrance akin to the poppy in the UK The Freedom Party has moved on a long way from the heyday of its firebrand leader, Joerg Haider, who died in a car crash in 2008. Back in the 1980s and 90s, Haider openly praised aspects of the Third Reich. These days, Freedom Party members who veer in that direction are quickly silenced or removed from their posts. A day or so later I fall into conversation with a young man called Michael, in a park in Vienna. It's a balmy spring evening, the chestnut trees are in bloom, and in the distance a jazz band is playing a free concert on an open-air podium. ""What do you think about the Freedom Party and the cornflower?"" I ask. ""I hate those people,"" he replies. ""And the cornflower isn't great. But you know, I'm not quite as worried about their attitude towards the past as I am about their attitude to what's going on now. Their barely-concealed racism, their rhetoric against Muslims and refugees is really wrong."" A demonstrator at an anti-Hofer rally in Vienna holds up an image of the cornflower He looks around at a family playing with their well-groomed dogs. ""And the other thing that bothers me,"" he says, ""is that they are working on people's fears and encouraging our worst instincts. Like Donald Trump does. Austria is better off than most countries in the world. It's safe - and in general life is pretty good here. But to hear the Freedom Party talk, you'd think we were living in some desperately difficult country."" He shrugs. I think back to my conversation with Dieter in the comfortable little town of Untersiebenbrunn. I had asked him if the Freedom Party was deliberately stirring up fears to gain votes. ""We don't create people's concerns, we express them,"" he had said. ""We're worried about our future. When you have a lot, you also have a lot to lose.""

"The European Council has said that Brexit talks can enter the second phase following last week's agreement. As a result it haspublished its guidelines,externalfor the next stage of talks. Here are some of the key phrases from that document. Don't forget that there are plenty of crucial details that still need to be resolved before negotiations on a withdrawal agreement come to an end. That means the financial settlement, citizens' rights and of course, the Irish border. Sufficient progress is not the end of the story, but the text also makes it clear that there will be a concerted effort to lock in what has been agreed so far - and that if the EU detects any reluctance or backsliding from the UK then that will have a negative effect on discussions about the future. Theresa May has already agreed that a transition of about two years will take place under existing EU rules and regulations, but the EU's text makes crystal clear what it believes that means. The UK will have to accept all EU law (that's what the acquis means) including new laws passed during the transition itself. But it will no longer have a seat at the table when those laws are made. To put it brutally - the UK will, for a while, become a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. Both sides talk of a strictly time-limited transition period, so there doesn't appear to be much appetite at the moment for extending it. Quite what happens if a future trade deal isn't ready by the end of the transition, a scenario many experts think is quite possible, will have to be debated in the future. During the transition, the UK will have to accept the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and all four freedoms - including the freedom of movement of people. The EU says the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union during a transition, while the UK insists that it will leave both on Brexit day. This could become a semantic argument, because by accepting all rules and regulations - in other words, the status quo - the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union whether it likes it or not. The British government has suggested that some things - like dispute resolution mechanisms - could change during the transition as agreement is made on future co-operation. But there's little appetite in the EU for that - in its view, you're either in or you're out. The EU 27 stress that they want a close partnership with the UK in the future, but here they are setting out the limits of what they could mean. The further away the UK wants to be from the rules and regulations of the single market the less access it will have - there is no such thing as partial membership. This gets us back to the unresolved debate about what ""full alignment"" at the Irish border really means in practice. The phrase ""preserve a level playing field"" is important too. The EU is anxious to ensure that the UK doesn't try to undercut the EU in any way by having looser regulations in certain key areas, and, if it does, then there will be consequences. EU negotiators won't have the authority to start discussions with the UK on future relations (including trade and also things like security and foreign policy) until another set of guidelines is adopted in March 2018. That gives the two sides not much more than six months to agree the text of a broad political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship. The EU hopes to get that finalised by October 2018, but it emphasises that formal trade negotiations can only begin after the UK has left the EU. Informal contacts on what the future might look like are probably taking place already, but the EU is still waiting for greater clarity from London about what exactly the UK government hopes to achieve in the long term. The UK is trying to be as ambitious as possible about what can be done before Brexit actually happens. The EU, though, emphasises that trade talks will have to continue long after the UK has left.

"An ""upside down volcano"" (L) and an ""upside down rocket"" (R) What do volcanoes and rockets have in common? ""Volcanoes have a nozzle aimed at the sky, and rockets have a nozzle aimed at the ground,"" explains Steve McNutt, a geosciences professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa. It explains why he and colleague Dr Glenn Thompson have installed the tools normally used to study eruptions at the famous Kennedy Space Center. Comparing the different types of rumblings could yield new insights. In the case of rockets, the team thinks their seismometers and infrasound (low-frequency acoustic waves) detectors might potentially be used by the space companies as a different type of diagnostic tool, to better understand the performance of their vehicles; or perhaps as a way to identify missiles in flight. In the case of volcanoes, the idea is to take the lessons learned at Kennedy and fine-tune the algorithms used to interpret what is happening in an eruption. It might even be possible to develop systems that give early warnings of some of the dangerous debris flows associated with volcanoes. This video can not be played Glenn Thompson and Steve McNutt: ""Kennedy has strong signals to test equipment "" ""It all started really as a way to test and calibrate our equipment,"" says Glenn. ""We don't have any volcanoes in South Florida - obviously. But Kennedy provided some strong sources, and it also gave our students the opportunity to learn how to deploy stations and work with the data."" The team has now recorded the seismic and acoustic signals emanating from about a dozen rockets. Most have been associated with launches; a few have been related to what are called static fire tests, in which the engines on a clamped vehicle are briefly ignited to check they are flight-ready. But perhaps the most fascinating event captured so far was the SpaceX pad explosion in September 2016. This saw a Falcon 9 rocket suffer a catastrophic failure as it was being fuelled. Many people will have seen the video of the spectacular fireball. ButGlenn's and Steve's equipment caught information not apparent in that film,external. This video can not be played The moment the SpaceX rocket exploded For example, they detected more than 150 separate sub-events in the infrasound over the course of 26 minutes. These were likely individual tanks, pipes or other components bursting into flames. Of course, the SpaceX explosion was an unusual occurrence, and it is the more routine activity that most interests the team. And some clear patterns are starting to emerge in their study of ""upside down volcanoes"". ""As the rocket gets higher and higher and accelerates, we see a decrease in the frequency in the infrasound - that's basically a Doppler shift because the source is moving away from us,"" says Steve. ""And then you get a coupling of the signal in the air into the ground and this produces seismic waves recorded on the seismometer. ""So, we get some common features between the infrasound and the seismometer, but then there's a little separation of the energy between the two."" A deadly pyroclastic flow heads down the flanks of the SoufriÃ¨re Hills volcano in Montserrat There is a lot still to learn, but the pair think they can distinguish the different types of rockets - to tell a Falcon from an Atlas from a Delta. There are subtle but significant divergences in their spectral signatures, which almost certainly reflect their distinct designs and modes of operation. Where in particular the rockets could have instruction for volcano monitoring is in describing moving sources. A rocket is a very well understood physical process. Its properties and parameters - such as the size of the nozzle orifice, the thrust, the trajectory and the distance - are all precisely known. The related seismic and acoustic signals should therefore serve as templates to help decipher some of the features of eruptions that share similar behaviours. Good examples of rapid movement in the volcano setting are the big mass surges like pyroclastic flows (descending clouds of hot ash/rock) and lahars (mud/ash avalanches). An objective of the team is to improve seismometer and infrasound systems' characterisation of these dangerous phenomena. This could lead to useful alerts being sent to people who live around volcanoes. ""Assuming you can find a few safe places to put your instruments that are reasonably close, you'd get your advance warning,"" said Steve. ""What you'd be doing then is getting the time and the strength of the signal and then watching it evolve to figure out which direction it's going. ""If you can do that successfully then you can forecast with a couple of minutes in advance things like lahars and pyroclastic flows downstream."" Glenn added: ""I worked on [the Caribbean island of] Montserrat during the crisis from 1995 to 2011, and we did have a rudimentary system even then for tracking the pyroclastic density currents coming down the slopes of the volcano. ""It wasn't quite a real-time application, but we hope with this kind of work that we can improve those algorithms and make them more of an automated alarm system."" The equipment at Kennedy has been temporary, but the team is looking for a permanent installation. Like everyone, Glenn and Steve are particularly looking forward to the launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy vehicle in the New Year. The Heavy should produce nearly 23 meganewtons of thrust at lift-off, more than any rocket in operation today. It is sure to make for some interesting seismic and infrasound signals.

"Adm Srur (right) is seen here with President Macri last month The head of the Argentine navy has been sacked following the loss of a submarine and its crew in the South Atlantic last month. The defence minister placed Adm Marcelo Srur in retirement on Friday night, it has emerged. The ARA San Juan disappeared with 44 crew on board after reporting an electrical problem off the coast of Patagonia. An international search operation has failed to locate the vessel. The families of the missing have urged the government to keep looking for the submarine, describing the anguish of living with uncertainty since the rescue operation was wound up just over two weeks ago. Some ships are still searching in an area where a loud noise was recorded in the hours following the disappearance - possible evidence that the submarine imploded. President Mauricio Macri has created a special independent commission to investigate the disappearance of the submarine, following criticism about the handling of the operation. The commission will comprise three submariners - one the father of one of the disappeared crew. Defence Minister Oscar Aguad has promised the investigation will be ""transparent"" and will have an unlimited budget. The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman ""We ask that they always tell us the truth, that they keep us informed about what's happening,"" said Jorge Villareal, father of missing crew member Fernando, according to Efe news agency. ""We just find things out through the media."" Adm Srur, 60, was appointed by President Macri in January 2016. What happens when a submarine vanishes Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine?

"The number of people out shopping in the UK in the first two weeks of December fell ""significantly"" compared to last year, retail researchers say. Analysis firm Springboard found a 4.9% decrease in footfall at shopping centres, retail parks and high streets. Bad weather and rise in online shopping were both factors in the decline, according to Diane Wehrle. The figures come as a retail analyst said it expected shops to make big discounts in the week before Christmas. Consultancy firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) said it was anticipating more retailers to be discounting in the week leading up to Christmas than during the Black Friday weekend. Springboard's analysis for this month - up to 14 December - showed that the number of people visiting shops compared to the same period last year fell by 4.9% - almost three times the 1.7% decrease in 2016. Ms Wehrle said last week's snow had a ""clear impact"" on footfall, but was just one of a number of factors. She said: ""The reasons are associated with budgetary constraints, due to inflation and the recent interest rate rise, but also due to the heavy discounting in November. ""Black Friday pulled spending forward, thereby impacting on customer activity in December. And of course all of this is set against a backdrop of a continuing rise in online spending."" She added that while online spending accounts for about 15% of total retail spending, it is rising approximately 10% year on year. Meanwhile, PwC said it expected retailers to make big discounts in the final week before Christmas to convince shoppers to keep spending throughout the festive period. The firm has analysed the number of promotions advertised in shops and online during November and December for the past seven years. It found that many of the retailers offering promotions during the Black Friday weekend in late November returned to full price sales by the beginning of December, before relaunching discounts in the lead up to Christmas. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: ""As we rapidly approach Christmas itself, we are already seeing an uptick in promotional activity as retailers try to attract customers through their doors and clear festive stock."" Earlier this week it was revealed thatBlack Friday helped retail sales to grow by 1.1% last month- despite average prices rising faster than average wages. By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam The six weeks from the end of November to the start of January account for up to half of any major retailer's annual profits. Have a bad Christmas, and you'll have a bad year. Add in falling real incomes because inflation is high and wage growth is modest, and retailers are especially nervous this year. So that's why some of them are offering decent discounts in the very fortnight before Christmas that they need to maximise their margins (profits). And the reason? Competition. The rivalry on - and offline - between retailers is intense. No flash sale by a large company, will go unmatched by its rivals. And consumers, thanks to the internet, are now increasingly aware of sudden discounting. So bargains don't go a-begging.
