"Kiernan Wong is reunited with her mother after 16 months apart An eight-year-old girl and her father, wrongly quarantined under Scotland's new hotel isolation rules, have been reunited with the girl's mother after just one day in the UK. Chun Wong and his daughter Kiernan got the hugs they were desperate for with his wife Danielle on Tuesday after immigration delays kept them apart for 16 months. They were allowed to leave their hotel after an error was discovered. They will now isolate at home in Fife. Since Monday, all passengers arriving in Scotland on international flights have to enter ""managed isolation"". However, this does not apply to those coming from within the Common Travel Area, including the UK and Ireland. Girl's hotel quarantine puts hug with mum on hold Hancock 'happy to discuss' quarantine loophole Which countries trigger hotel quarantine? Mr Wong and Kiernan had arrived in Edinburgh from the US via Dublin. They had gone straight to a hotel at Edinburgh airport, following advice they had been given. Later that night they were told that as they had got a connecting flight from Ireland, they could instead isolate at home. The family was finally reunited on Tuesday afternoon. Chun Wong and his wife Danielle have been apart for more than a year Mrs Wong told BBC Scotland about the moment she got to hug Kiernan for the first time in more than a year. She said: ""I have never had that level of anxiety on my life. My legs were shaking so much and when she came out of the hotel she was scared to run to me. It was lovely and I didn't want to let her go."" Mr Wong added: ""I just told her to run to mummy. What a reunion to remember."" He said an official from the airport had come to see him in the hotel on Monday night. ""He said that it was an error on their part that since we came into the country through Dublin we didn't need to quarantine,"" he said. ""They were very apologetic. They said they screwed up, which I understand. It was day one and what process is perfect on day one?"" The new arrivals will still carry out self-testing on the second and eighth day, in line with the isolation rules. Chun and Kiernan Wong are now quarantining at home after arriving from the US via Dublin Travellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels have to pay Â£1,750 each, plus an extra fee for additional isolating guests. In Mr Wong's case that was a further Â£325 for Kiernan. The Scottish government said it was investigating why he was ""wrongly advised"" at the airport. But Mrs Wong said she had found it difficult to get the right information ahead of her family's arrival. She said: ""We believed because they came from the US and the Scottish rule says that is international travel regardless of whether it is a red list country or not, they have to quarantine."" She was advised to book a quarantine hotel but again found problems with the England-based system. She said that online forms had no prompts for Scotland. She added: ""It is confusing. I believe based on the regulations they should be at the hotel. I don't disagree with the stance Scotland is taking. ""We were willing and happy to do it. It's an appropriate measure but it needs to be made simpler for people coming here. ""I didn't expect this. But I am thankful because I get to see my daughter. I was frantically running to the shops this morning to stock up on food."" Danielle Wong has not seen her daughter for 16 months. Photo taken when the family were previously together Mr Wong and Kiernan have moved to Scotland to be with Mrs Wong who has been in the country since November 2019. A dual UK/US citizen, she is a front-line NHS worker, involved in addiction services. The family have been separated for 16 months, after the pandemic hit the immigration system. On Monday Mr Wong said it would be ""heartbreaking"" to be apart for another 10 days if they had to isolate in a hotel. He said his daughter was ""ecstatic, overjoyed and a little nervous"" as it had been more than a year since she had seen her mum. ""The last time she saw her she was seven and in April she'll be nine. Crazy."" On Tuesday Kiernan had two Christmases' worth of presents waiting for her at her new home. The family, in an earlier photograph, are now reunited A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We are looking into the circumstances that led to Mr Wong being wrongly advised at the airport that he needed to book a managed isolation package. This is a very new system, being implemented at pace, and some initial challenges are to be expected. ""We are following up with the travel management company to ensure a full refund is provided to Mr Wong."" An Edinburgh Airport spokesman wished the Wong family well as they settled into their new life in Scotland. However, he insisted that ""inaccurate advice"" had come from the government which was evidence of the ""confusion"" the policy had created. The spokesman added: ""It is a clear example of the loophole that our governments have created in action and they should work together to close it before this happens again."" All those arriving into Scotland directly from outside the Common Travel Area must pay to isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel. But Scotland's first minister has raised concerns about the risk of people spreading new Covid variants if they arrive at airports and ferry terminals elsewhere, then travel to Scotland on public transport. For example, in England only travellers from 33 ""red list"" countries must enter managed quarantine. UK minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed on Tuesday that the quarantine rollout had ""gone smoothly"" in England. Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""As for day one, it's gone reasonably well, we can always do better and, of course, work with Scotland."" He added: ""Our discussions with the Scottish government will lead to a better operating system. I think it would be unwise to close the border, we are one United Kingdom."" The guidelines for international travel are published on theScottish government website,external. A section of it says: ""You must also book and pay for managed isolation if you travel to Scotland from the Republic of Ireland, and have been in an acute risk country (a ""red list"" country) in the 10 days before your arrival. ""If you arrive in Scotland from within the Common Travel Area, but have been in a country not on the acute risk list in the 10 days before your arrival, you must self-isolate. ""There are some limited exemptions from isolation. You may still be required to self-isolate when you are not doing the essential activity the exemption allows.""

"Jaguar Land Rover's Jaguar brand will be all-electric by 2025, the carmaker has said. The company will launch electric models of its entire Jaguar and Land Rover line-up by 2030, it added. The firm said it would keep all three of its three British plants open as part of its new strategy. But it has dropped plans to build an electric version of its XJ saloon at the Castle Bromwich plant, meaning the site will eventually stop making cars. Chief executive Thierry BollorÃ© said the plant would focus instead on ""non-production"" activities in the long term, without giving details. The company plans to spend about Â£2.5bn a year on new technology for its cars. This is a big move for Jaguar Land Rover, but the reality is it has little choice. Like other manufacturers, it is under pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions from its fleet, as new regulations come into force in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time, sales of diesels - which generally produce less CO2 than petrol engines - have been plummeting. And in the longer term, the UK government wants to outlaw the sale of all wholly petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Governments in other countries are moving in the same general direction. The problem is, electric cars cost more to design and build than conventional models, meaning it is currently hard to make a profit from them. Bigger manufacturers can throw money at the problem now, and hope to benefit from economies of scale later. JLR is a smaller company and can't do that - so instead it will re-emphasise Jaguar's credentials as a luxury brand when it goes all-electric. That might make sense from a marketing point of view, but making the sums add up looks like a steep challenge. It will also invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Fuel cells provide electric power, without producing tailpipe emissions - water is the only by-product. However, in order for them to be truly environmentally friendly, the hydrogen itself needs to be produced using renewable sources. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the announcement was ""a huge step for British car manufacturing"". Carmakers are under pressure to meet stringent carbon emission demands in Europe and China, as well as customer demand for high-performance electric cars with a luxury or performance feel. The UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Luxury car brand Bentley Motors, owned by Germany's Volkswagen, said in November its range will be fully electric by 2030, and last month General Motors said it aimed to have a zero tailpipe emission line-up by 2035.

"People must be ""optimistic but patient"" about the coronavirus situation in the UK and the end to restrictions, Boris Johnson has said. The PM hailed the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to ""relax"". He said there were still more people in hospital than at the peak of the first wave, and steps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"". He is to set out a roadmap next week for lifting England's restrictions. The government said on Sundaythat it had met its pledge to offer at least one Covid vaccine dose to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. More than 15 million people have received a first dose,according to the latest government figures.,external Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson hailed the ""unprecedented national achievement"" of hitting the target, but warned the threat from the virus remained ""very real"". The prime minister warned that the government did not have all the ""hard facts"" about how the vaccine impacted infections and that there were still more people in hospital with Covid-19 than in April - with admissions running at 1,600 a day across the UK. ""We have to keep our foot to the floor,"" he said. 'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid Third of social care staff 'still not vaccinated' First travellers arrive for hotel quarantine stay Plan to end lockdown 'cautious but irreversible' Mr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending England's restrictions, but that the government wanted this lockdown ""to be the last"", with ""cautious but irreversible"" progress. He added his plan next week would set out ""as much as we possibly can about the route to normality, even though some things are very uncertain"". Although he said he was ""increasingly optimistic"" he admitted he could not give ""an absolute cast-iron guarantee that we won't face further difficulties"". ""I don't want people to think I'm not optimistic. There's been a big change - science is now in the ascendency over the disease,"" he added. Mr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year. ""I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,"" he said. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the ""acknowledgement"" would give late night businesses ""the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time"". ""But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity,"" he added. Could this be the last lockdown? That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the government's stated aim. It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in. Who knew then that we'd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later? Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis. Today, again, he's urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well. That's because ministers really don't want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation. It comes aftermore than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend, calling for a commitment to a ""free life"" and the ending of lockdown measures before May. Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. This video can not be played Johnson: 'We want progress to be cautious but also irreversible' Earlier, No 10 said the intention was to ""start getting"" pupils back into school on 8 March, but was not ruling out the possibility that they could be sent back in stages. The PM's official spokesman said it was ""important"" the planned review of restrictions was carried out this week, with details to be set out in Mr Johnson's road map on Monday. The spokesman said he would not ""pre-empt"" what the road map might contain, but added: ""It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March, if the science and evidence allows."" LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? The government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups - including everyone over the age of 50 - by the end of April, Mr Johnson said. This would run alongside giving second doses within the 12-week window to those in the top four priority groups, who have already had a first dose. All those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers, are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination. With every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid. Science, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy. It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago. But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results. There is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants. No vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it. That's why advances in treatment are vital, too. A cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances. There is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back. Speaking at the same Downing Street briefing, NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as ""two sprints and a marathon"". He said the UK had passed the ""finishing line of the first sprint"" and now had a ""second sprint between now and 30 April"" to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups. The ""marathon"" will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible, alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed, Sir Simon added. Meanwhile, on Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.

Radio 4 PM Ministers risk ""dashing hope"" by setting dates for the lifting of lockdown restrictions, a government adviser has warned. Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, spoke to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme. He said: âIf you ask 'when' questions - or speculate about dates - in effect, you render people passive. ""You donât pose the real question, which is: what can we all do to bring infections down? âIf you set a date and then you change it, you donât give people hope, you dash hope. You bring despair. ""You create whatâs called âlearned helplessnessâ, where people begin to feel weâre not in control of anything. Those are the conditions under which people give up.â The full interview can be foundhere, 48 minutes in. Reality Check NHS Englandâs Sir Simon Stevens has said that figures were published weekly on the uptake of the vaccine by
different ethnic minority groups. But the numbers released arenât
particularly helpful. They are not broken down by age or
by region, meaning we canât see how well the older, priority groups are being
targeted. Nor do we have a good idea on how
large these communities actually are because the last census was a decade ago. This makes it difficult to work
out what percentage of each group has had the vaccine. What we do know is that a
large-scale study by the OpenSafely survey suggested thatblack people over 80 were almost half,externalas likely to
have had the vaccine than white people over 80. However, this study is now over
two weeks old. Another more recent study fromLeicesterâs main NHS trustfound that just 36% of black staff had their first
dose. This was compared with 71% of white staff. Here is a quick look at coronavirus around the UK in numbers. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Thinking about what the future might look can feel like a fairly futile exercise sometimes, with so much up in the air. But Boris Johnson did just offer up at least one interesting glimpse. He suggested there could well be rapid testing for people heading off to venues like nightclubs and theatres; a way of keeping a lid on infection rates in those parts of the economy that are the âtoughest nuts to crackâ. That may be some way off yet and thereâll be plenty of questions as to exactly how that would work. But it does shine a little light on what life might look like in the ""new normal"". Reality Check The lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs has
written to the prime minister demanding that all coronavirus rules be lifted by
the end of April. The group argues that once the top nine priority groups have been
vaccinated - which the government says it aims to complete by May - there will
be âno justificationâ for the restrictions. The success of the vaccine rollout means by 1 May âabout 99% of
deaths & 80% hospitalisations from Covid protected,â CRG Deputy Chair Steve
Bakertweeted,external. Might that be the case? In early December, England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof
Jonathan Van-Tam said itcould be possible to cut deaths by 99%if everyone on the
priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective â but this was
before the decision to delay second doses was announced. If the rollout progresses on schedule, some in those priority
groups will have only just received their first vaccine at the end of April, so
will not be fully protected. There is also a possibility the vaccine will be less effective
against some variants of the virus, and the take-up, while high, is very unlikely
to be 100%.  Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter More data from Israel's
vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic
infections. This indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger
population as it did in the clinical trials. It is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe
disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai
Levine. ""High vaccination coverage of the most susceptible
groups"" is key, he says. Israel is the first country in the world to see the impact of its vaccination programme, but it took significant population coverage and several weeks to reach this stage.

As tricky as it is, Tocilizumab is a word Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to get familiar with saying, as the drug normally used to treat arthritis could be a potential life-saver, according to research. This video can not be played Health workers in Peru began receiving the vaccine a week ago A second minister in Peru has resigned amid growing
anger over revelations that senior officials have received the coronavirus
vaccine well ahead of the public. Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete tweeted that she had
been inoculated in January and called it a âserious mistakeâ. Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti stepped down last
week after it emerged former President Martin Vizcarra was vaccinated in
October. Mr Vizcarraâs vaccination came just a few weeks beforehe was impeachedand removed from office on charges of being morally incompetent. Peru has been hit hard by the pandemic, recording
more than 1.2 million cases and over 43,700 deaths. Vaccinations of health workers began just over a
week ago but no date has yet been set to roll out the programme to the wider
public. NHS England chief Simon Stevens was speaking at the Downing Street press conference this afternoon. He described the race to vaccinate people as ""two sprints and a marathon"". This video can not be played Reality Check At
the UK government briefing, the chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens
said:â Weâre up against the
pandemic of Covid and weâre up against a pandemic of disinformationâ. False
and misleading claims about vaccines have been circulating on social media for
many months. They
include baseless conspiracy
theories that mass vaccinations are part of a secret plan to microchip people
or that they can somehow alter human DNA. BBCReality Check has looked at many of these- including recent posts on vaccines
and fertility â such as the false claim that vaccines contain proteins which
could lead the body to attack the placenta. Some
argue that Covid disinformation may be
affecting vaccine take-up. In an experiment, BBC Panorama showed a panel one videofilled with falsehoods - to see how it affected their willingness to get a jab.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca
vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization for emergency
use, which means it will be part of the WHOâs global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax. The vaccine will be produced at two plants - by SKBio in South Korea and the Serum Institute of India - and so had to be approved twice. ""We
now have all the pieces in place for the rapid distribution of vaccines,""
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""But we still need to scale up production."" The Oxford vaccine is seen as the ""vaccine for the
world"" as it is cheap, can be mass produced and is stored in a standard
fridge. It hasattracted controversy about its effectivenessagainst new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far
apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data. But a review by the WHO found that it met the
""must-have"" criteria for safety, and its benefits outweighed the risks. Today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing was led by the prime minister. He was joined by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, and Prof Chris
Whitty, the chief medical officer. Here's what they said: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Could this be the last lockdown? That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the governmentâs stated aim. It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in. Who knew then that weâd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later? Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis. Today, again, heâs urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine roll-out goes well. Thatâs because ministers really donât want to lift restrictions only to re-impose them again on a weary nation. The media questions wrap up with Alistair Smout from Reuters asking if it is the vaccine reducing infection cases or the national lockdown. He also asks who the PM holds responsible for a lack of transparency surrounding about the origins of the virus. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says the impact of the vaccine should become clear when looking at the data of those who have been vaccinated, in the order in which they received their dose. He adds that the UK's data set is not yet big enough to ""see with the naked eye"". On the second question, Boris Johnson says ""most evidence"" points to the disease having originated in Wuhan and stresses the importance of gathering as much evidence as possible. He also says a global treaty on pandemics is ""an attractive idea"". Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks the PM about quarantine hotels in the UK - he wants to know if people will have to pay extra if their release is delayed due to testing positive. What if they can't pay, he asks? He also wants to know what mental health provision is being made for these people being confined to a single room. Boris Johnson says it's currently illegal to travel abroad for holidays anyway so he would expect people coming in to the UK to be able to cover their costs. He says mental health support would be made available to whoever needs it. Sir Simon Stevens is asked why, when the UK is vaccinating an average of 435,000 people a day, the target for giving all over-50s a jab is the end of April. Sir Simon says the second doses still need to be administered and that the issue is vaccine supply. If supplies increase, then it ""looks like we can go faster"".  The Financial Times' Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe asks what steps the government has taken on vaccine hesitancy and disinformation among minority groups. She also asks about the possibility of vaccine passports. NHS head Sir Simon Stevens says there is ""real concern about hesitancy on the part of some black and South Asian communities"". He adds that there is a ""huge effort"" to overcome that hesitancy and suggests there is ""meaningful progress"". ""We are up against a pandemic of Covid and a pandemic of misinformation,"" he says. On vaccine passports, Boris Johnson says there are lots of discussions to be had but says at the moment the preferred route is one that relies on mass vaccinations plus rapid testing for places such as nightclubs and theatres. Earlier, Hannah from Glasgow asked whether a mental health spokesperson can speak at the next briefing to set out to the public how they can access mental health support. The PM says it is a ""good idea"" and suggests that Dr Alex George - ex-Love Islander and the government's youth mental health ambassador - could appear. ""We'll try and find the right person to say something about how to do this and how to encourage everybody, really, to look after our mental wellbeing and try and keep going through this pandemic,"" he says. ""I hope there isn't that much longer to go now, but clearly people have been under a lot of pressure and we've got to address that."" He urges people to make use of NHS and charity mental health services and says the government has put a further Â£500m into supporting NHS mental health services. Prof Chris Whitty points out that one of the next priority groups for vaccination is people who have got ""significant mental health problems"". Â© 2025 BBC.

'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid Third of social care staff 'still not vaccinated' First travellers arrive for hotel quarantine stay Plan to end lockdown 'cautious but irreversible' Mr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending England's restrictions, but that the government wanted this lockdown ""to be the last"", with ""cautious but irreversible"" progress. He added his plan next week would set out ""as much as we possibly can about the route to normality, even though some things are very uncertain"". Although he said he was ""increasingly optimistic"" he admitted he could not give ""an absolute cast-iron guarantee that we won't face further difficulties"". ""I don't want people to think I'm not optimistic. There's been a big change - science is now in the ascendency over the disease,"" he added. Mr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year. ""I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,"" he said. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the ""acknowledgement"" would give late night businesses ""the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time"". ""But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity,"" he added. Could this be the last lockdown? That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the government's stated aim. It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in. Who knew then that we'd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later? Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis. Today, again, he's urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well. That's because ministers really don't want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation. It comes aftermore than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend, calling for a commitment to a ""free life"" and the ending of lockdown measures before May. Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine.

The spokesman said he would not ""pre-empt"" what the road map might contain, but added: ""It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March, if the science and evidence allows."" LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? The government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups - including everyone over the age of 50 - by the end of April, Mr Johnson said. This would run alongside giving second doses within the 12-week window to those in the top four priority groups, who have already had a first dose. All those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers, are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination. With every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid. Science, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy. It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago. But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results. There is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants. No vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it. That's why advances in treatment are vital, too. A cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances. There is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back. Speaking at the same Downing Street briefing, NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as ""two sprints and a marathon"". He said the UK had passed the ""finishing line of the first sprint"" and now had a ""second sprint between now and 30 April"" to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups. The ""marathon"" will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible, alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed, Sir Simon added. Meanwhile, on Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged care staff to come forward to be vaccinated A third of social care staff in England have not had the Covid-19 vaccine, the health secretary has said, despite them being among the groups prioritised. Matt Hancock said it was ""very important"" for the staff, patients and society that they get the jab. Meanwhile, a hospital trust has revealed thatonly 36.8% of its black staff have had the vaccine. Everyone in the top four groups has had a jab offer and 15 million people have had a first dose, the government says. The rollout in England has officially been expanded to those aged 65 and over and younger people in at-risk groups. Tory MPs call for end to lockdown by May Hotel quarantine comes into force in UK Watchdog urged to investigate UK pandemic response In a bid to encourage more social care staff to have the jab, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""It is the right thing to do. It is very important that you come forward and take up this vaccine. It's important for you, it's important for your patients and of course it's important for the whole of society."" Analysis from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trusthas revealed lower proportions of black and Asian staff being vaccinated. It found that 70.9% of white staff had come forward, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff. University of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community. We want everyone to get the jab when they are called to do so."" Are you a social care or NHS worker who has yet to be vaccinated? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Upload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged those eligible to receive the vaccine to come forward. ""These jabs, these vaccines are safe, they are efficacious, they will help protect you against disease and against death and they're a wonderful thing to have - they help protect you, your family, your neighbours,"" Mr Johnson said. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said he would be talking to clinical leaders from various ethnic groups ""to work out together how we can encourage everybody to take up the vaccine"". Christina McAnea, general secretary of the trade union, Unison, said getting as many care workers as possible to have the Covid jab should be achieved through ""encouragement and persuasion"". She said care workers must be provided with ""the correct information"" and ""time to ask the experts about their concerns, think things through and talk to colleagues who've had the jab"". The uptake among care workers isn't surprising - they tend to come forward in lower numbers for the flu jab. It illustrates the need to continue reaching out to those who have not taken up the offer. The fear is some of the most vulnerable and deprived communities have the lowest levels of uptake, which would widen inequalities in the future. Today, though, marks an important milestone. But that is all it is. Most Covid deaths have come in the over-70s, but just over half of hospitalisations have. It means there are a significant number at risk in the 50 to 70 age group as well as younger adults with health conditions. They have been promised a jab by the end of April. Achieving that will not be easy. From March people will start needing second doses, which means the rate at which first doses are given is expected to tail off. As always, everything depends on supply. Ministers are confident in the supply of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and by Easter the deliveries of a third jab made by Moderna should arrive. There can be no let up. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said that there was still ""some way to go"" before easing lockdown. He said: ""At the latest count there are still over 23,000 people in hospital with Covid - that's more than in the April peak."" It is 69 days sincethe UK began its mass vaccination programme- and six weeks since the prime minister set out the pledge to offer a first dose to the four priority groups by 15 February. That meant vaccinating all elderly care home residents and their carers; everyone over 70; all frontline health and social care workers; and everyone with a condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to the virus - a total of 14.6 million people. Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing Mr Johnson hailed the vaccine rollout as an ""unprecedented achievement"" and said the country can go into the next stage ""with great confidence"". Five unanswered questions about the vaccine rollout Will I need a vaccine passport to travel? But whilethe UK's vaccination rate is third in the world, behind only Israel and the United Arab Emirates, there have been reports that some people in priority groups - including those who are housebound - are still waiting for their first dose. And a small number of the 15 million people vaccinated will have been outside these initial priority groups as some NHS regions had already begun giving jabs to younger people. As well as the over-65s, the next group to be offered the vaccine is the estimated 7.3 million people aged 16 to 65 with a range of health conditions that put them at risk from the virus. The rollout will then be extended to the remaining over-50 age groups, with the aim of offering a first dose to another 17.2 million people before the end of April. Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that millions of people whose asthma is under controlwill not be prioritised for the vaccine. Mr Hancock said that 90% of the over-70s had accepted the vaccine and one in four adults were now starting to receive protection against Covid-19. The Department of Health said 88% of the UK's coronavirus deaths occurred in the priority groups who have now been offered the vaccine. On Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections,according to the latest government figures,external. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? With the expectation that increasing numbers of people will be protected from serious illness, ministers will this week finalise plans on how England's coronavirus measures can be eased. The government has said it will take ""cautious"" steps,rejecting calls from Conservative MPs to commit to abolishing all Covid-19 restrictions by the end of April.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Progress must be 'cautious but irreversible' The government's plan to move England out of lockdown will be ""cautious but irreversible"", Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister is due to set out the roadmap for ending restrictions next Monday. He told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes ""if we possibly can"", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays. It comes as a group of Tory MPs call for a commitment to a ""free life"" and ending of lockdown measures before May. Senior backbencher Steve Baker said he wants the prime minister to ""let us reclaim our lives, once and for all"". The PM is likely to be questioned about his plans later when he hosts a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT - alongside England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens. New vaccine rollout phase begins Future lockdowns in Wales not ruled out When will lockdown rules be reviewed? On Sunday, the government said it met its target to offer a vaccine to the 15 million most vulnerable people across the UK. Figures on Monday showed a 29% drop in the number of positive cases across the country, down to 9,765 - the lowest figure since 2 October. But there are still concerns over the numbers, with over 88,000 cases recorded in the last week - an average of 157 cases per 100,000 - and 4,598 people dying within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. Labour said the government must ""lock in the gains of the vaccine"" and ensure more measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus - such as financial support for self-isolation and updated workplace guidance. Mr Johnson and senior members of his cabinet are set to spend the week looking into the latest coronavirus statistics before making an announcement on its plans. He said: ""The dates that we'll be setting out will be the dates by which we hope we can do something at the earliest."" There has been a raft of speculation on the date of re-openings of businesses and hospitality - much of which has been dismissed by Downing Street. But sources in No 10 told the BBC they were increasingly confident pupils in England would return to school on 8 March -the earliest the PM said the move could happen. Mr Johnson said no decisions had been taken yet, but the March date for schools had ""for a long time been a priority of the government and families up and down the country"". He added: ""We will do everything we can to make that happen, but we have got to keep looking at the data. ""There are still 23,000 or so Covid patients in the NHS - more than at the April peak last year - there are still sadly too many people dying of this disease; and rates of infection, although they are coming down, are still comparatively high. ""So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see."" Over the weekend, 63 Tory MPs wrote to Mr Johnson, calling for easing to begin in March and for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Mr Baker, who is the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should re-open by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. The proposal was rejected by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the government would be ""cautious"". Butwriting in the Telegraph,external, Mr Baker reasserted his plan, saying: ""As the prime minister said, let us reclaim our lives, once and for all. This can be a moment of unity - for our country and the Conservative Party - as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism to a much brighter future."" Fellow CRG member and Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the government ""have to think about livelihoods"", telling BBC Radio Essex: ""The moment you open schools up then there is no excuse for not opening up the rest of the economy."" Hospitality bosses are asking the government to reopen pubs by April, withthe chairman of Wetherspoon warning the industry is ""on its knees""and jobs are on the line. The plea comes after industry figures showed the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year - triple the tally in 2019. More than a dozen MPs have also called on Mr Johnson to allow restricted weddings to return from 8 March, followed by restriction-free weddings from 1 May. Tory former minister Esther McVey said after the top nine groups of people are vaccinated, it should be ""a huge moment for the UK to hold its head up high, for couples to walk down the aisle, and for families up and down the country to reunite, to celebrate and to plan their futures"". Any broad political consensus that existed in the early days of this pandemic has long gone. The Tory MPs that make up the Covid Recovery Group have been increasingly critical of prolonged restrictions. This is a group containing some senior Conservatives who are willing to be vocal, and willing to exert pressure on the prime minister. Their stance will no doubt be a factor in Downing Street's thinking. But it would be wrong to assume lockdown scepticism is representative of everyone on the Tory benches. Of more than 360 Conservative MPs, 63 signed the latest letter to Boris Johnson urging an easing of restrictions as soon as possible. That's not an inconsiderable number. However, there are also Tory MPs that advocate a more cautious approach, as do plenty on the opposition benches. The pressure from some in his party to move quickly out of lockdown creates tricky political tension for the prime minister - but it's not necessarily a majority view. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? Another senior Tory backbencher, Robert Halfon, said the PM needed to ""provide some kind of optimism to the public"" over lockdown easing, but warned against people relaxing too soon. The chair of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""I understand where [the Covid Recovery Group] are coming from and my heart has a lot of sympathy. ""I just don't want a repetition of what went on last year where we thought we were over the worst and then we're suddenly back in tiers of lockdown."" Meanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not want to give a ""cast iron guarantee"" about future lockdowns. He said: ""The danger is we try to set out absolutes - with talk of whether this is irreversible, or whether nothing else will happen in the future. ""What we want to do is make choices based on the best available data and information, to see case rates driven as low as possible, and then to have a cautious exit out of the current lockdown we're in.""

Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.

"The Scottish government is ""satisfied"" it has hit its latest vaccination target - but has warned that progress is set to slow down in the coming days. Ministers aimed to give a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to all over-70s and the clinically vulnerable by Monday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said everyone in this group should have been offered an appointment. She urged anyone who had not received one to contact the government, and said ""nobody is going to be left behind"". However, she said the rate of progress was set to ""decline a bit"" due to supply issues, with health teams ""unlikely to vaccinate more than 30,000 people a day this week"". This would be fewer than half of the number of people vaccinated on several days over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said staff ""stand ready to pick up the pace as soon as supplies allow"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Hancock 'happy to discuss' quarantine loophole Monday is the final day for the government to reach its target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all over-70s and those deemed to be extremely clinically vulnerable. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""satisfied we have met that target"", and that everyone in these groups had been offered the vaccine. A ""significant number of people"" had to rebook appointments due to the severe weather over the past week, but Ms Sturgeon said levels of uptake were already ""well beyond the 80% target we set out in our deployment plan"". The first minister said ""close to 100%"" of older care home residents and over-80s in the community had been given a first dose, along with 99% of 75 to 79-year-olds. And she said the uptake rate for those aged 70 to 74 was already at 85%, with more booked in for Monday. Ms Sturgeon said this was ""without a doubt a significant achievement"", which in time would ""reduce deaths from Covid-19 significantly"". The vaccination rate isexpected to dip over the coming weeksdue to a combination of factors, including a reduction in supplies. Ms Sturgeon said Pfizer had ""re-phased its delivery over the coming period"". The same number of vials will be delivered, but over a different timescale. She also said the higher than expected uptake of vaccines meant more doses had been used than anticipated, while more stocks would have to start being held back for second doses. Some vaccination centres like the NHS Louisa Jordan may move from seven days a week operation to five to reflect this. However, Ms Sturgeon stressed that ""we are not talking about closing vaccination centres"" and said the system could pick up pace ""very rapidly"" once supplies are available. She said: ""We're going to see these issues through this programme, that's in the nature of it, but it shouldn't take away from the fact we are in a much better position than we thought we would be in."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the vaccination target being hit was ""great news"" and that the government must now work on a ""route map"" towards easing lockdown. He said: ""Understandably specific dates set in stone are not possible because as the virus mutates it can get stronger variants, as we've seen over the last 10 or 11 months. ""But we need to know the triggers that will be in place for all school pupils to go back, for businesses to reopen - will we have a tiered approach or a national approach? ""These are the crucial points that businesses really need to be aware of so we can see our way out of this crisis."" Ms Sturgeon's cabinet is due to decide on Tuesday morning whether more pupils can return to Scotland's schools in the coming weeks, with an announcement to follow at Holyrood in the afternoon. The first minister said she was ""very keen"" to go ahead with the phased return of children to schools. She said there would be ""trade-offs"" over the coming months as the country eases out of lockdown, with schools and care home visiting ""the kind of things we focus on first as we try to get things back to normal"".

"There has been a ""concerning"" rise in food businesses operating out of people's homes during lockdown, according to the food safety watchdog. Many of them are selling food through social media, putting further pressure on a hygiene inspection system that is under strain because of the crisis. And other experts are also worried. ""Little food businesses are popping up like mushrooms in lockdown,"" said Julie Barratt from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH). ""There are rank outsiders operating off the radar, who think, 'Oh, my mum can cook', and confuse cooking with catering,"" she added. They sell to locals on apps such as Whatsapp, Instagram and Nextdoor. Many are failing to register as food businesses, meaning their hygiene arrangements are not checked by local authorities. But even those that do register are often not getting an inspection - despite new businesses usually being a priority - because the system is struggling to keep up during the pandemic. Hygiene inspections ceased completely during the first lockdown and since then a scaled-back operation has focused on high-risk cases. A business selling meat would be deemed higher risk than one selling cakes Local authorities are using video calls in a bid to clear the backlog. They allow basic issues to be resolved and reduce the time environmental health officers need to spend on-site. They could be used, for example, to ensure there is a separate sink for washing hands. But these video calls can never be as effective as in-person, surprise inspections, says Ms Barratt. They are unable to reveal things such as ingredients past their use-by date, or rat droppings under the cooker. Indeed, a challenge posed by the new legion of at-home businesses is that even if a physical inspection is required, a 24-hour warning has to be given because it is a private address, so the surprise element is lost. About 44% of new food businesses started since the first lockdown are home-based, according to a new centralised online registration system used by nearly 200 local authorities, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has revealed. The full picture will be clearer when all local authorities report their registration figures in the new financial year in April. ""The growth of at-home food businesses is a concern,"" the FSA said. ""Local authority resources are already stretched and many are finding it difficult to keep on top of the workload [these at-home food businesses] are generating,"" says Michael Jackson, the FSA's head of regulatory compliance. Some people are starting food businesses from their home because they have lost work and need to generate income - including professional chefs who have been hit by the closure of restaurants. Others are on furlough and have time to set up ""side hustles"". Takeaway eating and the idea of cooking for neighbours in need has also become more common in lockdown. As well as social media platforms, websites such as Olio and Cook My Grub also now allow this new army of at-home food entrepreneurs to find customers, selling everything from cakes to Sunday roasts. Every new food business must register before it starts selling food. Once registered with the local authority, an environmental health officer can visit in person and this eventually leads to an official food hygiene rating of 0-5 (or pass-fail in Scotland). The business can still trade prior to gaining its rating. However, the rating is a vital tool for customers to gauge the safety of an establishment and can be a selling point. Indeed, many new at-home food businesses that are well-run and take hygiene seriously are frustrated that they haven't been able to secure a rating yet, due to the backlog. This video can not be played Andrew Woodhouse is registered and hygiene-trained but awaiting inspection The FSA described the situation with inspections as ""at the edge of our risk appetite"" back in early December, before the current lockdown was announced. There have been no reported outbreaks of food poisoning connected to new at-home businesses so far. However, the FSA wants the public to be aware of the risks. ""Our advice to people when ordering food online is to check that the business has a food hygiene rating and choose only those with a rating of 3 or above, this can be checked onour website,external,"" says Mr Jackson of the FSA. ""If a consumer has any doubts about a food seller or a food product, they should report them to the local authority,"" he adds. ""Where sellers do not follow the rules, they may be fined, imprisoned for up to two years, or both."" However, others think the system itself needs an overhaul to protect the public. The law should be changed so that food businesses of any type cannot trade until they have been inspected and rated, says the CIEH's Ms Barratt.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged care staff to come forward to be vaccinated A third of social care staff in England have not had the Covid-19 vaccine, the health secretary has said, despite them being among the groups prioritised. Matt Hancock said it was ""very important"" for the staff, patients and society that they get the jab. Meanwhile, a hospital trust has revealed thatonly 36.8% of its black staff have had the vaccine. Everyone in the top four groups has had a jab offer and 15 million people have had a first dose, the government says. The rollout in England has officially been expanded to those aged 65 and over and younger people in at-risk groups. Tory MPs call for end to lockdown by May Hotel quarantine comes into force in UK Watchdog urged to investigate UK pandemic response In a bid to encourage more social care staff to have the jab, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""It is the right thing to do. It is very important that you come forward and take up this vaccine. It's important for you, it's important for your patients and of course it's important for the whole of society."" Analysis from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trusthas revealed lower proportions of black and Asian staff being vaccinated. It found that 70.9% of white staff had come forward, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff. University of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community. We want everyone to get the jab when they are called to do so."" Are you a social care or NHS worker who has yet to be vaccinated? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Upload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged those eligible to receive the vaccine to come forward. ""These jabs, these vaccines are safe, they are efficacious, they will help protect you against disease and against death and they're a wonderful thing to have - they help protect you, your family, your neighbours,"" Mr Johnson said. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said he would be talking to clinical leaders from various ethnic groups ""to work out together how we can encourage everybody to take up the vaccine"". Christina McAnea, general secretary of the trade union, Unison, said getting as many care workers as possible to have the Covid jab should be achieved through ""encouragement and persuasion"". She said care workers must be provided with ""the correct information"" and ""time to ask the experts about their concerns, think things through and talk to colleagues who've had the jab"". The uptake among care workers isn't surprising - they tend to come forward in lower numbers for the flu jab. It illustrates the need to continue reaching out to those who have not taken up the offer. The fear is some of the most vulnerable and deprived communities have the lowest levels of uptake, which would widen inequalities in the future. Today, though, marks an important milestone. But that is all it is. Most Covid deaths have come in the over-70s, but just over half of hospitalisations have. It means there are a significant number at risk in the 50 to 70 age group as well as younger adults with health conditions. They have been promised a jab by the end of April. Achieving that will not be easy. From March people will start needing second doses, which means the rate at which first doses are given is expected to tail off. As always, everything depends on supply. Ministers are confident in the supply of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and by Easter the deliveries of a third jab made by Moderna should arrive. There can be no let up. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said that there was still ""some way to go"" before easing lockdown. He said: ""At the latest count there are still over 23,000 people in hospital with Covid - that's more than in the April peak."" It is 69 days sincethe UK began its mass vaccination programme- and six weeks since the prime minister set out the pledge to offer a first dose to the four priority groups by 15 February. That meant vaccinating all elderly care home residents and their carers; everyone over 70; all frontline health and social care workers; and everyone with a condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to the virus - a total of 14.6 million people. Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing Mr Johnson hailed the vaccine rollout as an ""unprecedented achievement"" and said the country can go into the next stage ""with great confidence"". Five unanswered questions about the vaccine rollout Will I need a vaccine passport to travel? But whilethe UK's vaccination rate is third in the world, behind only Israel and the United Arab Emirates, there have been reports that some people in priority groups - including those who are housebound - are still waiting for their first dose. And a small number of the 15 million people vaccinated will have been outside these initial priority groups as some NHS regions had already begun giving jabs to younger people. As well as the over-65s, the next group to be offered the vaccine is the estimated 7.3 million people aged 16 to 65 with a range of health conditions that put them at risk from the virus. The rollout will then be extended to the remaining over-50 age groups, with the aim of offering a first dose to another 17.2 million people before the end of April. Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that millions of people whose asthma is under controlwill not be prioritised for the vaccine. Mr Hancock said that 90% of the over-70s had accepted the vaccine and one in four adults were now starting to receive protection against Covid-19. The Department of Health said 88% of the UK's coronavirus deaths occurred in the priority groups who have now been offered the vaccine. On Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections,according to the latest government figures,external. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? With the expectation that increasing numbers of people will be protected from serious illness, ministers will this week finalise plans on how England's coronavirus measures can be eased.

"The UK has powered past the vaccines target set six weeks ago, the prime minister tells a Downing Street briefing - but adds this is no moment to relax ""We've vaccinated more than 90% of those aged over 70 but don't forget 60% of hospital patients with Covid are under 70,"" says the PM ""If we can keep the supply up, we hope to offer vaccinations to everyone in the top nine priority groups by the end of April,"" Johnson adds The seven-day average of Covid deaths in the UK is still high but ""below the peak of the first wave"", chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty says NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens says the vaccine programme is like ""two sprints and a marathon"" and we have just reached the first sprint's finish line The PM says he cannot guarantee this will be the last lockdown, as we are ""battling with nature"" - but says science is ""in the ascendency"" A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK are confirmed, and there are 9,765 newly-reported cases But this is the first day since 2 October the number of cases announced by the UK government has been below 10,000 Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest on coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. Here's a summary of some of the stories we've been covering.  Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Alex Kleiderman, Laurence Peter, Hazel Shearing, Penny Spiller, Lauren Turner, Lucy Webster, Kate Whannel and Cherry Wilson. We'll be back on Tuesday morning.  British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving to England from ""red list"" countries have begun to self-isolate in hotels. Wiehann Meyer travelled from Johannesburg to the UK for a new job and has just begun his 10-day hotel quarantine alongside a friend, with whom he has been able to share the cost. This video can not be played Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent With every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid. Science, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy. It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago. But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results. There is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants. No vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it.Thatâs why advances in treatment are vital too. A cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances. There is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back. Radio 4 PM Ministers risk ""dashing hope"" by setting dates for the lifting of lockdown restrictions, a government adviser has warned. Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, spoke to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme. He said: âIf you ask 'when' questions - or speculate about dates - in effect, you render people passive. ""You donât pose the real question, which is: what can we all do to bring infections down? âIf you set a date and then you change it, you donât give people hope, you dash hope. You bring despair. ""You create whatâs called âlearned helplessnessâ, where people begin to feel weâre not in control of anything. Those are the conditions under which people give up.â The full interview can be foundhere, 48 minutes in. Reality Check NHS Englandâs Sir Simon Stevens has said that figures were published weekly on the uptake of the vaccine by
different ethnic minority groups. But the numbers released arenât
particularly helpful. They are not broken down by age or
by region, meaning we canât see how well the older, priority groups are being
targeted. Nor do we have a good idea on how
large these communities actually are because the last census was a decade ago. This makes it difficult to work
out what percentage of each group has had the vaccine. What we do know is that a
large-scale study by the OpenSafely survey suggested thatblack people over 80 were almost half,externalas likely to
have had the vaccine than white people over 80. However, this study is now over
two weeks old. Another more recent study fromLeicesterâs main NHS trustfound that just 36% of black staff had their first
dose. This was compared with 71% of white staff. Here is a quick look at coronavirus around the UK in numbers. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Thinking about what the future might look can feel like a fairly futile exercise sometimes, with so much up in the air. But Boris Johnson did just offer up at least one interesting glimpse. He suggested there could well be rapid testing for people heading off to venues like nightclubs and theatres; a way of keeping a lid on infection rates in those parts of the economy that are the âtoughest nuts to crackâ. That may be some way off yet and thereâll be plenty of questions as to exactly how that would work. But it does shine a little light on what life might look like in the ""new normal"". Reality Check The lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs has
written to the prime minister demanding that all coronavirus rules be lifted by
the end of April. The group argues that once the top nine priority groups have been
vaccinated - which the government says it aims to complete by May - there will
be âno justificationâ for the restrictions. The success of the vaccine rollout means by 1 May âabout 99% of
deaths & 80% hospitalisations from Covid protected,â CRG Deputy Chair Steve
Bakertweeted,external. Might that be the case? In early December, England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof
Jonathan Van-Tam said itcould be possible to cut deaths by 99%if everyone on the
priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective â but this was
before the decision to delay second doses was announced. If the rollout progresses on schedule, some in those priority
groups will have only just received their first vaccine at the end of April, so
will not be fully protected. There is also a possibility the vaccine will be less effective
against some variants of the virus, and the take-up, while high, is very unlikely
to be 100%.  Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter More data from Israel's
vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic
infections. This indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger
population as it did in the clinical trials. It is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe
disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai
Levine. ""High vaccination coverage of the most susceptible
groups"" is key, he says. Israel is the first country in the world to see the impact of its vaccination programme, but it took significant population coverage and several weeks to reach this stage.

As tricky as it is, Tocilizumab is a word Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to get familiar with saying, as the drug normally used to treat arthritis could be a potential life-saver, according to research. This video can not be played Health workers in Peru began receiving the vaccine a week ago A second minister in Peru has resigned amid growing
anger over revelations that senior officials have received the coronavirus
vaccine well ahead of the public. Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete tweeted that she had
been inoculated in January and called it a âserious mistakeâ. Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti stepped down last
week after it emerged former President Martin Vizcarra was vaccinated in
October. Mr Vizcarraâs vaccination came just a few weeks beforehe was impeachedand removed from office on charges of being morally incompetent. Peru has been hit hard by the pandemic, recording
more than 1.2 million cases and over 43,700 deaths. Vaccinations of health workers began just over a
week ago but no date has yet been set to roll out the programme to the wider
public. NHS England chief Simon Stevens was speaking at the Downing Street press conference this afternoon. He described the race to vaccinate people as ""two sprints and a marathon"". This video can not be played Reality Check At
the UK government briefing, the chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens
said:â Weâre up against the
pandemic of Covid and weâre up against a pandemic of disinformationâ. False
and misleading claims about vaccines have been circulating on social media for
many months. They
include baseless conspiracy
theories that mass vaccinations are part of a secret plan to microchip people
or that they can somehow alter human DNA. BBCReality Check has looked at many of these- including recent posts on vaccines
and fertility â such as the false claim that vaccines contain proteins which
could lead the body to attack the placenta. Some
argue that Covid disinformation may be
affecting vaccine take-up. In an experiment, BBC Panorama showed a panel one videofilled with falsehoods - to see how it affected their willingness to get a jab.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca
vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization for emergency
use, which means it will be part of the WHOâs global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax. The vaccine will be produced at two plants - by SKBio in South Korea and the Serum Institute of India - and so had to be approved twice. ""We
now have all the pieces in place for the rapid distribution of vaccines,""
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""But we still need to scale up production."" The Oxford vaccine is seen as the ""vaccine for the
world"" as it is cheap, can be mass produced and is stored in a standard
fridge. It hasattracted controversy about its effectivenessagainst new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far
apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data. But a review by the WHO found that it met the
""must-have"" criteria for safety, and its benefits outweighed the risks. Today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing was led by the prime minister. He was joined by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, and Prof Chris
Whitty, the chief medical officer. Here's what they said: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Could this be the last lockdown? That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the governmentâs stated aim. It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in. Who knew then that weâd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later? Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis. Today, again, heâs urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine roll-out goes well. Thatâs because ministers really donât want to lift restrictions only to re-impose them again on a weary nation. The media questions wrap up with Alistair Smout from Reuters asking if it is the vaccine reducing infection cases or the national lockdown. He also asks who the PM holds responsible for a lack of transparency surrounding about the origins of the virus. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says the impact of the vaccine should become clear when looking at the data of those who have been vaccinated, in the order in which they received their dose. He adds that the UK's data set is not yet big enough to ""see with the naked eye"". On the second question, Boris Johnson says ""most evidence"" points to the disease having originated in Wuhan and stresses the importance of gathering as much evidence as possible. He also says a global treaty on pandemics is ""an attractive idea"". Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks the PM about quarantine hotels in the UK - he wants to know if people will have to pay extra if their release is delayed due to testing positive. What if they can't pay, he asks? He also wants to know what mental health provision is being made for these people being confined to a single room. Boris Johnson says it's currently illegal to travel abroad for holidays anyway so he would expect people coming in to the UK to be able to cover their costs. He says mental health support would be made available to whoever needs it. Sir Simon Stevens is asked why, when the UK is vaccinating an average of 435,000 people a day, the target for giving all over-50s a jab is the end of April. Sir Simon says the second doses still need to be administered and that the issue is vaccine supply. If supplies increase, then it ""looks like we can go faster"".  The Financial Times' Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe asks what steps the government has taken on vaccine hesitancy and disinformation among minority groups. She also asks about the possibility of vaccine passports. NHS head Sir Simon Stevens says there is ""real concern about hesitancy on the part of some black and South Asian communities"". He adds that there is a ""huge effort"" to overcome that hesitancy and suggests there is ""meaningful progress"". ""We are up against a pandemic of Covid and a pandemic of misinformation,"" he says. On vaccine passports, Boris Johnson says there are lots of discussions to be had but says at the moment the preferred route is one that relies on mass vaccinations plus rapid testing for places such as nightclubs and theatres. Earlier, Hannah from Glasgow asked whether a mental health spokesperson can speak at the next briefing to set out to the public how they can access mental health support. The PM says it is a ""good idea"" and suggests that Dr Alex George - ex-Love Islander and the government's youth mental health ambassador - could appear. ""We'll try and find the right person to say something about how to do this and how to encourage everybody, really, to look after our mental wellbeing and try and keep going through this pandemic,"" he says. ""I hope there isn't that much longer to go now, but clearly people have been under a lot of pressure and we've got to address that."" He urges people to make use of NHS and charity mental health services and says the government has put a further Â£500m into supporting NHS mental health services. Prof Chris Whitty points out that one of the next priority groups for vaccination is people who have got ""significant mental health problems"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Progress must be 'cautious but irreversible' The government's plan to move England out of lockdown will be ""cautious but irreversible"", Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister is due to set out the roadmap for ending restrictions next Monday. He told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes ""if we possibly can"", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays. It comes as a group of Tory MPs call for a commitment to a ""free life"" and ending of lockdown measures before May. Senior backbencher Steve Baker said he wants the prime minister to ""let us reclaim our lives, once and for all"". The PM is likely to be questioned about his plans later when he hosts a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT - alongside England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens. New vaccine rollout phase begins Future lockdowns in Wales not ruled out When will lockdown rules be reviewed? On Sunday, the government said it met its target to offer a vaccine to the 15 million most vulnerable people across the UK. Figures on Monday showed a 29% drop in the number of positive cases across the country, down to 9,765 - the lowest figure since 2 October. But there are still concerns over the numbers, with over 88,000 cases recorded in the last week - an average of 157 cases per 100,000 - and 4,598 people dying within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. Labour said the government must ""lock in the gains of the vaccine"" and ensure more measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus - such as financial support for self-isolation and updated workplace guidance. Mr Johnson and senior members of his cabinet are set to spend the week looking into the latest coronavirus statistics before making an announcement on its plans. He said: ""The dates that we'll be setting out will be the dates by which we hope we can do something at the earliest."" There has been a raft of speculation on the date of re-openings of businesses and hospitality - much of which has been dismissed by Downing Street. But sources in No 10 told the BBC they were increasingly confident pupils in England would return to school on 8 March -the earliest the PM said the move could happen. Mr Johnson said no decisions had been taken yet, but the March date for schools had ""for a long time been a priority of the government and families up and down the country"". He added: ""We will do everything we can to make that happen, but we have got to keep looking at the data. ""There are still 23,000 or so Covid patients in the NHS - more than at the April peak last year - there are still sadly too many people dying of this disease; and rates of infection, although they are coming down, are still comparatively high. ""So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see."" Over the weekend, 63 Tory MPs wrote to Mr Johnson, calling for easing to begin in March and for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Mr Baker, who is the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should re-open by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. The proposal was rejected by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the government would be ""cautious"". Butwriting in the Telegraph,external, Mr Baker reasserted his plan, saying: ""As the prime minister said, let us reclaim our lives, once and for all. This can be a moment of unity - for our country and the Conservative Party - as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism to a much brighter future."" Fellow CRG member and Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the government ""have to think about livelihoods"", telling BBC Radio Essex: ""The moment you open schools up then there is no excuse for not opening up the rest of the economy."" Hospitality bosses are asking the government to reopen pubs by April, withthe chairman of Wetherspoon warning the industry is ""on its knees""and jobs are on the line. The plea comes after industry figures showed the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year - triple the tally in 2019. More than a dozen MPs have also called on Mr Johnson to allow restricted weddings to return from 8 March, followed by restriction-free weddings from 1 May. Tory former minister Esther McVey said after the top nine groups of people are vaccinated, it should be ""a huge moment for the UK to hold its head up high, for couples to walk down the aisle, and for families up and down the country to reunite, to celebrate and to plan their futures"". Any broad political consensus that existed in the early days of this pandemic has long gone. The Tory MPs that make up the Covid Recovery Group have been increasingly critical of prolonged restrictions. This is a group containing some senior Conservatives who are willing to be vocal, and willing to exert pressure on the prime minister. Their stance will no doubt be a factor in Downing Street's thinking. But it would be wrong to assume lockdown scepticism is representative of everyone on the Tory benches. Of more than 360 Conservative MPs, 63 signed the latest letter to Boris Johnson urging an easing of restrictions as soon as possible. That's not an inconsiderable number. However, there are also Tory MPs that advocate a more cautious approach, as do plenty on the opposition benches. The pressure from some in his party to move quickly out of lockdown creates tricky political tension for the prime minister - but it's not necessarily a majority view. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? Another senior Tory backbencher, Robert Halfon, said the PM needed to ""provide some kind of optimism to the public"" over lockdown easing, but warned against people relaxing too soon. The chair of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""I understand where [the Covid Recovery Group] are coming from and my heart has a lot of sympathy. ""I just don't want a repetition of what went on last year where we thought we were over the worst and then we're suddenly back in tiers of lockdown."" Meanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not want to give a ""cast iron guarantee"" about future lockdowns. He said: ""The danger is we try to set out absolutes - with talk of whether this is irreversible, or whether nothing else will happen in the future. ""What we want to do is make choices based on the best available data and information, to see case rates driven as low as possible, and then to have a cautious exit out of the current lockdown we're in.""

"The chairman of JD Wetherspoon is calling for pubs to reopen at the same time as non-essential shops. Tim Martin warned that the pub industry was ""on its knees"" and needed to reopen to save jobs. He said pubs made a massive contribution to the economy, with the Wetherspoons chain paying about Â£10 of tax for every pound of profit it made. His call comes after the boss of rival pub chain Young's said pubs should be reopened by April. Pubs, bars and restaurants across most of the UK are currently closed, although they can offer takeaway food and drink within certain restrictions. Scientists have said talk of reopening them is premature. 'Optimistic' PM plots 'cautious' lockdown easing Run Eat Out to Help Out again, says takeaway giant Will the UK's pubs stay shut until May? But Mr Martin argued that pubs and restaurants were ""Covid-secure environments"", having invested in safety measures such as plastic screens in front of tills, table service-only and floor markings to illustrate one-way systems around pub venues. ""Surely it is possible for the hospitality industry to reopen at the same time as non-essential shops, now that a vaccine exists, on the basis of the social distancing and hygiene regulations,"" he said. He also suggested that various lockdown measures imposed on pubs since March last year could spell a ""disaster"" for the public finances. In the financial year to July 2019, before the coronavirus crisis started, JD Wetherspoon, its customers and employees generated Â£764m of taxes, he said. ""The amount of tax paid by Wetherspoon is replicated, according to the size of the company, throughout the pub industry, and shows just how important pubs are to the economy,"" he said. Pubs in England can no longer sell alcohol to take away, only for delivery On Sunday, the chief executive of the Young's pub chain, Patrick Dardis, accused the prime minister of a ""lack of respect"" for the sector and of basing the decision to close pubs on ""unproven"" science - a claim that experts dispute. He said major pub chief executives, including himself, were leaving an industry forum set up by small business minister Paul Scully. He declined to name the executives. He said the industry needed a ""road map"" to reopening with social distancing restrictions in place, but that these should only last for a few months. Mr Dardis suggested during an interview with the BBC's World at One programme on Monday that pubs should reopen for Easter weekend, ""accepting that there would be social distancing"" measures in place. However, Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said talk of reopening pubs by April was premature. ""What the executives of pubs need to know is that failure to get it right equals back to square one. And back to square one equals much more pain economically, much more hardship."" He said people drank alcohol to relax and ""one of the consequences of relaxing is that you drop your guard"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously saidhe is ""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans on 22 February for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown - despite scientists' warnings against measures being rolled back too quickly. On Saturday, he said ""huge progress"" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March. After this, the government would look to open non-essential shops, followed by the hospitality sector, he said. UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls recently warned that a May restartwould be later than had been expected and that there could be ""very little"" left to reopen if closures last that long. Industry figures,externalreleased last week show the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year, triple the tally in 2019. With the pub and restaurant industry one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic,Wetherspoons last year slumped to its first annual pre-tax loss since 1984. Mr Martin also sold more than Â£50m worth of shares in the company in January. It came amid ""significant buying interest"" following a previous share placing announced by Wetherspoons, the company said. Some of those funds will go towards buying new pubs, which it expected to produce higher returns when they are allowed to reopen.

"Mercedes-Benz is recalling more than one million cars over a safety defect with the cars' emergency call system. The problem is with the cars' eCall feature, which alerts emergency services of an accident and relays a vehicle's location to them. But a fault means it is possible that the wrong location could be sent. The problem affects 1,292,258 cars in the United States, and the company says it is preparing a fix for customers in other countries too. The safety recall information form the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that Mercedes ""determined that a safety risk cannot be ruled out"". Because the problem is software-related, the fix can usually be done ""over the air"" - via a wireless download using the car's existing mobile data connection. But if it cannot, due to a bad connection or other problems, owners will be able to bring their cars into an authorised dealer to have the update applied. The eCall system is mandatory in the EU for all cars sold since 2018- and the US documents reveal that the reason for the investigation was a known case of the wrong location being sent ""in the European market"" in October 2019. Mercedes-Benz in the UK told the BBC: ""This software update will also be implemented in other countries and we are in close contact with the local authorities."" But it said it was not providing any further details until an official announcement of the fix. In the US, all 1,292,258 affected vehicles will have to receive a software update to fix the problem. That includes more than 200 different models and variants made between 2016 and 2021, including: CLA-Class, GLA-Class, GLE-Class, GLS-Class, SLC-Class A-Class, GT-Class, C-Class, E-Class, S-Class, CLS-Class SL-Class, B-Class, GLB-Class, GLC-Class, and G-Class vehicles The fault, Mercedes said, was in the software connected to the communications module used by the emergency call system. ""In rare cases, this could mean that in the event of an accident-related temporary drop in a vehicle's voltage, the communication module might not communicate the correct current position when an emergency call is made/triggered,"" a spokeswoman for the car-maker said. ""All other functions of the automatic and manual emergency call function remain fully operational,"" she added. Mercedes also said that it had discovered the fault itself due to its safety monitoring programme, which it said was a ""top priority"" for the company.

"Jaguar Land Rover's Jaguar brand will be all-electric by 2025, the carmaker has said. The company will launch electric models of its entire Jaguar and Land Rover line-up by 2030, it added. The firm said it would keep all three of its three British plants open as part of its new strategy. But it has dropped plans to build an electric version of its XJ saloon at the Castle Bromwich plant, meaning the site will eventually stop making cars. Chief executive Thierry BollorÃ© said the plant would focus instead on ""non-production"" activities in the long term, without giving details. The company plans to spend about Â£2.5bn a year on new technology for its cars. This is a big move for Jaguar Land Rover, but the reality is it has little choice. Like other manufacturers, it is under pressure to reduce the CO2 emissions from its fleet, as new regulations come into force in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time, sales of diesels - which generally produce less CO2 than petrol engines - have been plummeting. And in the longer term, the UK government wants to outlaw the sale of all wholly petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Governments in other countries are moving in the same general direction. The problem is, electric cars cost more to design and build than conventional models, meaning it is currently hard to make a profit from them. Bigger manufacturers can throw money at the problem now, and hope to benefit from economies of scale later. JLR is a smaller company and can't do that - so instead it will re-emphasise Jaguar's credentials as a luxury brand when it goes all-electric. That might make sense from a marketing point of view, but making the sums add up looks like a steep challenge. It will also invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Fuel cells provide electric power, without producing tailpipe emissions - water is the only by-product. However, in order for them to be truly environmentally friendly, the hydrogen itself needs to be produced using renewable sources. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the announcement was ""a huge step for British car manufacturing"". Carmakers are under pressure to meet stringent carbon emission demands in Europe and China, as well as customer demand for high-performance electric cars with a luxury or performance feel. The UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Luxury car brand Bentley Motors, owned by Germany's Volkswagen, said in November its range will be fully electric by 2030, and last month General Motors said it aimed to have a zero tailpipe emission line-up by 2035.

"Unions, women's groups and charities have asked the UK's equalities watchdog to investigate whether the government broke the law in its pandemic response. The groups claim some of the decisions taken by government are ""deepening inequalities"" faced by women. Their intervention comes a week after a committee of MPs said the government's response to Covid had ""repeatedly skewed towards men"". The government said it had offered ""unprecedented"" help in the pandemic. A spokesman said measures included help for the sectors where women are more likely to be employed, protection for female led start-ups and new childcare support. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said it had concerns about the ""particularly negative impact it [the pandemic] has had on women"". It added: ""While government focuses on the current crisis we do not consider it appropriate to use our legal powers, but we will be seeking to input into the promised review of the government's response and decisions taken."" Government's Covid help 'skewed towards men' - MPs 'I had to give up my job to home school my son' Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' In a letter to the commission, the groups - including the TUC, the Fawcett Society and Save the Children -  suggest the government may have failed to meet its legal obligations to consider the impact of its policies on women. They are asking the commission chair Baroness Falkner to launch an investigation, and urging ministers to carry out equality impact assessments of the furlough and self employment schemes. Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said the needs of women had been over looked ""at every stage of this pandemic"". ""Low-paid women have been excluded from getting sick pay, self-employed women who have taken maternity leave have lost out on vital financial help and women have had to take on primary caring responsibility for children,"" she said. ""The impact of school closures and childcare has put many women in an impossible situation because the right support has not been put in place."" She added that many had been forced to cut their hours or leave their jobs altogether. Another signatory to the letter - Anna Whitehouse from parenting website Mother Pukka - said equality had been ""swept off the table as privileged fathers in politics (often with nannies) decide the fate of mothers"". Responding to the letter the government insisted that every department considered the impact of its policies on inequality. ""As we seek to build back better following the pandemic everyone will play a crucial part and we will reflect that in our policy development,"" a spokesman said. This video can not be played Sharon Luca says she has ""the brunt of everything"" as she tries to juggle work and home-schooling Last week, MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee raised similar concernsin a report which said,externalministers had ""repeatedly"" failed to consider existing inequalities in the labour market when designing job and income support schemes. Their report argued that women are more likely to be employed in less secure work, and in sectors that have been shut down during the pandemic. It warned that women had borne the brunt of extra caring responsibilities, putting pressure on working mothers, and that pregnant women and new mothers are at risk of discrimination in a tough jobs market. The committee also said the government's plans for an economic recovery was too-male focused and called for more training and support for women.

"Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has given Monday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing Those aged between 65 and 69 - as well as younger people at greater risk - will be the next to get vaccinated He says he cannot give a ""cast iron guarantee"" new restrictions would not be imposed after the current lockdown ends Sixteen more deaths with coronavirus have been reported by Public Health Wales The number of people vaccinated has reached 784,809, up by 13,158 from Sunday's update It means a total equal to 24.9% of the Welsh population have now had the vaccine Lola Mayor and Richard Porter Thanks for following our coverage of today's Welsh Government press briefing. Here is a summary of today's updates:  That's the end of our live coverage for today, but you can keep up to date on the BBC News website and our updates on social media.  Analysis by Steve Duffy, BBC News This week should see the start of a more even split between first and
second doses of the vaccine. The total of second doses now stands at 5,402 - with Sunday seeing the most given out in
a single day so far. We can already see more second doses being given out in Wales since the
start of the month - just under 2,000 in the previous week but 1,178 on Sunday
alone. That is set to rise as the Welsh vaccination programme aims to make more
in-roads into priority groups given a first dose two months ago. Using Saturday's figures for the whole of the UK we can already see Wales is now on a similar
daily rate to Scotland and above England in terms of second doses. This week will see a stock of 46,000 Pfizer doses being used. Another 56,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca will also be available, as the programme
of first doses also continues. But the next two weeks will see a planned reduction in supply, as
manufacturers prepare their processes for a significant ramp up of production
from March onwards. That is likely to be noticeable with some of the figures we are likely to
see in a few days time. The plan to ease lockdown restrictions in Wales has to be âbuilt around data not datesâ, says the Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price said: âAs a fundamental principle, the roadmap has to built around data not dates. Thatâs  absolutely critical so you can't set an arbitrary date. âSo let's build the strategy around data, not dates, and I think that the other principle is that we should go for a phased step-by-step approach rather than all at onceâ. âThe worst thing possible would be to move too quickly and be recklessâ out of lockdown, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was responding to a question during the coronavirus press briefing about when the public might be able to meet outdoors for a meal with another family. He said while it was important to be âupfront with the people of Walesâ he couldn't give any guarantees as to what restrictions might be eased in the coming months as it was dependent on levels of the virus. He said during each three-week review, the Welsh Government would be âclear and cautiousâ about what they expect to do, but added that the âworst thing possible would be to move too quickly and to be reckless and then to have to put the brakes onâ. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies says itâs right to be cautious over easing lockdown restrictions but he hoped gyms could be reopened âin an organised mannerâ. Mr Davies said: âBeing lockdown for as long as we have has put huge pressures on peopleâs mental well-being. ""I'd like to see some sort of consideration around gyms being allowed to come forward in an organised manner so that people can look to those avenues to help them with their well-being."" He also said a plan was needed to address the fact that one in five people in Wales were now on an NHS waiting list: âItâs imperative we start a programme to move through these waiting timesâ. People over 70 who have not had an appointment for a vaccine should contact their local health board, Vaughan Gething says. The health minister said it's ""disappointing"" some people in that group said they had not received a vaccine appointment. Mr Gething stressed that 89.5% of people aged 70 to 74 and more than 90% of over-75s had received their first dose of the vaccine. ""So we're getting to extraordinarily high numbers of people"", he said. ""People in the first four priority groups - that's people over the age of 70 - if they haven't had an appointment, then they should contact their health service."" He said people in the next groups would be contacted soon. ""Everyone else please wait for the health service to contact you because I think we've shown successfully we're getting through this very quickly when supplies increase again, you can expect the rate of delivery to rapidly increase too."" The health minister says the Welsh Government is looking at âsmall thingsâ to ease out of lockdown but he wouldnât speculate on what measures were being discussed. âWe are looking to see if there are other small things we can do,"" Vaughan Gething said. âThere will be no widescale opening-up and lots of mixing between different households."" But he said he would ânot get drawn into speculationâ ahead of Fridayâs announcement where ministers will outline details of the next three-week phase of lockdown. Vaughan Gething says he would not want to
give a ""cast iron guarantee"" that lockdown measures wouldn't be
reimposed in future after being lifted in Wales. The health minister said there was a
""danger"" of setting out ""absolutes"" by talking about
whether lockdown lifting was ""irreversible."" The Prime Minister has said his plan to move England out of lockdown would be""cautious but irreversible"". But Mr Gething said: ""If we make cautious steps outwards
then it will still very much feel like a form of lockdown for most people,
because we're not going to be returning straight away to what we thought of as
our normal lives just over a year ago. ""So yes we don't want to see a return to
having to introduce more restrictions, but I wouldn't say we can give a cast
iron guarantee that would never happen."" Mr Gething said if a number of restrictions
were removed but then there was a ""significant upswing"" in the virus
- such as a new variant - then Welsh ministers ""would have a responsibility
to act."" He said he thought the majority of people would rather see lockdown rules continue until it's safe to ease out of lockdown and ""people's greatest concern is coming out too quickly and having another return of the virus."" He said ""an unfinished pandemic"" was a ""significant public health risk"". The reduction in Covid-19 transmission in Wales shows lockdown ""has really worked"", according to the health minister. However Vaughan Gething said it was ""harder to tell"" what impact the early stages of the vaccine rollout was having on case numbers. He told the press conference vaccines ""will help to protect people when there is some more mixing."" But he added: ""Even though our positivity rates are less than 10%, we're still a very long way from the very low rates we were at at the end of the summer. ""As we go forward though, our declining death numbers that we're starting to see in Wales, we will just see them remain at those low levels and that will give us more room to make more choices in the future with the confidence that most of our most vulnerable citizens have had some protection from the vaccine."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says Welsh health boards have been working with Oxford University on Covid research which has saved lives. He said âthe large-scale studyâ, which involved 1,100 people from across Wales, was looking for treatments to help people taken to hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19. âIt has already shown the low-cost steroid dexamethasone reduces death by up to a third in people with severe respiratory complications,"" he said. âAnd it has just reported that an arthritis drug could save one in 25 severely ill coronavirus patientsâ. He said the research also helped show what treatments didnât work, including the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. Vaughan Gething says Covid variants mean that there needs to be a ""cautious approach"" to easing lockdown restrictions. âWe have to be very careful about how we come out of lockdown because of the presence of new and infectious strains of the virus in the UK,"" the health minister said. âThe highly-infectious Kent variant is now the most dominant strain of the virus in Wales. âClusters of a mutated version of the Kent strain have been identified just over our border in Bristol and Liverpool. ""And the UK government has extended its surge testing to more areas of England to try and detect and contain the South African variant"". He said 13 cases had been detected in Wales and all but two of these had had  links with international travel. ""These variants have added yet another dimension to the pandemic. Itâs important that we all work together to get levels of coronavirus in the community as low as we possibly can. ""The best way of reducing the likelihood of new variants emerging is  to keep new infections low"", he added. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Governmentâs priority is to get younger children back to school when it announces its review of the coronavirus restrictions on Friday. âWe have already said we will use whatever headroom we have to get our youngest children back into school after half-term,â he told the press conference. âWe have been working with local education authorities, with teaching and non-teaching staff unions to develop a phased and flexible plan to enable foundation phase to restart from next Mondayâ. He also said ministers were also âlooking at whether there are any other small changes we are able to make to give families a bit more flexibility after such a long lockdownâ. The ânext big effortâ is to vaccinate people in the priority groups five to nine - at the same time as providing second dose appointments to all those in the first four groups - says the health minister. Vaughan Gething said appointments will first be offered to people aged 65 to 69, as well as younger people with an underlying health condition or in residential care, as well as a ""great many unpaid carers who are looking after people who vulnerable"". However he said: âWe have to factor in a temporary slowdown of vaccine supply across the UK to our plans over the next couple of weeks. âI want to be clear we have worked this into our plans and this will not delay anyoneâs second dose appointment. âWe expect supplies to quickly pick up again by March and, if this happens, we will be on track to offer everyone in groups five to nine a vaccine by the end of Aprilâ.

The local authority with the highest case rate remains Wrexham, with 161.1 cases per 100,000 people. This is followed by Flintshire (134.5) and Powys (120.1). The lowest case rates in Wales are now in Bridgend (55.8), Pembrokeshire (42.9) and Ceredigion (24.8).  784,809 people have now received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in Wales. That is up 13,158 on the the number published on Sunday. The total is now equal to 24.9% of the Welsh population. Of these, 5,402 have now received their second dose. There have been 16 more deaths with Covid reported today by Public Health Wales. It takes the total number in Wales to 5,137. There were 363 new cases reported, meaning the country has now had 199,518 cases of the virus.  The drive to getall pupils a laptop for home-schooling is still falling short, a charity is warning. Business2Schools, which distributes refurbished technology to children, says a ""high volume of need"" remains. One teacher says a lot of families are still forced to share one device and there remains a fear that pupils' education will be irreparably damaged. Most children aged between three and seven are due to return to school on 22 February, after the half-term break, but for most others, learning from home will continue. The Welsh Government said 128,000 devices had been sent to local authorities with 54,000 more expected. There isevidence the Covid-19 vaccine rollout is already reducing deaths, a leading statistician says. Jennifer Rogers said there was a sharper drop in deaths among people aged 90 and over compared with those aged 50 to 59, who had not yet been vaccinated. Prof Rogers, a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said older people ""make up 10% of cases but 80% of deaths"". Across the UK, she said there had been a 35% reduction each week for the past fortnight in the number of deaths among people aged 90 and over, compared with a 22% drop among people aged 50 to 59. In Wales, a total of 771,651 people - 24.5% of the population - had been given their first dose of vaccine as of 22:00 GMT on Saturday. We'll get the latest data for Sunday shortly.

"Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has given Monday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing Those aged between 65 and 69 - as well as younger people at greater risk - will be the next to get vaccinated He says he cannot give a ""cast iron guarantee"" new restrictions would not be imposed after the current lockdown ends Sixteen more deaths with coronavirus have been reported by Public Health Wales The number of people vaccinated has reached 784,809, up by 13,158 from Sunday's update It means a total equal to 24.9% of the Welsh population have now had the vaccine Lola Mayor and Richard Porter Thanks for following our coverage of today's Welsh Government press briefing. Here is a summary of today's updates:  That's the end of our live coverage for today, but you can keep up to date on the BBC News website and our updates on social media.  Analysis by Steve Duffy, BBC News This week should see the start of a more even split between first and
second doses of the vaccine. The total of second doses now stands at 5,402 - with Sunday seeing the most given out in
a single day so far. We can already see more second doses being given out in Wales since the
start of the month - just under 2,000 in the previous week but 1,178 on Sunday
alone. That is set to rise as the Welsh vaccination programme aims to make more
in-roads into priority groups given a first dose two months ago. Using Saturday's figures for the whole of the UK we can already see Wales is now on a similar
daily rate to Scotland and above England in terms of second doses. This week will see a stock of 46,000 Pfizer doses being used. Another 56,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca will also be available, as the programme
of first doses also continues. But the next two weeks will see a planned reduction in supply, as
manufacturers prepare their processes for a significant ramp up of production
from March onwards. That is likely to be noticeable with some of the figures we are likely to
see in a few days time. The plan to ease lockdown restrictions in Wales has to be âbuilt around data not datesâ, says the Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price said: âAs a fundamental principle, the roadmap has to built around data not dates. Thatâs  absolutely critical so you can't set an arbitrary date. âSo let's build the strategy around data, not dates, and I think that the other principle is that we should go for a phased step-by-step approach rather than all at onceâ. âThe worst thing possible would be to move too quickly and be recklessâ out of lockdown, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was responding to a question during the coronavirus press briefing about when the public might be able to meet outdoors for a meal with another family. He said while it was important to be âupfront with the people of Walesâ he couldn't give any guarantees as to what restrictions might be eased in the coming months as it was dependent on levels of the virus. He said during each three-week review, the Welsh Government would be âclear and cautiousâ about what they expect to do, but added that the âworst thing possible would be to move too quickly and to be reckless and then to have to put the brakes onâ. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies says itâs right to be cautious over easing lockdown restrictions but he hoped gyms could be reopened âin an organised mannerâ. Mr Davies said: âBeing lockdown for as long as we have has put huge pressures on peopleâs mental well-being. ""I'd like to see some sort of consideration around gyms being allowed to come forward in an organised manner so that people can look to those avenues to help them with their well-being."" He also said a plan was needed to address the fact that one in five people in Wales were now on an NHS waiting list: âItâs imperative we start a programme to move through these waiting timesâ. People over 70 who have not had an appointment for a vaccine should contact their local health board, Vaughan Gething says. The health minister said it's ""disappointing"" some people in that group said they had not received a vaccine appointment. Mr Gething stressed that 89.5% of people aged 70 to 74 and more than 90% of over-75s had received their first dose of the vaccine. ""So we're getting to extraordinarily high numbers of people"", he said. ""People in the first four priority groups - that's people over the age of 70 - if they haven't had an appointment, then they should contact their health service."" He said people in the next groups would be contacted soon. ""Everyone else please wait for the health service to contact you because I think we've shown successfully we're getting through this very quickly when supplies increase again, you can expect the rate of delivery to rapidly increase too."" The health minister says the Welsh Government is looking at âsmall thingsâ to ease out of lockdown but he wouldnât speculate on what measures were being discussed. âWe are looking to see if there are other small things we can do,"" Vaughan Gething said. âThere will be no widescale opening-up and lots of mixing between different households."" But he said he would ânot get drawn into speculationâ ahead of Fridayâs announcement where ministers will outline details of the next three-week phase of lockdown. Vaughan Gething says he would not want to
give a ""cast iron guarantee"" that lockdown measures wouldn't be
reimposed in future after being lifted in Wales. The health minister said there was a
""danger"" of setting out ""absolutes"" by talking about
whether lockdown lifting was ""irreversible."" The Prime Minister has said his plan to move England out of lockdown would be""cautious but irreversible"". But Mr Gething said: ""If we make cautious steps outwards

That is up 13,158 on the the number published on Sunday. The total is now equal to 24.9% of the Welsh population. Of these, 5,402 have now received their second dose. There have been 16 more deaths with Covid reported today by Public Health Wales. It takes the total number in Wales to 5,137. There were 363 new cases reported, meaning the country has now had 199,518 cases of the virus.  The drive to getall pupils a laptop for home-schooling is still falling short, a charity is warning. Business2Schools, which distributes refurbished technology to children, says a ""high volume of need"" remains. One teacher says a lot of families are still forced to share one device and there remains a fear that pupils' education will be irreparably damaged. Most children aged between three and seven are due to return to school on 22 February, after the half-term break, but for most others, learning from home will continue. The Welsh Government said 128,000 devices had been sent to local authorities with 54,000 more expected. There isevidence the Covid-19 vaccine rollout is already reducing deaths, a leading statistician says. Jennifer Rogers said there was a sharper drop in deaths among people aged 90 and over compared with those aged 50 to 59, who had not yet been vaccinated. Prof Rogers, a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said older people ""make up 10% of cases but 80% of deaths"". Across the UK, she said there had been a 35% reduction each week for the past fortnight in the number of deaths among people aged 90 and over, compared with a 22% drop among people aged 50 to 59. In Wales, a total of 771,651 people - 24.5% of the population - had been given their first dose of vaccine as of 22:00 GMT on Saturday. We'll get the latest data for Sunday shortly.

"Ms Ravi shared a document first posted by climate activist Greta Thunberg In India's southern city of Bangalore, Disha Ravi was a cheerful, familiar figure among local climate activists. The sprightly 22-year-old helped clean up lakes, plant trees and campaigned against plastic. She attended workshops, walked the streets demanding climate action, loved animals and spoke out against sexism and capital punishment. A vegan and the sole-earning member in her family, she worked with a local company that makes plant-based food. Ms Ravi is also one of the founders of the local wing of Fridays For Future, a global movement begun by climate change activist Greta Thunberg. Here, she participated in campaigns to preserve the lion-tailed macaque in an Indian bio-diversity spot, and stall a hydro power plant, among other causes. Living in a low-lying neighbourhood in a city which would get easily flooded during rains, she worried about climate change. Bangalore, she said, was experiencing severe rainfall and flooding these days. She had lived in the family home for 13 years, and found that the city had never experienced such heavy rains as it had in recent years. Ms Ravi did not mince her words. ""People of colour are suffering from the climate crisis first-hand - a lot of people don't give us attention that we need. The fact that you would choose to listen to a white person on the same issue rather than a person of colour, to me, is environmental racism,""she told Vogue,externalmagazine last year. The 21-year-old has helped clean up lakes, plant trees and campaigned against plastic Friends and fellow campaigners say she is a law-abiding activist. During a recent campaign to save trees in her city, Ms Ravi went to the police and sought permission. ""We have interacted during many campaigns to protect the environment. I always noticed she never transgressed the law,"" said Tara Krishnaswamy, a veteran activist. At the weekend, Ms Ravi was arrested after sharing a document intended to help farmers protest against new agriculture reform laws. The police say she was a ""key conspirator"" in the formulation and dissemination"" of the document. The so-called ""toolkit"", which suggested ways of helping the farmers, was tweeted by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. ""The call was to wage economic, social, cultural and regional war against India,"" the police said. They say Ms Ravi ""collaborated"" with separatist groups to ""spread disaffection against the Indian state"". In court, Ms Ravi, accused of sedition and conspiracy, broke down and told the judge she had merely edited two lines of the document. But police believe she shared the document with Ms Thunberg, and then asked her to remove it after it was ""accidentally"" leaked. The court remanded her to police custody. Ms Ravi's arrest has sparked a firestorm of protest and shocked many Indians. The chief minister of Delhi, run by an opposition party, has called the arrest""an unprecedented attack on democracy"". A journalist wondered how ""editing publicly available documents,externalthat help people coordinate views disagreeing with those of the government can be an act of sedition"". Yet another journalist tweeted: ""Themessage is clear,external: lock up your children, stop them protesting, or we will"". There have been protests against Ms Ravi's arrest Last July, the Delhi police temporarily blocked the website of Fridays For Future India, describing its content as ""objectionable"" and depicting an ""unlawful or terrorist act"". Members said all that it had done was swamp the environment ministry with thousands of emails inprotest against an environmental law. ""In India,people continue to suffer because of laws that are anti-people,external. We live in a country where dissent is suppressed. We in Fridays For Future India were labelled terrorists for objecting to the law]. Only a government that puts profit over people would consider asking for clean air, clean water and a liveable planet, an act of terrorism,"" Ms Ravi told an interviewer at the time. In September, she toldThe Guardian,external: ""Countries like India are already experiencing a climate crisis. We are just not fighting for our future, we are fighting for our present. We, the people from the most affected [regions], are going to change the conversation in climate negotiations and lead a just recovery plan that benefits people and not the pockets of our government"". In a videointerview,,externalthe feisty and outspoken young campaigner made it clear that she is no fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Mr Modi has convinced everybody that everything he is doing is good. There are so many questionable things about his governance. Not just in terms of equal rights but environmental rights or human rights."" ""My parents support him, I know."" Her friends describe Ms Ravi as a bright student, who won debates in college, where she graduated in business administration with a specialisation in finance. Like many young people of her generation, she loves Bollywood songs, binge-watches Netflix shows, loves cooking and pampers her dog. She plans on doing a masters in conservation: her role model is the world-famous conservation activist, Jane Goodall. Ms Ravi's friends and co-workers say she is a ""funny, goofy girl"" who is often late to events. ""We get irritated but we never say anything to her because she is so passionate about what she does,"" a friend said. The website of the Bangalore-based food company where she works mentions her as the ""youngest member"" who joined as an intern and then came on ""full time to work her magic on our customers by leading the company's direct-to-consumer efforts"". On social media, Ms Ravi has posted about Olive Ridley turtles, doing away with plastic and posed for pictures with her kitten and her dog. A Harry Potter fan, she has also shared pictures of Evanna Lynch. On Facebook, she calls herself a ""carrot enthusiast"". On Instagram, she describes herself as ""climate worried.""

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged care staff to come forward to be vaccinated A third of social care staff in England have not had the Covid-19 vaccine, the health secretary has said, despite them being among the groups prioritised. Matt Hancock said it was ""very important"" for the staff, patients and society that they get the jab. Meanwhile, a hospital trust has revealed thatonly 36.8% of its black staff have had the vaccine. Everyone in the top four groups has had a jab offer and 15 million people have had a first dose, the government says. The rollout in England has officially been expanded to those aged 65 and over and younger people in at-risk groups. Tory MPs call for end to lockdown by May Hotel quarantine comes into force in UK Watchdog urged to investigate UK pandemic response In a bid to encourage more social care staff to have the jab, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""It is the right thing to do. It is very important that you come forward and take up this vaccine. It's important for you, it's important for your patients and of course it's important for the whole of society."" Analysis from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trusthas revealed lower proportions of black and Asian staff being vaccinated. It found that 70.9% of white staff had come forward, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff. University of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community. We want everyone to get the jab when they are called to do so."" Are you a social care or NHS worker who has yet to be vaccinated? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Upload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged those eligible to receive the vaccine to come forward. ""These jabs, these vaccines are safe, they are efficacious, they will help protect you against disease and against death and they're a wonderful thing to have - they help protect you, your family, your neighbours,"" Mr Johnson said. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said he would be talking to clinical leaders from various ethnic groups ""to work out together how we can encourage everybody to take up the vaccine"". Christina McAnea, general secretary of the trade union, Unison, said getting as many care workers as possible to have the Covid jab should be achieved through ""encouragement and persuasion"". She said care workers must be provided with ""the correct information"" and ""time to ask the experts about their concerns, think things through and talk to colleagues who've had the jab"". The uptake among care workers isn't surprising - they tend to come forward in lower numbers for the flu jab. It illustrates the need to continue reaching out to those who have not taken up the offer. The fear is some of the most vulnerable and deprived communities have the lowest levels of uptake, which would widen inequalities in the future. Today, though, marks an important milestone. But that is all it is. Most Covid deaths have come in the over-70s, but just over half of hospitalisations have. It means there are a significant number at risk in the 50 to 70 age group as well as younger adults with health conditions. They have been promised a jab by the end of April. Achieving that will not be easy. From March people will start needing second doses, which means the rate at which first doses are given is expected to tail off. As always, everything depends on supply. Ministers are confident in the supply of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and by Easter the deliveries of a third jab made by Moderna should arrive. There can be no let up. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said that there was still ""some way to go"" before easing lockdown. He said: ""At the latest count there are still over 23,000 people in hospital with Covid - that's more than in the April peak."" It is 69 days sincethe UK began its mass vaccination programme- and six weeks since the prime minister set out the pledge to offer a first dose to the four priority groups by 15 February. That meant vaccinating all elderly care home residents and their carers; everyone over 70; all frontline health and social care workers; and everyone with a condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to the virus - a total of 14.6 million people. Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing Mr Johnson hailed the vaccine rollout as an ""unprecedented achievement"" and said the country can go into the next stage ""with great confidence"". Five unanswered questions about the vaccine rollout Will I need a vaccine passport to travel? But whilethe UK's vaccination rate is third in the world, behind only Israel and the United Arab Emirates, there have been reports that some people in priority groups - including those who are housebound - are still waiting for their first dose. And a small number of the 15 million people vaccinated will have been outside these initial priority groups as some NHS regions had already begun giving jabs to younger people. As well as the over-65s, the next group to be offered the vaccine is the estimated 7.3 million people aged 16 to 65 with a range of health conditions that put them at risk from the virus. The rollout will then be extended to the remaining over-50 age groups, with the aim of offering a first dose to another 17.2 million people before the end of April. Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that millions of people whose asthma is under controlwill not be prioritised for the vaccine. Mr Hancock said that 90% of the over-70s had accepted the vaccine and one in four adults were now starting to receive protection against Covid-19. The Department of Health said 88% of the UK's coronavirus deaths occurred in the priority groups who have now been offered the vaccine. On Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections,according to the latest government figures,external. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? With the expectation that increasing numbers of people will be protected from serious illness, ministers will this week finalise plans on how England's coronavirus measures can be eased. The government has said it will take ""cautious"" steps,rejecting calls from Conservative MPs to commit to abolishing all Covid-19 restrictions by the end of April.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Progress must be 'cautious but irreversible' The government's plan to move England out of lockdown will be ""cautious but irreversible"", Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister is due to set out the roadmap for ending restrictions next Monday. He told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes ""if we possibly can"", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays. It comes as a group of Tory MPs call for a commitment to a ""free life"" and ending of lockdown measures before May. Senior backbencher Steve Baker said he wants the prime minister to ""let us reclaim our lives, once and for all"". The PM is likely to be questioned about his plans later when he hosts a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT - alongside England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens. New vaccine rollout phase begins Future lockdowns in Wales not ruled out When will lockdown rules be reviewed? On Sunday, the government said it met its target to offer a vaccine to the 15 million most vulnerable people across the UK. Figures on Monday showed a 29% drop in the number of positive cases across the country, down to 9,765 - the lowest figure since 2 October. But there are still concerns over the numbers, with over 88,000 cases recorded in the last week - an average of 157 cases per 100,000 - and 4,598 people dying within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. Labour said the government must ""lock in the gains of the vaccine"" and ensure more measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus - such as financial support for self-isolation and updated workplace guidance. Mr Johnson and senior members of his cabinet are set to spend the week looking into the latest coronavirus statistics before making an announcement on its plans. He said: ""The dates that we'll be setting out will be the dates by which we hope we can do something at the earliest."" There has been a raft of speculation on the date of re-openings of businesses and hospitality - much of which has been dismissed by Downing Street. But sources in No 10 told the BBC they were increasingly confident pupils in England would return to school on 8 March -the earliest the PM said the move could happen. Mr Johnson said no decisions had been taken yet, but the March date for schools had ""for a long time been a priority of the government and families up and down the country"". He added: ""We will do everything we can to make that happen, but we have got to keep looking at the data. ""There are still 23,000 or so Covid patients in the NHS - more than at the April peak last year - there are still sadly too many people dying of this disease; and rates of infection, although they are coming down, are still comparatively high. ""So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see."" Over the weekend, 63 Tory MPs wrote to Mr Johnson, calling for easing to begin in March and for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Mr Baker, who is the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should re-open by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. The proposal was rejected by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the government would be ""cautious"". Butwriting in the Telegraph,external, Mr Baker reasserted his plan, saying: ""As the prime minister said, let us reclaim our lives, once and for all. This can be a moment of unity - for our country and the Conservative Party - as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism to a much brighter future."" Fellow CRG member and Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the government ""have to think about livelihoods"", telling BBC Radio Essex: ""The moment you open schools up then there is no excuse for not opening up the rest of the economy."" Hospitality bosses are asking the government to reopen pubs by April, withthe chairman of Wetherspoon warning the industry is ""on its knees""and jobs are on the line. The plea comes after industry figures showed the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year - triple the tally in 2019. More than a dozen MPs have also called on Mr Johnson to allow restricted weddings to return from 8 March, followed by restriction-free weddings from 1 May. Tory former minister Esther McVey said after the top nine groups of people are vaccinated, it should be ""a huge moment for the UK to hold its head up high, for couples to walk down the aisle, and for families up and down the country to reunite, to celebrate and to plan their futures"". Any broad political consensus that existed in the early days of this pandemic has long gone. The Tory MPs that make up the Covid Recovery Group have been increasingly critical of prolonged restrictions. This is a group containing some senior Conservatives who are willing to be vocal, and willing to exert pressure on the prime minister. Their stance will no doubt be a factor in Downing Street's thinking. But it would be wrong to assume lockdown scepticism is representative of everyone on the Tory benches. Of more than 360 Conservative MPs, 63 signed the latest letter to Boris Johnson urging an easing of restrictions as soon as possible. That's not an inconsiderable number. However, there are also Tory MPs that advocate a more cautious approach, as do plenty on the opposition benches. The pressure from some in his party to move quickly out of lockdown creates tricky political tension for the prime minister - but it's not necessarily a majority view. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? Another senior Tory backbencher, Robert Halfon, said the PM needed to ""provide some kind of optimism to the public"" over lockdown easing, but warned against people relaxing too soon. The chair of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""I understand where [the Covid Recovery Group] are coming from and my heart has a lot of sympathy. ""I just don't want a repetition of what went on last year where we thought we were over the worst and then we're suddenly back in tiers of lockdown."" Meanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not want to give a ""cast iron guarantee"" about future lockdowns. He said: ""The danger is we try to set out absolutes - with talk of whether this is irreversible, or whether nothing else will happen in the future. ""What we want to do is make choices based on the best available data and information, to see case rates driven as low as possible, and then to have a cautious exit out of the current lockdown we're in.""

"Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has given Monday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing Those aged between 65 and 69 - as well as younger people at greater risk - will be the next to get vaccinated He says he cannot give a ""cast iron guarantee"" new restrictions would not be imposed after the current lockdown ends Sixteen more deaths with coronavirus have been reported by Public Health Wales The number of people vaccinated has reached 784,809, up by 13,158 from Sunday's update It means a total equal to 24.9% of the Welsh population have now had the vaccine Lola Mayor and Richard Porter Thanks for following our coverage of today's Welsh Government press briefing. Here is a summary of today's updates:  That's the end of our live coverage for today, but you can keep up to date on the BBC News website and our updates on social media.  Analysis by Steve Duffy, BBC News This week should see the start of a more even split between first and
second doses of the vaccine. The total of second doses now stands at 5,402 - with Sunday seeing the most given out in
a single day so far. We can already see more second doses being given out in Wales since the
start of the month - just under 2,000 in the previous week but 1,178 on Sunday
alone. That is set to rise as the Welsh vaccination programme aims to make more
in-roads into priority groups given a first dose two months ago. Using Saturday's figures for the whole of the UK we can already see Wales is now on a similar
daily rate to Scotland and above England in terms of second doses. This week will see a stock of 46,000 Pfizer doses being used. Another 56,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca will also be available, as the programme
of first doses also continues. But the next two weeks will see a planned reduction in supply, as
manufacturers prepare their processes for a significant ramp up of production
from March onwards. That is likely to be noticeable with some of the figures we are likely to
see in a few days time. The plan to ease lockdown restrictions in Wales has to be âbuilt around data not datesâ, says the Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price said: âAs a fundamental principle, the roadmap has to built around data not dates. Thatâs  absolutely critical so you can't set an arbitrary date. âSo let's build the strategy around data, not dates, and I think that the other principle is that we should go for a phased step-by-step approach rather than all at onceâ. âThe worst thing possible would be to move too quickly and be recklessâ out of lockdown, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was responding to a question during the coronavirus press briefing about when the public might be able to meet outdoors for a meal with another family. He said while it was important to be âupfront with the people of Walesâ he couldn't give any guarantees as to what restrictions might be eased in the coming months as it was dependent on levels of the virus. He said during each three-week review, the Welsh Government would be âclear and cautiousâ about what they expect to do, but added that the âworst thing possible would be to move too quickly and to be reckless and then to have to put the brakes onâ. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies says itâs right to be cautious over easing lockdown restrictions but he hoped gyms could be reopened âin an organised mannerâ. Mr Davies said: âBeing lockdown for as long as we have has put huge pressures on peopleâs mental well-being. ""I'd like to see some sort of consideration around gyms being allowed to come forward in an organised manner so that people can look to those avenues to help them with their well-being."" He also said a plan was needed to address the fact that one in five people in Wales were now on an NHS waiting list: âItâs imperative we start a programme to move through these waiting timesâ. People over 70 who have not had an appointment for a vaccine should contact their local health board, Vaughan Gething says. The health minister said it's ""disappointing"" some people in that group said they had not received a vaccine appointment. Mr Gething stressed that 89.5% of people aged 70 to 74 and more than 90% of over-75s had received their first dose of the vaccine. ""So we're getting to extraordinarily high numbers of people"", he said. ""People in the first four priority groups - that's people over the age of 70 - if they haven't had an appointment, then they should contact their health service."" He said people in the next groups would be contacted soon. ""Everyone else please wait for the health service to contact you because I think we've shown successfully we're getting through this very quickly when supplies increase again, you can expect the rate of delivery to rapidly increase too."" The health minister says the Welsh Government is looking at âsmall thingsâ to ease out of lockdown but he wouldnât speculate on what measures were being discussed. âWe are looking to see if there are other small things we can do,"" Vaughan Gething said. âThere will be no widescale opening-up and lots of mixing between different households."" But he said he would ânot get drawn into speculationâ ahead of Fridayâs announcement where ministers will outline details of the next three-week phase of lockdown. Vaughan Gething says he would not want to
give a ""cast iron guarantee"" that lockdown measures wouldn't be
reimposed in future after being lifted in Wales. The health minister said there was a
""danger"" of setting out ""absolutes"" by talking about
whether lockdown lifting was ""irreversible."" The Prime Minister has said his plan to move England out of lockdown would be""cautious but irreversible"". But Mr Gething said: ""If we make cautious steps outwards
then it will still very much feel like a form of lockdown for most people,
because we're not going to be returning straight away to what we thought of as
our normal lives just over a year ago. ""So yes we don't want to see a return to
having to introduce more restrictions, but I wouldn't say we can give a cast
iron guarantee that would never happen."" Mr Gething said if a number of restrictions
were removed but then there was a ""significant upswing"" in the virus
- such as a new variant - then Welsh ministers ""would have a responsibility
to act."" He said he thought the majority of people would rather see lockdown rules continue until it's safe to ease out of lockdown and ""people's greatest concern is coming out too quickly and having another return of the virus."" He said ""an unfinished pandemic"" was a ""significant public health risk"". The reduction in Covid-19 transmission in Wales shows lockdown ""has really worked"", according to the health minister. However Vaughan Gething said it was ""harder to tell"" what impact the early stages of the vaccine rollout was having on case numbers. He told the press conference vaccines ""will help to protect people when there is some more mixing."" But he added: ""Even though our positivity rates are less than 10%, we're still a very long way from the very low rates we were at at the end of the summer. ""As we go forward though, our declining death numbers that we're starting to see in Wales, we will just see them remain at those low levels and that will give us more room to make more choices in the future with the confidence that most of our most vulnerable citizens have had some protection from the vaccine."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says Welsh health boards have been working with Oxford University on Covid research which has saved lives. He said âthe large-scale studyâ, which involved 1,100 people from across Wales, was looking for treatments to help people taken to hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19. âIt has already shown the low-cost steroid dexamethasone reduces death by up to a third in people with severe respiratory complications,"" he said. âAnd it has just reported that an arthritis drug could save one in 25 severely ill coronavirus patientsâ. He said the research also helped show what treatments didnât work, including the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. Vaughan Gething says Covid variants mean that there needs to be a ""cautious approach"" to easing lockdown restrictions. âWe have to be very careful about how we come out of lockdown because of the presence of new and infectious strains of the virus in the UK,"" the health minister said. âThe highly-infectious Kent variant is now the most dominant strain of the virus in Wales. âClusters of a mutated version of the Kent strain have been identified just over our border in Bristol and Liverpool. ""And the UK government has extended its surge testing to more areas of England to try and detect and contain the South African variant"". He said 13 cases had been detected in Wales and all but two of these had had  links with international travel. ""These variants have added yet another dimension to the pandemic. Itâs important that we all work together to get levels of coronavirus in the community as low as we possibly can. ""The best way of reducing the likelihood of new variants emerging is  to keep new infections low"", he added. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Governmentâs priority is to get younger children back to school when it announces its review of the coronavirus restrictions on Friday. âWe have already said we will use whatever headroom we have to get our youngest children back into school after half-term,â he told the press conference. âWe have been working with local education authorities, with teaching and non-teaching staff unions to develop a phased and flexible plan to enable foundation phase to restart from next Mondayâ. He also said ministers were also âlooking at whether there are any other small changes we are able to make to give families a bit more flexibility after such a long lockdownâ. The ânext big effortâ is to vaccinate people in the priority groups five to nine - at the same time as providing second dose appointments to all those in the first four groups - says the health minister. Vaughan Gething said appointments will first be offered to people aged 65 to 69, as well as younger people with an underlying health condition or in residential care, as well as a ""great many unpaid carers who are looking after people who vulnerable"". However he said: âWe have to factor in a temporary slowdown of vaccine supply across the UK to our plans over the next couple of weeks. âI want to be clear we have worked this into our plans and this will not delay anyoneâs second dose appointment. âWe expect supplies to quickly pick up again by March and, if this happens, we will be on track to offer everyone in groups five to nine a vaccine by the end of Aprilâ.

The local authority with the highest case rate remains Wrexham, with 161.1 cases per 100,000 people. This is followed by Flintshire (134.5) and Powys (120.1). The lowest case rates in Wales are now in Bridgend (55.8), Pembrokeshire (42.9) and Ceredigion (24.8).  784,809 people have now received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in Wales. That is up 13,158 on the the number published on Sunday. The total is now equal to 24.9% of the Welsh population. Of these, 5,402 have now received their second dose. There have been 16 more deaths with Covid reported today by Public Health Wales. It takes the total number in Wales to 5,137. There were 363 new cases reported, meaning the country has now had 199,518 cases of the virus.  The drive to getall pupils a laptop for home-schooling is still falling short, a charity is warning. Business2Schools, which distributes refurbished technology to children, says a ""high volume of need"" remains. One teacher says a lot of families are still forced to share one device and there remains a fear that pupils' education will be irreparably damaged. Most children aged between three and seven are due to return to school on 22 February, after the half-term break, but for most others, learning from home will continue. The Welsh Government said 128,000 devices had been sent to local authorities with 54,000 more expected. There isevidence the Covid-19 vaccine rollout is already reducing deaths, a leading statistician says. Jennifer Rogers said there was a sharper drop in deaths among people aged 90 and over compared with those aged 50 to 59, who had not yet been vaccinated. Prof Rogers, a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said older people ""make up 10% of cases but 80% of deaths"". Across the UK, she said there had been a 35% reduction each week for the past fortnight in the number of deaths among people aged 90 and over, compared with a 22% drop among people aged 50 to 59. In Wales, a total of 771,651 people - 24.5% of the population - had been given their first dose of vaccine as of 22:00 GMT on Saturday. We'll get the latest data for Sunday shortly.

"The first train to stop at Bow Street was not made public so people wouldn't be tempted to break Covid lockdown rules The name may be synonymous with a space on a Monopoly board and its connection to the birth of professional policing - but Bow Street has got its station back. However, it is not the Bow Street near Covent Garden in central London but its namesake near Aberystwyth in mid Wales. For the first time in 56 years, the village was joined to the rail network as the first train stopped on Sunday. The opening was kept low key as Wales is under a strict Covid-19 lockdown. So there was little fanfare when the 09:12 GMT service from Machynlleth to Aberystwyth stopped to pick up passengers at the Ceredigion village for the first time since 1965. Why one railway station lost 90% of its passengers All aboard the 'largest' model railway in the country House with 900ft model railway for sale It was just a precaution in case any overeager railway enthusiasts had been tempted to break the restrictions for that shot of the first diesel multiple-unit train parked up at Bow Street. The original Bow Street station closed in 1965 - and is now the site of a builders' merchant The other Bow Street in central London ""This is an important milestone for us and we'd have liked to celebrate it more but that is not appropriate and safe at the moment,"" acknowledged Transport for Wales chief executive James Price. The Â£8m project to reopen the station on the Cambrian Line that connects Aberystwyth and Pwllheli to Birmingham and Shrewsbury has been 11 years in the making. The new single-track halt with a park-and-ride is south of the old station. It closed after 101 years in the 1960s Beeching cuts which saw the end of thousands of stations around the UK. The former site now houses a builders' merchant. Bow Street is the first station to open in Wales sincePye Corner in Newportmore than six years ago - and other than some new trains, this is the first tangible marker for the Transport for Wales rail franchise. The Cardiff Parkway station on the outskirts of the city will link to the proposed South Wales Metro But Welsh ministers and rail bosses hope it is the first of many stations around Wales that are being considered to improve public transport infrastructure. A project to reopenSt Clears station in Carmarthenshire has secured Â£4.7m of UK government funding,externalwhile theWelsh Government wants UK government cash help to build stationsat Carno in Powys, Deeside Parkway in Flintshire and Ely Mill in Cardiff. A privately fundedÂ£30m Cardiff Parkway stationat St Mellons has also been backed by ministers in Wales. Four more stations -three in Newport and one at Magorin Monmouthshire - have also been recommended by a Welsh Government-backed commission looking to alleviate congestion on the M4 following thescrapping of a new Â£1.6bn motorway south of Newport. Bow Street Station was joint-funded by Welsh Government and UK government money But although Transport for Wales - which runs the Wales and Border rail franchise - is Welsh Government-owned, most rail infrastructure in Wales and across the UK is under Westminster control. ""We have lots of ambitions for reopening a number of railway stations and increasing the number of services but railways are run by the UK government,"" said Welsh Deputy Transport Minister Lee Waters. ""We're stuck in the sidings a little bit. Without UK government stepping up to the plate, we don't have the means to deliver them. ""We've called for extra powers to be given to Wales for railway infrastructure. We are being short-changed by Â£5bn over the next 10 years for the investment we need. "" The UK Government said the Welsh Government can and does invest in station construction and upgrade, in addition to the funding provided Westminster. ""This Government has committed a record Â£1.5 billion to the Welsh railways in recent years,"" added a Department for Transport spokesperson. ""The specification, procurement and management of rail services in Wales is devolved to Welsh ministers and we work closely with them."" Pre-Covid estimates made for the Welsh Government suggested Bow Street station would ""generate"" 30,000 annual trips and take nearly 466,000 vehicle miles (750,000km) off the local road network a year - helping reduce carbon emissions and congestion and parking issues in nearby Aberystwyth. Aberystwyth is a popular seaside resort and has a large student population due to its university ""The benefit for the amount of money invested here was higher here than anywhere else,"" said Mr Price. With its 70-space car park, bike shelter and 110-yard (100m) platform, the idea is for the station to be a local travel hub to take the pressure off the seaside and busy university town of Aberystwyth less than four miles away. ""Especially at rush hour and peak tourist season traffic is a problem,"" said Aberystwyth Business Club chairman John Glasby. The railway stations worth lingering at Rod Stewart reveals his epic model railway city How Wales was affected by Beeching's rail cuts ""Especially in a tight, cramped town with only two ways in and out - so hopefully a new park-and-ride station on the edge of town might alleviate that pressure on infrastructure and boost local trade. ""The estimate is if you invest Â£8m on local public transport infrastructure, the local economic benefit is three times that - so in this case about Â£24m."" But Mr Glasby, head of commercial services at Aberystwyth University, did say local businesses were ""split"" on whether Bow Street station was ""good value for money"" and could the ""money be better spent elsewhere helping the town"". How the route between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen would look if reopened ""The railway project people inAberystwyth really want is the reopening of the line to Carmarthenand the south Wales main line,"" he said. ""But that is massive, massive investment."" About Â£755m to be precise, according to afeasibility study published in 2018. Travelling between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen on the train currently takes about six hours compared with an hour and a half in the car - and the line is one of many across Wales people want to reopen. The Welsh Government states railway infrastructure is the UK government's ""responsibility"" and Mr Waters said it was money ministers in Cardiff Bay ""don't have"". It is hoped the new station could reduce traffic pressure in Aberystwyth ""I understand the strong wishes to do something to reinstate it,"" said Mr Price. ""But people will also understand that at the minute the significant cost involved."" But Transport for Wales engineers are looking at ""slightly different railway technologies"" to reinstate routes in ""a more cost-effective way"". Some people in the village have previously said they would continue to use the regular and quick bus service to Aberystwyth. The 102-year-old station at Carno in Powys was shut in the 1960s So there are a few envious eyes in Bow Street's direction from people who have been campaigning for a station in their village for years. A campaign group atCarno in Powysclaim the 27-minute journey between Machynlleth and Caersws is the ""longest stretch of railway in Wales without a station"" - and part of the reason why their station should be the one reopening, more than 50 years after the Beeching axe. A petition to reopen Carno station was presented to Cardiff Bay in 2007 ""It's fair to say we were disappointed when it was announced Bow Street would open,"" said Carno Station Action Group secretary John Ellison. ""Especially when other groups like ours have been continually campaigning so hard and have such local support. ""But, on the other hand, we're heartened to see stations anywhere reopen for communities - and it gives groups of volunteers like us hope to keep campaigning and hopefully one day we will get our station back.""

"Unions, women's groups and charities have asked the UK's equalities watchdog to investigate whether the government broke the law in its pandemic response. The groups claim some of the decisions taken by government are ""deepening inequalities"" faced by women. Their intervention comes a week after a committee of MPs said the government's response to Covid had ""repeatedly skewed towards men"". The government said it had offered ""unprecedented"" help in the pandemic. A spokesman said measures included help for the sectors where women are more likely to be employed, protection for female led start-ups and new childcare support. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said it had concerns about the ""particularly negative impact it [the pandemic] has had on women"". It added: ""While government focuses on the current crisis we do not consider it appropriate to use our legal powers, but we will be seeking to input into the promised review of the government's response and decisions taken."" Government's Covid help 'skewed towards men' - MPs 'I had to give up my job to home school my son' Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' In a letter to the commission, the groups - including the TUC, the Fawcett Society and Save the Children -  suggest the government may have failed to meet its legal obligations to consider the impact of its policies on women. They are asking the commission chair Baroness Falkner to launch an investigation, and urging ministers to carry out equality impact assessments of the furlough and self employment schemes. Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said the needs of women had been over looked ""at every stage of this pandemic"". ""Low-paid women have been excluded from getting sick pay, self-employed women who have taken maternity leave have lost out on vital financial help and women have had to take on primary caring responsibility for children,"" she said. ""The impact of school closures and childcare has put many women in an impossible situation because the right support has not been put in place."" She added that many had been forced to cut their hours or leave their jobs altogether. Another signatory to the letter - Anna Whitehouse from parenting website Mother Pukka - said equality had been ""swept off the table as privileged fathers in politics (often with nannies) decide the fate of mothers"". Responding to the letter the government insisted that every department considered the impact of its policies on inequality. ""As we seek to build back better following the pandemic everyone will play a crucial part and we will reflect that in our policy development,"" a spokesman said. This video can not be played Sharon Luca says she has ""the brunt of everything"" as she tries to juggle work and home-schooling Last week, MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee raised similar concernsin a report which said,externalministers had ""repeatedly"" failed to consider existing inequalities in the labour market when designing job and income support schemes. Their report argued that women are more likely to be employed in less secure work, and in sectors that have been shut down during the pandemic. It warned that women had borne the brunt of extra caring responsibilities, putting pressure on working mothers, and that pregnant women and new mothers are at risk of discrimination in a tough jobs market. The committee also said the government's plans for an economic recovery was too-male focused and called for more training and support for women.

"Ms Ravi shared a document first posted by climate activist Greta Thunberg The arrest of 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling it an attack on free speech. She was arrested on Saturday over a shared document to help farmers protest against new agricultural laws. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal described her arrest as an ""unprecedented attack on democracy"". Several activists and journalists have also been arrested in recent weeks in connection with the protests. Now in their third month, the protests have come to represent one of the biggest challenges faced by prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Police said Ms Ravi was a ""key conspirator"" in the ""formulation and dissemination"" of the document - a protest ""toolkit"". They said Ms Ravi, one of the founders of the Indian branch of the Fridays for Future climate strike,was an editor of the document,externaland had shared it with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. ""I did not make the toolkit. We wanted to support the farmers. I edited two lines on 3 February,"" Ms Ravi told the court,according to the NDTV news site,external. Mr Kejriwal has joined several prominent voices online, including activists, journalists and opposition politicians (such as former finance minister P Chidambaram), all of whom appear both shocked and furious over the arrest.

Ms Ravi, who lives in the southern city of Bangalore, was flown to the capital Delhi where she appeared before a magistrate on Sunday. She was sent to judicial custody for five days. Questions have been raised over the fact that Ms Ravi did not have a lawyer during her hearing - a fact which criminal lawyer Rebecca John, who has been tracking the case, described as ""a shocking abdication of judicial duties"" in a Facebook post. ""If the accused was not being represented by counsel at the time of the hearing, the magistrate should have waited till her counsel arrived or in the alternate, provided her with legal aid,"" Ms John wrote. It's unclear still what Ms Ravi is being charged with, but many fear she is being held under acolonial-era sedition law that has been used in recent arrests against journalists. People charged under the draconian lawhave to surrender their passports, are not eligible for government jobs and must produce themselves in the court as and when required. This video can not be played One night at the farmers' protest The Delhi police, who arrested Ms Ravi, invoked the same law earlier this month when they said they were investigating the toolkit. They said it suggested a conspiracy in the run up to a huge rally on 26 January,which saw protesting farmers clash with police. The toolkit was hugely publicised about two weeks ago when Ms Thunberg tweeted it, voicing her support for protesting farmers. The farmers are seeking the repeal of new agriculture reform laws that will further open up India's farming sector to corporate buyers and investment. The government, which has offered to suspend the laws, says they will improve farming incomes. But farmers, who want nothing short of a complete withdrawal, say the opposite will happen. They fear the laws will threaten decades-old concessions guaranteed by the government and leave them vulnerable to the private market. Ms Ravi's arrest is being seen by many as an intimidation tactic by the federal government, which oversees the Delhi police. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Farmers' group Samyukta Kisan Morcha, one of the main groups behind the protests, expressed their support for Ms Ravi and demanded her release. Support has poured in from everywhere, including Indian film actor Siddharth, Canadian poet Rupi Kaur and US Vice President Kamala Harris's niece Meena Harris. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Speaking via a big screen link at the Natural History Museum, Bill Gates said achieving net zero would be 'humanity's greatest ever achievement' Fifty-one billion and zero - the two numbers Bill Gates says you need to know about climate. Solving climate change would be ""the most amazing thing humanity has ever done"", says the billionaire founder of Microsoft. By comparison, ending the pandemic is ""very, very easy"", he claims. Mr Gates's new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, is a guide to tackling global warming. Don't underestimate the scale of the challenge, he told me when we spoke last week. ""We've never made a transition like we're talking about doing in the next 30 years. There is no precedent for this."" Fifty-one billion is how many tonnes of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere each year. Net zero is where we need to get to. This means cutting emissions to a level where any remaining greenhouse gas releases are balanced out by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. One way to do this is by planting trees, which soak up CO2 through their leaves. Bill Gates steps down from Microsoft board âHow Covid could help save the planetâ Listen to Bill Gates' new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, on Radio 4 Mr Gates' focus is on how technology can help us make that journey. Renewable sources like wind and solar can help us decarbonise electricity but, as Mr Gates points out, that's less than 30% of total emissions. We are also going to have to decarbonise the other 70% of the world economy - steel, cement, transport systems, fertiliser production and much, much more. We simply don't have ways of doing that at the moment for many of these sectors. The answer, says Mr Gates, will be an innovation effort on a scale the world has never seen before. This has to start with governments, he argues. At the moment, the economic system doesn't price in the real cost of using fossil fuels. Most users don't pay anything for the damage to the environment done by pollution from the petrol in their car or the coal or gas that created the electricity in their home. ""Right now, you don't see the pain you're causing as you emit carbon dioxide,"" is how Mr Gates puts it. That's why he says governments have to intervene. ""We need to have price signals to tell the private sector that we want green products,"" he says. That is going to require a huge investment by governments in research and development, Mr Gates argues, as well as support to allow the market for new products and technologies to grow, thereby helping drive down prices. Yet Mr Gates was famous for arguing that regulation stifled innovation when he was building Microsoft into the multi-billion-dollar behemoth it is now. So isn't it a bit rich for him now to demand government intervention? He replies he has always supported ""the basic role of government in terms of roads and justice and education and scientific research"". And, on the climate issue, he maintains it will be impossible to avoid a disaster, particularly for those who live near the equator, without governments around the world getting behind the effort. The Republican Party in America needs to recognise the importance of tackling climate change, says Mr Gates. This needs to be a ""constant 30-year push"", he maintains. ""Business just can't change all that physical infrastructure unless the market signals are constant and very clear."" Melinda and Bill Gates set up their charitable foundation in 1994 Co-founded Microsoft in 1975 World's fourth richest person with a net worth of $124bn, according to Forbes Has donated nearly $50bn through charitable foundation set up with wife Melinda in 1994 Stood down from day-to-day-role at Microsoft in 2008 to concentrate on philanthropic endeavours Current focus includes global health and development, education and tackling climate change Simply consuming less stuff - fewer flights, local food, less electricity and gas - won't solve the problem. ""India is going to build housing for their people, provide lighting at night, air conditioning to make conditions liveable,"" Mr Gates believes, so global demand will not reduce. He argues political action is more important, demanding government do the right thing, and, using our voices as consumers, insisting the same of companies. ""If you buy an electric car, a hamburger made of a meat substitute, an electric heat pump for your home you are helping increase the production of these products and therefore helping drive prices down."" Mr Gates still enjoys the trappings of the billionaire lifestyle. He uses private jets, but insists that they are powered by biofuels - aviation fuels made from plant products. ""I pay three times as much now for my aviation fuel, you know, over $7m [Â£5m] a year in all my offset spending."" Andhe has joined a Â£3bn bidding war,externalto buy one of the world's largest private jet services companies, a business called Signature Aviation. Is that appropriate when you've just written a book telling the world how to avoid a climate disaster? ""I don't think getting rid of flying would make sense,"" he replies. ""That type of brute force technique won't get us there."" He says the answer has to be ""a type of aviation fuel that doesn't cost much extra and is zero emission and that's got to be biofuels or electric fuels or perhaps using green hydrogen to power the plane"". Mr Gates has become something of abogeyman for coronavirus conspiracy theorists. He has been accused of everything from concocting the virus in a secret laboratory as part of a project by global elites to depopulate the world, to using vaccinations to implant microchips in people to track and control them. He laughs when asked about this. ""Why would I want to track people? You know, I'm just not that interested in where people are going."" The main focus for his huge charitable efforts to date has been tackling health issues in developing countries. He tells me he is used to people getting bored when he talks about tuberculosis and malaria at cocktail parties, so this is a real change from what he calls ""the normal obscurity of working on infectious disease"". But he says he was worried that speaking out on climate might attract similar controversy. ""I don't want to dilute my voice on issues like polio eradication or malaria,"" Mr Gates explains, but says he felt this was the right time to publish his plan for tackling climate change. He says he wants his ideas to feed into the green stimulus packages being proposed around the world and to be discussed in the run-up to the crucialclimate conference the UK is hosting in Glasgowin November this year. We are at a crucial point in the climate debate, Mr Gates believes. He describes the young generation as having a ""moral conviction"" that they have to be involved in bringing change on the issue. ""Now we have to take that energy and make sure it's directed at the policies that will make a difference,"" he argues. But it isn't going to be easy, he warns. This has to continue to be a huge priority for the world year in, year out. The hope is ""we get a bit lucky"" and succeed in developing innovative new technologies that really do solve the hard areas, he says. But he is optimistic that we can still avoid the worst effects of climate change. ""You know, I've seen many times, innovation surprises us in a positive way.""

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged care staff to come forward to be vaccinated A third of social care staff in England have not had the Covid-19 vaccine, the health secretary has said, despite them being among the groups prioritised. Matt Hancock said it was ""very important"" for the staff, patients and society that they get the jab. Meanwhile, a hospital trust has revealed thatonly 36.8% of its black staff have had the vaccine.

Christina McAnea, general secretary of the trade union, Unison, said getting as many care workers as possible to have the Covid jab should be achieved through ""encouragement and persuasion"". She said care workers must be provided with ""the correct information"" and ""time to ask the experts about their concerns, think things through and talk to colleagues who've had the jab"". The uptake among care workers isn't surprising - they tend to come forward in lower numbers for the flu jab. It illustrates the need to continue reaching out to those who have not taken up the offer. The fear is some of the most vulnerable and deprived communities have the lowest levels of uptake, which would widen inequalities in the future. Today, though, marks an important milestone.

As well as the over-65s, the next group to be offered the vaccine is the estimated 7.3 million people aged 16 to 65 with a range of health conditions that put them at risk from the virus. The rollout will then be extended to the remaining over-50 age groups, with the aim of offering a first dose to another 17.2 million people before the end of April. Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that millions of people whose asthma is under controlwill not be prioritised for the vaccine. Mr Hancock said that 90% of the over-70s had accepted the vaccine and one in four adults were now starting to receive protection against Covid-19.

"Peter Lawrence, seen here on the 10th anniversary of his daughter's disappearance, was a retired solicitor The father of missing Claudia Lawrence has died without ever knowing what happened to his daughter. Peter Lawrence, who was 74, died on Thursday at St Leonard's Hospice in York following a short illness, his family said in a statement. His death comes 12 years after his daughter vanished in the city. Police believe Claudia - who was 35 when she was last seen on 18 March 2009 - was murdered but her body has never been found. What happened to Claudia? Mr Lawrence's family said in a statement: ""It is sad that nearly 12 years after Claudia's disappearance from York, Peter never found out what has happened to her. ""He was a very private person thrust into the full glare of the media, and despite a tireless campaign to find her he also selflessly devoted himself to helping others with missing relatives through the charity Missing People."" Peter Lawrence was appointed an OBE in 2018 for his charity work Mr Lawrence campaigned for the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill, also known as Claudia's Law, which was passed in April 2017. Claudia's Law, whichcame into force in July 2019, allows relatives to take control of their missing loved ones' financial matters. Mr Lawrence, a retired solicitor, said it was an ""absolutely marvellous feeling"" to see the proposals clear a major hurdle in the law-making process. In 2018 hewas appointed an OBEin the Queen's Birthday Honours in recognition of his tireless campaigning for change after his daughter's disappearance. Peter Lawrence said not knowing what happened to Claudia was ""the hardest thing for the family to bear"" Mr Lawrence's family said: ""Despite Peter's death, the message remains the same - where is Claudia? ""Anyone with information should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101."" Mr Lawrence described being ""hugely disappointed and depressed"" when in January 2017detectives said they were scaling back the investigation. Miss Lawrence was reported missing after she failed to turn up for work at the University of York. Police previously said they ""strongly suspect key and vital information"" which would offer a breakthrough was being ""withheld"". Nine people have been questioned as part of the investigation, but no charges have ever been brought.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Progress must be 'cautious but irreversible' The government's plan to move England out of lockdown will be ""cautious but irreversible"", Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister is due to set out the roadmap for ending restrictions next Monday. He told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes ""if we possibly can"", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays. It comes as a group of Tory MPs call for a commitment to a ""free life"" and ending of lockdown measures before May. Senior backbencher Steve Baker said he wants the prime minister to ""let us reclaim our lives, once and for all"". The PM is likely to be questioned about his plans later when he hosts a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT - alongside England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens. New vaccine rollout phase begins Future lockdowns in Wales not ruled out When will lockdown rules be reviewed? On Sunday, the government said it met its target to offer a vaccine to the 15 million most vulnerable people across the UK. Figures on Monday showed a 29% drop in the number of positive cases across the country, down to 9,765 - the lowest figure since 2 October. But there are still concerns over the numbers, with over 88,000 cases recorded in the last week - an average of 157 cases per 100,000 - and 4,598 people dying within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. Labour said the government must ""lock in the gains of the vaccine"" and ensure more measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus - such as financial support for self-isolation and updated workplace guidance. Mr Johnson and senior members of his cabinet are set to spend the week looking into the latest coronavirus statistics before making an announcement on its plans. He said: ""The dates that we'll be setting out will be the dates by which we hope we can do something at the earliest."" There has been a raft of speculation on the date of re-openings of businesses and hospitality - much of which has been dismissed by Downing Street. But sources in No 10 told the BBC they were increasingly confident pupils in England would return to school on 8 March -the earliest the PM said the move could happen. Mr Johnson said no decisions had been taken yet, but the March date for schools had ""for a long time been a priority of the government and families up and down the country"". He added: ""We will do everything we can to make that happen, but we have got to keep looking at the data. ""There are still 23,000 or so Covid patients in the NHS - more than at the April peak last year - there are still sadly too many people dying of this disease; and rates of infection, although they are coming down, are still comparatively high. ""So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see."" Over the weekend, 63 Tory MPs wrote to Mr Johnson, calling for easing to begin in March and for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Mr Baker, who is the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should re-open by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. The proposal was rejected by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the government would be ""cautious"". Butwriting in the Telegraph,external, Mr Baker reasserted his plan, saying: ""As the prime minister said, let us reclaim our lives, once and for all. This can be a moment of unity - for our country and the Conservative Party - as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism to a much brighter future."" Fellow CRG member and Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the government ""have to think about livelihoods"", telling BBC Radio Essex: ""The moment you open schools up then there is no excuse for not opening up the rest of the economy."" Hospitality bosses are asking the government to reopen pubs by April, withthe chairman of Wetherspoon warning the industry is ""on its knees""and jobs are on the line. The plea comes after industry figures showed the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year - triple the tally in 2019. More than a dozen MPs have also called on Mr Johnson to allow restricted weddings to return from 8 March, followed by restriction-free weddings from 1 May. Tory former minister Esther McVey said after the top nine groups of people are vaccinated, it should be ""a huge moment for the UK to hold its head up high, for couples to walk down the aisle, and for families up and down the country to reunite, to celebrate and to plan their futures"". Any broad political consensus that existed in the early days of this pandemic has long gone. The Tory MPs that make up the Covid Recovery Group have been increasingly critical of prolonged restrictions. This is a group containing some senior Conservatives who are willing to be vocal, and willing to exert pressure on the prime minister. Their stance will no doubt be a factor in Downing Street's thinking. But it would be wrong to assume lockdown scepticism is representative of everyone on the Tory benches. Of more than 360 Conservative MPs, 63 signed the latest letter to Boris Johnson urging an easing of restrictions as soon as possible. That's not an inconsiderable number. However, there are also Tory MPs that advocate a more cautious approach, as do plenty on the opposition benches. The pressure from some in his party to move quickly out of lockdown creates tricky political tension for the prime minister - but it's not necessarily a majority view. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? Another senior Tory backbencher, Robert Halfon, said the PM needed to ""provide some kind of optimism to the public"" over lockdown easing, but warned against people relaxing too soon. The chair of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""I understand where [the Covid Recovery Group] are coming from and my heart has a lot of sympathy. ""I just don't want a repetition of what went on last year where we thought we were over the worst and then we're suddenly back in tiers of lockdown."" Meanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not want to give a ""cast iron guarantee"" about future lockdowns. He said: ""The danger is we try to set out absolutes - with talk of whether this is irreversible, or whether nothing else will happen in the future. ""What we want to do is make choices based on the best available data and information, to see case rates driven as low as possible, and then to have a cautious exit out of the current lockdown we're in.""

"The UK has powered past the vaccines target set six weeks ago, the prime minister tells a Downing Street briefing - but adds this is no moment to relax ""We've vaccinated more than 90% of those aged over 70 but don't forget 60% of hospital patients with Covid are under 70,"" says the PM ""If we can keep the supply up, we hope to offer vaccinations to everyone in the top nine priority groups by the end of April,"" Johnson adds The seven-day average of Covid deaths in the UK is still high but ""below the peak of the first wave"", chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty says NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens says the vaccine programme is like ""two sprints and a marathon"" and we have just reached the first sprint's finish line The PM says he cannot guarantee this will be the last lockdown, as we are ""battling with nature"" - but says science is ""in the ascendency"" A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK are confirmed, and there are 9,765 newly-reported cases But this is the first day since 2 October the number of cases announced by the UK government has been below 10,000 Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest on coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. Here's a summary of some of the stories we've been covering.  Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Alex Kleiderman, Laurence Peter, Hazel Shearing, Penny Spiller, Lauren Turner, Lucy Webster, Kate Whannel and Cherry Wilson. We'll be back on Tuesday morning.  British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving to England from ""red list"" countries have begun to self-isolate in hotels. Wiehann Meyer travelled from Johannesburg to the UK for a new job and has just begun his 10-day hotel quarantine alongside a friend, with whom he has been able to share the cost. This video can not be played Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent With every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid. Science, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy. It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago. But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results. There is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants. No vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it.Thatâs why advances in treatment are vital too. A cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances. There is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back. Radio 4 PM Ministers risk ""dashing hope"" by setting dates for the lifting of lockdown restrictions, a government adviser has warned. Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, spoke to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme. He said: âIf you ask 'when' questions - or speculate about dates - in effect, you render people passive. ""You donât pose the real question, which is: what can we all do to bring infections down? âIf you set a date and then you change it, you donât give people hope, you dash hope. You bring despair. ""You create whatâs called âlearned helplessnessâ, where people begin to feel weâre not in control of anything. Those are the conditions under which people give up.â The full interview can be foundhere, 48 minutes in. Reality Check NHS Englandâs Sir Simon Stevens has said that figures were published weekly on the uptake of the vaccine by
different ethnic minority groups. But the numbers released arenât
particularly helpful. They are not broken down by age or
by region, meaning we canât see how well the older, priority groups are being
targeted. Nor do we have a good idea on how
large these communities actually are because the last census was a decade ago. This makes it difficult to work
out what percentage of each group has had the vaccine. What we do know is that a
large-scale study by the OpenSafely survey suggested thatblack people over 80 were almost half,externalas likely to
have had the vaccine than white people over 80. However, this study is now over
two weeks old. Another more recent study fromLeicesterâs main NHS trustfound that just 36% of black staff had their first
dose. This was compared with 71% of white staff. Here is a quick look at coronavirus around the UK in numbers. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Thinking about what the future might look can feel like a fairly futile exercise sometimes, with so much up in the air. But Boris Johnson did just offer up at least one interesting glimpse. He suggested there could well be rapid testing for people heading off to venues like nightclubs and theatres; a way of keeping a lid on infection rates in those parts of the economy that are the âtoughest nuts to crackâ. That may be some way off yet and thereâll be plenty of questions as to exactly how that would work. But it does shine a little light on what life might look like in the ""new normal"". Reality Check The lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs has
written to the prime minister demanding that all coronavirus rules be lifted by
the end of April. The group argues that once the top nine priority groups have been
vaccinated - which the government says it aims to complete by May - there will
be âno justificationâ for the restrictions. The success of the vaccine rollout means by 1 May âabout 99% of
deaths & 80% hospitalisations from Covid protected,â CRG Deputy Chair Steve
Bakertweeted,external. Might that be the case? In early December, England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof
Jonathan Van-Tam said itcould be possible to cut deaths by 99%if everyone on the
priority list took the vaccine and it was highly effective â but this was
before the decision to delay second doses was announced. If the rollout progresses on schedule, some in those priority
groups will have only just received their first vaccine at the end of April, so
will not be fully protected. There is also a possibility the vaccine will be less effective
against some variants of the virus, and the take-up, while high, is very unlikely
to be 100%.  Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter More data from Israel's
vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic
infections. This indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger
population as it did in the clinical trials. It is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe
disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai
Levine. ""High vaccination coverage of the most susceptible
groups"" is key, he says. Israel is the first country in the world to see the impact of its vaccination programme, but it took significant population coverage and several weeks to reach this stage.

As tricky as it is, Tocilizumab is a word Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to get familiar with saying, as the drug normally used to treat arthritis could be a potential life-saver, according to research. This video can not be played Health workers in Peru began receiving the vaccine a week ago A second minister in Peru has resigned amid growing
anger over revelations that senior officials have received the coronavirus
vaccine well ahead of the public. Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete tweeted that she had
been inoculated in January and called it a âserious mistakeâ. Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti stepped down last
week after it emerged former President Martin Vizcarra was vaccinated in
October. Mr Vizcarraâs vaccination came just a few weeks beforehe was impeachedand removed from office on charges of being morally incompetent. Peru has been hit hard by the pandemic, recording
more than 1.2 million cases and over 43,700 deaths. Vaccinations of health workers began just over a
week ago but no date has yet been set to roll out the programme to the wider
public. NHS England chief Simon Stevens was speaking at the Downing Street press conference this afternoon. He described the race to vaccinate people as ""two sprints and a marathon"". This video can not be played Reality Check At
the UK government briefing, the chief executive of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens
said:â Weâre up against the
pandemic of Covid and weâre up against a pandemic of disinformationâ. False
and misleading claims about vaccines have been circulating on social media for
many months. They
include baseless conspiracy
theories that mass vaccinations are part of a secret plan to microchip people
or that they can somehow alter human DNA. BBCReality Check has looked at many of these- including recent posts on vaccines
and fertility â such as the false claim that vaccines contain proteins which
could lead the body to attack the placenta. Some
argue that Covid disinformation may be
affecting vaccine take-up. In an experiment, BBC Panorama showed a panel one videofilled with falsehoods - to see how it affected their willingness to get a jab.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca
vaccine has been approved by the World Health Organization for emergency
use, which means it will be part of the WHOâs global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax. The vaccine will be produced at two plants - by SKBio in South Korea and the Serum Institute of India - and so had to be approved twice. ""We
now have all the pieces in place for the rapid distribution of vaccines,""
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""But we still need to scale up production."" The Oxford vaccine is seen as the ""vaccine for the
world"" as it is cheap, can be mass produced and is stored in a standard
fridge. It hasattracted controversy about its effectivenessagainst new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far
apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data. But a review by the WHO found that it met the
""must-have"" criteria for safety, and its benefits outweighed the risks. Today's Downing Street coronavirus briefing was led by the prime minister. He was joined by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, and Prof Chris
Whitty, the chief medical officer. Here's what they said: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Could this be the last lockdown? That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the governmentâs stated aim. It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in. Who knew then that weâd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later? Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis. Today, again, heâs urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine roll-out goes well. Thatâs because ministers really donât want to lift restrictions only to re-impose them again on a weary nation. The media questions wrap up with Alistair Smout from Reuters asking if it is the vaccine reducing infection cases or the national lockdown. He also asks who the PM holds responsible for a lack of transparency surrounding about the origins of the virus. To the first question, Prof Chris Whitty says the impact of the vaccine should become clear when looking at the data of those who have been vaccinated, in the order in which they received their dose. He adds that the UK's data set is not yet big enough to ""see with the naked eye"". On the second question, Boris Johnson says ""most evidence"" points to the disease having originated in Wuhan and stresses the importance of gathering as much evidence as possible. He also says a global treaty on pandemics is ""an attractive idea"". Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks the PM about quarantine hotels in the UK - he wants to know if people will have to pay extra if their release is delayed due to testing positive. What if they can't pay, he asks? He also wants to know what mental health provision is being made for these people being confined to a single room. Boris Johnson says it's currently illegal to travel abroad for holidays anyway so he would expect people coming in to the UK to be able to cover their costs. He says mental health support would be made available to whoever needs it. Sir Simon Stevens is asked why, when the UK is vaccinating an average of 435,000 people a day, the target for giving all over-50s a jab is the end of April. Sir Simon says the second doses still need to be administered and that the issue is vaccine supply. If supplies increase, then it ""looks like we can go faster"".  The Financial Times' Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe asks what steps the government has taken on vaccine hesitancy and disinformation among minority groups. She also asks about the possibility of vaccine passports. NHS head Sir Simon Stevens says there is ""real concern about hesitancy on the part of some black and South Asian communities"". He adds that there is a ""huge effort"" to overcome that hesitancy and suggests there is ""meaningful progress"". ""We are up against a pandemic of Covid and a pandemic of misinformation,"" he says. On vaccine passports, Boris Johnson says there are lots of discussions to be had but says at the moment the preferred route is one that relies on mass vaccinations plus rapid testing for places such as nightclubs and theatres. Earlier, Hannah from Glasgow asked whether a mental health spokesperson can speak at the next briefing to set out to the public how they can access mental health support. The PM says it is a ""good idea"" and suggests that Dr Alex George - ex-Love Islander and the government's youth mental health ambassador - could appear. ""We'll try and find the right person to say something about how to do this and how to encourage everybody, really, to look after our mental wellbeing and try and keep going through this pandemic,"" he says. ""I hope there isn't that much longer to go now, but clearly people have been under a lot of pressure and we've got to address that."" He urges people to make use of NHS and charity mental health services and says the government has put a further Â£500m into supporting NHS mental health services. Prof Chris Whitty points out that one of the next priority groups for vaccination is people who have got ""significant mental health problems"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ms Ravi shared a document first posted by climate activist Greta Thunberg The arrest of 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling it an attack on free speech. She was arrested on Saturday over a shared document to help farmers protest against new agricultural laws. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal described her arrest as an ""unprecedented attack on democracy"". Several activists and journalists have also been arrested in recent weeks in connection with the protests. Now in their third month, the protests have come to represent one of the biggest challenges faced by prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Police said Ms Ravi was a ""key conspirator"" in the ""formulation and dissemination"" of the document - a protest ""toolkit"". They said Ms Ravi, one of the founders of the Indian branch of the Fridays for Future climate strike,was an editor of the document,externaland had shared it with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. ""I did not make the toolkit. We wanted to support the farmers. I edited two lines on 3 February,"" Ms Ravi told the court,according to the NDTV news site,external. Mr Kejriwal has joined several prominent voices online, including activists, journalists and opposition politicians (such as former finance minister P Chidambaram), all of whom appear both shocked and furious over the arrest.

Ms Ravi, who lives in the southern city of Bangalore, was flown to the capital Delhi where she appeared before a magistrate on Sunday. She was sent to judicial custody for five days. Questions have been raised over the fact that Ms Ravi did not have a lawyer during her hearing - a fact which criminal lawyer Rebecca John, who has been tracking the case, described as ""a shocking abdication of judicial duties"" in a Facebook post. ""If the accused was not being represented by counsel at the time of the hearing, the magistrate should have waited till her counsel arrived or in the alternate, provided her with legal aid,"" Ms John wrote. It's unclear still what Ms Ravi is being charged with, but many fear she is being held under acolonial-era sedition law that has been used in recent arrests against journalists. People charged under the draconian lawhave to surrender their passports, are not eligible for government jobs and must produce themselves in the court as and when required. This video can not be played One night at the farmers' protest The Delhi police, who arrested Ms Ravi, invoked the same law earlier this month when they said they were investigating the toolkit. They said it suggested a conspiracy in the run up to a huge rally on 26 January,which saw protesting farmers clash with police. The toolkit was hugely publicised about two weeks ago when Ms Thunberg tweeted it, voicing her support for protesting farmers. The farmers are seeking the repeal of new agriculture reform laws that will further open up India's farming sector to corporate buyers and investment. The government, which has offered to suspend the laws, says they will improve farming incomes. But farmers, who want nothing short of a complete withdrawal, say the opposite will happen. They fear the laws will threaten decades-old concessions guaranteed by the government and leave them vulnerable to the private market. Ms Ravi's arrest is being seen by many as an intimidation tactic by the federal government, which oversees the Delhi police. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""This is a new low, even for India,"" environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman told the BBC. ""These are the kinds of young people we should be celebrating, and not jailing.""

He said this runs contrary to PM Modi's efforts to enlist youth in cleaning up cities as part of his flagship Swachh Bharat (Clean India) Campaign My Jayaraman added that it sent a clear message to young people that ""they should restrict themselves to picking up garbage on the streets or planting trees, and not come into the arena of policy-making"". Farmers' group Samyukta Kisan Morcha, one of the main groups behind the protests, expressed their support for Ms Ravi and demanded her release. Support has poured in from everywhere, including Indian film actor Siddharth, Canadian poet Rupi Kaur and US Vice President Kamala Harris's niece Meena Harris. Allow Twitter content?

"Japan's economy surged in the fourth quarter of 2020, but it was not enough to keep the country from negative growth for the year. The economy beat expectations to grow by 3% between October and December compared to the same period in 2019. But growth was considerably slower than in the previous quarter, when the economy expanded 5.3%. Japan's economy shrank 4.8% over the full year, its first contraction since 2009. The growth figures come as Japan's Nikkei index briefly hit 30,000 for the first time since 1990. Fresh Covid-19 stimulus for Japanese economy Japan leads economic 'Zoom boom' out of recession Tokyo Olympics 'unlikely to go ahead in 2021' The world's third-largest economy suffered its worst post-war quarterly contraction between April and June, as the global pandemic hit domestic consumption and exports. But consumption and exports, which are both key drivers of the Japanese economy, also fuelled a rebound in the second half of the year. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of the economy, rose 2.2% in the final quarter of 2020, slowing from the 5.1% increase in the previous quarter. Stronger economic growth globally in the third and fourth quarters also helped Japanese businesses sell more of their products overseas. Annualised growth - which assumes the quarter's growth will be maintained for the whole year - was 12.7%, suggesting Japan could be on track for a strong and rapid recovery. This video can not be played Tokyo's famous Kabuki-za Theatre has been closed for the last five months But growth is still fragile, and could be hampered by restrictions aimed at limiting another wave of Covid-19. Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research, expects the recovery to struggle because Japan lags behind western economies in vaccine distribution. ""The conditions are such that Japan will not be able to avoid negative growth in the first quarter,"" he told Reuters. ""There is a high possibility that there will be a repeating cycle of coronavirus infections spreading and being contained this year, which means that consumption is not likely to recover at the expected pace."" In December, the government announced another round of stimulus aimed at pulling the world's second largest economy out of its slump. The 73.6tr yen ($708bn; Â£530bn) package took Japan's total stimulus spending to around $3tr.

"For children under the age of five, Covid restrictions have been in place for a big chunk of their lives. For the very youngest, daily life has never been Covid-free. What should parents and carers of young children be concerned about? Five experts offer advice and support. For most families with anew baby, there's no need to worry, Alison Morton, of the Institute of Health Visiting, says. ""In those first few months, parents are babies' most favourite things,"" she says. ""Sitting on your lap, taking turns, mimicking - they're very happy with just that."" Sally Hogg, from the Parent-Infant Foundation, which supports teams working with new parents, agrees. ""You don't go to a parent-and-baby group with a three-month-old because baby needs to learn to sing,"" she says. ""It's because you need the company and positive baby-friendly ideas. ""To get those things in lockdown, you might chat on the phone with friends, family and other parents or join groups online."" Asolder babiesbecome more aware of the world around them, Alison says, they remember someone or something exists, such as a parent, even when they can't see them. ""As a result, babies experience separation anxiety and may get upset if they're left with unfamiliar people. ""This is totally normal and nothing to do with any lack of socialisation because of Covid."" Once they're more inquisitive and confident,toddlerswant to play with other youngsters. ""If your child has no older siblings, then clearly - because of Covid - those contacts will be restricted,"" Alison says. ""But studies of children with restricted play - like those in hospital long-term - found youngsters adapted and found other ways to play."" Most children should recover long-term, even though the pandemic has changed play, she says. And if you're a single parent, or know one, you can always ""bubble"" with them.

""People worry about children looking at screens too much,"" Dr Bernadka Dubicka, who chairs the child-and-adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says. ""But they've been lockdown lifesavers."" There should be balance, though. ""Have meals together, make eye contact and keep screens out of bedrooms,"" Bernadka says. But how do you persuade two-year-olds to engage in a Zoom conversation with Grandma and Grandad? ""Young children will chat for a bit, then just wander off,"" Sally says. ""But you can share stories and play games. ""Get grandparents to ask them to find things, a certain toy or something that's a specific colour."" Get outside All our experts spoke of the value of going out to play. Parks and playgrounds remain open. England's current lockdown restrictions allow under-fives to go with you when you meet someone you don't live with for exercise. In Wales, children aged 10 or below can accompany you. And in Scotland, the age limit is 11. Rules by nation: England,external Wales,external Scotland,external Northern Ireland,external Nurseries also remain open. Although, in Scotland only key-worker children can attend. ""Sending a child to nursery must be a parent's individual decision,"" Dr Paul Ramchandani, Lego professor of play in education, development and learning, at Cambridge University, says. ""I'd say it depends on local Covid levels and how comfortable you feel."" Watch out for persistent changes in their behaviour. For example, if they: become much more withdrawn, irritable or needy start to have trouble sleeping or regularly wet themselves regularly say they've physical symptoms, such as tummy pains or headaches ""Stress in very young children can often present with physical symptoms,"" Bernadka says. ""They'll describe stomach pains, because they don't have the verbal skills to express themselves accurately."" Health-visitor appointments were cut when the pandemic started. And many became online only. Health-visiting services have now restarted. But in practice, Alison says, there are huge local variations. ""There's particular worry for small premature babies and for others where conditions like cerebral palsy have been missed,"" she says. ""It's been up to parents to acknowledge problems. ""Many have been anxious about asking for help."" Neonatal nurse with mother and baby If you're concerned about your child, contact your GP, midwife or health visitor. Parents are anxious, Alison says. ""But it's important to know most children are going to be fine,"" she says. ""And you can ask for help if you're worried."" Paul agrees. ""It's normal to feel extra stressed,"" he says. ""Family life has adapted. ""But chances are you're still being a good-enough parent."" Parent and child mental-health problems go hand-in-hand, Bernadka says. ""If more adults are struggling, then it's not going to have a positive impact on children,"" she says. And those parents need to find help for themselves first. Get mental health support,external Institute of Health Visiting: Parenting through Coronavirus,external Signs you might be struggling include: being unusually tearful feeling particularly anxious or irritable feeling constantly depressed or having no desire to do anything In arecent survey of pregnancy and young children's providers,external, by the First 1001 Days Movement, nearly all (98%) said parental anxiety or depression had affected babies. Covid: The devastating toll of the pandemic on children BBC Bitesize: Parents' Toolkit ""Not everyone needs to be labelled with a mental-health problem,"" Alison says. ""Parents often just lack confidence."" ""I've worked with hundreds of new mums who've had a wobble and needed ideas or a bit of extra support. ""Everything's soon back to normal."" Speak to your partner, family or friends first if you can. But professional advice is available. Health visitors would rather hear from people early, Alison says, before more serious conditions, such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and post-natal depression, develop. In anOfsted survey of 208 nurseries in England,external, most reported children returning after the spring 2020 lockdown had fallen behind in personal, social and emotional development. Some returned less confident, while others were using nappies and dummies at an older age than nursery staff would expect. But Paul offers words of reassurance. ""There are very few developmental goals which most children won't be able to catch up with,"" he says. Our experts agree youngsters with special needs or living in poverty or homes where there's conflict or abuse could have longer-term issues and need more support. In the first lockdown, babies and toddlers from disadvantaged backgrounds,according to university researchers in Oxford,external, missed out on activities to support their development, compared with those with more highly educated and well paid parents.
