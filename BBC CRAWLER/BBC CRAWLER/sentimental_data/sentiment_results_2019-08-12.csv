"This video can not be played Hong Kong police were filmed making an arrest with the help of a suspected undercover officer Hong Kong police have admitted deploying officers disguised as anti-government protesters during mass unrest that rocked the city on Sunday. Some officers disguised themselves as ""different characters"", a spokesman said, adding that the ""decoy operation"" had targeted ""extreme violent rioters"". It comes after video surfaced showing suspected undercover officers making arrests during Sunday's clashes. Protesters have called for an inquiry into the actions of the police. Hong Kong's mass demonstrations and unrest show no sign of abating, more than two months after they were sparked by a controversial extradition bill that has since been suspended. On Monday, protesters occupied Hong Kong's international airport forcing the cancellation of flights. Authorities say operations are now resuming at the airport, but some airlines have further cancelled hundreds of flights on Tuesday. The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Explaining the protests in 300 words How badly has tourism been affected? On Monday, in a news conference that was at times heated, Deputy Police Commissioner Tang Ping-Keung defended the use of the ""decoy officers"". ""I can say that during the time when our police officers were disguised... they [did not] provoke anything."" he said. ""We won't ask them to stir up trouble."" ""Our operation... is targeting extreme violent rioters,"" he added. Mr Tang said police were responding to protesters who had used slings and hurled petrol bombs. Allow Twitter content?

Assistant Police Commissioner Mak Chin-ho, who also faced a volley of questions about Sunday's violent scenes, said there was no evidence to suggest a woman had been shot by a police projectile. Images of the woman, who was bleeding heavily from her eye, were shared widely on social media over the weekend. On Monday, protesters at the city's international airport wore bandages over their eyes in response to the incident. Demonstrators wore eye patches in reference to a woman who was injured on Sunday There were confrontations in several central districts on Sunday and police used rubber bullets and tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators. Video also showed officers storming enclosed railway stations before firing tear gas inside and beating people with batons. This video can not be played Violence erupts in HK train stations A number of people, including a police officer, were injured in the clashes. Mr Mak also defended the use of pepper ball rounds at close range, saying officers made a ""split-second"" decision to fire on protesters who had tried to flee. Beijing officials strongly condemned Sunday's violence and linked violent protesters to ""terrorism"". The city's international airport cancelled all departures on Monday, as thousands of protesters occupied it and caused disruption. More than 160 flights were cancelled and officials blamed ""seriously disrupted"" operations. As rumours spread that police planned to move in on protesters in the evening, thousands opted to leave on foot at about midnight. Early on Tuesday, the airport said operations had resumed but warned flights would still be affected. Flagship carrier Cathay Pacific said more than 200 inbound and outbound flights were cancelled on Tuesday- with the airline blaming the ""public assembly taking place"". Around 50 protesters remained camped in the terminals on Tuesday morning, while more than 100 passengers were spotted queuing up at a ticket counter, Reuters news agency reported. Officials say about 5,000 gathered for the fourth day of protests at the airport on Monday One passenger, who wishes to remain anonymous, told the BBC they had been left stranded at the airport with ""no food and no drinking water"". ""We have been completely abandoned by the airport staff,"" they said. ""People are sleeping on conveyor belts and hard floors."" Separately, Hong Kong police have also unveiled a water cannon vehicle as a new tool to combat the protests. Demonstrations started in June in opposition to a proposed extradition bill, which would have allowed suspected criminals to be sent to mainland China for trial. Critics said it would undermine Hong Kong's legal freedoms, and could be used to silence political dissidents. Although the government has now suspended the bill, demonstrators want it to be fully withdrawn. Their demands have broadened to include calls for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and an amnesty for all arrested protesters. Hong Kong is part of China but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland. It has a free press and judicial independence under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" approach - freedoms which activists fear are being increasingly eroded.

"This video can not be played Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target ""any particular group"" US President Donald Trump's administration is to make it more difficult for poorer legal migrants to extend their visas or gain permanent resident status (a green card). The rule targets migrants who rely on public benefits, such as food aid or public housing, for more than a year. Their applications will be rejected if the government decides they are likely to rely on public assistance in future. The rule change would reinforce ""ideals of self-sufficiency,"",externalofficials said. The new regulation, known as a ""public charge rule"", was published in the Federal Register on Monday,externaland will take effect on 15 October. Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change. It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants. What's the state of illegal immigration in US? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change. Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country. Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected. An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected. Civil rights groups have said the move unfairly targets low-income immigrants. The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) has said it will sue the Trump administration to stop the regulation from taking effect. But the White House said the current system favours immigrants with family ties rather than those who ""are self-sufficient and do not strain our public resources"". Although much of Donald Trump's rhetoric during the 2016 presidential campaign was directed at what he saw as the dangers of undocumented immigration, it has been clear for some time that this is just part of a larger goal to reduce US immigration levels in total - both illegal and legal. Since his inauguration, Mr Trump has cut the number of refugees admitted to the US each year. The White House blocked a Senate compromise immigration proposal in January 2018 in part because it did not include changes to the legal immigration system. During those negotiations, Mr Trump reportedly made comments about preferring immigrants from places like Norway, rather than ""shithole"" countries. Now the administration is making it more difficult for less affluent individuals to obtain legal US residency - or perhaps even enter the country at all. This sets up an election clash next year between a president sharpening and broadening his immigration rhetoric and Democrats, many of whom have said they believe all immigrants, legal or otherwise, should be eligible for public aid. President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration. ""To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,"" a White House statement read after the rule change was announced. It said two-thirds of immigrants entering the US ""do so based on family ties rather than on skill or merit"". More than three-quarters (78%) of households headed by a non-citizen with no more than a secondary school education used at least one welfare programme, it added. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of the US Citizenship and Immigration Service, announced the regulation at a press conference on Monday. He said finances, education, age, and the level of an applicant's English-language skills will all be considered in green card applications. ""No one factor alone"" will decide a case, he added.

"This video can not be played Caroline Lucas tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire why she wants an all-women cabinet A Green Party MP has been criticised after suggesting an all-women ""emergency cabinet"" could meet to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. Writing in the Guardian,,externalCaroline Lucas said the cross-party group, formed of 10 female politicians, could ""bring a different perspective"". Ms Lucas said the cabinet could organise another EU referendum if the PM is defeated in a no-confidence vote. But cabinet minister Liz Truss criticised the plan as sexist. Ms Lucas - a former leader of the Green Party - has also apologised after receiving criticism for only inviting white women to sit on her proposed group. In her article, she suggested MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit should try to defeat Boris Johnson in ano-confidence vote, then replace him with a ""national unity government"". This arrangement - when a group of MPs from different parties choose to work together - has not been seen since the Second World War. An all-female cabinet, she suggested, could then ""press the pause button"" and organise another referendum offering a choice between staying in the EU or the government's Brexit plan, whether that is an agreed deal or no deal. But her idea was criticised by International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, who tweeted: ""Is there anything more sexist than claiming your gender determines your worldview/behaviour/attitude?"" Defending her proposal, Ms Lucas told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It is a generalisation and there are plenty of exceptions, but I would argue, generally and in my experience, women tend to be less tribal and tend to find it easier to establish trust more quickly. ""I simply want to see whether or not by bring women together the key women from across Westminster whether or not we could generate a new dynamic,"" she added. ""We are facing a crisis. Time is running out."" MP cautious on all-female unity cabinet bid Greens call for new Brexit referendum Sturgeon 'would work with all-female cabinet' Liz Truss criticised the proposals as sexist Among the women Ms Lucas has invited to join her are Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Conservative MP Justine Greening, and Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts. The others are: Heidi Allen, Kirsty Blackman, Yvette Cooper, Sylvia Hermon, and Anna Soubry. She has asked to meet the 10 women in the coming days. On Monday, Ms Lucas told the BBC she had received responses from five of the women she has written to, expressing differing levels of interest. She also added that her proposed unity government would have to be led by a female Labour MP, as they would be representing the largest opposition party. She said she wasn't completely against involving men - for instance accepting that a key anti-Brexit campaigner like Dominic Grieve could be given a cabinet seat. Asked about her invitation to join the proposed female cabinet, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I'm happy to work with anybody, male or female, to try to stop Brexit"". ""I'm all for more women in politics, I think we can bring a different perspective,"" she told ITV's Loose Women. ""But I do feel duty-bound to point out that the former prime minister of course was a woman and didn't manage to sort out Brexit - so there's maybe a flaw in that argument."" Ms Thornberrytweeted a reply,externalto say she would not be able to take part in the planned talks because she is currently on holiday. She added that returning the issue of Brexit ""to the people"" was the ""best route to go down at this point"". ""My fear with the other suggested route - imposing some alternative coalition government without any reference to the public - would risk worsening the feelings of anger and resentment towards 'Westminster' that have led us into this Brexit mess,"" she added. Ms Saville Roberts welcomed Ms Lucas's bid to break the deadlock over Brexit, but said she was ""not entirely comfortable"" that only women would be involved. Ms Soubry, who leads the Independent Group for Change, said she believed in the ""power of women"", but a national unity government should be formed ""irrespective of gender"". Ms Lucas has also faced criticism for the fact that all ten women she invited to join her proposed cabinet are white. One of her critics, Labour MP Clive Lewis asked: ""Where are the BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] women politicians?"" In a statementposted on Facebook,externalon Monday, Ms Lucas wrote: ""An all-white list of women isn't right"". ""I should have reached out further and thought more deeply about who, and what kind of politics, an all-white list represents. I apologise."" ""There are women of colour colleagues who are standing up to this government's reckless gamble with Britain's future, and it was wrong to overlook them."" Dr Helen Kowalewska, a research fellow at Southampton University, said there was some academic literature suggesting women could be more co-operative than men. She said other papers suggested women could make more effective leaders - although there was ""much more research showing no such gender differences"". Research on the subject could reinforce stereotypes while excluding people whose gender identity is non-binary, she added. Dr Kowalewsa said a cabinet comprising people from lots of different backgrounds - including, but not limited to, race and class - would be a better representation than a board comprising ""similar women"" only. ""I don't find the concept of an all-woman cabinet helpful, but I do agree that we need more women involved in the Brexit process,"" she said.

"Argentine stock markets and its currency have both plunged after conservative Argentine President Mauricio Macri suffered a shock defeat in primary elections on Sunday. The peso fell 15% against the dollar on Monday after earlier plunging around 30% to a record low. Some of the country's most traded stocks have also lost around half of their value in one day. Mr Macri, in response, has pledged to ""reverse"" Sunday's election result. At a news conference on Monday, the president also said that the drop suggested the market lacked confidence in an opposition government. Is this the end of Macri's vision for Argentina? Argentine leader Macri trounced in primary vote ""This [market meltdown] is just a small demonstration of what can happen,"" said Mr Macri. ""We have much to do still. Every election is a message and we understood it."" At end of trading on Monday, Argentina's main Merval index closed down 31% as some of the country's largest companies saw their market values plummet. Cement producer Loma Negra was among those worst affected, with its share price down around 55%. Financial services firm Galicia Financial also saw a 46% drop in its stock value. The embattled president was defeated by his centre-left rival, Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, who is now seen as the frontrunner for October's presidential race. Alberto FernÃ¡ndez's running mate is ex-President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez His running mate is former President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, who presided over an administration remembered for a high degree of protectionism and heavy state intervention in the economy. Analysis by Daniel Gallas, BBC South America Business Correspondent Argentina is a country that has suffered with all sorts of economic problems that are taught in textbooks. But even by its standards, this market meltdown is unprecedented. In just two hours, a third of the Merval index (which accounts for the most traded stocks in the country) was wiped out in value. Investors are now pushing the ""sell"" button, as many believe it will be impossible for President Mauricio Macri to win the upcoming election in October. If he loses, this will be the end of a pro-business agenda to save Argentina's economy that has been implemented since Mr Macri came to power in 2015, which includes IMF loans, austerity measures and the end of capital controls. Sunday's primaries were seen as vindication for ""Kirchnerismo"" which have for years denounced Mr Macri's plan as ineffective. The country is in recession and still suffering with inflation and poverty. There are still two more months to go until the election - but few believe there will be surprises as big as this one coming up again. Edward Glossop, from the London-based consultancy Capital Economics, said Mr Macri's government could pull out all the stops to try to shore up popular support. This could include easing budget curbs imposed as part of Argentina's agreement with the International Monetary Fund. ""An outright loosening of the purse strings is possible. The IMF would probably turn a blind eye to this, since it is in its interest for President Macri to secure re-election,"" he said, but added: ""We doubt that these efforts would be enough to change voter perception."" President Macri was elected in 2015 on promises to boost Argentina's economy with a sweep of liberal economic reforms. But his promised recovery has yet to materialise - Argentina is currently in a recession and posted 22% inflation for the first half of the year, one of the highest rates globally. More than a third of the country's population is currently living in poverty, according to official figures. Is this the end of Macri's vision for Argentina?

""I don't find the concept of an all-woman cabinet helpful, but I do agree that we need more women involved in the Brexit process,"" she said.

"The UK is ""first in line"" for a trade deal with the US, President Trump's national security adviser has said. John Bolton said the US supported a no-deal Brexit and added Washington would propose an accelerated series of trade deals. Mr Bolton claimed deals could be done on a ""sector-by-sector"" basis, with an agreement on manufacturing made first. However, critics warned the UK would have to give in to some US demands in return for any trade agreement. His comments came after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson at No 10. According to Mr Bolton, a bilateral agreement or ""series of agreements"" could be carved out ""very quickly, very straight-forwardly"". A trade deal for financial services and agriculture would not be the first to be agreed, he added. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Trump-Johnson relationship 'will be sensational' Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? Who is John Bolton? Mr Bolton said ""doing it in pieces"" was not unprecedented and the US understood the importance of doing as much as possible as rapidly as possible before the 31 October exit date. He said there would be enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress for speedy ratification at each stage. Mr Johnson said there ""all sorts"" of opportunities for UK business in the US, particularly service companies, but the negotiations will be a ""tough old haggle"". ""The single biggest deal we need to do is a free trade deal agreement with our friends and partners over the Channel,"" he said. But Nancy Pelosi, who leads the Democrats in the US House of Representatives, said inApril that a US-UK trade deal would not be ""on the cards""if Brexit damaged the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. Asked whether his proposed plan would follow World Trade Organisation rules, Mr Bolton said ""our trade negotiators seem to think it is"". And he insisted the UK was ""constantly at the front of the trade queue"" for the Trump administration. By BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker There is a problem with sector-by-sector trade agreements. They are not compatible with WTO rules, which say free trade agreements for goods should cover ""substantially all the trade"". There is no formal definition of that term but a figure of 90% has often been suggested. It is unlikely a deal covering a few sectors would qualify. Other WTO members could start a dispute and would, on the face of it, have every chance of winning. However, it does not mean it would be impossible. WTO rules are not enforceable in national courts so if the UK and the US wanted to go ahead they probably could. But it would be a strange move for any country committed to the rules-based global trade system that has the WTO at its heart. There is another problem for any trade agreement: whether it meets the ""substantially all the trade"" criterion or not, it would need to be ratified by the US Congress. There is a substantial body of American legislators who would be likely to vote against it if they thought that Brexit had taken place in a way that posed a danger to the peace process and the open border on the island of Ireland. Mr Bolton also referenced Mr Johnson's willingness to participate in Operation Sentinel, which aims to beef up the military presence in the Gulf in the face of tensions between the West and Iran, saying he was ""pleased"" as this ""reflects a change"" from Theresa May's government. Meanwhile, former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw described Mr Bolton as ""dangerously bellicose"", and suggested the UK would have to agree to some US demands, for example allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken. ""This is a highly transactional administrationâ¦ you don't get something for nothing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The EU currently bans chlorine-washed chicken products on welfare grounds Lewis Lukens, a former deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in London and former acting US ambassador, said Mr Bolton was aligned to President Trump's ""America first agenda"" and would be making ""strong demands"" on the UK to back the US position on issues like Huawei, China and Iran. Mr Johnson is expected to have his first face-to-face meeting as prime minister with Mr Trump later this month at the G7 summit in France. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins It would be hard to find a more enthusiastic champion of Brexit than John Bolton: a thoughtful, intellectual, highly combative and controversial champion of the nation state. He caused havoc as US ambassador to the United Nations between 2005 and 2006 with his open rejection of the UN's usefulness except where it served the direct interests of the US. So it should be no surprise that he told us at a briefing during his London visit: ""Britain's success in successfully exiting the European Union is a statement about democratic rule and constitutional government that's important for Britain, but it's important for the United States too."" He stressed it was very much in the US interest and there was no ""quid pro quo"" with any other issues. By that, he was denying all suggestions that Britain would be expected to fall into line with Washington's Iran policy - although he clearly hoped that it might. Likewise, he welcomed Mr Johnson's position on Huawei and 5G technology, calling it ""Britain going back to square one"" and re-examining the issue. For now, Mr Bolton said, Britain was entirely focused on Brexit. The US is willing to wait. But that does leave open many questions about future relations and possible political trade-offs with the United States. If Mr Bolton's major intervention in trade negotiations has raised some eyebrows, the National Security Advisor had a forthright answer to that. He pointed us to the National Security Act of 1947 and told us firmly that his remit includes economic security, because the security of a nation depends fundamentally on its prosperity.

"Migrants travelling to the US sleep on a basketball court in Mexico The US is a country shaped by immigration - but at many times in its history, there has been controversy over new arrivals. A closer look at those who call the country home reveals the great changes that have taken place and the contribution immigrants make. Today, nearly 14% of the population of the US was born overseas. This is a sharp rise from the historical low of just under 5% in 1970 but roughly the same as between 1870 and 1910. After a wave of arrivals from Europe in the late 19th Century, immigration fell dramatically - from about one million a year in 1910 to only 165,000 by 1924. This was largely the result of limits on the number of immigrants from particular countries but the economic turmoil of the Great Depression and the two world wars also played a part. The second half of the 20th Century saw quotas lifted and policies aimed at family reunification introduced. In 1986, an amnesty was granted to many people living in the US without documentation. Today, the foreign-born population varies widely across the country, ranging from under 5% in parts of the South East and Midwest, to more than 20% in California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York. Although the number of immigrants now arriving in the US is just half the level seen around 1900, the overall foreign-born share of the population is similar. In the US, the rising immigrant share of the population is not simply due to more people arriving but is also due to the falling birth rate among the native population. Since the 1960s, the average number of children had by women in the US has fallen from 3.7 to 1.8. This has led to a fall in the number of people described as prime working age (those who are 25 to 54) who are the children of native-born parents. In contrast, the population of immigrants and their children has continued to grow. Migrant caravan: What is it and why does it matter? Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' What Trump's got wrong on birthright law The agony over an American dream Most immigrants to the US are in the country legally. In 2014, 44% of the foreign-born population had been granted US citizenship.  A further 27% are green card holders - making them legal permanent residents - and 4% are temporary residents with authorisation to live in the country. Roughly one in four immigrants, or 11.1 million people, is living in the country without legal authorisation. This proportion has fallen, following a sharp drop in net unauthorised immigration from about 500,000 per year in the early 2000s to roughly zero since 2009. About 75% of unauthorised immigrants are thought to have lived in the US for more than 10 years. Fewer than one in five are under the age of 24, with three out of four thought to be 25- to 54-year-olds. Roughly 800,000 people who entered the US as children have claimed temporary partial legal status. These are theso-called Dreamers, whose legal status has been thrown into question by policy changes introduced by the Trump administration. A girl waits on a bridge at the US-Mexico border Today, most immigrants to the US come from Latin America or Asia - a big change from a century ago, when most arrived from Europe. In 2017, 27% of foreign-born US residents were from Mexico, compared with under 2% in 1910. A further 17% were from other Latin American countries, including El Salvador and Cuba. Almost one in three immigrants to the US are now from Asian countries, with India and China accounting for the largest share - 6.5% and 4.7% of all immigrants respectively. In 2017, one in 10 immigrants was from Europe, compared with nine out of 10 in 1910. While the locations have changed, immigrants have tended to come from places poorer than the US, as people seek better circumstances. Output per capita in 1910 in Italy was roughly a third of that in the US, as is the case in Mexico today. One of the clearest ways in which the diversity of immigrants can be seen is in their widely varying educational attainment. Immigrants are more likely to have a master's degree or doctorate than the children of parents born in the US. However, nearly one in four immigrants has not graduated from high school - compared with about one in 20 people born in the US. Yet immigrants to the US tend to be more skilled than their peers who do not emigrate This may be because of the limited social safety net available to those with poor prospects, better prospects for highly skilled immigrants and the relatively high cost of reaching the US for many. Regardless of the characteristics of their parents, children of immigrants tend to attain educational outcomes that are similar to those of the children of native-born parents. More like this Where a six-figure salary is 'low income' The puzzle of America's most optimistic people The places America's rich and poor call home Immigrants contribute directly to economic growth - boosting the population and increasing demand for goods and services. Giving many unauthorised immigrants citizenship and allowing more immigration would raise annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth - the total value of goods and services produced - by 0.33 percentage points over the next decade, the US Congressional Budget Office has suggested. In contrast,removing unauthorised immigrants would lower growth by 0.27 percentage points a year,external. This is significant when it comes to national economic growth. A 10-year$1.5 trillion infrastructure investment might boost GDP by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points,externalper year. Immigrants also contribute to economic growth in a less direct way. Although they account for only 18% of workers over the age of 25, immigrants account for 28% of high quality patents - a sign of underlying technological progress, linked to productivity and economic growth. Output in the economy is higher and grows faster with more immigrants, as they increase the number of workers and productivity. Immigrant workers accounted for 39% of the increase in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics jobs - rising to 29% of all workers in this sector - in 2010. Nevertheless, they are most likely to be employed in service occupations, such as chefs, housekeepers and nursing aides. Immigrants also tend to have a positive impact on US finances,external- paying more in taxes than they receive in government services, when compared with native-born workers. It is particularly striking that among low-skilled workers, immigrants are more likely to be employed and less likely to receive government benefits than those born in the US. Since its founding, immigrants have been an integral part of the fabric weaving together the US economy and society writ large. Understanding who they are and what role they have in the US can help shape the debate around those who make it their home in years to come.

"As campaigning for the 2020 election ramps up, President Donald Trump has continued to focus on immigration as a key issue, calling the number of migrants at the southern border a national security crisis. But what do the numbers say about undocumented immigrants already in the US? New reports of unsanitary and at times dangerous conditions at migrant detention facilities along the US-Mexico border has added fuel to the immigration debate. Democratic lawmakers have been touring the centres, describing conditions where migrants are reportedly forced to drink water out of toilets. In June, Congress passed a bill to send $4.6bn (Â£3.6bn) to address the ongoing crisis at the border, amid growing outrage over the conditions. But while the number of apprehensions at the border has been rising over the last two years, the number of undocumented immigrants in the US is decreasing,according to new analysis from the Pew Research Center,external. Much of that has to do with unauthorised Mexican immigrants - many of whom are now leaving the US. Analysing US census data from 1990 until 2017, Pew reported a decline in the overall undocumented immigrant population within the US. After a high of 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in 2007, the totals for 2017 dipped by nearly two million. Pew attributes this decline largely to a decrease in unauthorised Mexican immigrants, with more leaving the US than entering. People walk towards Mexico from San Ysidro, California The departure of Mexican-born immigrants means that for the first time in decades, they are no longer the majority demographic of undocumented residents in the US, according to Pew. That said, they do still make up a significant share of the population at just under five million of the total 10.5 million. Trump vows 'merit-based' immigration rules 'Why I'm leaving' - the new migrant caravan According to 2016 data, California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Georgia and Illinois had the highest populations of undocumented immigrants. Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia, Maine and Vermont had around 5,000 or fewer undocumented residents. Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US Trump's border wall - in seven charts The decline in undocumented immigrants is apparent across the country, even in five out of the six states with the largest populations of these immigrants. Five states did see rises in their undocumented populations compared to 2007: Louisiana, Maryland, the Dakotas and Massachusetts. Migrants are loaded onto a bus by US Border Patrol agents after being detained when they crossed into the United States from Mexico As evidenced at the border, the demographics of undocumented migrants arriving in the US are changing. The number of Central American migrants - particularly from the Northern Triangle region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras - is on the rise. But 2017 still saw fewer unauthorised arrivals than 2007, mostly due to the drop in Mexicans entering the US. And reports by the Department of Homeland Security note that most undocumented immigrants do not cross the US border illegally, but rather overstay their visas. In 2017, Canadians overstaying their visa made up the largest group of these migrants, followed by Mexicans. Trump wall: How much has he actually built?

"Argentine stock markets and its currency have both plunged after conservative Argentine President Mauricio Macri suffered a shock defeat in primary elections on Sunday. The peso fell 15% against the dollar on Monday after earlier plunging around 30% to a record low. Some of the country's most traded stocks have also lost around half of their value in one day. Mr Macri, in response, has pledged to ""reverse"" Sunday's election result. At a news conference on Monday, the president also said that the drop suggested the market lacked confidence in an opposition government. Is this the end of Macri's vision for Argentina? Argentine leader Macri trounced in primary vote ""This [market meltdown] is just a small demonstration of what can happen,"" said Mr Macri. ""We have much to do still. Every election is a message and we understood it."" At end of trading on Monday, Argentina's main Merval index closed down 31% as some of the country's largest companies saw their market values plummet. Cement producer Loma Negra was among those worst affected, with its share price down around 55%. Financial services firm Galicia Financial also saw a 46% drop in its stock value. The embattled president was defeated by his centre-left rival, Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, who is now seen as the frontrunner for October's presidential race. Alberto FernÃ¡ndez's running mate is ex-President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez His running mate is former President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, who presided over an administration remembered for a high degree of protectionism and heavy state intervention in the economy. Analysis by Daniel Gallas, BBC South America Business Correspondent Argentina is a country that has suffered with all sorts of economic problems that are taught in textbooks. But even by its standards, this market meltdown is unprecedented. In just two hours, a third of the Merval index (which accounts for the most traded stocks in the country) was wiped out in value. Investors are now pushing the ""sell"" button, as many believe it will be impossible for President Mauricio Macri to win the upcoming election in October. If he loses, this will be the end of a pro-business agenda to save Argentina's economy that has been implemented since Mr Macri came to power in 2015, which includes IMF loans, austerity measures and the end of capital controls. Sunday's primaries were seen as vindication for ""Kirchnerismo"" which have for years denounced Mr Macri's plan as ineffective. The country is in recession and still suffering with inflation and poverty. There are still two more months to go until the election - but few believe there will be surprises as big as this one coming up again. Edward Glossop, from the London-based consultancy Capital Economics, said Mr Macri's government could pull out all the stops to try to shore up popular support. This could include easing budget curbs imposed as part of Argentina's agreement with the International Monetary Fund. ""An outright loosening of the purse strings is possible. The IMF would probably turn a blind eye to this, since it is in its interest for President Macri to secure re-election,"" he said, but added: ""We doubt that these efforts would be enough to change voter perception."" President Macri was elected in 2015 on promises to boost Argentina's economy with a sweep of liberal economic reforms. But his promised recovery has yet to materialise - Argentina is currently in a recession and posted 22% inflation for the first half of the year, one of the highest rates globally. More than a third of the country's population is currently living in poverty, according to official figures. Is this the end of Macri's vision for Argentina?

"This video can not be played Caroline Lucas tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire why she wants an all-women cabinet A Green Party MP has been criticised after suggesting an all-women ""emergency cabinet"" could meet to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. Writing in the Guardian,,externalCaroline Lucas said the cross-party group, formed of 10 female politicians, could ""bring a different perspective"". Ms Lucas said the cabinet could organise another EU referendum if the PM is defeated in a no-confidence vote. But cabinet minister Liz Truss criticised the plan as sexist. Ms Lucas - a former leader of the Green Party - has also apologised after receiving criticism for only inviting white women to sit on her proposed group. In her article, she suggested MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit should try to defeat Boris Johnson in ano-confidence vote, then replace him with a ""national unity government"". This arrangement - when a group of MPs from different parties choose to work together - has not been seen since the Second World War. An all-female cabinet, she suggested, could then ""press the pause button"" and organise another referendum offering a choice between staying in the EU or the government's Brexit plan, whether that is an agreed deal or no deal. But her idea was criticised by International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, who tweeted: ""Is there anything more sexist than claiming your gender determines your worldview/behaviour/attitude?"" Defending her proposal, Ms Lucas told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It is a generalisation and there are plenty of exceptions, but I would argue, generally and in my experience, women tend to be less tribal and tend to find it easier to establish trust more quickly. ""I simply want to see whether or not by bring women together the key women from across Westminster whether or not we could generate a new dynamic,"" she added. ""We are facing a crisis. Time is running out."" MP cautious on all-female unity cabinet bid Greens call for new Brexit referendum Sturgeon 'would work with all-female cabinet' Liz Truss criticised the proposals as sexist Among the women Ms Lucas has invited to join her are Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Conservative MP Justine Greening, and Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts. The others are: Heidi Allen, Kirsty Blackman, Yvette Cooper, Sylvia Hermon, and Anna Soubry. She has asked to meet the 10 women in the coming days. On Monday, Ms Lucas told the BBC she had received responses from five of the women she has written to, expressing differing levels of interest. She also added that her proposed unity government would have to be led by a female Labour MP, as they would be representing the largest opposition party. She said she wasn't completely against involving men - for instance accepting that a key anti-Brexit campaigner like Dominic Grieve could be given a cabinet seat. Asked about her invitation to join the proposed female cabinet, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I'm happy to work with anybody, male or female, to try to stop Brexit"". ""I'm all for more women in politics, I think we can bring a different perspective,"" she told ITV's Loose Women. ""But I do feel duty-bound to point out that the former prime minister of course was a woman and didn't manage to sort out Brexit - so there's maybe a flaw in that argument."" Ms Thornberrytweeted a reply,externalto say she would not be able to take part in the planned talks because she is currently on holiday. She added that returning the issue of Brexit ""to the people"" was the ""best route to go down at this point"". ""My fear with the other suggested route - imposing some alternative coalition government without any reference to the public - would risk worsening the feelings of anger and resentment towards 'Westminster' that have led us into this Brexit mess,"" she added. Ms Saville Roberts welcomed Ms Lucas's bid to break the deadlock over Brexit, but said she was ""not entirely comfortable"" that only women would be involved. Ms Soubry, who leads the Independent Group for Change, said she believed in the ""power of women"", but a national unity government should be formed ""irrespective of gender"". Ms Lucas has also faced criticism for the fact that all ten women she invited to join her proposed cabinet are white. One of her critics, Labour MP Clive Lewis asked: ""Where are the BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] women politicians?"" In a statementposted on Facebook,externalon Monday, Ms Lucas wrote: ""An all-white list of women isn't right"". ""I should have reached out further and thought more deeply about who, and what kind of politics, an all-white list represents. I apologise."" ""There are women of colour colleagues who are standing up to this government's reckless gamble with Britain's future, and it was wrong to overlook them."" Dr Helen Kowalewska, a research fellow at Southampton University, said there was some academic literature suggesting women could be more co-operative than men. She said other papers suggested women could make more effective leaders - although there was ""much more research showing no such gender differences"". Research on the subject could reinforce stereotypes while excluding people whose gender identity is non-binary, she added. Dr Kowalewsa said a cabinet comprising people from lots of different backgrounds - including, but not limited to, race and class - would be a better representation than a board comprising ""similar women"" only. ""I don't find the concept of an all-woman cabinet helpful, but I do agree that we need more women involved in the Brexit process,"" she said.

"Water was above rail level in Winchburgh tunnel meaning trains could only travel through at 5mph, causing significant delays Transport issues are easing off after heavy rain and flooding caused delays across Scotland. Storms on Saturday and Sunday left many areas waterlogged and made the return to work on Monday morning problematic for many. Flooding at the Winchburgh tunnel near Linlithgow disrupted travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh and from Edinburgh to Dunblane. A speed restriction put in place on the line has now been lifted. Flooding also caused a signalling fault which has been fixed and passengers have been advised that bus replacement services are no longer in place. Allow Twitter content?

The problems at Winchburgh came after the same tunnel was flooded a week ago. Earlier ScotRail operations director David Simpson told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""We had a report of more flood water at Winchburgh at the start of service this morning. ""We sent some engineers to site and they reported the water just above the rail level there. ""We are having to send trains at slower speed through that area, reduce the number of trains and those trains are seeing delays as they pass through the tunnel at a lower speed."" Passengers at Dunblane faced a challenging commute on Monday morning Frustrated passengers took to social media complaining that the ground had been lowered in the tunnel to accommodate new electric train tracks. Mr Simpson said monitoring of the tunnel had taken place across the weekend and pumps were used to remove water. But he admitted more work was needed to rectify whatever was causing the regular flooding. He said: ""The volume of rain that fell yesterday on top of saturated land over the last few days has caused this. ""We have to look at why we have seen more flooding there and work with our Network Rail colleagues to make that area more resilient. ""The last thing people want on Monday morning is delays and cancellations."" Flooding closed part of the West Coast mainline on Sunday He said that as part of an extra Â£160m investment in weather resilience across Scotland over the next five years, ScotRail would be working with Network Rail to look at targeted problems areas such as Winchburgh. The West Highland line remains affected by landslips north of Helensburgh. Routes re-opened to Oban on Monday but south of Crainlarich, several locations required major work. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued 10 flood alerts on Sunday. Trains were again affected afterthe West Coast mainline between England and Scotland was closedtemporarily due to flooding. In Ayrshire, warnings were sent out that two of the region's rivers were in danger of breaching their banks. East Ayrshire Council distributed more than 7,000 sandbags to protect households in the areas around Kilmarnock Water and River Irvine. The Odeon Cinema in Kilmarnock evacuated dozens of customers mid-film when the River Irvine's banks burst in Queen's Drive. The town's Asda supermarket was also closed early. Prestwick Airport car park was flooded when holidaymakers returned to pick up their cars Holidaymakers returning to Prestwick Airport arrived from their flights to find their cars partly submerged in the car park. David Shearer returned from a weekend in Barcelona at about 23:30 on Sunday and told the BBC news website: ""Car park three was closed. It has flooded at about 14:00 and a lot of cars were not drivable. I was lucky , my car was drivable but did have a lot of water in it. ""People were in tears."" A spokesman for Prestwick Airport said: ""It happened very quickly. The burn behind the car park filled up and took us all by surprise. ""We towed out the cars which needed it and the water is gone now."" In Dumfries and Galloway, the A7 was shut by a landslide south of Langholm on Saturday - one lane has since reopened and traffic lights are in place at Skippers Bridge. Central Fife was also experiencing flooding on Monday morning, with Haugh Road in Burntisland closed. The weather forecast was drier and brighter for Monday, with lighter showers overnight.

"Drug crime is increasing in many small towns and villages even as it falls significantly in city centres, the BBC has found. Police data shows drug crimes in England and Wales have fallen by more than 50,000 in the past five years. But national averages hide a major shift in where drug crimes are being committed. It comes asthe government pledged an extra Â£85m to prosecutorsto help deal with a rise in violent crime. In London, 30 out of 36 areas saw either a decrease or no significant change in recorded drug crime over the past five years. But moving outside of the capital, in the South East and East of England, there were 74 small towns and villages that bucked the trend and saw increases in drug crime. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The map above used a statistical model to classify areas that have experienced a significant change in drug crime. Weight is given to areas with a strong overall trend of increasing or decreasing crime across several years. Where there is no strong overall pattern in a particular location, those areas have been labelled as having ""no change"". 'Drug crime' refers to drug-related incidents reported to or identified by the police that an officer classes as criminal, whether or not the crime results in a charge. Taphere,externalif you can't see the interactive map above In Liverpool drug crime has fallen by nearly 20%, but 15 miles away in Chester it increased by 40%. The push from drug gangs to find new markets within easy commuting distance of their home cities where competition for market share may be lower than in their base is sometimes called county lines. County lines often involves the use of teenagers to ferry drugs between cities and towns, and to set up drug-dealing operations in the homes of addicts in a process known as ""cuckooing"". The National Crime Agency says more and more children and young people are being referred to the ""National Referral Mechanism"", a system designed to identify human-trafficking victims, as a result of county lines. ""The county lines model is linked to violence and relies on the exploitation of vulnerable people to make a criminal profit, with organised crime networks bringing terror to the communities they operate in,"" NCA spokesman Nikki Holland said. ""We're working with partners to gather vital intelligence to help us dismantle these networks piece by piece and ultimately protect those at risk of harm."" London, the West Midlands and Liverpool are the biggest exporters of county lines drug crime, according to NCA analysis, with increasingly diverse areas targeted by the gangs, from large towns to rural communities. County lines' drug runners 'as young as 11' Victim's 'terrifying' cuckooing ordeal 'My son was groomed to sell drugs' The BBC counted the number of drug crimes in ""built-up areas"" - the villages, towns and cities where people live, according to boundaries drawn up by the Office for National Statistics - using recorded crime data from the police data archive. It then measured how much recorded crime went up or down in each area in the five years from 2013 to 2018. However, the volume of crimes recorded can be affected by police activities and how the police focus on their different priorities. Most of the smaller areas in the data have seen falls in recorded drug crime, defined as offences involving either the possession or supply of illegal drugs, broadly in line with the national picture of reducing drug crime overall. But of the 200 areas where drug crime has increased the most since 2013, almost three quarters have a population which is lower than the average for all built-up areas. In contrast, of the 200 areas where drug crime has decreased the most, nine in 10 have an above-average population. As well as towns on the peripheries of cities seeing increases, another pattern can be seen along the south coast of England. Bournemouth and Weymouth both saw rises of at least 50%, and Swanage, Bridport, Lyme Regis, Exeter and Redruth in Cornwall all saw significant increases in drug crime. ""As a society, as law enforcement, as people who work in the public sector, as the public, we all need to come together and we all need to understand that this is happening on our streets right across the country. And we need to work together, as we are, to do something about it,"" Assistant Chief Constable Chris Green, the head of the North-West Regional Organised Crime Unit, told the BBC. ""There are conservative estimates of 10,000 children. Ten thousand children across the United Kingdom who have been dragged into county lines. ""If you have someone who is criminally exploiting a child, a young person for the purposes of criminality, they are ruining their lives by exposing them to risk that they shouldn't be exposed to. They're dragging them into criminality, and once they're dragged into that criminality it has huge consequences for their life chances. ""Are they abusing that child? Absolutely they are. "" Correction 12 September 2019: This article originally referred to the village of Westhumble in Surrey, where figures show there's been an increase in drugs offences in the past year. Surrey police subsequently confirmed these cases were related to drugs possession in the surrounding area and on the 13 August we updated our article to reflect that.

"The changes will come into force in September A university is banning the sale of burgers to try to fight global warming. Goldsmiths, University of London, is removing all beef products from sale - and charging a 10p levy on bottled water and single-use plastic cups. It plans to install more solar panels across its New Cross campus, in south-east London, and switch to a 100% clean energy supplier as soon as possible. It will spend money on its allotment and identify other areas where planting could help to absorb carbon dioxide. The university emits about 3.7 million kg of carbon each year but is hoping to become carbon neutral by 2025. And it will try to increase the number of students studying climate change. Scientists saybeef is more damaging to the environmentas cows produce more methane and require more land and water than other livestock. The college's new head, Prof Frances Corner, said: ""The growing global call for organisations to take seriously their responsibilities for halting climate change is impossible to ignore. Prof Frances Corner says we face a ""defining moment"" ""Though I have only just arrived at Goldsmiths, it is immediately obvious that our staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that they are determined to help deliver the step change we need to cut our carbon footprint drastically and as quickly as possible. ""Declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words. ""I truly believe we face a defining moment in global history and Goldsmiths now stands shoulder to shoulder with other organisations willing to call the alarm and take urgent action to cut carbon use."" Goldsmiths Students' Union president Joe Leam said: ""Our house is on fire,"" invoking the words of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. ""I believe Frances Corner and the university management are realising this and making these changes to put their part of the house fire out. ""The SU will be a part of this process every step of the way to make sure this stays true, seeking to speed the process up wherever possible, and will keep the college community updated throughout."" Rosie Rogers, of Greenpeace UK, said: ""It's encouraging to see an institution like Goldsmiths not simply declaring a climate emergency but acting on it. ""From energy use, to food sales and plastic pollution - all universities and organisations with campus sites can make changes across their facilities that are better for our planet.

The National Crime Agency says more and more children and young people are being referred to the ""National Referral Mechanism"", a system designed to identify human-trafficking victims, as a result of county lines. ""The county lines model is linked to violence and relies on the exploitation of vulnerable people to make a criminal profit, with organised crime networks bringing terror to the communities they operate in,"" NCA spokesman Nikki Holland said. ""We're working with partners to gather vital intelligence to help us dismantle these networks piece by piece and ultimately protect those at risk of harm.""

It then measured how much recorded crime went up or down in each area in the five years from 2013 to 2018. However, the volume of crimes recorded can be affected by police activities and how the police focus on their different priorities. Most of the smaller areas in the data have seen falls in recorded drug crime, defined as offences involving either the possession or supply of illegal drugs, broadly in line with the national picture of reducing drug crime overall. But of the 200 areas where drug crime has increased the most since 2013, almost three quarters have a population which is lower than the average for all built-up areas. In contrast, of the 200 areas where drug crime has decreased the most, nine in 10 have an above-average population. As well as towns on the peripheries of cities seeing increases, another pattern can be seen along the south coast of England. Bournemouth and Weymouth both saw rises of at least 50%, and Swanage, Bridport, Lyme Regis, Exeter and Redruth in Cornwall all saw significant increases in drug crime. ""As a society, as law enforcement, as people who work in the public sector, as the public, we all need to come together and we all need to understand that this is happening on our streets right across the country.

"Drug crime is increasing in many small towns and villages even as it falls significantly in city centres, the BBC has found. Police data shows drug crimes in England and Wales have fallen by more than 50,000 in the past five years. But national averages hide a major shift in where drug crimes are being committed. It comes asthe government pledged an extra Â£85m to prosecutorsto help deal with a rise in violent crime. In London, 30 out of 36 areas saw either a decrease or no significant change in recorded drug crime over the past five years. But moving outside of the capital, in the South East and East of England, there were 74 small towns and villages that bucked the trend and saw increases in drug crime. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The map above used a statistical model to classify areas that have experienced a significant change in drug crime. Weight is given to areas with a strong overall trend of increasing or decreasing crime across several years. Where there is no strong overall pattern in a particular location, those areas have been labelled as having ""no change"". 'Drug crime' refers to drug-related incidents reported to or identified by the police that an officer classes as criminal, whether or not the crime results in a charge.

"Migrants travelling to the US sleep on a basketball court in Mexico The US is a country shaped by immigration - but at many times in its history, there has been controversy over new arrivals. A closer look at those who call the country home reveals the great changes that have taken place and the contribution immigrants make. Today, nearly 14% of the population of the US was born overseas. This is a sharp rise from the historical low of just under 5% in 1970 but roughly the same as between 1870 and 1910. After a wave of arrivals from Europe in the late 19th Century, immigration fell dramatically - from about one million a year in 1910 to only 165,000 by 1924. This was largely the result of limits on the number of immigrants from particular countries but the economic turmoil of the Great Depression and the two world wars also played a part. The second half of the 20th Century saw quotas lifted and policies aimed at family reunification introduced. In 1986, an amnesty was granted to many people living in the US without documentation. Today, the foreign-born population varies widely across the country, ranging from under 5% in parts of the South East and Midwest, to more than 20% in California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York. Although the number of immigrants now arriving in the US is just half the level seen around 1900, the overall foreign-born share of the population is similar. In the US, the rising immigrant share of the population is not simply due to more people arriving but is also due to the falling birth rate among the native population. Since the 1960s, the average number of children had by women in the US has fallen from 3.7 to 1.8. This has led to a fall in the number of people described as prime working age (those who are 25 to 54) who are the children of native-born parents. In contrast, the population of immigrants and their children has continued to grow. Migrant caravan: What is it and why does it matter? Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' What Trump's got wrong on birthright law The agony over an American dream Most immigrants to the US are in the country legally. In 2014, 44% of the foreign-born population had been granted US citizenship.  A further 27% are green card holders - making them legal permanent residents - and 4% are temporary residents with authorisation to live in the country. Roughly one in four immigrants, or 11.1 million people, is living in the country without legal authorisation. This proportion has fallen, following a sharp drop in net unauthorised immigration from about 500,000 per year in the early 2000s to roughly zero since 2009. About 75% of unauthorised immigrants are thought to have lived in the US for more than 10 years. Fewer than one in five are under the age of 24, with three out of four thought to be 25- to 54-year-olds. Roughly 800,000 people who entered the US as children have claimed temporary partial legal status. These are theso-called Dreamers, whose legal status has been thrown into question by policy changes introduced by the Trump administration. A girl waits on a bridge at the US-Mexico border Today, most immigrants to the US come from Latin America or Asia - a big change from a century ago, when most arrived from Europe. In 2017, 27% of foreign-born US residents were from Mexico, compared with under 2% in 1910. A further 17% were from other Latin American countries, including El Salvador and Cuba. Almost one in three immigrants to the US are now from Asian countries, with India and China accounting for the largest share - 6.5% and 4.7% of all immigrants respectively. In 2017, one in 10 immigrants was from Europe, compared with nine out of 10 in 1910. While the locations have changed, immigrants have tended to come from places poorer than the US, as people seek better circumstances. Output per capita in 1910 in Italy was roughly a third of that in the US, as is the case in Mexico today. One of the clearest ways in which the diversity of immigrants can be seen is in their widely varying educational attainment. Immigrants are more likely to have a master's degree or doctorate than the children of parents born in the US. However, nearly one in four immigrants has not graduated from high school - compared with about one in 20 people born in the US. Yet immigrants to the US tend to be more skilled than their peers who do not emigrate This may be because of the limited social safety net available to those with poor prospects, better prospects for highly skilled immigrants and the relatively high cost of reaching the US for many. Regardless of the characteristics of their parents, children of immigrants tend to attain educational outcomes that are similar to those of the children of native-born parents. More like this Where a six-figure salary is 'low income' The puzzle of America's most optimistic people The places America's rich and poor call home Immigrants contribute directly to economic growth - boosting the population and increasing demand for goods and services. Giving many unauthorised immigrants citizenship and allowing more immigration would raise annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth - the total value of goods and services produced - by 0.33 percentage points over the next decade, the US Congressional Budget Office has suggested. In contrast,removing unauthorised immigrants would lower growth by 0.27 percentage points a year,external. This is significant when it comes to national economic growth. A 10-year$1.5 trillion infrastructure investment might boost GDP by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points,externalper year. Immigrants also contribute to economic growth in a less direct way. Although they account for only 18% of workers over the age of 25, immigrants account for 28% of high quality patents - a sign of underlying technological progress, linked to productivity and economic growth. Output in the economy is higher and grows faster with more immigrants, as they increase the number of workers and productivity. Immigrant workers accounted for 39% of the increase in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics jobs - rising to 29% of all workers in this sector - in 2010. Nevertheless, they are most likely to be employed in service occupations, such as chefs, housekeepers and nursing aides. Immigrants also tend to have a positive impact on US finances,external- paying more in taxes than they receive in government services, when compared with native-born workers. It is particularly striking that among low-skilled workers, immigrants are more likely to be employed and less likely to receive government benefits than those born in the US. Since its founding, immigrants have been an integral part of the fabric weaving together the US economy and society writ large. Understanding who they are and what role they have in the US can help shape the debate around those who make it their home in years to come.

"This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip. The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists. This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on. It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub. The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Read more about Hong Kong's history Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule. The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected. For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline. Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China. There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong. The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"". The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Another sticking point has been democratic reform. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters. Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers. Some elected members have even been disbarredafter Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them. Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Were triads involved in Hong Kong attacks? Hong Kong'smini-constitution, the Basic Law,external, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like. The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature. In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear. While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese. Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show thatmost people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"",external-only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"",external- and 71% of people saythey do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens,external. The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young. ""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says. Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China. There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living. Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government. Demonstrations in 2014 went on for several weeks There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years. In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets. Do protests ever work in China? Young and unhappy in HK Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position. This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019 While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard. As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change. And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003,up to 500,000 people took to the streets,externalto protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over""patriotic education"" classesfollowing rallies against the move. However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority. In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing. In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions. In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies. In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts. The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.

"As campaigning for the 2020 election ramps up, President Donald Trump has continued to focus on immigration as a key issue, calling the number of migrants at the southern border a national security crisis. But what do the numbers say about undocumented immigrants already in the US? New reports of unsanitary and at times dangerous conditions at migrant detention facilities along the US-Mexico border has added fuel to the immigration debate. Democratic lawmakers have been touring the centres, describing conditions where migrants are reportedly forced to drink water out of toilets. In June, Congress passed a bill to send $4.6bn (Â£3.6bn) to address the ongoing crisis at the border, amid growing outrage over the conditions. But while the number of apprehensions at the border has been rising over the last two years, the number of undocumented immigrants in the US is decreasing,according to new analysis from the Pew Research Center,external. Much of that has to do with unauthorised Mexican immigrants - many of whom are now leaving the US. Analysing US census data from 1990 until 2017, Pew reported a decline in the overall undocumented immigrant population within the US. After a high of 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in 2007, the totals for 2017 dipped by nearly two million. Pew attributes this decline largely to a decrease in unauthorised Mexican immigrants, with more leaving the US than entering. People walk towards Mexico from San Ysidro, California The departure of Mexican-born immigrants means that for the first time in decades, they are no longer the majority demographic of undocumented residents in the US, according to Pew. That said, they do still make up a significant share of the population at just under five million of the total 10.5 million. Trump vows 'merit-based' immigration rules 'Why I'm leaving' - the new migrant caravan According to 2016 data, California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Georgia and Illinois had the highest populations of undocumented immigrants. Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia, Maine and Vermont had around 5,000 or fewer undocumented residents. Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US Trump's border wall - in seven charts The decline in undocumented immigrants is apparent across the country, even in five out of the six states with the largest populations of these immigrants. Five states did see rises in their undocumented populations compared to 2007: Louisiana, Maryland, the Dakotas and Massachusetts. Migrants are loaded onto a bus by US Border Patrol agents after being detained when they crossed into the United States from Mexico As evidenced at the border, the demographics of undocumented migrants arriving in the US are changing. The number of Central American migrants - particularly from the Northern Triangle region of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras - is on the rise. But 2017 still saw fewer unauthorised arrivals than 2007, mostly due to the drop in Mexicans entering the US. And reports by the Department of Homeland Security note that most undocumented immigrants do not cross the US border illegally, but rather overstay their visas. In 2017, Canadians overstaying their visa made up the largest group of these migrants, followed by Mexicans. Trump wall: How much has he actually built?

"The changes will come into force in September A university is banning the sale of burgers to try to fight global warming. Goldsmiths, University of London, is removing all beef products from sale - and charging a 10p levy on bottled water and single-use plastic cups. It plans to install more solar panels across its New Cross campus, in south-east London, and switch to a 100% clean energy supplier as soon as possible. It will spend money on its allotment and identify other areas where planting could help to absorb carbon dioxide. The university emits about 3.7 million kg of carbon each year but is hoping to become carbon neutral by 2025. And it will try to increase the number of students studying climate change. Scientists saybeef is more damaging to the environmentas cows produce more methane and require more land and water than other livestock. The college's new head, Prof Frances Corner, said: ""The growing global call for organisations to take seriously their responsibilities for halting climate change is impossible to ignore. Prof Frances Corner says we face a ""defining moment"" ""Though I have only just arrived at Goldsmiths, it is immediately obvious that our staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that they are determined to help deliver the step change we need to cut our carbon footprint drastically and as quickly as possible. ""Declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words. ""I truly believe we face a defining moment in global history and Goldsmiths now stands shoulder to shoulder with other organisations willing to call the alarm and take urgent action to cut carbon use."" Goldsmiths Students' Union president Joe Leam said: ""Our house is on fire,"" invoking the words of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. ""I believe Frances Corner and the university management are realising this and making these changes to put their part of the house fire out. ""The SU will be a part of this process every step of the way to make sure this stays true, seeking to speed the process up wherever possible, and will keep the college community updated throughout."" Rosie Rogers, of Greenpeace UK, said: ""It's encouraging to see an institution like Goldsmiths not simply declaring a climate emergency but acting on it. ""From energy use, to food sales and plastic pollution - all universities and organisations with campus sites can make changes across their facilities that are better for our planet. ""We call on others to urgently follow suit and to include cutting all ties from fossil fuel funding in their climate-emergency response.""

"Greta Thunberg is one of 2019's most sought after voices - but big artists didn't want to work with her, according to the 1975's manager. The climate activist features on the first track of the band's new album. Lead singer Matty Healy and manager Jamie Oborne said Greta is ""the most important person in the world to give a platform to"". ""Other artists didn't want to do it - it's madness. Bigger artists than The 1975."" The 16-year-old Swedish activist spoke at an Extinction Rebellion rally in April The five-minute track opens the new album, Notes on a Conditional Form, set for release in 2020. But thetrack itself was released in July. Its proceeds will go to environmental campaign groupExtinction Rebellion. Jamie Oborne, who founded the label Dirty Hit, said: ""We weren't even going to release it until the album came out, that was never the plan. ""After we met her in Stockholm and recorded it, we agreed it just wasn't a statement that could wait six months to come out. It felt like that would've made it a vanity exercise."" Jamie Oborne says the essay released by The 1975 with Greta Thunberg isn't your traditional opening album track Greta Thunberg became one of the leading voices on climate change last year when she started skipping school to protest for change. It led to aworldwide movement of school strikes. ""Greta represents an a priori truth,"" Jamie said. ""That the world has to change its basic construct and how it operates."" On the track, titled The 1975, the 16-year-old says it's ""time to rebel"" and calls for ""civil disobedience"". ""We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed, all political movements in their current form have failed, but Homo sapiens have not yet failed,"" she adds. ""Now is not the time for speaking politely. Now is the time to speak clearly."" This video can not be played Environmental activist Greta Thunberg says climate change is 'an existential crisis' Jamie tried to contact Greta on Instagram, but it was an unsuccessful attempt. He later ended up being introduced to her dad, Svante Thunberg, who he described as an ""amazing human being"". ""Svante and I connected quite easily - I feel like we are going to be really good friends,"" he said. The 1975 aren't yet completely carbon efficient as a band, but Jamie toldthe Guardian,externalDirty Hit has eliminated single-use plastics and says the band is working on other areas, like pollution created from vinyl production.

"The government is considering giving powers to fine video-sharing apps and websites to the UK's media regulator. The proposal would see Ofcom able to impose multi-million pound fines if it judges the platforms have failed to prevent youngsters seeing pornography, violence and other harmful material. The regulator would take charge of the matter from 19 September 2020. The move is designed to meet the UK's obligations to the EU but may not be required if Brexit occurs in October. Even then, it would only be an interim measure until a separate online harms regulator was appointed at a later date. ""The implementation of the AVMSD [Audiovisual Media Services Directive] is required as part of the United Kingdom's obligations arising from its membership of the European Union and until the UK formally leaves the European Union all of its obligations remain in force,"" said a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. ""If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, we will not be bound to transpose the AVMSD into UK law."" The Telegraph newspaper was first to report the scheme,external. It said that the proposal was ""quietly"" agreed before Parliament's summer break and would give Ofcom the power to fine tech firms up to 5% of their revenues and/or block them in the UK if they failed to comply with its rulings. The watchdog has said that it is ready to adopt the powers. ""These new rules are an important first step in regulating video-sharing online, and we'll work closely with the government to implement them,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We also support plans to go further and legislate for a wider set of protections, including a duty of care for online companies towards their users."" Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat have not commented. YouTube: 'We don't take you down the rabbit hole' Instagram vows to remove all graphic self-harm images from site Self-harm, suicide and social media But TechUK - the industry group that represents the sector - said it hoped that ministers would take a ""balanced and proportionate approach"" to the issue. ""Key to achieving this will be clear and precise definitions across the board, and a proportionate sanctions and compliance regime,"" said its deputy chief executive Antony Walker. The Internet Association added that it hoped any intervention would be proportionate. ""Any new regulation should be targeted at specific harms, and be technically possible to implement in practice - taking into account that resources available vary between companies,"" said Daniel Dyball, the association's executive director. Child safety charity NSPCC has welcomed the announcement. ""The immediacy of livestreaming can make children more vulnerable to being coerced by abusers, who may capture the footage, share it and use it as blackmail,"" commented Andy Burrows, head of the organisation's child safety online policy. ""The directive gives the UK a chance to introduce tough measures on tech firms that have their European headquarters here. ""Crucially, this is a real chance to bring in legislative protections ahead of the forthcoming Online Harms Bill and to finally hold sites to account if they put children at risk.""

"The shipyard in Port Glasgow is expected to be in administration by the end of the week The Scottish government is ""ready and willing"" to take Ferguson shipyard into public ownership, Economy Secretary Derek Mackay has announced. He said this was to avert the yard's closure with the loss of 350 jobs, and to complete two ferries being built there for Cal Mac west coast services. The move followslegal notice being servedthat the business faces administration by the end of this week. Mr Mackay said the government remained open to other investors. But in a statement, he added that it was essential to act without delay, to secure the yard, its workforce and the unfinished ships. A letter has been sent to Ferguson Marine, and its sole shareholder, industrialist Jim McColl, saying the Scottish government is hopeful that directors and creditors ""recognise the importance of completing that transfer as quickly and smoothly as possible"". Shipyard boss and government clash over rescue plan Ferguson set for administration The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Shipshape: when the state steps in On SundayMr McColl was strongly critical of the move towards public ownership, saying it made no economic sense. However, on Friday, Ferguson's chief executive, Gerry Marshall, said directors would support Mr McColl and the Scottish government in trying to reach a positive outcome for the business and its employees. Since then 60 workers have stopped working there, due to the withdrawal of contract agencies, in a bid to protect their financial position. That has taken the workforce below 300. Mr Mackay said:  ""The Scottish government has been working for over two years to find a resolution to the difficulties at Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd. ""Throughout that time, our preference has been to identify viable commercial options to keep the yard going and to finish the vessels. No such solutions have come forward. ""The Scottish government has now indicated to all relevant parties that we are ready and willing to take Ferguson Marine into public ownership and deliver the ferries to secure the continued employment of the workforce in the yard."" An order for CalMac ferries has been at the centre of a very public dispute He added: ""There remains a process to go through to secure the transfer of the yard to the Scottish government, and we are hopeful that all parties recognise the importance of completing that transfer as quickly and as smoothly as possible. ""While we are open to engaging with any parties with a serious interest in investing in and securing a future for the shipyard, it is essential the government acts now to secure the completion of the ferries and continuity of employment at Ferguson's."" Mr Mackay told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmethe government was unwilling to ""hand over a cheque"" to complete the ferries because it would be ""illegal"" and would flout state aid rules. Under European Union rules it is illegal for countries to give financial help to some companies in a way that would give them unfair advantage over others. Mr Mackay said: ""The Â£97m has already been spent on vessels that are not complete. Once we conduct due diligence and if we're in public ownership we'll have sight as to what is required to complete those vessels. ""The alternative is for the government to walk away, the company goes into administration, the jobs are lost, the vessels are not complete."" The government's takeover of the yard follows Mr McColl's rescue of the yard from administration five years ago. The shipyard's main contract since then has been for two ferries, due to serve Arran and the Outer Hebrides. To support it, the Scottish government loaned it Â£45m, in two tranches. That gives it priority over other creditors in taking control of the yard - except for the issuer of a Â£25m bond, which Ferguson required to secure the Cal Mac ferries contract. The fixed price contract was for Â£97m. However, Ferguson now estimates the cost has risen to double that, and the ships are behind schedule. That is being blamed on numerous changes to the design, many of them linked to an innovative dual-fuel engine, using both diesel and liquefied natural gas. Unwilling to fund the difference from his investment firm, Clyde Blowers Capital, Mr McColl sought a deal to share the overrun costs with the Scottish government, but that was rejected. General secretary of the GMB Union in Scotland Gary Smith told BBC Scotland the yard did have a future. ""There has been a problem with two contracts but the truth is we are going to have to renew the fleet of CalMac ferries because frankly they're clapped out,"" he said. ""We know there are other commercial opportunities out there and we know that Ferguson's is at the cutting edge of hydrogen technology and above all, the greatest asset at the yard that we've got is the workforce. ""It's got a huge future, this company is not a basket case by any stretch of the imagination.""

"Water was above rail level in Winchburgh tunnel meaning trains could only travel through at 5mph, causing significant delays Transport issues are easing off after heavy rain and flooding caused delays across Scotland. Storms on Saturday and Sunday left many areas waterlogged and made the return to work on Monday morning problematic for many. Flooding at the Winchburgh tunnel near Linlithgow disrupted travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh and from Edinburgh to Dunblane. A speed restriction put in place on the line has now been lifted. Flooding also caused a signalling fault which has been fixed and passengers have been advised that bus replacement services are no longer in place. Allow Twitter content?

The problems at Winchburgh came after the same tunnel was flooded a week ago. Earlier ScotRail operations director David Simpson told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""We had a report of more flood water at Winchburgh at the start of service this morning. ""We sent some engineers to site and they reported the water just above the rail level there. ""We are having to send trains at slower speed through that area, reduce the number of trains and those trains are seeing delays as they pass through the tunnel at a lower speed."" Passengers at Dunblane faced a challenging commute on Monday morning Frustrated passengers took to social media complaining that the ground had been lowered in the tunnel to accommodate new electric train tracks. Mr Simpson said monitoring of the tunnel had taken place across the weekend and pumps were used to remove water. But he admitted more work was needed to rectify whatever was causing the regular flooding. He said: ""The volume of rain that fell yesterday on top of saturated land over the last few days has caused this. ""We have to look at why we have seen more flooding there and work with our Network Rail colleagues to make that area more resilient. ""The last thing people want on Monday morning is delays and cancellations."" Flooding closed part of the West Coast mainline on Sunday He said that as part of an extra Â£160m investment in weather resilience across Scotland over the next five years, ScotRail would be working with Network Rail to look at targeted problems areas such as Winchburgh. The West Highland line remains affected by landslips north of Helensburgh. Routes re-opened to Oban on Monday but south of Crainlarich, several locations required major work. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued 10 flood alerts on Sunday. Trains were again affected afterthe West Coast mainline between England and Scotland was closedtemporarily due to flooding. In Ayrshire, warnings were sent out that two of the region's rivers were in danger of breaching their banks. East Ayrshire Council distributed more than 7,000 sandbags to protect households in the areas around Kilmarnock Water and River Irvine. The Odeon Cinema in Kilmarnock evacuated dozens of customers mid-film when the River Irvine's banks burst in Queen's Drive. The town's Asda supermarket was also closed early. Prestwick Airport car park was flooded when holidaymakers returned to pick up their cars Holidaymakers returning to Prestwick Airport arrived from their flights to find their cars partly submerged in the car park. David Shearer returned from a weekend in Barcelona at about 23:30 on Sunday and told the BBC news website: ""Car park three was closed. It has flooded at about 14:00 and a lot of cars were not drivable. I was lucky , my car was drivable but did have a lot of water in it. ""People were in tears."" A spokesman for Prestwick Airport said: ""It happened very quickly. The burn behind the car park filled up and took us all by surprise. ""We towed out the cars which needed it and the water is gone now."" In Dumfries and Galloway, the A7 was shut by a landslide south of Langholm on Saturday - one lane has since reopened and traffic lights are in place at Skippers Bridge. Central Fife was also experiencing flooding on Monday morning, with Haugh Road in Burntisland closed. The weather forecast was drier and brighter for Monday, with lighter showers overnight.

"Luxury brand Versace has apologised after an image on one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories. After fierce criticism on social media in China, Versace said it had made a mistake and had stopped selling the tops. It said it ""respects the sovereignty of China's territorial state"". Fashion brands Givenchy and Coach are also facing a backlash for not adhering to China's territorial claims. The Versace T-shirts, images of which were shared on social media, featured city-country pairs such as Milan-Italy and London-UK. These also included Hong Kong-Hong Kong and Macau-Macau.

China has been increasingly strict in policing how foreign firms describe Hong Kong, which is part of China but has a special status, offering its people more autonomy than those on the mainland. Macau is aspecial administrative region of China. In a post on Weibo, the Italian fashion label said it had stopped selling and had destroyed the T-shirts as of 24 July. ""We apologise for the dispute. We love China and respect the sovereignty of China's territorial state,"" a translation of Versace's statement said. The label's artistic director Donatella Versace issued a similar apology. ""Never have I wanted to disrespect China's National Sovereignty and this is why I wanted to personally apologise for such inaccuracy and for any distress that it might have caused,""she said on her Instagram account,external. The incident also led to Versace's China brand ambassador Yang Mi, a popular actress in the country, cutting ties with the brand. Actress Yang Mi cut ties with Versace ""China's territorial integrity and sovereignty are sacred and inviolable at all times,"" a statement from her studio, Jiaxing Media, said. The hashtag #YangMiStopsWorkingWithVersace had 860 million views on Weibo on Monday morning Versace is the latest foreign company to have drawn ire from consumers in mainland China over sovereignty sensitivities. The issue has gained further prominence in light of months ofpro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. The company also misspelled the Belgian city of Brussels, instead printing 'Brusells' on the t-shirt. On Monday, fashion brands Coach and Givenchy also faced a backlash over garments they had produced. Coach's China ambassador Liu Wen, a model, said on China's Weibo social media website that she had ended her contract with the company over a T-shirt which listed Taiwan as a country. ""I apologize to everyone for the damage that I have caused as a result of my less-careful choice of brand!"" she said in a Weibo post that was liked hundreds of thousands of times. Coach said it corrected the error last year and apologised. Separately, Chinese boy band member Jackson Yee said he had quit as a Givenchy spokesman after pictures emerged of one of its shirts listing Hong Kong and Taiwan in a similar way. Givenchy also apologised. The background on the Hong Kong protests Last year, US retailer Gap apologised for selling T-shirts which it said showed an ""incorrect map"" of China. The design featured just the mainland and not territories that China also claims, such as Taiwan. Beijing considers self-ruling Taiwan to be a breakaway province. Several other companies including Marriottand Delta Airlines issued similar apologies in 2018 after information on their websites appeared to conflict with China's territorial claims.

"This video can not be played ""If I hadnât gone online for a day, they were quickly on the phone or sending me an email"" The number of gamblers complaining about British betting firms has risen almost 5,000% in the past five years. There were a record 8,266 complaints last year, according to Gambling Commission figures obtained by BBC Panorama. That compares to just 169 in 2013. Most of them were about firms refusing to pay out on winning bets or failing to operate in a socially responsible way. The rise follows a sharp increase in UK gambling over the past decade. The big betting firms have already promised Â£60m a year to help problem gamblers and say they are working on a plan to reduce gambling-related harm. Neil McArthur, chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said there were complex reasons for the rise in complaints. Neil McArthur says the industry must know its customers ""We are pushing the industry to know its customers, and part of this is actually, possibly, a good sign because it's suggesting that consumers are demanding more of the gambling operators.  And I would encourage them to continue to do that,"" he said. The industry has expanded rapidly since the government relaxed restrictions on betting and advertising in 2007. Rooney move raises gambling questions Ladbrokes Coral fined after customer lost Â£98,000 Gambling firms pledge Â£60m to help addicts Gamblers are now losing almost twice as much to the betting companies as they were a decade ago. Last year, punters lost a record Â£14.5bn. The biggest rise has been in online gambling, where new games and products have attracted new customers. Amanda, not her real name, doesn't want to be identified. She was in her 50s when she started betting on an online site called Jackpotjoy. She gambled away all her money from the sale of her home.  When her father died, she inherited a share of his house, and she lost that on Jackpotjoy as well. In total, Amanda lost Â£633,000. She made her last bet on the day she was made bankrupt. ""I was in a complete sort of lost bubble world,"" she said.  ""To me it was just escapism and I would just sit online and I would just be pressing the button on my computer. Jackpotjoy says it always acts in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements ""It's horrific what I've done to myself really. Everything that I had worked for.  My children looked up to me and now I have blown their inheritance."" Jackpotjoy said it always acted in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements and that it had encouraged Amanda to use responsible gambling tools. ""This included the use of deposit limits, cooling-off periods and alternative withdrawal methods; tools which Amanda was aware of and used during the time she played with us,"" the company said. High stakes betting machines have been banned from the High Street, but there are no legal limits for online games. That means customers can lose thousands of pounds in just a few minutes. Campaigners say that the government needs to do more to protect the most vulnerable gamblers. Daniel Clinkscales took his own life at the age of 35 after struggling with a gambling addiction for years. He was a well-paid sales manager, but he took on two extra jobs just to fund his betting habit. His mother, Jo Holloway, said Daniel hid his gambling for many years. She said:  ""I think he found it so hard to really come to terms with the fact that there he was - clever, intelligent, largely successful at almost everything he turned his hand to - and he'd got this one problem. Gambling."" Jo Holloway says gambling has been normalised She thinks that the burden of responsibility should be placed on the betting companies, because some gamblers simply don't know how to stop. ""Gambling has been normalised. It has been made to look like something that everybody does innocently. It's not. You can lose your house in an afternoon. How serious does it have to be before people will act?"" The Gambling Commission said it had no plans to introduce maximum stakes online because operators already have enough information to keep players safe and to ensure they are playing with money they can afford to lose. The major betting companies have already agreed to increase safer gambling messages and to review the tone of their promotional material.

The push from drug gangs to find new markets within easy commuting distance of their home cities where competition for market share may be lower than in their base is sometimes called county lines. County lines often involves the use of teenagers to ferry drugs between cities and towns, and to set up drug-dealing operations in the homes of addicts in a process known as ""cuckooing"". The National Crime Agency says more and more children and young people are being referred to the ""National Referral Mechanism"", a system designed to identify human-trafficking victims, as a result of county lines. ""The county lines model is linked to violence and relies on the exploitation of vulnerable people to make a criminal profit, with organised crime networks bringing terror to the communities they operate in,"" NCA spokesman Nikki Holland said.

It then measured how much recorded crime went up or down in each area in the five years from 2013 to 2018. However, the volume of crimes recorded can be affected by police activities and how the police focus on their different priorities. Most of the smaller areas in the data have seen falls in recorded drug crime, defined as offences involving either the possession or supply of illegal drugs, broadly in line with the national picture of reducing drug crime overall. But of the 200 areas where drug crime has increased the most since 2013, almost three quarters have a population which is lower than the average for all built-up areas. In contrast, of the 200 areas where drug crime has decreased the most, nine in 10 have an above-average population. As well as towns on the peripheries of cities seeing increases, another pattern can be seen along the south coast of England. Bournemouth and Weymouth both saw rises of at least 50%, and Swanage, Bridport, Lyme Regis, Exeter and Redruth in Cornwall all saw significant increases in drug crime.

"This video can not be played Tackling the world's single-use plastic problem About 2.2 million fewer single-use cups were used by public bodies in Wales in the last year - a drop of nearly 19%. Hospitals, emergency services, councils and government organisations have said they are trying to reduce the amount of waste produced by the cups. Eight out of the 43 bodies asked said they did not buy single-use cups in 2018-19, and seven of those have also withdrawn plastic straws and cutlery. Campaigners welcomed the fall but said 9.6 million cups ordered was too many. The details, given to BBC Wales following a Freedom of Information request, also showed a Â£71,000 fall in the amount spent on single-use cups between 2017-18 and 2018-19. Wales 'could lead' in plastics recycling Party packs help cut single-use plastic 'Plastic-free' award UK first for island Single-use plastics ban backed by Euro MPs ""Two million is a big decrease,"" said Rebecca Colley-Jones, a trustee of the Chartered Institute of Waste Management. ""It's very positive. These things don't happen overnight. You take it a step at a time."" She said single-use plastics were a convenience for most, but added: ""Perhaps what's happened over the last year or so is that people realise the consequences of it. ""Everyone will now have been getting used to a little inconvenience."" Cardiff University is one of the bodies that has gone plastic-free. A spokesman said: ""The phasing out of single-use plastics across the university is one of a number of measures that we've put in place to help build an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for our community and to bring about environmental benefits not only to Cardiff and Wales but to the wider world. ""We are extremely pleased with the progress we've made over the past year, however we are not complacent and will continue to look at ways in which we can reduce our campus footprint."" Many of the organisations that still buy single-use plastics said they were committed to making changes. Monmouthshire council said it had stopped using plastics since 2018-19, while others are investing in biodegradable cups or encouraging staff to have re-useable cups and plastics. Bettina Gilbert, programme manager at charity Wrap Cymru, said: ""It's great news that Wales' public bodies are reducing the number of single-use plastic cups they're using and tackling 'problem plastics' such as straws and plastic cutlery, to be eliminated by the end of 2020 under WRAP's UK Plastics Pact. ""But these figures show there's still work to be done.

"Wayne Rooney was unveiled at a Derby County news conference on Tuesday Wayne Rooney's move to Derby County has reopened the discussion about football's links with gambling - is it more than just an astute piece of football business? The Rams have openly said that ""on the back of"" the former England captain joining, they have secured ""a record-breaking sponsorship"" deal with their shirt sponsor, online casino 32Red. While no direct link was confirmed, Rooney's squad number at Pride Park will be 32 when hejoins Derby in January. Rooney himself said the number he wears is ""not a big deal"" when asked about the sponsorship link at a news conference on Tuesday. But Derby owner Morris was more bullish, telling BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We looked at the commercial opportunities this could create for us, and we realised this could be very smart business. ""So, in some ways, we're seeing this as an opportunity to actually create money off the back of this deal, as opposed to net spend."" Morris told in-house channel RamsTV that the deal had ""sparked keen interest with our sponsors, who want to leverage more of that"". He also cited Rooney's ""fantastic reputation"" for his charity and community work and said the player would play a ""big part"" in helping with community projects, which Morris described as a ""fundamental"" part of the club's relationship with fans. Football finance expert Dr Dan Plumley told BBC Sport that football's reliance on betting companies as sponsors is ""one of the big issues"" faced by the sport. ""There is a big moral issue with gambling at the minute,"" said Plumley. ""This is no coincidence. And it is right to be pointed out."" Plumley, a senior lecturer in sport business management at Sheffield Hallam University, added: ""The ethical issues, especially with the wider societal problems with gambling, has led to a lot of talk about it,"" he said. ""What clubs will come back and say is that this is a business and they need a sponsor for that business. ""There are a lot of providers in the gambling market and, if they are the best sponsorship package on the table, is it the club's responsibility to really turn that down? ""It is an issue that is on everyone's agenda. People want to see money put back into players and the club, and this revenue needs to be generated."" ""It's certainly unique. Already they have hashtags trending which link them [Rooney and 32Red]."" Derby move 'not just about coming home' 'You need picking up?' - How the world reacted to Rooney joining Derby Former Arsenal and England captain Tony Adams has previously saidsuch sponsorship deals should be stopped. In a statement, the Gambling Commission said ""sponsorship arrangements must be undertaken in a socially responsible manner"", with its rules adding that deals should not ""be likely to be of particular appeal to under-18s"" or ""associated with youth culture"". Derby are one of 16 clubs in England's second division whose primary sponsor is a betting firm, 15 of which are displayed on the front of their shirts. The general manager at 32Red, Neil Banbury, said the arrangement with Derby ""shows a new model for football club sponsorship is possible"". He also added that their involvement with the club includes investing in a community project that deals with mental heath in the area. This video can not be played Derby role 'too good to turn down' for Rooney With reports that Rooney will earn between Â£80,000 and Â£100,000 a week, the sponsorship tie-up was key in bringing England and Manchester United's all-time record goalscorer back to the English game. Rooney's entire wages will count towards the club's Financial Fair Play (FFP) calculations despite him moving to Pride Park as a player-coach, as there is no 50% split on wages for such dual roles at that level - unlike in League One and League Two. Plumley said Rooney's wages would make the former Everton forward one of the biggest earners to ever play in the second tier. ""That would be very crazy money in the Championship if true,"" he said. ""You are also looking at one of the most talented players of a generation, a true legend of English football, and Derby have managed to get him in the Championship. ""It's one of the biggest moves at that level. You can argue that this is a bit of a masterstroke."" Derby selling their Pride Park stadium home to owner Morris for Â£80m has also helped make the deal for Rooney possible. The sale and lease back of the ground meant the club reported a pre-tax profit of Â£14.6m for the 2017-18 season, ensuring the club met the English Football League spending rules. In the past week, they have gone on to break their transfer record onmidfielder Krystian Bielik for about Â£10mand recruit Rooney - a five-time Premier League champion, who also collected Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, Europa League and Club World Cup winner's medals with Manchester United. ""That stadium sale brought them a room with FFP,"" said Plumley. ""To go from being really under the cosh, to selling the stadium, to breaking your transfer record and then having Wayne Rooney come in from January is a remarkable turnaround."" While selling a stadium is ""a one-time fix"", having Rooney at Derby's disposal as they chase promotion to the Premier League is a""roll of the dice"" worth more than Â£170m. ""You get to the Premier League and your financial troubles almost disappear overnight,"" said Plumley. ""This is a gamble in that respect. Obviously Derby are looking at Wayne Rooney on the pitch first and foremost and this is absolutely about another tilt at promotion.""

"The shipyard in Port Glasgow is expected to be in administration by the end of the week The Scottish government is ""ready and willing"" to take Ferguson shipyard into public ownership, Economy Secretary Derek Mackay has announced. He said this was to avert the yard's closure with the loss of 350 jobs, and to complete two ferries being built there for Cal Mac west coast services. The move followslegal notice being servedthat the business faces administration by the end of this week. Mr Mackay said the government remained open to other investors. But in a statement, he added that it was essential to act without delay, to secure the yard, its workforce and the unfinished ships. A letter has been sent to Ferguson Marine, and its sole shareholder, industrialist Jim McColl, saying the Scottish government is hopeful that directors and creditors ""recognise the importance of completing that transfer as quickly and smoothly as possible"". Shipyard boss and government clash over rescue plan Ferguson set for administration The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Shipshape: when the state steps in On SundayMr McColl was strongly critical of the move towards public ownership, saying it made no economic sense. However, on Friday, Ferguson's chief executive, Gerry Marshall, said directors would support Mr McColl and the Scottish government in trying to reach a positive outcome for the business and its employees. Since then 60 workers have stopped working there, due to the withdrawal of contract agencies, in a bid to protect their financial position. That has taken the workforce below 300. Mr Mackay said:  ""The Scottish government has been working for over two years to find a resolution to the difficulties at Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd. ""Throughout that time, our preference has been to identify viable commercial options to keep the yard going and to finish the vessels. No such solutions have come forward. ""The Scottish government has now indicated to all relevant parties that we are ready and willing to take Ferguson Marine into public ownership and deliver the ferries to secure the continued employment of the workforce in the yard."" An order for CalMac ferries has been at the centre of a very public dispute He added: ""There remains a process to go through to secure the transfer of the yard to the Scottish government, and we are hopeful that all parties recognise the importance of completing that transfer as quickly and as smoothly as possible. ""While we are open to engaging with any parties with a serious interest in investing in and securing a future for the shipyard, it is essential the government acts now to secure the completion of the ferries and continuity of employment at Ferguson's."" Mr Mackay told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmethe government was unwilling to ""hand over a cheque"" to complete the ferries because it would be ""illegal"" and would flout state aid rules. Under European Union rules it is illegal for countries to give financial help to some companies in a way that would give them unfair advantage over others. Mr Mackay said: ""The Â£97m has already been spent on vessels that are not complete. Once we conduct due diligence and if we're in public ownership we'll have sight as to what is required to complete those vessels. ""The alternative is for the government to walk away, the company goes into administration, the jobs are lost, the vessels are not complete."" The government's takeover of the yard follows Mr McColl's rescue of the yard from administration five years ago. The shipyard's main contract since then has been for two ferries, due to serve Arran and the Outer Hebrides. To support it, the Scottish government loaned it Â£45m, in two tranches. That gives it priority over other creditors in taking control of the yard - except for the issuer of a Â£25m bond, which Ferguson required to secure the Cal Mac ferries contract. The fixed price contract was for Â£97m. However, Ferguson now estimates the cost has risen to double that, and the ships are behind schedule. That is being blamed on numerous changes to the design, many of them linked to an innovative dual-fuel engine, using both diesel and liquefied natural gas. Unwilling to fund the difference from his investment firm, Clyde Blowers Capital, Mr McColl sought a deal to share the overrun costs with the Scottish government, but that was rejected. General secretary of the GMB Union in Scotland Gary Smith told BBC Scotland the yard did have a future. ""There has been a problem with two contracts but the truth is we are going to have to renew the fleet of CalMac ferries because frankly they're clapped out,"" he said. ""We know there are other commercial opportunities out there and we know that Ferguson's is at the cutting edge of hydrogen technology and above all, the greatest asset at the yard that we've got is the workforce. ""It's got a huge future, this company is not a basket case by any stretch of the imagination.""

"More than 600 people were arrested in raids targeting ""county lines"" Children as young as 11 are being exploited by gangs running ""county lines"" drug networks, MPs have heard. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said there had been a rapid rise of ""county lines"", where city-based gangs exploit people to sell drugs in smaller towns. It told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that more than 2,000 phone lines are being operated by gangs across the UK - up from 720 a year ago. Twenty-three police force areas were now involved, the NCA said. Most of the vulnerable people exploited were children aged 15-17. ""County lines"" is a tactic whereby gangs in places such as London, Liverpool and Birmingham introduce untraceable phones to a different area to sell drugs at street level. Local runners - often teenagers - are used to transport the drugs. Teen orphan forced to be heroin dealer Drugs violence 'at unprecedented level' Victim's 'terrifying' cuckooing ordeal Nikki Holland, director of investigations at the NCA, told MPs that the latest assessment showed law enforcement agencies had ""greater awareness"" of the problem. But she warned that the issue had spread from London, the West Midlands and Merseyside to involve more than half of the UK's police force areas. In an annual report on the issue, the NCA said that data from last year showed that victims were younger than previously identified, with ages ranging between 11 and 56. This video can not be played What is County Lines? Gangs establish contact and build relationships before the exploitation takes place, so some may have been approached at an even younger age, the NCA said. They targeted children with backgrounds of poverty, family breakdown, exclusion from school or behavioural and developmental disorders, the agency said, but children of ""seemingly stable backgrounds"" were also exploited. Profits of more than Â£800,000 can be generated from an individual phone number, known as a ""deal line"", according to the NCA. Mass marketing text messages are used to advertise drugs along with two-for-one deals and free samples offered in exchange for the contact details of potential customers, the report said. The NCA also identified an ""emerging trend"" of using app-based taxi services to transport gang members and potential victims of exploitation. After a week of raids, police said that 600 people have been arrested and over 140 weapons seized, including 12 firearms, swords, machetes, axes and knives. Police referred 40 people as potential victims of human trafficking or modern slavery and discovered 400 vulnerable adults and 600 children in need of support. In a statement, Ms Holland said: ""We know that criminal networks use high levels of violence, exploitation and abuse to ensure compliance from the vulnerable people they employ to do the day-to-day drug supply activity."" She said law enforcement agencies aimed ""disrupt their activity and take away their assets"" to block the cash flow of organised crime groups. Children aged between 15 and 17 were the majority of those exploited in county lines, with both boys and girls involved, the NCA said. It said the ""grooming techniques"" were similar to ""child sexual exploitation and abuse"", with gifts and attention as well as threats of violence.

"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""Stop-and-search works."" An extra 10,000 new prison places will be created and stop-and-search powers expanded, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised. The first new prison in the Â£2.5bn programme will be at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire, whereexpansion plans have previously been announced. The government said the plans showed it was ""serious about fighting crime"". But Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said ""random"" stop-and-search was a ""recipe for unrest"". The government's focus on law and order will add to speculation that No 10 is preparing for an autumn general election, said BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. But Mr Johnson has previouslyruled out an election before October 31. Reality Check: Have police numbers dropped? Does stop and search reduce crime? The prison and policing plans for England and Wales follow other recent initiatives from Downing Street about the NHS and immigration. Last month, the government alsopledged to recruit20,000 extra police officers, nearly replacing the number of officers lost since the Conservatives returned to power. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""We know the greatest deterrent to crime is the perception of the likelihood of getting caught. Prevention is really what we're after."" But on the same programme, Lord Heseltine accused the government of ""economic irresponsibility"", saying it was ""trashing money around the place like there is no tomorrow, aimed very specifically at very clear electoral targets"". The 10,000 new prison places are expected to be created by building new jails and expanding existing ones, at a cost of up to Â£2.5bn. The first new prison will be built alongside the maximum security jail at HMP Full Sutton, the Ministry of Justice said. But plans already announced there have drawn objections from police, who said it would increase violent crime in the jail. Previously decommissioned prison venues will also be refurbished and brought back into use, the government said. Mr Johnson wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat the investment was ""long overdue"". He also argued that too many serious violent or sexual offenders are coming out of prison long before they should, and tougher sentences were needed. ""We need to come down hard on crime,"" he wrote. ""That means coming down hard on criminals. We need to reverse the balance of fear. ""I want the criminals to be afraid - not the public."" In 2016, former justice secretary Liz Truss unveiled a white paper promising a Â£1.3bn investment in prisons, addingan extra 10,000 places by 2020- later pushed back to 2022. The Ministry of Justice said it was on course to create 3,360 places at two new prisons by 2023. Government sources said the Â£2.5bn funding would allow it to deliver 10,000 places on top of that, including projects already at a planning stage such as HMP Full Sutton. But a spokesman for the Prison Reform Trust said the suggestion that all 10,000 places were new was ""misleading"" given earlier announcements. The trust said prisons needed 12,000 more places just to eliminate overcrowding and accommodate new prisoners who have already been sentenced. ""We know the aggressive rhetoric of 'prison works' invariably drives up the use of imprisonment long before the capacity to deal with that has been created,"" said Peter Dawson, the trust's director. ""Tough rhetoric is no substitute for understanding the evidence."" A pilot scheme making it easier for police to search people without reasonable suspicion, in places where serious violence may occur, is being extended to all 43 forces across England and Wales. In March, when he was home secretary, Sajid Javidfirst introduced the scheme in seven police force areas: London, the West Midlands, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Greater Manchester. The latest move will see restrictions over using section 60 stop-and-search lifted more widely, giving officers across England and Wales a limited time period to search anyone in a designated area in order to prevent violent crime. Inspectors will now be able to use section 60 without seeking the authorisation of a senior officer and there will be a lower threshold for its use, with police only needing to reasonably believe that violence ""may"" occur, not that it will. Police given more stop and search powers The key facts about rising knife crime The Home Office and Number 10 said their decision to extend stop-and-search was based on ""initial feedback"" from the three-month trial in seven areas. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Stop-and-search works. We hear again and again from police that [they] need to be empowered."" She said powers needed to be used in the ""right, legal and professional way"" but their use was supported by families of victims of knife crime, from ""communities that have suffered so much trauma and pain"". The announcement comes days aftera police officer was stabbed in the headwith a machete in east London. Stop-and-search powers have been controversial for many years, with evidence that they are sometimes misused and that they disproportionately target black people. In 2017-18, black people were9.5 times more likely to be searched,externalthan white people, a gap which has grown in recent years. Jonathan Hinds, who campaigns against its misuse, told BBC Radio 5 Live he had been stopped three times within a mile by three different police officers. He warned black people faced being ""targeted by these draconian powers"". London was one of seven areas where the stop-and-search pilot scheme was initially trialled Elena Noel, co-chair of Southwark's anti-knife crime forum, said action was needed to halt the ""crisis"" but ""independent data does not show that stop-and-search stops knife crime and violence"". Astudy of stop-and-search over a decade in London,externalby the College of Policing found it to be ""inconsistent"" and ""weak"" as a deterrent. Labour accused the Conservatives of trying to ""appear tough"" instead of dealing with the root causes of crime. Ms Abbott said evidence-based stop-and-search was an important tool, but ""random stops have only poisoned police community relations"" and were a ""tried and tested recipe for unrest"". The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman Ed Davey accused Mr Johnson of repeating the ""failed policies of the past"" and said extending stop-and-search disproportionately affected black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Talking tough on crime will always grab headlines for governments and that's exactly what Boris Johnson's done. These announcements may address public concern about violent crime and follow the priorities Mr Johnson set for his government on day one. But they are also the type of promises the prime minister would like to point to during an election campaign. And the announcements, coming in such quick succession from the government, add to the sense that it is preparing to go to the polls. Whether the prime minister is forced into it through a vote of no confidence, or chooses to call for one himself, there is an increasing sense that an election isn't far away - either before or after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. Promising to do something is one thing, but paying for it and delivering it is another - and with these policy announcements comes an increasing bill for the Treasury to foot. Tax rises or extra borrowing are a much harder sell for MPs campaigning on the doorstep, so we might have to wait some time to find out exactly where the money's coming from. The Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents police officers, said it welcomed forces across the country being given the same tools to tackle knife crime. John Apter, the federation's national chairman, said: ""We can't have a postcode lottery on keeping the public safe."" ""We are in the grip of a wave of violent crime on a scale we've not seen before, with young people being killed or stabbed on our streets, and we have to do something about it,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. This video can not be played Youth mentor Dijon Joseph and Ch Supt Simon Messinger discuss stop and search He acknowledged concerns about stop-and-search and said police officers would be as professional as possible, with many wearing body cameras. But he said they also had to respond to people who could be ""incredibly hostile, aggressive and violent"". Have police numbers dropped?

"Cathay Pacific has warned staff they could be fired if they ""support or participate in illegal protests"" in Hong Kong, as pressure from Beijing intensifies. The warning was emailed to staff by chief executive Rupert Hogg on Monday. On Friday, China ordered the airline to suspend workers who support pro-democracy protests in the territory. Cathay fired two employees and suspended one pilot over the weekend in response to the order. Also on Monday,Hong Kong International Airport cancelled more than 100 departing flights, as anti-government protests in its main terminal continued for a fourth day. Cathay Pacific is now subject to new regulations announced last week by Beijing's aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which came into effect on Sunday. These require it to submit lists of staff working on flights going to the mainland or through its airspace. Any staff member accused of involvement in ""illegal protests"" is banned from working on those flights. Authorities have warned planes could be prevented from landing if they do not comply. The regulator has also demanded a report from Cathay by 15 August on planned measures to ""strengthen internal control and improve flight safety and security"". In his email to staff, seen by the BBC, Mr Hogg wrote: ""Cathay Pacific Group's operations in mainland China are key to our business. ""We are therefore legally required to follow CAAC regulations and, as is the case with any notices issued by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over us, we must and will comply."" Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flagship carrier, has found itself in a difficult position over the long-running pro-democracy demonstrations in the territory, which have angered Beijing. How weeks of protests have hit Hong Kong tourism The background you need on the Hong Kong protests The email from Mr Hoggfollowed more violent clashes in Hong Kong on Sunday. ""Cathay Pacific Group has a zero-tolerance approach to illegal activities. Specifically, in the current context, there will be disciplinary consequences for employees who support or participate in illegal protests,"" Mr Hogg wrote. ""These consequences could be serious and may include termination of employment."" Shares in the Hong-Kong based airline fell more than 4% on Monday. The statement represents an about-face for Cathay Pacific, which said last week that it would not stop staff joining demonstrations. However, the airline has come under increasing pressure to change its stance, both from the Chinese government and from a wider backlash on the mainland. Fuelled by China's state-run press, a boycott campaign on social media using the hashtag #BoycottCathayPacific has attracted more than 17 million views. Cathay Pacific cabin crew have also taken to social media to communicate with each other about the authorities' crackdown, using closed WhatsApp and Facebook groups to share information. One message seen by the BBC said crews flying into China were now liable to have their phones checked and data read by ""safety officers"" and advised crew members to leave their usual devices at home. Protests have been running for days at Hong Kong's main airport Last week, the airline said it had seen a fall in bookings for travel to Hong Kong ""in the realm of double digits"" amid signs that the anti-government protests were discouraging people from travelling to the territory. Protests in Hong Kong began about nine weeks ago over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms. Hong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland. It has a free press and judicial independence under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" approach - freedoms that activists fear are being increasingly eroded. Cathay Pacific suspended a pilot who has been accused of rioting after allegedly participating in the Hong Kong protests, following a directive from China's aviation regulator last week. In a statement, Cathay Pacific said it ""wishes to make it clear that we express no view whatsoever on the subject matter of any proceedings to which he may be subject"". It also terminated two airport ground staff for ""misconduct"". No further details were given.

"The government is considering giving powers to fine video-sharing apps and websites to the UK's media regulator. The proposal would see Ofcom able to impose multi-million pound fines if it judges the platforms have failed to prevent youngsters seeing pornography, violence and other harmful material. The regulator would take charge of the matter from 19 September 2020. The move is designed to meet the UK's obligations to the EU but may not be required if Brexit occurs in October. Even then, it would only be an interim measure until a separate online harms regulator was appointed at a later date. ""The implementation of the AVMSD [Audiovisual Media Services Directive] is required as part of the United Kingdom's obligations arising from its membership of the European Union and until the UK formally leaves the European Union all of its obligations remain in force,"" said a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. ""If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, we will not be bound to transpose the AVMSD into UK law."" The Telegraph newspaper was first to report the scheme,external. It said that the proposal was ""quietly"" agreed before Parliament's summer break and would give Ofcom the power to fine tech firms up to 5% of their revenues and/or block them in the UK if they failed to comply with its rulings. The watchdog has said that it is ready to adopt the powers. ""These new rules are an important first step in regulating video-sharing online, and we'll work closely with the government to implement them,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We also support plans to go further and legislate for a wider set of protections, including a duty of care for online companies towards their users."" Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat have not commented. YouTube: 'We don't take you down the rabbit hole' Instagram vows to remove all graphic self-harm images from site Self-harm, suicide and social media But TechUK - the industry group that represents the sector - said it hoped that ministers would take a ""balanced and proportionate approach"" to the issue. ""Key to achieving this will be clear and precise definitions across the board, and a proportionate sanctions and compliance regime,"" said its deputy chief executive Antony Walker. The Internet Association added that it hoped any intervention would be proportionate. ""Any new regulation should be targeted at specific harms, and be technically possible to implement in practice - taking into account that resources available vary between companies,"" said Daniel Dyball, the association's executive director. Child safety charity NSPCC has welcomed the announcement. ""The immediacy of livestreaming can make children more vulnerable to being coerced by abusers, who may capture the footage, share it and use it as blackmail,"" commented Andy Burrows, head of the organisation's child safety online policy. ""The directive gives the UK a chance to introduce tough measures on tech firms that have their European headquarters here. ""Crucially, this is a real chance to bring in legislative protections ahead of the forthcoming Online Harms Bill and to finally hold sites to account if they put children at risk.""

"The number of empty shops in town centres is at its highest for four years, industry figures show. The vacancy rate was 10.3% in July, its highest level since January 2015, according to the British Retail Consortium and Springboard survey. Footfall also fell by 1.9% in July, the worst July performance for seven years. Diane Wehrle, Springboard insights director, said July had been ""much more challenging"" for shopping centres and High Streets than out of town stores. The survey showed that High Street footfall declined by 2.7% in July, and shopping centre footfall declined by 3.1%. In contrast, footfall in retail parks increased by 1.2%. Ms Wehrle added: ""Consumer demand is ever-more polarised between convenience and experience, and the stronger performance of out of town destinations where footfall rose by 1.2% in July reflects the fact that retail parks are successfully bridging the convenience-experience gap. ""They not only offer consumers accessible shopping environments with free parking and easy click and collect opportunities for online purchases, but many also combine this with an enhanced experience that includes coffee shops and casual dining restaurants, and some also have leisure facilities.""

"Luxury brand Versace has apologised after an image on one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories. After fierce criticism on social media in China, Versace said it had made a mistake and had stopped selling the tops. It said it ""respects the sovereignty of China's territorial state"". Fashion brands Givenchy and Coach are also facing a backlash for not adhering to China's territorial claims. The Versace T-shirts, images of which were shared on social media, featured city-country pairs such as Milan-Italy and London-UK. These also included Hong Kong-Hong Kong and Macau-Macau.

China has been increasingly strict in policing how foreign firms describe Hong Kong, which is part of China but has a special status, offering its people more autonomy than those on the mainland. Macau is aspecial administrative region of China. In a post on Weibo, the Italian fashion label said it had stopped selling and had destroyed the T-shirts as of 24 July. ""We apologise for the dispute. We love China and respect the sovereignty of China's territorial state,"" a translation of Versace's statement said. The label's artistic director Donatella Versace issued a similar apology. ""Never have I wanted to disrespect China's National Sovereignty and this is why I wanted to personally apologise for such inaccuracy and for any distress that it might have caused,""she said on her Instagram account,external. The incident also led to Versace's China brand ambassador Yang Mi, a popular actress in the country, cutting ties with the brand. Actress Yang Mi cut ties with Versace ""China's territorial integrity and sovereignty are sacred and inviolable at all times,"" a statement from her studio, Jiaxing Media, said. The hashtag #YangMiStopsWorkingWithVersace had 860 million views on Weibo on Monday morning Versace is the latest foreign company to have drawn ire from consumers in mainland China over sovereignty sensitivities. The issue has gained further prominence in light of months ofpro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. The company also misspelled the Belgian city of Brussels, instead printing 'Brusells' on the t-shirt. On Monday, fashion brands Coach and Givenchy also faced a backlash over garments they had produced. Coach's China ambassador Liu Wen, a model, said on China's Weibo social media website that she had ended her contract with the company over a T-shirt which listed Taiwan as a country. ""I apologize to everyone for the damage that I have caused as a result of my less-careful choice of brand!"" she said in a Weibo post that was liked hundreds of thousands of times. Coach said it corrected the error last year and apologised. Separately, Chinese boy band member Jackson Yee said he had quit as a Givenchy spokesman after pictures emerged of one of its shirts listing Hong Kong and Taiwan in a similar way. Givenchy also apologised. The background on the Hong Kong protests Last year, US retailer Gap apologised for selling T-shirts which it said showed an ""incorrect map"" of China. The design featured just the mainland and not territories that China also claims, such as Taiwan. Beijing considers self-ruling Taiwan to be a breakaway province. Several other companies including Marriottand Delta Airlines issued similar apologies in 2018 after information on their websites appeared to conflict with China's territorial claims.

The Scottish government responded that Mr McColl's own rescue plan ""had a number of serious risks"". The Port Glasgow site, which employs about 350 staff, isdue to enter administration. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said taking the beleaguered yard into public ownership was an option. Ferguson set for administration The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Shipshape: when the state steps in It comes amid a very public row between Mr McColl and the Scottish government over a contract to build two ferries. The Â£97m deal for CalMac is behind schedule and considerably over budget. An order for CalMac ferries have been at the centre of a very public dispute Ferguson has said it expects to lose nearly Â£40m on the ferry deal, which is being procured through the public-sector agency CMAL. The Scottish government said Mr McColl's proposal to salvage the contract would not have put any of his firm's money into the yard. A government spokesman said: ""It offered no certainty on the overall final cost of both vessels and saw no money from Clyde Blowers Capital themselves being invested."" The spokesman added the proposal - understood to have involved the Scottish government taking an equity stake in the business - could have been unlawful. The public fall-out is between ministers and a businessman who was close to the SNP administration. Mr McColl is reputed to be a billionaire, and is one of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's council of economic advisers. Five years ago, he helped the government politically, with a deal to take the Ferguson shipyard out of administration, averting closure in the days before the independence referendum. On Friday Mr McColl, along with fellow directors of Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, served notice of intent to put the company into administration by next Friday. The Â£97m fixed price contract for the two CalMac ferries is understood to have doubled in cost, at least partly due to the complexity of designing and installing an innovative hybrid, dual-fuel engine. The Scottish government has been working over the weekend on its response to the administration warning. A letter was to be sent by Monday morning setting out how ministers intended to proceed. Talks are expected from Monday between lawyers and advisers and a solution is expected by midweek. Last night, the Scottish government repeated its pledge to safeguard jobs for the 350 people who work at the Inverclyde yard, and to complete the ships. It said that it had been working on the basis of no additional funding going into the business from Ferguson or Jim McColl's investment firm Clyde Blowers Capital. A spokesman said: ""We have been actively considering other options, including public ownership and remain keen to reach a conclusion on this matter. ""We also remain open to considering viable alternative options and will continue to work with all partners to reach a constructive solution that can deliver both the vessels and safeguard jobs for those who work in the yard.""

"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""Stop-and-search works."" An extra 10,000 new prison places will be created and stop-and-search powers expanded, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised. The first new prison in the Â£2.5bn programme will be at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire, whereexpansion plans have previously been announced. The government said the plans showed it was ""serious about fighting crime"". But Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said ""random"" stop-and-search was a ""recipe for unrest"". The government's focus on law and order will add to speculation that No 10 is preparing for an autumn general election, said BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. But Mr Johnson has previouslyruled out an election before October 31. Reality Check: Have police numbers dropped? Does stop and search reduce crime? The prison and policing plans for England and Wales follow other recent initiatives from Downing Street about the NHS and immigration. Last month, the government alsopledged to recruit20,000 extra police officers, nearly replacing the number of officers lost since the Conservatives returned to power. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""We know the greatest deterrent to crime is the perception of the likelihood of getting caught. Prevention is really what we're after."" But on the same programme, Lord Heseltine accused the government of ""economic irresponsibility"", saying it was ""trashing money around the place like there is no tomorrow, aimed very specifically at very clear electoral targets"". The 10,000 new prison places are expected to be created by building new jails and expanding existing ones, at a cost of up to Â£2.5bn. The first new prison will be built alongside the maximum security jail at HMP Full Sutton, the Ministry of Justice said. But plans already announced there have drawn objections from police, who said it would increase violent crime in the jail. Previously decommissioned prison venues will also be refurbished and brought back into use, the government said. Mr Johnson wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat the investment was ""long overdue"". He also argued that too many serious violent or sexual offenders are coming out of prison long before they should, and tougher sentences were needed. ""We need to come down hard on crime,"" he wrote. ""That means coming down hard on criminals. We need to reverse the balance of fear. ""I want the criminals to be afraid - not the public."" In 2016, former justice secretary Liz Truss unveiled a white paper promising a Â£1.3bn investment in prisons, addingan extra 10,000 places by 2020- later pushed back to 2022. The Ministry of Justice said it was on course to create 3,360 places at two new prisons by 2023. Government sources said the Â£2.5bn funding would allow it to deliver 10,000 places on top of that, including projects already at a planning stage such as HMP Full Sutton. But a spokesman for the Prison Reform Trust said the suggestion that all 10,000 places were new was ""misleading"" given earlier announcements. The trust said prisons needed 12,000 more places just to eliminate overcrowding and accommodate new prisoners who have already been sentenced. ""We know the aggressive rhetoric of 'prison works' invariably drives up the use of imprisonment long before the capacity to deal with that has been created,"" said Peter Dawson, the trust's director. ""Tough rhetoric is no substitute for understanding the evidence."" A pilot scheme making it easier for police to search people without reasonable suspicion, in places where serious violence may occur, is being extended to all 43 forces across England and Wales. In March, when he was home secretary, Sajid Javidfirst introduced the scheme in seven police force areas: London, the West Midlands, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Greater Manchester. The latest move will see restrictions over using section 60 stop-and-search lifted more widely, giving officers across England and Wales a limited time period to search anyone in a designated area in order to prevent violent crime. Inspectors will now be able to use section 60 without seeking the authorisation of a senior officer and there will be a lower threshold for its use, with police only needing to reasonably believe that violence ""may"" occur, not that it will. Police given more stop and search powers The key facts about rising knife crime The Home Office and Number 10 said their decision to extend stop-and-search was based on ""initial feedback"" from the three-month trial in seven areas. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Stop-and-search works. We hear again and again from police that [they] need to be empowered."" She said powers needed to be used in the ""right, legal and professional way"" but their use was supported by families of victims of knife crime, from ""communities that have suffered so much trauma and pain"". The announcement comes days aftera police officer was stabbed in the headwith a machete in east London. Stop-and-search powers have been controversial for many years, with evidence that they are sometimes misused and that they disproportionately target black people. In 2017-18, black people were9.5 times more likely to be searched,externalthan white people, a gap which has grown in recent years. Jonathan Hinds, who campaigns against its misuse, told BBC Radio 5 Live he had been stopped three times within a mile by three different police officers. He warned black people faced being ""targeted by these draconian powers"". London was one of seven areas where the stop-and-search pilot scheme was initially trialled Elena Noel, co-chair of Southwark's anti-knife crime forum, said action was needed to halt the ""crisis"" but ""independent data does not show that stop-and-search stops knife crime and violence"". Astudy of stop-and-search over a decade in London,externalby the College of Policing found it to be ""inconsistent"" and ""weak"" as a deterrent. Labour accused the Conservatives of trying to ""appear tough"" instead of dealing with the root causes of crime. Ms Abbott said evidence-based stop-and-search was an important tool, but ""random stops have only poisoned police community relations"" and were a ""tried and tested recipe for unrest"". The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman Ed Davey accused Mr Johnson of repeating the ""failed policies of the past"" and said extending stop-and-search disproportionately affected black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Talking tough on crime will always grab headlines for governments and that's exactly what Boris Johnson's done. These announcements may address public concern about violent crime and follow the priorities Mr Johnson set for his government on day one. But they are also the type of promises the prime minister would like to point to during an election campaign. And the announcements, coming in such quick succession from the government, add to the sense that it is preparing to go to the polls. Whether the prime minister is forced into it through a vote of no confidence, or chooses to call for one himself, there is an increasing sense that an election isn't far away - either before or after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. Promising to do something is one thing, but paying for it and delivering it is another - and with these policy announcements comes an increasing bill for the Treasury to foot. Tax rises or extra borrowing are a much harder sell for MPs campaigning on the doorstep, so we might have to wait some time to find out exactly where the money's coming from. The Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents police officers, said it welcomed forces across the country being given the same tools to tackle knife crime. John Apter, the federation's national chairman, said: ""We can't have a postcode lottery on keeping the public safe."" ""We are in the grip of a wave of violent crime on a scale we've not seen before, with young people being killed or stabbed on our streets, and we have to do something about it,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. This video can not be played Youth mentor Dijon Joseph and Ch Supt Simon Messinger discuss stop and search He acknowledged concerns about stop-and-search and said police officers would be as professional as possible, with many wearing body cameras. But he said they also had to respond to people who could be ""incredibly hostile, aggressive and violent"". Have police numbers dropped?

"The number of empty shops in town centres is at its highest for four years, industry figures show. The vacancy rate was 10.3% in July, its highest level since January 2015, according to the British Retail Consortium and Springboard survey. Footfall also fell by 1.9% in July, the worst July performance for seven years. Diane Wehrle, Springboard insights director, said July had been ""much more challenging"" for shopping centres and High Streets than out of town stores. The survey showed that High Street footfall declined by 2.7% in July, and shopping centre footfall declined by 3.1%. In contrast, footfall in retail parks increased by 1.2%. Ms Wehrle added: ""Consumer demand is ever-more polarised between convenience and experience, and the stronger performance of out of town destinations where footfall rose by 1.2% in July reflects the fact that retail parks are successfully bridging the convenience-experience gap. ""They not only offer consumers accessible shopping environments with free parking and easy click and collect opportunities for online purchases, but many also combine this with an enhanced experience that includes coffee shops and casual dining restaurants, and some also have leisure facilities."" Chris Vallance, BBC's The World At One Stockton-on-Tees has invested in its town centre, but still shops keep closing In a shopping arcade in Stockton-on-Tees, the loudspeakers are playing Empire State of Mind. ""Bright lights will inspire you,"" goes the chorus, but the canned music isn't inspiring all the shoppers. ""It's getting like a ghost town really,"" one says. ""They've made it nice, the area, but the shops are going one by one."" In 2018, data from the Centre for Retail Research found more than 2,500 mostly medium or large retail businesses failed, and the organisation's Joshua Bamfield now expects 2019 to be worse. Stockton-On-Tees has also faced losses. ""Marks & Spencer, they closed and now Debenhams is going to close,"" Labour's Nigel Cooke, the borough council cabinet member for regeneration and housing, told Radio 4's World At One. Stockton's response to High Street closures has been to try to ""reinvent"" the High Street. Read more from Chris here The BRC said there was concern about the rise in empty store fronts. ""If the government wishes to avoid seeing more empty shops in our town centres then they must act to relieve some of the pressure bearing down on the High Street,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. ""Currently, retail accounts for 5% of the economy, yet pays 10% of all business costs and 25% of all business taxes. The rising vacancy figures show this is simply not sustainable. ""We need an immediate freeze in rates, as well as fixing the transitional relief, which leads to corner shops in Redcar subsidising banks in central London.""
