"Middlesbrough's Gaston Ramirez was shown a yellow card for simulation at Bournemouth - before picking up a second and being sent off Players who dive in English football will face bans from next season under new Football Association regulations. Under the new rules, passed by the governing body at its annual general meeting on Thursday, a panel will review footage each Monday looking for cases of simulation. Any player unanimously found guilty of diving would be given a suspension. The FA also announced it has passed reforms it proposed in March, followingcriticism over the way it is run. The FA defines the new offence for which players will be punished as ""successful deception of a match official"". Only incidents that result in a player winning a penalty or lead to an opponent being sent off - through either a direct red card or two yellow cards - will be punished. The FA says it will act ""where there is clear and overwhelming evidence to suggest a match official has been deceived by an act of simulation, and as a direct result, the offending player's team has been awarded a penalty and/or an opposing player has been dismissed"". Its panel will consist of one former match official, one ex-manager and one ex-player. The announcement follows what the FA said was ""a period of consultation with stakeholders over the past few months"". The rule change also required approval from the Premier League, the EFL and the Professional Footballers' Association. Speaking in December, Burnley manager Sean Dyche said he thought diving would be eradicated from football""in six months""if retrospective bans were introduced. Such bans have been utilised in Scottish football since 2011. This video can not be played 'Utter rubbish' - Allardyce on new diving ban BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson: The Scottish Football Association compliance officer - Tony McGlennan - reviews incidents in matches and determines whether or not notices of complaint should be raised. If a player is deemed to have dived during a game and the match officials did not recognise that at the time, the player will be issued with a disciplinary notice. The player can then either acknowledge guilt and accept the punishment offered by the compliance officer, or appeal. If it is the latter, a hearing is convened with an independent three-man panel - including people from legal and football backgrounds - who consider the case made by the compliance officer and the player before making a ruling. This video can not be played How Scottish football has punished divers In December, five former FA bosses asked the government to intervene and change an organisation they described as being held back by""elderly white men"". Sports Minister Tracey Crouch had said the FA could lose Â£30m-Â£40m of public funding if it did not modernise. In March, the FA announced proposed reforms to: Establish three positions on the FA board reserved for female members by 2018; Reduce the size of the board to 10 members; Add 11 new members to the FA Council so it ""better reflects the inclusive and diverse nature of English football""; Limit board membership to three periods of three years; Introduce term limits for FA Council membership. These were passed after a vote by shareholders at Thursday's annual general meeting, having already been approved by the FA Council in April. ""I'm absolutely delighted the FA has understood the importance of good governance and implemented these reforms,"" Crouch said. The proposals were criticised for not going far enough when first announced in March. Lord Herman Ouseley, the chairman of anti-racism group Kick It Out, said he had ""no confidence in the FA's proposals"" and described the reforms as a ""sham"". He added certain minority groups would continue to be under-represented, and that ""by prioritising women on boards, all other protected groups are being left behind"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Given the FA's traditional resistance to change, this will come as a huge relief to many in the game, and be seen as a major victory for chairman Greg Clarke, who has succeeded where others before him had failed. It means the FA avoids the funding cut it had been threatened with by the government. Some critics believe the game's deficiencies are cultural - rather than structural - and these changes on their own will do little to address under-representation of minorities, inequality of wealth and power, standards of grassroots facilities and youth coaching, and a failing England team. But the hope will be that decision-making is improved, and that administrators - knowing they now only have a certain amount of time in post - are more likely to make a difference, and act in the interests of the whole of football.

"This video can not be played New Nottingham Forest owner denies match-fixing Nottingham Forest have been bought by Greek shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis after his takeover was passed by the English Football League (EFL). The businessman and Olympiakos owner is facing accusations of match-fixing in Greece but has passed the EFL's owners' and directors' test. Marinakis' buyout brings to an end Fawaz Al Hasawi's five-year reign in charge of the Championship club. A previous takeover by a United States consortium fell through in January. In an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, Marinakis said that allegations he is involved in a ""criminal organisation"" were invented by ""jealous"" opponents to ""destroy"" his success with the Greek champions. He was previously accused of being involved in the bombing of a referee's bakery but faced no action. Marinakis, who is heading a consortium with Greek businessman Socrates Kominakis, denies all the claims and has not faced any charges. He is waiting to find out whether a remaining case against him will proceed, but says: ""I have nothing to be afraid of and to worry about as I have done nothing wrong."" The EFL has approved the deal after reviewing the business plan and applying the owners' and directors' test. It saw no reason to disqualify the prospective owners under the test. The EFL also asked Uefa for its views on Marinakis' ownership of Olympiakos and received a positive response. Two-time European Cup winners Forest only escaped relegation to England's third tier on goal difference witha win on the final day of the season. Marinakis has also ""guaranteed"" manager Mark Warburton, who was appointed in March, will be with the club ""for a number of years"". In an interview with BBC correspondent Richard Conway, Marinakis spelt out his vision for Nottingham Forest. He says he will: Return ""stability"" to a club with ""huge potential"" which ""belongs to the elite of the Premier League"" Not make rash pledges, saying: ""I never give promises - I deliver"" Back Mark Warburton and says he will work within EFL financial rules to support him in the transfer market Formulate a 'fans advisory body' and 'youth council' with a representative attending board meetings Reduce ticket prices to reward fan loyalty Olympiakos won the Greek Superleague by six points in 2016-17 and also reached the last 16 of the Europa League Under Marinakis' ownership since 2010, Olympiakos have won seven domestic championships in a row. They are among the top-25 ranked teams in Europe. He told BBC Sport that claims of criminality against him are as a result of this record. ""All these years, a lot has been said but nothing came out in reality. All of it has been dismissed and we have been clear from all of this,"" he said. ""Now there is a last case remaining - there are about 80 persons involved. I can tell you again that I have nothing to do with it because I know very well what I have done and how I have achieved victories. ""Of course I cannot stop our opponents talking or bad-mouthing."" He added the EFL and other football authorities, such as European governing body Uefa, have cleared him after ""two months"" of ""numerous questions"". Nottingham Forest won consecutive European Cups in 1979 and 1980 under Brian Clough, with Trevor Francis scoring the winning goal in the first of the finals Marinakis attended high school in Watford from the age of 15 and went on to university in the UK. He told the BBC he chose to invest in Forest based on ""what I remember from the past and the potential the club has"". He added: ""I think that it doesn't take long to decide, even if you have a choice, which team to go for. When you see all this tradition and all these achievements, of course this club has the potential to grow and achieve victories that the whole region deserves."" ""I'm not going to promise you things or I'm not a rich guy who came from abroad to spend my money and gain glory by acquiring a team in the UK. ""I had glories from my times with Olympiakos who have won everything, who have broken every record both within our country and in Europe, in the Champions League for our level. ""We know a lot of players, managers, clubs, officials in various parts of the world in international football, agents - all this can help us to put all our connections together and try to do our very best for Nottingham."" Forest supporters invaded the City Ground pitch after they beat Ipswich 3-0 on 7 May to remain in the Championship Forest, league champions in 1977-78 and European Cup winners in the following two seasons, last played in the Premier League in 1998-99. They have since spent 14 seasons in the second tier and three seasons in League One, from 2005-06 to 2007-08. Despite narrowly escaping a return to the third tier this season, Marinakis believes Forest should be in the Premier League. ""We have a long-term plan and within this long-term plan we want to bring Nottingham to where it belongs. And of course Nottingham belongs in the Premier League. And Nottingham belongs to the elite of the Premier League,"" he says. ""Furthermore the supporters of Nottingham have been tired all these years, they didn't have such good times. But they remained loyal and for us that's very important. ""The potential is huge. The potential of this team is that when it will be very well organised, when it will achieve victories again, when it will have a better position in the Championship, when it will have a better position and we can look seriously at the Premier League, then we will be there to stay."" Warburton has previously described the new ownership as ""proven football people"", referencing Marinakis' achievements at Olympiakos. ""They have done a magnificent job at getting into the Champions League year in, year out and have really developed an outstanding club,"" he added. Also referred to as the 'fit and proper persons test', it is designed to prevent someone being involved in running a football club if they have any of the disqualifying conditions listedhere.,external That includes criminal matters such as dishonest acts and unspent convictions and company disqualification matters such as bankruptcy. Fawaz Al Hasawi took over control at Forest in the summer of 2012. Mark Warburton is the club's eighth manager since then Natalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor, on the feeling among some Forest supporters. Supporters seem to be optimistic about the new ownership because five years under Fawaz promised so much but delivered so little. His well-meaning love of the club and his vast wealth was never in doubt but there were eight different managers and a fragile infrastructure behind the scenes, with people in key positions coming and going at regular intervals. Increasing anger led to fans' protests, while Forest finished lower in the league year on year - culminating in this season's final-day escape from relegation. Bridges need to be built and reputations restored. Mark Warburton's arrival shows signs of a more sensible, long-term approach on the football side. There is a sense of relief among fans, but also caution because tremendous wealth does not automatically mean a well-run, stable and successful club. Marinakis is aggressively ambitious but has taken on a club in need of major rebuilding. The purchase is a consortium led by Marinakis and Socrates Kominakis,a Greek businessman and investor, for 100% of Hasawi's shares. The sum is undisclosed. The owners have formed a new company NF Football Investments Ltd, registered in the UK. Nicholas Randall QC, a leading sports lawyer, has been appointed as chairman. Ioannis Vrentzos - CEO of Olympiakos - will move to become Forest CEO. Frank McParland has had his contract extended as director of football. Sat in his modern London office, adorned with a mix of modern art and oil paintings of the port of Piraeus in Greece, Evangelos Marinakis spoke confidently of his long-term plan for Nottingham Forest. His key phrase is ""hard work"". He repeatedly said those words during our interview, and prides himself on building teams both within his shipping empire and at the football clubs he owns. His immediate focus appears to be order, appointing professionals and creating a stable base from which the club can rebuild. But Marinakis does come with baggage. He has faced - and has been cleared - of very serious charges in Greece. He insists his remaining legal difficulties in Greece don't worry him and that he's done nothing wrong. Significantly, the deal is also being fronted by fellow businessman Socrates Kominakis. His presence will ensure that should anything happen in the future concerning Marinakis' ability to own the club (a prospect he says is not based in reality), there will be continuity in the boardroom.

"Match live on Radio 5 live Spurs have 83pts - Leicester won title with 81 Kane's fourth his 26th PL goal this season Striker now two goals ahead of Everton's Lukaku Get involved - #bbcfootball Gary Rose Nothing to play for? Think again. It's advantage Harry Kane in the battle for the Golden Boot as he leads the way with 26 goals, two more than Romelu Lukaku and three more than Alexis Sanchez. Who will come out on top? We'll find out Sunday. See you later. Leicester 1-6 Tottenham A bit more from man-of-the-moment Harry Kane:""It probably couldâve been more. It is the first time in my
professional career that Iâve done that, there has been a bit of build-up on
the race for the golden boot and I wanted at least one or two to put the
pressure on but to get four is amazing. Iâm now sitting at the top, but we go
in with the same mentality, to make sure we win first and foremost and then
score as many as I can. ""We are a bit disappointed not to get a clean sheet for Hugo,
who is going for the golden glove but all in all it was a good night. ""It was probably one of the best performances of the season. ""I think this is my best season, I missed 11 weeks out and to
score the most in a Premier League campaign, I worked hard during my injury to
ensure I came back in better shape than I started."" #bbcfootball, BBC Sport Facebook page and 81111 on text Duncan Hall:What Spurs were ""missing"" these last two years was a rest. Huge advantage for one-game-a-week Chelsea and Leicester.  Leicester 1-6 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino:""It was very good, fantastic. The motivation, the attitude was so, so good. that's how we want to finish the season. ""Harry Kane's a special player, he loves Tottenham. He means a lot for the team. I tell you always that he's one of the best strikers in the world. His performances show that we are right. ""It's fantastic, the goals he has scored this season despite having two injuries. ""For us to keep our best players, a lot of clubs are interested in them but the players we want to keep will be here next season. If any players leave it's Tottenham's decision. Our fans need to be calm. ""The players must feel they are part of us and want to share in our success."" #bbcfootball, BBC Sport Facebook page and 81111 on text Alex Wray:Nonsense to say spurs bottled it, won 11 of their last 12 games! Even if they beat West Ham, Chelsea still would've won the title. Chrjca:I'm amazed that people say that Spurs ""bottled it"" this year. You can't bottle it if you were never top of the table! Leicester 1-6 Tottenham More from Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, this time speaking about Harry Kane:""It is fantastic for him. It is a season again where he fights to be the top scorer in the Premier League. He is great, he is one of the best strikers in the world. He will try to keep going in the next game and try to finish in the best way. ""He was injured two times in the season but he is so fresh now and he is trying to score a lot of goals to finish at the top. We have another opportunity against Hull."" Worried he will go in the summer?""It is very clear we will keep the players we want to keep and we will maybe sell the players we want to sell. We are so, so calm about our key players. They are happy here, we have an exciting project."" Leicester 1-6 Tottenham Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to Sky Sports:""I am very happy with the performance and the attitude. Fantastic. The only way to improve our mentality is to try and always play in this way. ""Always is important to improve. In the first half we dominated the game, they changed shape in the second half and tried to play with more energy. It was difficult because we conceded the goal but the team tried to keep going and we deserved it."" The win moves Tottenham onto 83 points, a tally that would have been enough to win the Premier League on eight occasions previously. Leicester 1-6 Tottenham Leicester boss Craig Shakespeare, speaking to BBC Sport:""At half-time I thought we needed to cause them more problems. For 10-15 minutes of the second half we played on the front foot and got back into the game but the third goal for them seemed to take the confidence away from us. ""We have to be more competitive against them, we gave them too much space, we have to make sure we get blocks in. The goals were too easy in my view but we haven't had too many performances like that. ""We will reflect on it in the morning. We have another game on Sunday and we have to pick ourselves up quickly."" On his future:""The planning for me just starts for Bournemouth this weekend. That is all I can focus on. There's been a bit of recruitment which I've been privy to but for me is to focus on football.""  Tottenham striker Harry Kane to Sky Sports:""I wanted to get one or two goals at least and take it to the final game. I am in the driving seat but there's still one more game. I am not resting on my laurels but I hope to get four more. ""Leicester made it tough for us. They put the pressure on us."" Season not over?""We had been talking about that during the weekend. Hopefully I can get the Golden Boot and hopefully Hugo Lloris can get the Golden Glove. It is disappointing to concede but hopefully we can keep a clean sheet against Hull."" Text 81111 Discuss.... Time to start talking about Kane as the best striker in Europe. Stats speak for themselves. And I sent this after the third goal! Jake Massive, massive drama in the play-off semi-finals. A last-second own goal has just earned Blackpool a 3-3 draw at Luton for a 6-5 aggregate victory, meaning they are into the League Two play-off final. Exeter, meanwhile, have beaten Carlisle United 3-2 to secure their place at Wembley with a 6-5 aggregate win. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Chris Cornell was one of the defining voices of grunge music - his bluesy, multi-octave voice becoming Soundgarden's not-so-secret weapon. Born in Seattle, Washington, in 1964, he developed an interest in music while at school - especially with The Beatles - which led to him learning the piano. But he spent most of his teenage years a loner, afflicted by agoraphobia and anxiety, until rock music helped him overcome his uneasiness around others. After dropping out of school, he bought a drum kit and played in various local bands, which brought him into contact bassist Hiro Yamamoto and  guitarist Kim Thayil, with whom he formed Soundgarden in 1984. The band was named after an art installation in Seattle's Sand Point. Cornell initially played the drums while singing, but was able to concentrate on vocals after a drummer was recruited in 1985. In Soundgarden, he slowed the frenetic flammery of '80s metal to a sombre crawl, earning the band comparisons to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Although they started out on Seattle's Sub Pop label (their debut EP, Screaming Life was the label's second release), they were the first grunge band to sign to a major label. In 1994 the band's breakout fourth album Superunknown spawned worldwide hit Black Hole Sun. The song's surreal and nightmarish video became an MTV favourite and won Best Metal/Hard Rock Video at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. It remains their most enduring hit. Spotify lists more than 50 cover versions, with everyone from Anastacia to Paul Anka drawn to its pretty melody and dreamlike lyrics. Even Cornell wasn't sure what it was about. ""I was just sucked in by the music and I was painting a picture with the lyrics,"" he once said. ""There was no real idea to get across."" While the song defined the band, there was no pinning Cornell down. He wrote for other acts, including Alice Cooper, and formed Audioslave with the remnants of experimental rock act Rage Against The Machine. With them, he played Cuba's first ever outdoor concert by an American rock band; while in later years he worked with hip-hop producer Timbaland and released a solo acoustic album, Songbook, which put his remarkable vocals front and centre. Soundgarden disbanded in 1997 and reunited in 2010. Cornell went into rehab in 2003 after struggles with addiction to drugs and alcohol. His Casino Royale Bond theme in 2006, You Know My Name, may not be a classic of the genre - but in framing Daniel Craig as a new, leaner, tougher 007, it was an uncompromising success. He wrote the end title song Live to Rise for Marvel's The Avengers and his song Misery Chain, a duet with Joy Williams, appeared on the soundtrack of the Oscar-winning film 12 Years A Slave. Cornell's song The Keeper from Machine Gun Preacher was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2012. Like all great musicians, he was curious and fearless. His greatest regret of the grunge scene was that Seattle's experimental bands, the ones playing free jazz and Gothic rock, got left behind because they didn't fit the music industry's narrative. ""It's like somebody came into your city with bulldozers and water compressors and mined your own perfect mountain and excavated it and threw out what they didn't want and left the rest to rot,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1994. ""It's that bad."" His untimely death means that, after Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley and Scott Weiland, yet another of grunge's leading lights has been extinguished. To those who knew him, the loss will be even greater. Cornell is survived by his wife Vicky, whom he married in 2004, and their two children. He also had a daughter with first wife and former manager Susan Silver. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"There are more than 3,300 candidates hoping to win one of the 650 seats in the UK's House of Commons on 8 June. What do we know about those jockeying for position in the race for election? Overall, about 30% of candidates are women - up from the previous record of 26% in 2015, although the actual number of women standing is down from 1,036 to 983. However, parties vary. The Conservatives are the only party to campaign in all four nations of the UK Labour is putting forward the highest percentage of female candidates of any major party, at 41%. The Greens are on 36%, the SNP on 34%, and the Lib Dems on 29%. The Conservatives and Plaid Cymru, both of which are led by women, are neck-and-neck towards the back of the pack with 28% of their parliamentary candidates female.* The party with by far the fewest female candidates is UKIP, on 13%. Labour also has a higher proportion of women standing in constituencies that the party won in 2015. The Lib Dems campaigned in 631 seats in 2015, but won just eight seats. Meanwhile the SNP lost just three of Scotland's 59 parliamentary constituencies But the two biggest parties are fielding very similar proportions of women in seats they lost by less than 10% in 2015. So if Labour increases its share of the vote in each of these places by five percentage points, it would gain 16 women and 32 men. A similar increase for the Conservatives would give them 18 women and 30 men. With candidates in all British constituencies (bar one) and seven of the 18 seats in Northern Ireland, the Conservatives are standing in more of the country than any other party. In 2015 they contested 16 Northern Irish seats. Labour and the Lib Dems do not stand in Northern Ireland. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  The Lib Dems have two fewer candidates than Labour, as they are not standing in Brighton Pavilion, which returned the UK's only Green MP in 2015, or in Skipton and Ripon in Yorkshire, reportedly to bolster the chances of the local Green candidate. Perhaps because they last stood for election only two years ago, just 14 Labour MPs and 12 Conservatives in the 2015-17 Parliament are not standing again. Compared with previous general elections, these numbers are quite small. Thirty-nine Labour MPs and 38 Conservatives decided not stand for re-election in 2015. The average number of MPs standing down at general elections between 1979 and 2015 is about 90. Of the 12 Conservatives standing down in 2017, 11 are men, but six of the candidates vying to replace them are women. For Labour, 11 of the 14 standing down are men, and 10 of the candidates in their former seats are women. * The Speaker of the House of Commons is an MP and has to stand for re-election as Speaker in their constituency at every general election. Traditionally the biggest parties in the House of Commons do not stand against the Speaker however some parties, such as UKIP, do. The current Speaker, John Bercow, is standing for election in Buckingham. The Speaker is a neutral figure in Parliament, so Mr Bercow is no longer a member of the Conservative Party as he was before his election to the role (by parliament). However, for the purposes of calculating the number of seats belonging to each party - and calculating those held, gained or lost by each party - Mr Bercow's seat is regarded as being a Conservative constituency as he won it for the party in 1997, 2001 and 2005 before being elected speaker.

" The air inside of a 25 foot cannon is hot and smells like metal. It’s dark and loud, and the moments before a launch - even for an experienced human cannonball like 32-year-old “Nitro” Nicole Sanders - are filled with real fear. “There’s no feeling comfortable with it,” she says. The cannonball act is deceptively simple: a cannon large enough to fit a human inside its bore “shoots” an acrobat high into the air, and she lands in a net or an airbag. The mechanics of the cannon are a closely guarded secret, but it works with a combination of hydraulics and air pressure - there’s no gunpowder. The only explosion comes from some fireworks lit for show. The flight of the human cannonball at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus is over in just under three seconds, but the preparation takes days. It's up to the human cannonball to control her flight, to use her muscles in order to fly properly, to tumble safely, and land without injuring herself. Any mistake - if the cannon isn’t warmed up enough or Sanders’ footing is off - can cause a bad flight and an even worse landing. A 14-year-old girl named Zazel was the first to be shot out of a cannon, in 1877 London. In the 140 years since, the act’s safety has been vastly improved but never perfected. One circus historian estimated that 30 human cannonballs have died in performance accidents. The most recent death occurred in 2011. Like Zazel, Sanders is an acrobat and an aerialist by training. She is terrifically fit - each muscle must be pulled taut for the moment of launch. She can’t gain or lose too much weight, or else risk throwing off the cannon maker’s calculations with potentially disastrous results. On 7 May, in a downtown arena in Providence, Rhode Island, Sanders rides into the centre of the floor atop the bright red and gold cannon. In her civilian life she is tattooed and favours an all-black wardrobe, but in the show she’s dressed head to toe in a glittery silver jumpsuit. She grins and high-kicks and flourishes with her arms towards the sold-out crowd. As soon as she slides down into the mouth of the cannon, the smile drops. Sanders pulls into herself tightly and calls out to her shooter, Boris, that she’s ready. The ringmaster counts down from five, and with the cracking sound of fireworks, Sanders is launched high in the air, cresting at 40-feet and travelling roughly 66 miles per hour at a G-force of about seven, which is enough to knock out a fighter pilot in flight. She throws out her arms like wings, releasing two fistfuls of glitter. She turns in mid-air, touches her fingertips to her toes, then falls on her back into the airbag. This is when the adrenaline hits, as the crowd roars its approval. Just like she’d envisioned, everything goes perfectly. It is her 596th shot. It may also be her last. After 146 years, these are the final performances of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus, an American institution that was slowly brought to its knees by a combination of evolving cultural tastes, bad luck and political enemies that left it no longer financially viable for its parent company, Feld Entertainment. So, in addition to ignoring the 104-foot expanse of floor between the cannon mouth and the airbag, Sanders has had to force herself to stop thinking about the fact that she’s facing unemployment, the loss of her home, the disbanding of her tight-knit circus family, and the end of her dream job. I’m scrambling, kinda, to try and see what I want to do. This could be the end of my circus career.” A week earlier, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train clatters into Providence at dusk, making its final journey with passengers from the circus’ penultimate performances in Hartford, Connecticut. As soon as the silver cars stamped “GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH” come to a halt, Ivan Vargas, a sixth-generation circus performer from a long line of trapeze artists, clambers down into the muddy gravel. “I learned to walk on the train, my parents were living on the train when I was born,” he says, looking up and down the desolate train tracks. Here we are now, I just took my final train run.” They call it “the city without a zip code”. Sixty-one cars and a little over a mile long, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train is still the primary residence for most of the 107 performers and crew on the Red Unit, one of two remaining touring shows. There are 32 coaches divided into apartments of varying sizes, with as many as 16 people per car sleeping on narrow bunks. The youngest children sleep in the same car with their parents. Some of the families even keep cats and dogs. There is a single, six-table “Pie Car” with a fully functional kitchen staffed 24-hours-a-day when the train is in motion. Performers can shimmy down the razor-thin hallways that connect the cars, order a slab of meatloaf or a slice of pie, and watch the only continuously functioning TV. There is a shop car and a generator car, and 19 flatbeds filled with vehicles, costumes, equipment and tiger toys. The train is followed by a caravan of RVs and trucks ferrying the animals - seven camels, three ponies, 18 tigers, 12 poodles, plus horses, snakes, and goats. The production members hail from 13 different countries including Mongolia, Hungary, Russia, China, and Chile. All the show’s music is performed live, so a full band travels along, as well as a lighting and pyrotechnics crew, a team of veterinarians, vendor and concessions workers, the costume and wardrobe staff, the pie car chefs, interpreters and - at certain times - even a travelling circus ministry. By the time it pulls into Providence, the train had travelled 50,000 miles and visited 83 cities in the two-year tour, titled Circus XTREME. Vargas, 26, whose family is originally from Mexico, was born in between Sunday performances. His father - a trapeze artist - attended the birth while still in costume. Vargas was two years old the first time he got on a trapeze, and 14 the first time he performed in a Ringling Bros show, as an acrobat. When he turned 18, he became a clown, with his own train car room. To me it’s the best way to travel across the country. You take your small apartment with you. You step out on the vestibules and watch the country go by.” Ringling Bros is the last American circus that travels by rail, a tradition that began in the 1830s. In 1872, the showman Phineas T Barnum loaded his brand new circus on to the rails for the first time. By the time of his death, Barnum and his partner James Bailey had grown the show into a multi-ringed kaleidoscopic extravaganza of exotic animals, acrobats and strongmen, contortionists and sword-swallowers, and the train had become as iconic as the circus itself. “They would literally shut towns down when they arrived. Months in advance people knew it was coming,” says Janet Davis, a professor of American studies and history, and author of The Circus Age. “Schools cancelled their classes, factories shut their doors.” Five Wisconsin brothers named Ringling bought the Barnum & Bailey circus after its founders died, and in 1919, Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey debuted as a single show. Life on the circus train in the early days was exciting, seedy, and dangerous. “Love always seemed on the mind of circus folk, although given the cramped quarters, liaisons often took place in lumberyards, warehouses, or even, in extremis, ditches,” wrote photographer Loomis Dean, who travelled on the train as a circus employee. Terrible, unimaginable things happened in [the labourers’] cars, everything from fights to killings.” Courtesy of Circus World Museum This was also the heyday of the freakshow, invented by Barnum and perpetuated by Ringling. “Long, long before we thought about the animals being exploited it was common to exploit people like African Americans and differently abled people,” says Beth Macy, the author of Truevine, the story of two African-American albino brothers from Virginia who were snatched from their home and placed in the circus. Ringling purchased them in 1923. The brothers were first marketed as “Barnum’s monkey men”, then, after their blonde dreadlocks grew out, “Ambassadors from Mars”. It took 13 years for their mother to rescue them and bring them home. In 1956, the last of the circus-owning Ringlings, John Ringling North, announced that the circus would no longer perform under the canvas big top, nicknamed “Big Bertha”, but in brick and mortar arenas. It was a cost-cutting measure, but also seen as punishment for workers who’d attempted to unionise. Hundreds of “canvasmen” who set up and tore down the big top lost their jobs overnight. About a decade later, Irvin and Israel Feld - music promoters who worked with Chubby Checker, Fats Domino, and Paul Anka - bought the circus for $8m (£6.2m) with the help of investors. One of Irvin’s first acts as owner was to end the freakshow. Throughout its changing owners and acts in the constant pursuit of the new and novel, the one thing that remained constant was the train. Ivan Vargas, like generations of circus kids before him, first lived on the train with his parents, and attended school in the travelling classroom that set up amongst the dressing rooms at every stop along the tour. He had two teachers, one to shepherd him through grade school, another for high school, along with the other handful of children who spent 11 months out of the year on tour with their parents. He was not allowed to perform unless he went to class, which often took place in between shows. Sometimes Vargas wondered what it might be like to join the ranks of the “townies” - circus slang for non-circus people. I thought about how I would fit in being in a public school or going to a prom,” Ivan breaks down at the close of the final performance He continues, “but it never crossed my mind that I want to leave the show to go experience this. To me, I would never trade in the circus for anything.” He was married for a time, to a Ukrainian performer who came onto the unit in 2008. They fell in love as an 18-year-old Vargas introduced her to American malls and movies along the train route. But after she got her dream job with Cirque du Soleil and left the tour, the young couple who fell in love by spending 24 hours a day together on the train were unable to sustain the relationship on two weeks a year together. They divorced a year ago. We live so fast, it’s the way that it works.” “I’ve known people who literally come from different backgrounds, different cultures and countries, they don’t know each other. By the end of the tour they’ll be married and have a child already.” In the summer of 2016, for instance, Moroccan high wire walker Mustafa Danguir married Russian juggler Anna Lebedeva in a ceremony performed at the centre of a wire the width of a human thumb. The groom rode in on a camel, the bride did the splits at the “altar” 30 feet in the air. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus. The rise of television, movies, the internet and mobile phones has been siphoning off Ringling’s audience for decades, and the brand sustained irreparable damage during the animal rights movement that began in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Feld Entertainment has famously done battle with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, winning a $25m lawsuit against a group who claimed Ringling’s elephants were being abused. However, they’ve also been investigated and had to pay hefty fines to the US Department of Agriculture over various animal mistreatment allegations. Legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams Public opinion on captive exotic animals shifted, and changes in local laws were making it increasingly difficult to bring the elephants to different markets - cities and then entire states like California and Rhode Island banned the use of bullhooks on elephants, a tool the circus claims is for guiding and training, and which animal rights activists say is an implement of torture. The city of Asheville, North Carolina, banned the display of any exotic animal in its municipally-owned arena. Vargas was a clown on the Gold Unit, a third arm of the travelling tours of the circus, the year before Feld shut it down in 2015. The number of people in the remaining two units, Red and Blue, started to shrink. And in each city, the performers were met with crowds of angry animal rights protesters, and smaller and smaller audiences. In 2016, Feld yielded to public pressure, and the last 11 elephants on tour were transferred to a Florida preserve owned by the Felds. Vargas’ father and 65 others lost their jobs as elephant caretakers. (Some, like Vargas’ father, stayed on to care for the other animals or went to work at the Florida facility.) In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus.

In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. The final blow was delivered on 14 January, 2017, late one night after the last in a “six pack” of performances in Orlando, Florida. Posters printed in English, Portuguese, Ukrainian and Mongolian had gone up earlier in the day announcing a mysterious, mandatory all-staff meeting. There was speculation amongst the performers that the two units might be folded together, or that the rest of the animals would be leaving the tour. So when Feld Entertainment executives delivered the news that the circus was shutting down completely, it landed hard. “You watched hundreds of people burst into tears at the same time,” recalls ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson, Ringling Bros’ first female ringmaster. She had just given up her job, apartment and car to join the circus four months earlier. But the show had to go on. “The next day, we came in and did two more shows.” The five months leading up to the final performances haven’t been easy. Feld set up career counsellors at each stop. One by one, performers who found new gigs dropped off the tour. Foreign performers without new jobs will lose their work visas shortly after the final show, and the Felds are covering plane tickets and reimbursing mileage for road trips home. But it’s not all bad. The last days of the circus found screaming animal rights protesters replaced with sold-out crowds and teary fans. Well-wishers post themselves along the train tracks, sometimes waiting hours with hand-painted signs, hoping to catch a glimpse of the ringmaster waving from the vestibule one last time. For Vargas, the end of the circus is the end of the only way of life he’s ever known. On their day off before the start of performances in Providence, he heads to the local mall after a cursory and futile effort to pack up his train car. Over milkshakes and tater tots at Johnny Rockets, he says he couldn’t stand seeing the removal trucks and dumpsters lined up beside the train. I needed to do something normal, I just want to walk around and kind of be a person.” He wanders around with his 18-year-old cousin Tristan, the sole member of the final class of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey high school. Tristan will graduate that evening at the end-of-tour cast party, dressed in a red cap and gown with the circus insignia on it. They bump into other clowns, a BMX rider, some of the crew, the tiger trainer and his seven-year-old son, Gunther, named after the legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams. In their street clothes, they all look just like ordinary people. That Sunday, the performers wake up and log on to social media to mark the last day in the circus. “Worst. Day. Ever,” writes band trombonist Megan O’Malley, along with a picture of her completely empty room on the train. “The final time putting on my RBBB Circus Xtreme makeup,” Ivan Vargas captions an Instagram photo of himself. The Red Unit gathers for a final circus mass, and a prayer from Circus and Travelling Show Ministries’ Father Francis Cancro: Bless with your holy light concession workers, floor crews, transportation crews and office workers and all who make the world of the circus a reality by their labour. Bless those who manifested beauty through the use of their gifts and talents as they walk, run, jump and fly across the sky. Send your angels as their protection. Circus alumni begin descending on Providence, including dozens of retired clowns and showgirls. Brian and Tina Miser, married cannonball coaches who mentored Sanders, arrive with their 13-year-old daughter. Skyler has already been shot out of a miniature, 8-foot cannon built by her father. She will never realise her dream to become a Ringling Bros cannonball. Chimgee Haltarhuu, a former acrobat with the Mongolian State Circus, flies in from her home in Minnesota where she now teaches a circus school. She wants to personally thank Feld Entertainment chief executive Kenneth Feld for hiring her in the ‘90s. The decision whisked her and her 5-year-old son out of an abusive marriage in Mongolia, where there were no resources for victims of domestic violence. Haltarhuu now makes yearly trips to Mongolia to run free circus demos to start a conversation with village women and children about abuse. Chimgee Haltarhuu with the coach of the current “Mongolian Marvels”” Ringling saved my life,” she says. “We built a good life. I have a house, I have a good job and a good husband, so I’m really happy.” If attendees of the last-ever pre-show - when ticket holders are allowed onto the arena floor to mingle with the clowns, contortionists, dancers and BMX bikers - were paying attention, they might have noticed their hosts struggling to maintain their cheery disposition. They might have noticed that Ivan Vargas’ make-up is pooling in milky droplets on his chin. They might have seen that after the camel trainer cheerfully asked the audience to return to their seats, she rushes backstage in tears. Scattered all over the cavernous dressing room areas, performers are finding private corners to try to compose themselves. Outside on the floor it is impossible to tell anything is amiss. The Danguir high wire act is flawless. The Mongolian contortionists beam as they hang upside down from the backs of their camels. The audience gasps as an acrobat jumps rope 50 feet above the arena floor as the Wheel of Steel spins below his feet. Sanders’ lands safely, cradled in the huge black air bag one last time. Then comes Taba Maluenda’s tiger act. A burly, bald Chilean with a scar across one cheek, Maluenda is one of the only performers with his own microphone. It picks up a sob that escapes his throat as the 13 tigers watch curiously from their perches. He summons one of them down and buries his face in her fur. It’s their last time working together - though he’s raised some of the tigers since they were cubs, they don’t belong to him, and Feld is not disclosing where they are being sent. Maluenda thanks each tiger by name as they exit the caged ring. These guys put food on my table for 13 years.” Then he turns to his 19-year-old daughter Tabata, an assistant in the act who is standing on the other side of the cage door. She’s been on the Ringling Bros train since she was seven. “Tabata, I’m sorry for papa stayed and took care of these animals and forgetted about you,” he says. “That’s never gonna happen again - papa love you.” At the end of the act, he gets down on his knees and kisses the arena floor. As ringmaster Wilson closes out their final show with a rendition of Auld Lang Syne - an old, tour-ending tradition - the rest of the circus children come running onto the floor. Some clamber onto the trampolines with their acrobat parents, others are inconsolable. “We never say good-bye in the circus life, all we say is we’ll see you down the road,” Wilson booms into the microphone for the final time, doffing her glittering top hat. “So ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, thank you. We’ll see you down the road.” Monday morning in the train yard after the final performance is quiet, and there’s a sweet smelling breeze wafting off of a nearby bread factory. Parked all along the train are little cars, giant moving trucks, a pick-up truck whose bed is stacked with a unicycle and an APPLAUSE sign. Adam Craig, the owner of the pick-up, is driving his son Stephen, one of the clowns, back home to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. “If his career never went any further, to have done this would be the exclamation point on anybody else’s career,” says Craig, a granite countertop fabricator. “I remember how exciting it was the first day that we came out and saw the train.” A little girl walking a teensy chihuahua on a leash steps down from her train car. She’s followed by her mother, Irina Prostetsova, a second-generation circus dog trainer from Moscow who’s been with Ringling Bros for five years. Out of her big baggy costume, Prostetsova is dressed casual but chic. In the show her blonde hair is gelled straight up, now, it’s swept softly to one side of her face. For her, there is nothing to cry about today. It was my last performing day. I’m not a performer anymore. I took not one costume, not one prop, nothing.” Prostetsova has been performing in circuses since she was 11 years old. Her father and her brother also trained dogs for the circus. She was an acrobat as well. She married another circus performer, Alex Emelin, and together they and their 12 poodles came to the US to join Ringling. A year into their contract, Prostetsova and Emelin divorced.Despite the fact that they were in the worst throes of the break-up, they continued performing and travelling together with Ringling. Now, three years later, she says she and Emelin are friends again, but the end of the circus is the first time she’ll be able to live away from her ex-husband. “It’s a good thing,” she says. “Finally, I can start my new life.” She’s enrolled in a beauty school. She and her seven-year-old daughter Valentina are driving to Georgia, to close on a townhouse in a tiny city about 45 minutes from Atlanta. Prostetsova’s father and mother are joining them from Moscow - her mother has ALS, and is paralysed, a perilous condition in wintry Russia. Prostetsova and Emelin found homes for all 12 of their standard and miniature poodles. “No more performing for dogs,” says Prostetsova. “Guys gonna sit on the couch, and just go to the park, and just enjoy the life.” Her greatest hope is that Valentina does not become a circus performer. Maybe, she says, she could be a dentist. Prostetsova, Valentina, and their little dog Yumiko climb into a black SUV hitched to a U-Haul trailer and drive away. One by one, in cars and in taxis and moving vans, all 107 members of the Red Unit drive away from the train yard until it is empty. For some, they’re driving towards permanent addresses, towards apartments with full size stoves and refrigerators, to nine-to-five jobs and consistent wifi signals, toward high schools with homecomings and proms, utility bills and bathtubs instead of showers that suddenly - with an odd curve of the train tracks - tilt so far to the side that the water starts pooling and overflowing, and has to be bailed out the window. A quieter life. Ivan Vargas is joining a pirate-themed dinner theatre in Myrtle Beach called Pirates Voyage, where he’ll be learning to sword fight and stunt dive. The Wheel of Steel act is joining a circus in Spain. The Danguir high wire troupe are going back to Morocco, where they are semi-finalists on the Simon Cowell-produced TV show Arabs Got Talent. Nicole Sanders nearly signed a deal to do cannon in South Africa, but it fell apart at the last minute. She was offered a contract at a smaller American circus, but says the pay was less than minimum wage, with no health insurance. She turned it down. Performing, you know you’re not going to make a load of money, but you want to be able to survive.” She catches a flight to New Orleans, Louisiana, to stay with her mother while she figures out her next move. The last person at the train yard in Providence is ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson. She was hired to be Ringling Bros first female ringmaster, and had held the title for exactly one month when she found out that she would also be its last. Before being whisked into the national spotlight as the face of Circus XTREME, she’d been playing a ringmaster in a circus-themed dinner theatre in Orlando, Florida. She’s heading back to her hometown of Tallahassee without concrete plans for the future. With much groaning and shuddering, the train cars start moving down the track heading north, and slowly pick up speed. The bright red “RINGLING BROS AND BARNUM & BAILEY” banner stamped on the side of each car rolls past Wilson dozens and dozens of times. The Red Unit train will join the Blue Unit train in New Jersey in preparation for their final performance on 21 May in Uniondale, New York. Along the way, the cars that have been purchased at auction (minimum bid: $10,000) will be uncoupled and left behind to be picked up by their new owners. The Misers bought one that will be delivered to their cannonball training grounds in Peru, Indiana, and used as a guest house. At least one is destined to become a dinner train in Cincinnati, Ohio, albeit with the Ringling Bros name scraped off. What is left of the train will make the long, final journey south to the circus’ headquarters in Florida. Unsold cars will be scrapped for metal. The final car disappears over the horizon, the shrill squealing noises get tinier and tinier until they’re gone. An older man in a ball cap who was watching the departure approaches a sleep-deprived Wilson, who’s standing alone outside her moving truck with tears streaming down her face. “Excuse me,” he asks in a thick New England accent. “Are you the ringmaster?” Wilson answers simply, “Yeah,” and they both laugh joylessly. Long after the train has left the yard, Wilson lingers filming the tracks on her iPhone, pacing up and down the parking lot, and fretting because she forgot to thank the circus’ concession workers in her final speech. The sky is filling slowly with ominous dark clouds. Finally, she stops at the cab of her huge yellow moving truck. “It’s been amazing,” she sighs. “Time to get in this bad boy and figure out what I’m gonna do. “I’ll see you down the road.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,1.3109055e-05
"More women are finding work in cities Why are millions of women dropping out of work in India? The numbers are stark - for the first time in India's recent history, not only was there a decline in the female labour participation rate, but also a shrinking of the total number of women in the workforce. Nearly 20 million Indian women quit work between 2004-05 to 2011-12 The labour force participation rate for women of working age declined from 42% in 1993-94 to 31% in 2011-12 Some 53% of the total drop - the largest chunk - happened among women aged 15-24 and living in villages In rural areas, the female labour force participation rate dropped from 49% to 37.8% between 2004-05 and 2009-10 While more than 24 million men joined the work force between 2004-5 to 2009-10, the number of women in the the work force dropped by 21.7 million Using data gleaned from successive rounds ofNational Sample Survey Organisation,externalandcensus,externaldata, a team of researchers from World Bank have attempted to find out why this is happening. ""These are significant matters of concern. As India poises itself to increase economic growth and foster development, it is necessary to ensure that its labour force becomes fully inclusive of women,"" says thestudy,external, authored by Luis A Andres, Basab Dasgupta, George Joseph, Vinoj Abraham and Maria Correia. So what accounts for the unprecedented and puzzling drop in women's participation in the workforce - at a time when India's economy has grown at a steady pace? Women need better and more suitable job opportunities outside farming, the authors say Predictable social norms are attributed to women quitting work in India: marriage, motherhood, vexed gender relations and biases, and patriarchy. But they may not be the only reasons. Marriage, for example, does affect the rate of participation of women in the workforce. But in villages, the workforce participation rate of married women has been found to be higher than that of unmarried women - whereas in the cities, the situation is reversed. Significantly, rising aspirations and relative prosperity may be actually responsible for putting a large cohort of women out of work in India. Remember, the largest drop has been in the villages. After calculating the labour force participation rates and educational participation rates (young women in schools) the researchers believe that one plausible explanation for the drop in the participation rate among rural girls and women aged 15-24 is the recent expansion of secondary education and rapidly changing social norms leading to ""more working age young females opting to continue their education rather than join the labour force early"". The study says there has been a ""larger response to income changes among the poor, rather than the wealthy, by sending children to school"". Also, casual workers - mainly women - drop out of the workforce when wages increased for regular earners - mainly men - leading to the stabilisation of family incomes. ""Improved stability in family income can be understood as a disincentive for female household members to join the labour force,"" says the study. Many women work outside the home, and on their farms ""This largely resonates with the existing literature, which suggests that with rising household income levels, women in rural India withdraw from paid labour and engage in status production at home."" But dropping or opting out of the workforce to go to school and get an education may not ensure that these women will eventually go to work. After studying the relationship with the female labour participation rate and levels of educational achievements, the researchers found that having a high school-level education was ""not found to be an incentive for women"" to work. The lowest rate of participation is among those who had secured school and high school education in the cities and villages. And the rate is actually highest among illiterates and college graduates. But there has been a general drop in the rate in recent years, indicating that irrespective of educational attainments, ""the incentive for women to participate in the workforce has declined over this period"". Why motherhood makes Indian women quit their jobs Will new maternity law help keep Indian women in work? The Indian women who took on a multinational and won To be sure, India has a poor record of female participation in the workforce: the International Labour Organisation ranked it 121 out of 131 countries in 2013, one of the lowest in the world. Also, India is not an outlier when it comes to women dropping out of the workforce. Between 2004 and 2012, the female labour force participation rate in China dropped from 68% to 64%, but the participation rate remains very high compared with India. In neighbouring Sri Lanka, for example, the participation rate has dropped, but only by 2%. ""India stands out because of a such a sharp decline within such a short period. In levels, it is very low in international rankings now,"" the researchers told me. India needs to offer more opportunities to women, the researchers say Clearly women need better and more suitable job opportunities, outside agriculture. Rural labour markets need to offer jobs that are acceptable and attractive to women and their families. The World Bank study suggests that gains will not be realised unless social norms around women's - and men's - work also change: ""Strategies to communicate the importance of women's work should take into account the roles of women, husbands and in-laws."" Also, as another study says, the ""ongoing decrease in the availability of farm-based work, has led to women focusing on economic activities within their households"".

"With an election three weeks away, it would be normal to start seeing letters in national newspapers from the chief executives of the UK's biggest companies setting out their priorities for the next government. A helpful reminder from the commercial powers that be that it is businesses, not government, that create prosperity, and their needs should be high on any political party's agenda. So far - nothing. Why has business lost its voice? Business leaders I have spoken to in the last few weeks have told me that they have been left in no doubt that none of the major parties need or want their blessing. Both the Tories and the Labour party of Blair and Mandelson either enthusiastically courted or felt ""intensely relaxed"" around the country's wealthiest people. Not any more. The Conservatives attempt to recast themselves as the party of the worker, rather than of the boss, with promises to intervene in markets and crack down on boardroom excess. That has seen the door to the Number 10 kitchen supper clang shut. Yes, there have been dinners for business chiefs and spouses, but attendees tell me that if talk turns to policy, the talk dries up. Last night at a black-tie do in Park Lane, business moved to plan B: offer to help with the crushing weight of technical Brexit negotiations facing a potentially overwhelmed civil service. Paul Dreschler, the president of the CBI, offered a government that hadn't done trade deals for 40 years help in getting it right. ""Business can help navigating the labyrinthine problems of Brexit. We are offering to create a business Brexit task force in the next 50 days,"" he said. The problem is this assistance looks like it comes from Jeeves rather than the local mechanic. A thousand-strong contingent wining and dining while economic figures show average workers getting poorer every day as their wage rises are gobbled up by rising prices is not ""on message"" for any of the parties. Business chiefs are hopeful that once the election is over their offers will be welcome. As one chairman told me - hopefully everyone will ""chill out"" and be prepared to listen. Over years of trying to get business leaders to tell me what they really think about politics on air, I've learnt that through elections and referenda most prefer to argue their case behind closed doors - as long as they were on the same side of the door. Right now it seems - to not just many but most in this business gathering - that no-one is listening.

"At what age should the bank of mum and dad shut its doors to a son or daughter? In northern Spain, a judge has turned down the demand of a 23-year-old woman to continue receiving her parents' financial support, ruling that she is ""too lazy to earn a living"". Family bonds are traditionally highly valued in Spain and this decision marks a contrast with many previous rulings in which parents have been obliged to support their offspring long after they become adults, and even into their 30s. Spain's crippling economic crisis has caused youth unemployment to soar, meaning most young people rely on their parents for many years after leaving school. The average age at which Spaniards leave home has risen to 29, almost nine years later than the average Swede, according to Eurostat. The unnamed 23 year old, from the seaside town of Castro Urdiales, went to the Cantabrian provincial court to demand maintenance of â¬300 a month (Â£255; $330) from her father. The woman's parents had separated in 2012 and there had been no mention of child support in their settlement. The court noted that the woman had not completed secondary education but she had received money from her parents to pay for IT courses that she had not managed to complete. Why young adults are waiting to grow up Third of US millennials live at home China: Where 70% of millennials own a home Legal precedent in Spain holds that parents are obliged to provide for their children until they reach economic independence. But the judges ruled that this responsibility does not apply if the child's behaviour prevents them from getting on in life. In this instance, the woman's conduct was ""legally classifiable as one of abandonment, laziness and failure to take advantage"". In a similar vein, a court in Catalonia last year told a 19 year old, who was neither in work nor studying, that his parents were not obliged to support his ""capricious lifestyle"", effectively booting him on to the street. The president of the Spanish family law association, Maria Dolores Lozano, says parents are increasingly seeking legal help. Judges are also drawing attention to the large numbers of young Spaniards who have moved abroad to find work, when they consider whether or not a child has options to support themselves, she adds. The reality in Spain is that these cases are by no means the whole of the story. Clara is 33 years old, able-bodied and has a master's degree. And yet an appeal court in the north-western province of Galicia has ruled her father must continue to pay her an allowance of â¬450 a month while she seeks a job in keeping with her education. ""The really unprecedented thing about this case is that the support is open-ended,"" says Rosario Bello, Clara's legal representative. So it could become a kind of pension for life. ""There is no set rule on how long parents must support their children, but the late 20s used to mark the limit, allowing a person to get support while they studied for a degree and maybe a master's degree before entering the labour market,"" Ms Bello explains. ""It is the crisis that has led to this change."" This video can not be played Matthew Price spoke to some Spanish students about their job options Despite Spain's economic recovery over the past two years, unemployment among under-30s remains stubbornly high at 43%. The figure is so high partly because many young Spaniards continue studying throughout much of their 20s. But the shocking reality is that fewer than 40% of young people are gainfully employed, according to a study published in April by La Caixa bank's social welfare foundation. In the report, entitled ""Low education level, low labour participation"", author BegoÃ±a Cueto of Oviedo University explains why a lack of skills and chronic unemployment are so inextricably linked. Of the one in three 25- to 34-year-olds who did not complete secondary education, many dropped out of school and took up unskilled work during Spain's construction boom in the decade leading up to the 2008 financial crash. ""One of the key challenges facing our system is to reduce the school dropout rate, regardless of the economic situation,"" she argues. Because after drifting out of school, into work and then out of employment,  many young Spaniards are stuck at home, straining their country's long and proud tradition of family solidarity.

"Mr Chang arrived in the US in January 1988 after a lifetime in Taiwan, to inform on his government's nuclear ambitions In 1988 Taiwan was racing to build its first nuclear bomb, but one military scientist put a stop to that when he defected to the United States and exposed those plans. This is the story of a man who insists he had to betray his country in order to save it. To this day, critics consider Chang Hsien-yi a traitor - but he has no regrets. ""If I can ever do it all over again, I will do it,"" says the calmly defiant 73-year-old, speaking from his home in the US state of Idaho. The former military colonel has been living there since 1988 when he fled to the US, a close ally of the island, and this is his first substantial interview about that time. It might seem a perplexing turn of events given the close relationship the US has with Taiwan, but Washington had  found out that Taiwan's government had secretly ordered scientists to develop nuclear weapons. Taiwan's enemy, the Communist government of China, had been building up its nuclear arsenal since the 1960s, and the Taiwanese were terrified this would be unleashed on the island. Taiwan separated from China after the Chinese Civil War in 1949. To this day China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has vowed to reunify with the island, by force if necessary. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Which countries have nuclear weapons? The leadership of the island was also in an uncertain phase - its president, Chiang Ching-kuo, was dying, and the US thought  that General Hau Pei-tsun, whom they saw as a hawkish figure, would become his successor. Mr Chang, seen here with one of his children in Taiwan before his defection, enjoyed a comfortable life at that time They were worried about a nuclearisation of the Taiwan Strait and bent on stopping Taiwan's nuclear ambition in its tracks and preventing a regional arms race. So they secretly enlisted Mr Chang to halt Taiwan's programme. When Mr Chang was recruited by the CIA in the early 1980s, he was the deputy director at Taiwan's Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, which was responsible for the nuclear weapons programme. As one of Taiwan's key nuclear scientists, he enjoyed a life of privilege and a lucrative salary. But he says he began questioning whether the island should have nuclear weapons after the catastrophic Chernobyl accident in 1986 in the former Soviet Union. He was convinced by the Americans' argument that stopping the programme would be ""good for peace, and was for the benefit of mainland China and Taiwan"". Factory 221 witnessed the research and test of China's first nuclear bomb ""This fit into my mindset very much,"" says Mr Chang. ""But the most important reason why I agreed is that they went to great efforts to assure me they would ensure my safety."" The next task was getting him and his family out. At that time, military officials could not leave Taiwan without permission. So, Mr Chang first ensured his wife and three young children's safety by sending them to Japan for a holiday. His wife, Betty, says she had no clue about her husband's double life. They had only talked about the possibility of him accepting a job in the US. The Changs were put in a safe house shortly after their arrival in the US ""He told me this was a trial to test how easy I could get out from Taiwan and to see how much luggage I could pack,"" she says. Mrs Chang left on 8 January 1988 with their children, excited to visit Tokyo Disneyland. The very next day, Mr Chang took a flight to the US using a fake passport provided by the CIA. All he had with him was some cash and a few personal possessions. Contrary to previous reports, he says he did not take a single document with him when he left Taiwan. ""The American government had all the evidence, they just needed someone - me - to corroborate it."" Meanwhile in Tokyo, Betty Chang was approached by a woman who handed her a letter from Mr Chang. That was the moment she discovered her husband was a CIA spy and had defected. ""It said 'You will never go back to Taiwan and from Japan you will go to USA'... that was a surprise for me. ""I just cried when I knew I could no longer go back to Taiwan,"" says Mrs Chang. The family was bundled into a plane headed for Seattle, where they were met by Mr Chang at the airport. The Changs were later put in a safe house in Virginia, due to fears he would be assassinated by Taiwanese agents or patriotic extremists. Within a month, the US succeeded in pressuring Taiwan to end the programme, using the intelligence it had collected and Mr Chang's testimony. Taiwan was believed to be just one or two years from completing a nuclear bomb. Mr Chang has remained silent for decades. But with his recent retirement he now wants to set the record straight with a memoir, titled Nuclear! Spy? CIA: Record of an Interview with Chang Hsien-yi. The book, written with academic Chen Yi-shen and published in December, has reignited a debate about whether Mr Chang did the right thing for Taiwan. Mr Chang recently wrote a book about his side of the story Some praise him for preventing a potential nuclear war. Others see his actions as denying Taiwan the weapons it needed for self-defence and survival. Even those in Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which officially opposes the development of nuclear energy and weapons, take a dim view of Mr Chang's actions. ""Regardless of what your political views are, when you betray your country, it's not acceptable... it cannot be forgiven,"" said the DPP's Wang Ting-yu, chairman of the parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee. But Mr Chang insists he feared then that ambitious Taiwanese politicians would use nuclear weapons to try to take back mainland China. He claims Madame Chiang Kai Shek, the stepmother of dying President Chiang Ching-kuo, and a group of generals loyal to her had even gone so far as to set up a separate chain of command to expedite the development of nuclear weapons. Taiwan's programme was developed in response to China's stockpile of missiles, several of which are now on display at Beijing's Military Museum ""They said they wouldn't use it, but nobody believed it,"" says Mr Chang, adding that the US certainly did not. Nowadays, there may still be politicians who could be tempted to use such weapons, this time to pursue Taiwan's formal independence from China at whatever cost, he says. But the DPP's Mr Wang dismisses this notion. ""We absolutely don't consider this, we don't even think about it,"" he said. Taiwan has nuclear power plants, which some have protested against Over the years some Taiwanese presidents have hinted at a desire to reactivate the island's nuclear weapons programme, but these suggestions have been quickly quashed by Washington's objections. Still, the island is widely considered to have the ability to make nuclear weapons quickly if needed. China has in recent years threatened to attack if Taiwan ever deployed nuclear weapons. Following his defection, Taiwan's military listed Mr Chang as a fugitive. But even after his arrest warrant expired in 2000, he has not returned to Taiwan and does not plan to. He does not want to deal with criticism he is sure he would face, and the negative impact that would have on his family there. The Chang family is pictured here in this 1995 photo, a few years after their defection to the US In 1990, they were permanently resettled in Idaho, where Mr Chang worked as a consulting engineer and scientist at the US government's Idaho National Laboratories until he retired in 2013. He says his only regret is that he was not able to see his parents before they passed away. ""You don't have to be in Taiwan to love Taiwan; I love Taiwan,"" says Mr Chang. ""I am Taiwanese, I am Chinese. I don't want to see Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait killing each other.""

"In my interview with Philip Hammond last month, the Chancellor pleaded that he did not want to have his hands ""constrained"". It was a clear signal he wanted to drop the ""triple tax lock"" put in place by David Cameron before the 2015 election not to raise income tax, national insurance contributions or VAT. In two out of three, Number 10 appears to have heeded his request. There is a pledge in the manifesto not to increase VAT. But the promise not to raise income tax or national insurance has been replaced by a rather vaguer ""firm intention to reduce taxes on Britain's businesses and working families"". Many predict that Mr Hammond will resurrect the plan to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed if the Tories win on June 8 and he remains as Chancellor. Today's manifesto is all about increasing ""wriggle room"" for any new Conservative government. Just as the manifesto opens the door to tax rises, it also allows for more borrowing. It pledges to ""balance the books"" (meaning the government earns in taxes what it spends on services) and eliminate the deficit by the ""middle of the next decade"". That's about three years further into the future than suggested in the Autumn Statement, when Mr Hammond said ""the public finances should be returned to balance as early as possible in the next Parliament"". Many economists took that to mean around 2022, given that at that stage we were expecting an election in 2020. ""By pushing out the time by which the government expects to balance the books, it is implicitly telling us that there is likely to be an easing off in austerity,"" said Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank. ""The government is still trying to reduce borrowing, but is doing so slightly more gradually than previously projected."" Of course, revising deficit targets has become something of a tradition for the Conservatives - who insist they are still firm backers of ""sound money"". The first target, set in 2010, was to eliminate the deficit by 2015. Then it was 2020. Now it is 2025. As the old New Yorker cartoon says of the harassed executive desperately searching for a free lunch appointment. ""Never? Is never good for you?"" In her hunt for fiscal flexibility (there are still fears the economy could take a rapid turn for the worse) Mrs May has also reduced the pensions triple lock to a double lock - abandoning the promise that pensions would rise by at least 2.5% every year. The double lock says that pensions will now rise by either inflation or earnings growth - whichever is higher. That could mean pension increases of less than 2.5%, if inflation and earnings growth fall. Mrs May, with Mr Hammond supporting her from the side lines, has produced a manifesto that gives her good deal of economic room for manoeuvre. And that is for a reason. Before 2010 and 2015, the Tories believed their ""sell"" to the voter was that they could be ""trusted"" with the public finances and that people wanted a rapid reduction in government borrowing. That belief has changed. In an era of falling real incomes and struggling productivity growth (the actual way to create economic wealth), the focus has moved to more active support for the economy. Even if that means taxing and borrowing more.

"Alex Hanscombe was two years old and with his mother when she was attacked and killed In July 1992 a young mother, Rachel Nickell, was stabbed repeatedly and killed on Wimbledon Common in London. She was with her son, Alex, who was just two years old. He was the only witness. Now aged 27, Alex Hanscombe has spoken toBBC Woman's Hourabout that time and how he has moved on. ""More than anything, I remember just after the attack reaching out to my mother and asking her to get up. I realised in a split second that she was gone and wasn't coming back."" Alex's memories about the attack are vivid.  He recalls the assailant washing his hands in a nearby stream. He also remembers seeing a cash receipt which had fallen from his mother's pocket - he rested it on her forehead. This video can not be played Alex explains how he came to terms with seeing his mother being murdered. It took many years for the killer to be caught. A man called Colin Stagg was wrongly accused of her killing and a judge criticised the police investigation which deployed a ""honey trap"". In 2008 a man called Robert Napper pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Napper, who had schizophrenia, had already been convicted of a 1993 double killing. He is at Broadmoor high security hospital. There was intense media interest in the case, so Alex's father, Andre, took him to rural France to start a new life. After a while the press found out where they lived, so they moved once more - this time to Spain. Alex with his mother, who had been a model People knowing where they lived presented a risk to Alex's life. He was the only person to have witnessed his mother's killing and for as long as the killer was at large, he was in danger. He insists that he was never scared, although he acknowledges that ""my life could have ended that very morning"". He says certain situations used to trigger very strong reactions in him as a child, especially if he saw someone who looked like his mother's killer. Alex has always strived not to be defined by what happened. ""There were all sorts of claims that were made about me, such as I'd never talk again, I'd end up living under a bridge or even repeat the same cycle of violence. But it's about creating your path and living your own way,"" he said. It is 25 years this year since Rachel Nickell was killed on Wimbledon Common He has recently returned to the spot on Wimbledon Common where his mother was killed. ""I had this strong urge to go back there and something magical happened. ""I knelt down and said a prayer. I said thank you for all my blessings and for making the pieces of the puzzle come together in the right way. And at that very moment I heard someone call, ""Molly, Molly"". ""I thought I was dreaming but it was a man calling out to his dog, Molly."" Alex's father Andre, left, moved the family to France, then Spain, to avoid intense media interest Molly was the pet dog with Rachel and Alex when she was attacked 25 years ago. ""The coincidence and this happening: it's all there for a reason,"" he says. Alex lives in Barcelona with his father. He studies hypnotherapy, handwriting analysis and yoga.

" The air inside of a 25 foot cannon is hot and smells like metal. It’s dark and loud, and the moments before a launch - even for an experienced human cannonball like 32-year-old “Nitro” Nicole Sanders - are filled with real fear. “There’s no feeling comfortable with it,” she says. The cannonball act is deceptively simple: a cannon large enough to fit a human inside its bore “shoots” an acrobat high into the air, and she lands in a net or an airbag. The mechanics of the cannon are a closely guarded secret, but it works with a combination of hydraulics and air pressure - there’s no gunpowder. The only explosion comes from some fireworks lit for show. The flight of the human cannonball at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus is over in just under three seconds, but the preparation takes days. It's up to the human cannonball to control her flight, to use her muscles in order to fly properly, to tumble safely, and land without injuring herself. Any mistake - if the cannon isn’t warmed up enough or Sanders’ footing is off - can cause a bad flight and an even worse landing. A 14-year-old girl named Zazel was the first to be shot out of a cannon, in 1877 London. In the 140 years since, the act’s safety has been vastly improved but never perfected. One circus historian estimated that 30 human cannonballs have died in performance accidents. The most recent death occurred in 2011. Like Zazel, Sanders is an acrobat and an aerialist by training. She is terrifically fit - each muscle must be pulled taut for the moment of launch. She can’t gain or lose too much weight, or else risk throwing off the cannon maker’s calculations with potentially disastrous results. On 7 May, in a downtown arena in Providence, Rhode Island, Sanders rides into the centre of the floor atop the bright red and gold cannon. In her civilian life she is tattooed and favours an all-black wardrobe, but in the show she’s dressed head to toe in a glittery silver jumpsuit. She grins and high-kicks and flourishes with her arms towards the sold-out crowd. As soon as she slides down into the mouth of the cannon, the smile drops. Sanders pulls into herself tightly and calls out to her shooter, Boris, that she’s ready. The ringmaster counts down from five, and with the cracking sound of fireworks, Sanders is launched high in the air, cresting at 40-feet and travelling roughly 66 miles per hour at a G-force of about seven, which is enough to knock out a fighter pilot in flight. She throws out her arms like wings, releasing two fistfuls of glitter. She turns in mid-air, touches her fingertips to her toes, then falls on her back into the airbag. This is when the adrenaline hits, as the crowd roars its approval. Just like she’d envisioned, everything goes perfectly. It is her 596th shot. It may also be her last. After 146 years, these are the final performances of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus, an American institution that was slowly brought to its knees by a combination of evolving cultural tastes, bad luck and political enemies that left it no longer financially viable for its parent company, Feld Entertainment. So, in addition to ignoring the 104-foot expanse of floor between the cannon mouth and the airbag, Sanders has had to force herself to stop thinking about the fact that she’s facing unemployment, the loss of her home, the disbanding of her tight-knit circus family, and the end of her dream job. I’m scrambling, kinda, to try and see what I want to do. This could be the end of my circus career.” A week earlier, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train clatters into Providence at dusk, making its final journey with passengers from the circus’ penultimate performances in Hartford, Connecticut. As soon as the silver cars stamped “GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH” come to a halt, Ivan Vargas, a sixth-generation circus performer from a long line of trapeze artists, clambers down into the muddy gravel. “I learned to walk on the train, my parents were living on the train when I was born,” he says, looking up and down the desolate train tracks. Here we are now, I just took my final train run.” They call it “the city without a zip code”. Sixty-one cars and a little over a mile long, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train is still the primary residence for most of the 107 performers and crew on the Red Unit, one of two remaining touring shows. There are 32 coaches divided into apartments of varying sizes, with as many as 16 people per car sleeping on narrow bunks. The youngest children sleep in the same car with their parents. Some of the families even keep cats and dogs. There is a single, six-table “Pie Car” with a fully functional kitchen staffed 24-hours-a-day when the train is in motion. Performers can shimmy down the razor-thin hallways that connect the cars, order a slab of meatloaf or a slice of pie, and watch the only continuously functioning TV. There is a shop car and a generator car, and 19 flatbeds filled with vehicles, costumes, equipment and tiger toys. The train is followed by a caravan of RVs and trucks ferrying the animals - seven camels, three ponies, 18 tigers, 12 poodles, plus horses, snakes, and goats. The production members hail from 13 different countries including Mongolia, Hungary, Russia, China, and Chile. All the show’s music is performed live, so a full band travels along, as well as a lighting and pyrotechnics crew, a team of veterinarians, vendor and concessions workers, the costume and wardrobe staff, the pie car chefs, interpreters and - at certain times - even a travelling circus ministry. By the time it pulls into Providence, the train had travelled 50,000 miles and visited 83 cities in the two-year tour, titled Circus XTREME. Vargas, 26, whose family is originally from Mexico, was born in between Sunday performances. His father - a trapeze artist - attended the birth while still in costume. Vargas was two years old the first time he got on a trapeze, and 14 the first time he performed in a Ringling Bros show, as an acrobat. When he turned 18, he became a clown, with his own train car room. To me it’s the best way to travel across the country. You take your small apartment with you. You step out on the vestibules and watch the country go by.” Ringling Bros is the last American circus that travels by rail, a tradition that began in the 1830s. In 1872, the showman Phineas T Barnum loaded his brand new circus on to the rails for the first time. By the time of his death, Barnum and his partner James Bailey had grown the show into a multi-ringed kaleidoscopic extravaganza of exotic animals, acrobats and strongmen, contortionists and sword-swallowers, and the train had become as iconic as the circus itself. “They would literally shut towns down when they arrived. Months in advance people knew it was coming,” says Janet Davis, a professor of American studies and history, and author of The Circus Age. “Schools cancelled their classes, factories shut their doors.” Five Wisconsin brothers named Ringling bought the Barnum & Bailey circus after its founders died, and in 1919, Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey debuted as a single show. Life on the circus train in the early days was exciting, seedy, and dangerous. “Love always seemed on the mind of circus folk, although given the cramped quarters, liaisons often took place in lumberyards, warehouses, or even, in extremis, ditches,” wrote photographer Loomis Dean, who travelled on the train as a circus employee. Terrible, unimaginable things happened in [the labourers’] cars, everything from fights to killings.” Courtesy of Circus World Museum This was also the heyday of the freakshow, invented by Barnum and perpetuated by Ringling. “Long, long before we thought about the animals being exploited it was common to exploit people like African Americans and differently abled people,” says Beth Macy, the author of Truevine, the story of two African-American albino brothers from Virginia who were snatched from their home and placed in the circus. Ringling purchased them in 1923. The brothers were first marketed as “Barnum’s monkey men”, then, after their blonde dreadlocks grew out, “Ambassadors from Mars”. It took 13 years for their mother to rescue them and bring them home. In 1956, the last of the circus-owning Ringlings, John Ringling North, announced that the circus would no longer perform under the canvas big top, nicknamed “Big Bertha”, but in brick and mortar arenas. It was a cost-cutting measure, but also seen as punishment for workers who’d attempted to unionise. Hundreds of “canvasmen” who set up and tore down the big top lost their jobs overnight. About a decade later, Irvin and Israel Feld - music promoters who worked with Chubby Checker, Fats Domino, and Paul Anka - bought the circus for $8m (£6.2m) with the help of investors. One of Irvin’s first acts as owner was to end the freakshow. Throughout its changing owners and acts in the constant pursuit of the new and novel, the one thing that remained constant was the train. Ivan Vargas, like generations of circus kids before him, first lived on the train with his parents, and attended school in the travelling classroom that set up amongst the dressing rooms at every stop along the tour. He had two teachers, one to shepherd him through grade school, another for high school, along with the other handful of children who spent 11 months out of the year on tour with their parents. He was not allowed to perform unless he went to class, which often took place in between shows. Sometimes Vargas wondered what it might be like to join the ranks of the “townies” - circus slang for non-circus people. I thought about how I would fit in being in a public school or going to a prom,” Ivan breaks down at the close of the final performance He continues, “but it never crossed my mind that I want to leave the show to go experience this. To me, I would never trade in the circus for anything.” He was married for a time, to a Ukrainian performer who came onto the unit in 2008. They fell in love as an 18-year-old Vargas introduced her to American malls and movies along the train route. But after she got her dream job with Cirque du Soleil and left the tour, the young couple who fell in love by spending 24 hours a day together on the train were unable to sustain the relationship on two weeks a year together. They divorced a year ago. We live so fast, it’s the way that it works.” “I’ve known people who literally come from different backgrounds, different cultures and countries, they don’t know each other. By the end of the tour they’ll be married and have a child already.” In the summer of 2016, for instance, Moroccan high wire walker Mustafa Danguir married Russian juggler Anna Lebedeva in a ceremony performed at the centre of a wire the width of a human thumb. The groom rode in on a camel, the bride did the splits at the “altar” 30 feet in the air. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus. The rise of television, movies, the internet and mobile phones has been siphoning off Ringling’s audience for decades, and the brand sustained irreparable damage during the animal rights movement that began in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Feld Entertainment has famously done battle with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, winning a $25m lawsuit against a group who claimed Ringling’s elephants were being abused. However, they’ve also been investigated and had to pay hefty fines to the US Department of Agriculture over various animal mistreatment allegations. Legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams Public opinion on captive exotic animals shifted, and changes in local laws were making it increasingly difficult to bring the elephants to different markets - cities and then entire states like California and Rhode Island banned the use of bullhooks on elephants, a tool the circus claims is for guiding and training, and which animal rights activists say is an implement of torture. The city of Asheville, North Carolina, banned the display of any exotic animal in its municipally-owned arena. Vargas was a clown on the Gold Unit, a third arm of the travelling tours of the circus, the year before Feld shut it down in 2015. The number of people in the remaining two units, Red and Blue, started to shrink. And in each city, the performers were met with crowds of angry animal rights protesters, and smaller and smaller audiences. In 2016, Feld yielded to public pressure, and the last 11 elephants on tour were transferred to a Florida preserve owned by the Felds. Vargas’ father and 65 others lost their jobs as elephant caretakers. (Some, like Vargas’ father, stayed on to care for the other animals or went to work at the Florida facility.) In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus.

In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. The final blow was delivered on 14 January, 2017, late one night after the last in a “six pack” of performances in Orlando, Florida. Posters printed in English, Portuguese, Ukrainian and Mongolian had gone up earlier in the day announcing a mysterious, mandatory all-staff meeting. There was speculation amongst the performers that the two units might be folded together, or that the rest of the animals would be leaving the tour. So when Feld Entertainment executives delivered the news that the circus was shutting down completely, it landed hard. “You watched hundreds of people burst into tears at the same time,” recalls ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson, Ringling Bros’ first female ringmaster. She had just given up her job, apartment and car to join the circus four months earlier. But the show had to go on. “The next day, we came in and did two more shows.” The five months leading up to the final performances haven’t been easy. Feld set up career counsellors at each stop. One by one, performers who found new gigs dropped off the tour. Foreign performers without new jobs will lose their work visas shortly after the final show, and the Felds are covering plane tickets and reimbursing mileage for road trips home. But it’s not all bad. The last days of the circus found screaming animal rights protesters replaced with sold-out crowds and teary fans. Well-wishers post themselves along the train tracks, sometimes waiting hours with hand-painted signs, hoping to catch a glimpse of the ringmaster waving from the vestibule one last time. For Vargas, the end of the circus is the end of the only way of life he’s ever known. On their day off before the start of performances in Providence, he heads to the local mall after a cursory and futile effort to pack up his train car. Over milkshakes and tater tots at Johnny Rockets, he says he couldn’t stand seeing the removal trucks and dumpsters lined up beside the train. I needed to do something normal, I just want to walk around and kind of be a person.” He wanders around with his 18-year-old cousin Tristan, the sole member of the final class of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey high school. Tristan will graduate that evening at the end-of-tour cast party, dressed in a red cap and gown with the circus insignia on it. They bump into other clowns, a BMX rider, some of the crew, the tiger trainer and his seven-year-old son, Gunther, named after the legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams. In their street clothes, they all look just like ordinary people. That Sunday, the performers wake up and log on to social media to mark the last day in the circus. “Worst. Day. Ever,” writes band trombonist Megan O’Malley, along with a picture of her completely empty room on the train. “The final time putting on my RBBB Circus Xtreme makeup,” Ivan Vargas captions an Instagram photo of himself. The Red Unit gathers for a final circus mass, and a prayer from Circus and Travelling Show Ministries’ Father Francis Cancro: Bless with your holy light concession workers, floor crews, transportation crews and office workers and all who make the world of the circus a reality by their labour. Bless those who manifested beauty through the use of their gifts and talents as they walk, run, jump and fly across the sky. Send your angels as their protection. Circus alumni begin descending on Providence, including dozens of retired clowns and showgirls. Brian and Tina Miser, married cannonball coaches who mentored Sanders, arrive with their 13-year-old daughter. Skyler has already been shot out of a miniature, 8-foot cannon built by her father. She will never realise her dream to become a Ringling Bros cannonball. Chimgee Haltarhuu, a former acrobat with the Mongolian State Circus, flies in from her home in Minnesota where she now teaches a circus school. She wants to personally thank Feld Entertainment chief executive Kenneth Feld for hiring her in the ‘90s. The decision whisked her and her 5-year-old son out of an abusive marriage in Mongolia, where there were no resources for victims of domestic violence. Haltarhuu now makes yearly trips to Mongolia to run free circus demos to start a conversation with village women and children about abuse. Chimgee Haltarhuu with the coach of the current “Mongolian Marvels”” Ringling saved my life,” she says. “We built a good life. I have a house, I have a good job and a good husband, so I’m really happy.” If attendees of the last-ever pre-show - when ticket holders are allowed onto the arena floor to mingle with the clowns, contortionists, dancers and BMX bikers - were paying attention, they might have noticed their hosts struggling to maintain their cheery disposition. They might have noticed that Ivan Vargas’ make-up is pooling in milky droplets on his chin. They might have seen that after the camel trainer cheerfully asked the audience to return to their seats, she rushes backstage in tears. Scattered all over the cavernous dressing room areas, performers are finding private corners to try to compose themselves. Outside on the floor it is impossible to tell anything is amiss. The Danguir high wire act is flawless. The Mongolian contortionists beam as they hang upside down from the backs of their camels. The audience gasps as an acrobat jumps rope 50 feet above the arena floor as the Wheel of Steel spins below his feet. Sanders’ lands safely, cradled in the huge black air bag one last time. Then comes Taba Maluenda’s tiger act. A burly, bald Chilean with a scar across one cheek, Maluenda is one of the only performers with his own microphone. It picks up a sob that escapes his throat as the 13 tigers watch curiously from their perches. He summons one of them down and buries his face in her fur. It’s their last time working together - though he’s raised some of the tigers since they were cubs, they don’t belong to him, and Feld is not disclosing where they are being sent. Maluenda thanks each tiger by name as they exit the caged ring. These guys put food on my table for 13 years.” Then he turns to his 19-year-old daughter Tabata, an assistant in the act who is standing on the other side of the cage door. She’s been on the Ringling Bros train since she was seven. “Tabata, I’m sorry for papa stayed and took care of these animals and forgetted about you,” he says. “That’s never gonna happen again - papa love you.” At the end of the act, he gets down on his knees and kisses the arena floor. As ringmaster Wilson closes out their final show with a rendition of Auld Lang Syne - an old, tour-ending tradition - the rest of the circus children come running onto the floor. Some clamber onto the trampolines with their acrobat parents, others are inconsolable. “We never say good-bye in the circus life, all we say is we’ll see you down the road,” Wilson booms into the microphone for the final time, doffing her glittering top hat. “So ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, thank you. We’ll see you down the road.” Monday morning in the train yard after the final performance is quiet, and there’s a sweet smelling breeze wafting off of a nearby bread factory. Parked all along the train are little cars, giant moving trucks, a pick-up truck whose bed is stacked with a unicycle and an APPLAUSE sign. Adam Craig, the owner of the pick-up, is driving his son Stephen, one of the clowns, back home to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. “If his career never went any further, to have done this would be the exclamation point on anybody else’s career,” says Craig, a granite countertop fabricator. “I remember how exciting it was the first day that we came out and saw the train.” A little girl walking a teensy chihuahua on a leash steps down from her train car. She’s followed by her mother, Irina Prostetsova, a second-generation circus dog trainer from Moscow who’s been with Ringling Bros for five years. Out of her big baggy costume, Prostetsova is dressed casual but chic. In the show her blonde hair is gelled straight up, now, it’s swept softly to one side of her face. For her, there is nothing to cry about today. It was my last performing day. I’m not a performer anymore. I took not one costume, not one prop, nothing.” Prostetsova has been performing in circuses since she was 11 years old. Her father and her brother also trained dogs for the circus. She was an acrobat as well. She married another circus performer, Alex Emelin, and together they and their 12 poodles came to the US to join Ringling. A year into their contract, Prostetsova and Emelin divorced.Despite the fact that they were in the worst throes of the break-up, they continued performing and travelling together with Ringling. Now, three years later, she says she and Emelin are friends again, but the end of the circus is the first time she’ll be able to live away from her ex-husband. “It’s a good thing,” she says. “Finally, I can start my new life.” She’s enrolled in a beauty school. She and her seven-year-old daughter Valentina are driving to Georgia, to close on a townhouse in a tiny city about 45 minutes from Atlanta. Prostetsova’s father and mother are joining them from Moscow - her mother has ALS, and is paralysed, a perilous condition in wintry Russia. Prostetsova and Emelin found homes for all 12 of their standard and miniature poodles. “No more performing for dogs,” says Prostetsova. “Guys gonna sit on the couch, and just go to the park, and just enjoy the life.” Her greatest hope is that Valentina does not become a circus performer. Maybe, she says, she could be a dentist. Prostetsova, Valentina, and their little dog Yumiko climb into a black SUV hitched to a U-Haul trailer and drive away. One by one, in cars and in taxis and moving vans, all 107 members of the Red Unit drive away from the train yard until it is empty. For some, they’re driving towards permanent addresses, towards apartments with full size stoves and refrigerators, to nine-to-five jobs and consistent wifi signals, toward high schools with homecomings and proms, utility bills and bathtubs instead of showers that suddenly - with an odd curve of the train tracks - tilt so far to the side that the water starts pooling and overflowing, and has to be bailed out the window. A quieter life. Ivan Vargas is joining a pirate-themed dinner theatre in Myrtle Beach called Pirates Voyage, where he’ll be learning to sword fight and stunt dive. The Wheel of Steel act is joining a circus in Spain. The Danguir high wire troupe are going back to Morocco, where they are semi-finalists on the Simon Cowell-produced TV show Arabs Got Talent. Nicole Sanders nearly signed a deal to do cannon in South Africa, but it fell apart at the last minute. She was offered a contract at a smaller American circus, but says the pay was less than minimum wage, with no health insurance. She turned it down. Performing, you know you’re not going to make a load of money, but you want to be able to survive.” She catches a flight to New Orleans, Louisiana, to stay with her mother while she figures out her next move. The last person at the train yard in Providence is ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson. She was hired to be Ringling Bros first female ringmaster, and had held the title for exactly one month when she found out that she would also be its last. Before being whisked into the national spotlight as the face of Circus XTREME, she’d been playing a ringmaster in a circus-themed dinner theatre in Orlando, Florida. She’s heading back to her hometown of Tallahassee without concrete plans for the future. With much groaning and shuddering, the train cars start moving down the track heading north, and slowly pick up speed. The bright red “RINGLING BROS AND BARNUM & BAILEY” banner stamped on the side of each car rolls past Wilson dozens and dozens of times. The Red Unit train will join the Blue Unit train in New Jersey in preparation for their final performance on 21 May in Uniondale, New York. Along the way, the cars that have been purchased at auction (minimum bid: $10,000) will be uncoupled and left behind to be picked up by their new owners. The Misers bought one that will be delivered to their cannonball training grounds in Peru, Indiana, and used as a guest house. At least one is destined to become a dinner train in Cincinnati, Ohio, albeit with the Ringling Bros name scraped off. What is left of the train will make the long, final journey south to the circus’ headquarters in Florida. Unsold cars will be scrapped for metal. The final car disappears over the horizon, the shrill squealing noises get tinier and tinier until they’re gone. An older man in a ball cap who was watching the departure approaches a sleep-deprived Wilson, who’s standing alone outside her moving truck with tears streaming down her face. “Excuse me,” he asks in a thick New England accent. “Are you the ringmaster?” Wilson answers simply, “Yeah,” and they both laugh joylessly. Long after the train has left the yard, Wilson lingers filming the tracks on her iPhone, pacing up and down the parking lot, and fretting because she forgot to thank the circus’ concession workers in her final speech. The sky is filling slowly with ominous dark clouds. Finally, she stops at the cab of her huge yellow moving truck. “It’s been amazing,” she sighs. “Time to get in this bad boy and figure out what I’m gonna do. “I’ll see you down the road.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.99947053
" The air inside of a 25 foot cannon is hot and smells like metal. It’s dark and loud, and the moments before a launch - even for an experienced human cannonball like 32-year-old “Nitro” Nicole Sanders - are filled with real fear. “There’s no feeling comfortable with it,” she says. The cannonball act is deceptively simple: a cannon large enough to fit a human inside its bore “shoots” an acrobat high into the air, and she lands in a net or an airbag. The mechanics of the cannon are a closely guarded secret, but it works with a combination of hydraulics and air pressure - there’s no gunpowder. The only explosion comes from some fireworks lit for show. The flight of the human cannonball at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus is over in just under three seconds, but the preparation takes days. It's up to the human cannonball to control her flight, to use her muscles in order to fly properly, to tumble safely, and land without injuring herself. Any mistake - if the cannon isn’t warmed up enough or Sanders’ footing is off - can cause a bad flight and an even worse landing. A 14-year-old girl named Zazel was the first to be shot out of a cannon, in 1877 London. In the 140 years since, the act’s safety has been vastly improved but never perfected. One circus historian estimated that 30 human cannonballs have died in performance accidents. The most recent death occurred in 2011. Like Zazel, Sanders is an acrobat and an aerialist by training. She is terrifically fit - each muscle must be pulled taut for the moment of launch. She can’t gain or lose too much weight, or else risk throwing off the cannon maker’s calculations with potentially disastrous results. On 7 May, in a downtown arena in Providence, Rhode Island, Sanders rides into the centre of the floor atop the bright red and gold cannon. In her civilian life she is tattooed and favours an all-black wardrobe, but in the show she’s dressed head to toe in a glittery silver jumpsuit. She grins and high-kicks and flourishes with her arms towards the sold-out crowd. As soon as she slides down into the mouth of the cannon, the smile drops. Sanders pulls into herself tightly and calls out to her shooter, Boris, that she’s ready. The ringmaster counts down from five, and with the cracking sound of fireworks, Sanders is launched high in the air, cresting at 40-feet and travelling roughly 66 miles per hour at a G-force of about seven, which is enough to knock out a fighter pilot in flight. She throws out her arms like wings, releasing two fistfuls of glitter. She turns in mid-air, touches her fingertips to her toes, then falls on her back into the airbag. This is when the adrenaline hits, as the crowd roars its approval. Just like she’d envisioned, everything goes perfectly. It is her 596th shot. It may also be her last. After 146 years, these are the final performances of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus, an American institution that was slowly brought to its knees by a combination of evolving cultural tastes, bad luck and political enemies that left it no longer financially viable for its parent company, Feld Entertainment. So, in addition to ignoring the 104-foot expanse of floor between the cannon mouth and the airbag, Sanders has had to force herself to stop thinking about the fact that she’s facing unemployment, the loss of her home, the disbanding of her tight-knit circus family, and the end of her dream job. I’m scrambling, kinda, to try and see what I want to do. This could be the end of my circus career.” A week earlier, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train clatters into Providence at dusk, making its final journey with passengers from the circus’ penultimate performances in Hartford, Connecticut. As soon as the silver cars stamped “GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH” come to a halt, Ivan Vargas, a sixth-generation circus performer from a long line of trapeze artists, clambers down into the muddy gravel. “I learned to walk on the train, my parents were living on the train when I was born,” he says, looking up and down the desolate train tracks. Here we are now, I just took my final train run.” They call it “the city without a zip code”. Sixty-one cars and a little over a mile long, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train is still the primary residence for most of the 107 performers and crew on the Red Unit, one of two remaining touring shows. There are 32 coaches divided into apartments of varying sizes, with as many as 16 people per car sleeping on narrow bunks. The youngest children sleep in the same car with their parents. Some of the families even keep cats and dogs. There is a single, six-table “Pie Car” with a fully functional kitchen staffed 24-hours-a-day when the train is in motion. Performers can shimmy down the razor-thin hallways that connect the cars, order a slab of meatloaf or a slice of pie, and watch the only continuously functioning TV. There is a shop car and a generator car, and 19 flatbeds filled with vehicles, costumes, equipment and tiger toys. The train is followed by a caravan of RVs and trucks ferrying the animals - seven camels, three ponies, 18 tigers, 12 poodles, plus horses, snakes, and goats. The production members hail from 13 different countries including Mongolia, Hungary, Russia, China, and Chile. All the show’s music is performed live, so a full band travels along, as well as a lighting and pyrotechnics crew, a team of veterinarians, vendor and concessions workers, the costume and wardrobe staff, the pie car chefs, interpreters and - at certain times - even a travelling circus ministry. By the time it pulls into Providence, the train had travelled 50,000 miles and visited 83 cities in the two-year tour, titled Circus XTREME. Vargas, 26, whose family is originally from Mexico, was born in between Sunday performances. His father - a trapeze artist - attended the birth while still in costume. Vargas was two years old the first time he got on a trapeze, and 14 the first time he performed in a Ringling Bros show, as an acrobat.

But after she got her dream job with Cirque du Soleil and left the tour, the young couple who fell in love by spending 24 hours a day together on the train were unable to sustain the relationship on two weeks a year together. They divorced a year ago. We live so fast, it’s the way that it works.” “I’ve known people who literally come from different backgrounds, different cultures and countries, they don’t know each other. By the end of the tour they’ll be married and have a child already.” In the summer of 2016, for instance, Moroccan high wire walker Mustafa Danguir married Russian juggler Anna Lebedeva in a ceremony performed at the centre of a wire the width of a human thumb. The groom rode in on a camel, the bride did the splits at the “altar” 30 feet in the air. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus. The rise of television, movies, the internet and mobile phones has been siphoning off Ringling’s audience for decades, and the brand sustained irreparable damage during the animal rights movement that began in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Feld Entertainment has famously done battle with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, winning a $25m lawsuit against a group who claimed Ringling’s elephants were being abused. However, they’ve also been investigated and had to pay hefty fines to the US Department of Agriculture over various animal mistreatment allegations. Legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams Public opinion on captive exotic animals shifted, and changes in local laws were making it increasingly difficult to bring the elephants to different markets - cities and then entire states like California and Rhode Island banned the use of bullhooks on elephants, a tool the circus claims is for guiding and training, and which animal rights activists say is an implement of torture. The city of Asheville, North Carolina, banned the display of any exotic animal in its municipally-owned arena. Vargas was a clown on the Gold Unit, a third arm of the travelling tours of the circus, the year before Feld shut it down in 2015. The number of people in the remaining two units, Red and Blue, started to shrink. And in each city, the performers were met with crowds of angry animal rights protesters, and smaller and smaller audiences. In 2016, Feld yielded to public pressure, and the last 11 elephants on tour were transferred to a Florida preserve owned by the Felds. Vargas’ father and 65 others lost their jobs as elephant caretakers. (Some, like Vargas’ father, stayed on to care for the other animals or went to work at the Florida facility.) In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus.

In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. The final blow was delivered on 14 January, 2017, late one night after the last in a “six pack” of performances in Orlando, Florida. Posters printed in English, Portuguese, Ukrainian and Mongolian had gone up earlier in the day announcing a mysterious, mandatory all-staff meeting. There was speculation amongst the performers that the two units might be folded together, or that the rest of the animals would be leaving the tour. So when Feld Entertainment executives delivered the news that the circus was shutting down completely, it landed hard. “You watched hundreds of people burst into tears at the same time,” recalls ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson, Ringling Bros’ first female ringmaster. She had just given up her job, apartment and car to join the circus four months earlier. But the show had to go on. “The next day, we came in and did two more shows.” The five months leading up to the final performances haven’t been easy. Feld set up career counsellors at each stop. One by one, performers who found new gigs dropped off the tour. Foreign performers without new jobs will lose their work visas shortly after the final show, and the Felds are covering plane tickets and reimbursing mileage for road trips home. But it’s not all bad. The last days of the circus found screaming animal rights protesters replaced with sold-out crowds and teary fans. Well-wishers post themselves along the train tracks, sometimes waiting hours with hand-painted signs, hoping to catch a glimpse of the ringmaster waving from the vestibule one last time. For Vargas, the end of the circus is the end of the only way of life he’s ever known. On their day off before the start of performances in Providence, he heads to the local mall after a cursory and futile effort to pack up his train car. Over milkshakes and tater tots at Johnny Rockets, he says he couldn’t stand seeing the removal trucks and dumpsters lined up beside the train. I needed to do something normal, I just want to walk around and kind of be a person.” He wanders around with his 18-year-old cousin Tristan, the sole member of the final class of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey high school. Tristan will graduate that evening at the end-of-tour cast party, dressed in a red cap and gown with the circus insignia on it. They bump into other clowns, a BMX rider, some of the crew, the tiger trainer and his seven-year-old son, Gunther, named after the legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams. In their street clothes, they all look just like ordinary people. That Sunday, the performers wake up and log on to social media to mark the last day in the circus. “Worst. Day. Ever,” writes band trombonist Megan O’Malley, along with a picture of her completely empty room on the train. “The final time putting on my RBBB Circus Xtreme makeup,” Ivan Vargas captions an Instagram photo of himself. The Red Unit gathers for a final circus mass, and a prayer from Circus and Travelling Show Ministries’ Father Francis Cancro: Bless with your holy light concession workers, floor crews, transportation crews and office workers and all who make the world of the circus a reality by their labour. Bless those who manifested beauty through the use of their gifts and talents as they walk, run, jump and fly across the sky. Send your angels as their protection. Circus alumni begin descending on Providence, including dozens of retired clowns and showgirls. Brian and Tina Miser, married cannonball coaches who mentored Sanders, arrive with their 13-year-old daughter. Skyler has already been shot out of a miniature, 8-foot cannon built by her father. She will never realise her dream to become a Ringling Bros cannonball. Chimgee Haltarhuu, a former acrobat with the Mongolian State Circus, flies in from her home in Minnesota where she now teaches a circus school. She wants to personally thank Feld Entertainment chief executive Kenneth Feld for hiring her in the ‘90s. The decision whisked her and her 5-year-old son out of an abusive marriage in Mongolia, where there were no resources for victims of domestic violence. Haltarhuu now makes yearly trips to Mongolia to run free circus demos to start a conversation with village women and children about abuse. Chimgee Haltarhuu with the coach of the current “Mongolian Marvels”” Ringling saved my life,” she says. “We built a good life. I have a house, I have a good job and a good husband, so I’m really happy.” If attendees of the last-ever pre-show - when ticket holders are allowed onto the arena floor to mingle with the clowns, contortionists, dancers and BMX bikers - were paying attention, they might have noticed their hosts struggling to maintain their cheery disposition. They might have noticed that Ivan Vargas’ make-up is pooling in milky droplets on his chin. They might have seen that after the camel trainer cheerfully asked the audience to return to their seats, she rushes backstage in tears. Scattered all over the cavernous dressing room areas, performers are finding private corners to try to compose themselves. Outside on the floor it is impossible to tell anything is amiss. The Danguir high wire act is flawless. The Mongolian contortionists beam as they hang upside down from the backs of their camels. The audience gasps as an acrobat jumps rope 50 feet above the arena floor as the Wheel of Steel spins below his feet. Sanders’ lands safely, cradled in the huge black air bag one last time. Then comes Taba Maluenda’s tiger act. A burly, bald Chilean with a scar across one cheek, Maluenda is one of the only performers with his own microphone. It picks up a sob that escapes his throat as the 13 tigers watch curiously from their perches. He summons one of them down and buries his face in her fur. It’s their last time working together - though he’s raised some of the tigers since they were cubs, they don’t belong to him, and Feld is not disclosing where they are being sent. Maluenda thanks each tiger by name as they exit the caged ring. These guys put food on my table for 13 years.” Then he turns to his 19-year-old daughter Tabata, an assistant in the act who is standing on the other side of the cage door. She’s been on the Ringling Bros train since she was seven. “Tabata, I’m sorry for papa stayed and took care of these animals and forgetted about you,” he says. “That’s never gonna happen again - papa love you.” At the end of the act, he gets down on his knees and kisses the arena floor. As ringmaster Wilson closes out their final show with a rendition of Auld Lang Syne - an old, tour-ending tradition - the rest of the circus children come running onto the floor. Some clamber onto the trampolines with their acrobat parents, others are inconsolable. “We never say good-bye in the circus life, all we say is we’ll see you down the road,” Wilson booms into the microphone for the final time, doffing her glittering top hat. “So ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, thank you. We’ll see you down the road.” Monday morning in the train yard after the final performance is quiet, and there’s a sweet smelling breeze wafting off of a nearby bread factory. Parked all along the train are little cars, giant moving trucks, a pick-up truck whose bed is stacked with a unicycle and an APPLAUSE sign. Adam Craig, the owner of the pick-up, is driving his son Stephen, one of the clowns, back home to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. “If his career never went any further, to have done this would be the exclamation point on anybody else’s career,” says Craig, a granite countertop fabricator. “I remember how exciting it was the first day that we came out and saw the train.” A little girl walking a teensy chihuahua on a leash steps down from her train car. She’s followed by her mother, Irina Prostetsova, a second-generation circus dog trainer from Moscow who’s been with Ringling Bros for five years. Out of her big baggy costume, Prostetsova is dressed casual but chic. In the show her blonde hair is gelled straight up, now, it’s swept softly to one side of her face. For her, there is nothing to cry about today. It was my last performing day. I’m not a performer anymore. I took not one costume, not one prop, nothing.” Prostetsova has been performing in circuses since she was 11 years old. Her father and her brother also trained dogs for the circus. She was an acrobat as well. She married another circus performer, Alex Emelin, and together they and their 12 poodles came to the US to join Ringling. A year into their contract, Prostetsova and Emelin divorced.Despite the fact that they were in the worst throes of the break-up, they continued performing and travelling together with Ringling. Now, three years later, she says she and Emelin are friends again, but the end of the circus is the first time she’ll be able to live away from her ex-husband. “It’s a good thing,” she says. “Finally, I can start my new life.” She’s enrolled in a beauty school. She and her seven-year-old daughter Valentina are driving to Georgia, to close on a townhouse in a tiny city about 45 minutes from Atlanta. Prostetsova’s father and mother are joining them from Moscow - her mother has ALS, and is paralysed, a perilous condition in wintry Russia. Prostetsova and Emelin found homes for all 12 of their standard and miniature poodles. “No more performing for dogs,” says Prostetsova. “Guys gonna sit on the couch, and just go to the park, and just enjoy the life.” Her greatest hope is that Valentina does not become a circus performer. Maybe, she says, she could be a dentist. Prostetsova, Valentina, and their little dog Yumiko climb into a black SUV hitched to a U-Haul trailer and drive away. One by one, in cars and in taxis and moving vans, all 107 members of the Red Unit drive away from the train yard until it is empty. For some, they’re driving towards permanent addresses, towards apartments with full size stoves and refrigerators, to nine-to-five jobs and consistent wifi signals, toward high schools with homecomings and proms, utility bills and bathtubs instead of showers that suddenly - with an odd curve of the train tracks - tilt so far to the side that the water starts pooling and overflowing, and has to be bailed out the window. A quieter life. Ivan Vargas is joining a pirate-themed dinner theatre in Myrtle Beach called Pirates Voyage, where he’ll be learning to sword fight and stunt dive. The Wheel of Steel act is joining a circus in Spain. The Danguir high wire troupe are going back to Morocco, where they are semi-finalists on the Simon Cowell-produced TV show Arabs Got Talent. Nicole Sanders nearly signed a deal to do cannon in South Africa, but it fell apart at the last minute. She was offered a contract at a smaller American circus, but says the pay was less than minimum wage, with no health insurance. She turned it down. Performing, you know you’re not going to make a load of money, but you want to be able to survive.” She catches a flight to New Orleans, Louisiana, to stay with her mother while she figures out her next move. The last person at the train yard in Providence is ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson. She was hired to be Ringling Bros first female ringmaster, and had held the title for exactly one month when she found out that she would also be its last. Before being whisked into the national spotlight as the face of Circus XTREME, she’d been playing a ringmaster in a circus-themed dinner theatre in Orlando, Florida. She’s heading back to her hometown of Tallahassee without concrete plans for the future. With much groaning and shuddering, the train cars start moving down the track heading north, and slowly pick up speed. The bright red “RINGLING BROS AND BARNUM & BAILEY” banner stamped on the side of each car rolls past Wilson dozens and dozens of times. The Red Unit train will join the Blue Unit train in New Jersey in preparation for their final performance on 21 May in Uniondale, New York. Along the way, the cars that have been purchased at auction (minimum bid: $10,000) will be uncoupled and left behind to be picked up by their new owners. The Misers bought one that will be delivered to their cannonball training grounds in Peru, Indiana, and used as a guest house. At least one is destined to become a dinner train in Cincinnati, Ohio, albeit with the Ringling Bros name scraped off. What is left of the train will make the long, final journey south to the circus’ headquarters in Florida. Unsold cars will be scrapped for metal. The final car disappears over the horizon, the shrill squealing noises get tinier and tinier until they’re gone. An older man in a ball cap who was watching the departure approaches a sleep-deprived Wilson, who’s standing alone outside her moving truck with tears streaming down her face. “Excuse me,” he asks in a thick New England accent. “Are you the ringmaster?” Wilson answers simply, “Yeah,” and they both laugh joylessly. Long after the train has left the yard, Wilson lingers filming the tracks on her iPhone, pacing up and down the parking lot, and fretting because she forgot to thank the circus’ concession workers in her final speech. The sky is filling slowly with ominous dark clouds. Finally, she stops at the cab of her huge yellow moving truck. “It’s been amazing,” she sighs. “Time to get in this bad boy and figure out what I’m gonna do. “I’ll see you down the road.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.0006933896
"Travellers can make some money by becoming informal couriers The next time you take an international flight, how about transporting something in your suitcase for a complete stranger? If your answer to that question is a resounding ""no way"", and the very thought conjures up terrifying images of unwitting drug mules and long prison sentences, you might need to think again. ""I always take things back from my travels for family and friends,"" says 45-year-old French airline worker Olivier Kaba. ""Now not only am I able to bring things for others, but I get rewarded financially for doing it. ""In the past two years I have made about 1,000 euros ($1,100; Â£860)."" Olivier is a regular user of Worldcraze, one of three similar firms that have launched in recent years to help connect people who would like to buy something from a different country, with travellers who have spare space in their suitcase and want to make a bit of money by being informal couriers. There are some products that ex-pats just cannot live without The idea is that the buyer can quickly get his or her hands on a product that may not be available to buy or import where he or she lives (country A), or that the item may simply be a lot cheaper abroad (country B). So with transactions made via the three companies' websites and apps, travellers who are due to fly from country B to country A can purchase and transport the products for the buyers. They can then arrange to meet to hand them over. Over the past 24 months Olivier says he has transported everything from three months' supply of French salami to the US, bags of Japanese sweets called ""Tokyo banana"", and 20kg of fabric samples for a woman starting her own business. ""I discover new products I have never heard of,"" he says. Worldcraze was launched in 2012 by French entrepreneurs Frederic Simons and Guillaume Cayard. Olivier Kaba makes about 500 euros a year transporting goods via Worldcraze On a trip to New York Frederic noticed a large price difference between Levi's jeans in France and the US, and the idea was born. Today Worldcraze says it has 10,000 users, with Apple products being the most frequently delivered items. From each transaction Worldcraze takes â¬2.50 from the buyer, and 10% of the traveller's payment, which is up to 10% of the cost of the product being transported. Singapore-based Ouibring has a similar business model. Founded in 2016 by developers Joel Gordon and Andrew Crosio, they say that one Ouibring delivery is now made every day on average. Goods delivered so far include artisan coffee from Japan to Hungary, a baby carrier from Thailand to the US, a candle carried from India, and a room spray from Singapore to the Czech Republic. Joel Gordon says Ouibring flags any inappropriate requests ""For shoppers this is a way of getting previously unavailable products, full stop,"" says Joel. ""For bringers [the travellers who deliver the items] it's about making some money, and meeting interesting people who appreciate the effort, and can share tips for exploring the place you're visiting, or the next step on your journey."" To remove the risk of illegal or counterfeit products being transported both Ouibring and Worldcraze only allow users to buy and collect new products from legitimate shops. Worldcraze's chief marketing officer Constance Claviez Homberg says: ""Our users can't buy illegal products because they are buying products directly in shops. ""That way it is just impossible to carry illegal stuff, or counterfeit products. [And] travellers have to upload the product's bill on our platform to prove that the product is congruent."" Worldcraze helped one man buy a hockey stick from overseas The company also advises users to check on whether the item in question is legal in the destination country, and has staff that check out requests made on its website and app every day. Ouibring's Joel Gordon says that it also has a ""moderation system"" which ""flags requests that may be inappropriate, and we remove requests if required"". He says that the company also advises users that if they are unsure about anything they should get in touch via its secure contact form ""and we'll get back to you asap"". ""We are happy to provide advice for travellers for specific questions,"" says Joel. ""At the end of the day, it is the individual traveller's responsibility to ensure they comply with the relevant laws of the country they are travelling to."" Mumbai-based Beck Friends, another firm that enables travellers to transport goods for other people, doesn't limit people to purchasing new items. Instead a traveller recently transported a much-loved teddy bear from Chicago to Mumbai after its owner, a four-year-old girl called Heer, left it behind. Beck Friends helped reunite Heer and her bear Teddy To remove any security concerns, the buyer and carrier have to be first connected on social media, such as on Facebook, LinkedIn or Google+. Users must also upload two valid forms of identification, such as a passport and driving licence. Beck co-founder Deep Malhotra says: ""Security is the prime concern, and we are building a robust platform to address this."" Where things get more complicated is the issue of export and import tariffs, which vary greatly from country to country. All three companies say they advise users on this, and it is the buyer who ultimately has to pay any charges. If any traveller is unsure of something, or gets into any difficulties, all three companies say they have support staff available around the clock to help, be it via telephone, live web chat or email. Ouibring's Joel Gordon says that he doesn't think security or customs worries will hold back the growth of his company. ""Our vision is to become another part of daily international life, like Airbnb, with people all around the world helping to make transport, logistics and travel work together better.""

" The air inside of a 25 foot cannon is hot and smells like metal. It’s dark and loud, and the moments before a launch - even for an experienced human cannonball like 32-year-old “Nitro” Nicole Sanders - are filled with real fear. “There’s no feeling comfortable with it,” she says. The cannonball act is deceptively simple: a cannon large enough to fit a human inside its bore “shoots” an acrobat high into the air, and she lands in a net or an airbag. The mechanics of the cannon are a closely guarded secret, but it works with a combination of hydraulics and air pressure - there’s no gunpowder. The only explosion comes from some fireworks lit for show. The flight of the human cannonball at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus is over in just under three seconds, but the preparation takes days. It's up to the human cannonball to control her flight, to use her muscles in order to fly properly, to tumble safely, and land without injuring herself. Any mistake - if the cannon isn’t warmed up enough or Sanders’ footing is off - can cause a bad flight and an even worse landing. A 14-year-old girl named Zazel was the first to be shot out of a cannon, in 1877 London. In the 140 years since, the act’s safety has been vastly improved but never perfected. One circus historian estimated that 30 human cannonballs have died in performance accidents. The most recent death occurred in 2011. Like Zazel, Sanders is an acrobat and an aerialist by training. She is terrifically fit - each muscle must be pulled taut for the moment of launch. She can’t gain or lose too much weight, or else risk throwing off the cannon maker’s calculations with potentially disastrous results. On 7 May, in a downtown arena in Providence, Rhode Island, Sanders rides into the centre of the floor atop the bright red and gold cannon. In her civilian life she is tattooed and favours an all-black wardrobe, but in the show she’s dressed head to toe in a glittery silver jumpsuit. She grins and high-kicks and flourishes with her arms towards the sold-out crowd. As soon as she slides down into the mouth of the cannon, the smile drops. Sanders pulls into herself tightly and calls out to her shooter, Boris, that she’s ready. The ringmaster counts down from five, and with the cracking sound of fireworks, Sanders is launched high in the air, cresting at 40-feet and travelling roughly 66 miles per hour at a G-force of about seven, which is enough to knock out a fighter pilot in flight. She throws out her arms like wings, releasing two fistfuls of glitter. She turns in mid-air, touches her fingertips to her toes, then falls on her back into the airbag. This is when the adrenaline hits, as the crowd roars its approval. Just like she’d envisioned, everything goes perfectly. It is her 596th shot. It may also be her last. After 146 years, these are the final performances of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus, an American institution that was slowly brought to its knees by a combination of evolving cultural tastes, bad luck and political enemies that left it no longer financially viable for its parent company, Feld Entertainment. So, in addition to ignoring the 104-foot expanse of floor between the cannon mouth and the airbag, Sanders has had to force herself to stop thinking about the fact that she’s facing unemployment, the loss of her home, the disbanding of her tight-knit circus family, and the end of her dream job. I’m scrambling, kinda, to try and see what I want to do. This could be the end of my circus career.” A week earlier, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train clatters into Providence at dusk, making its final journey with passengers from the circus’ penultimate performances in Hartford, Connecticut. As soon as the silver cars stamped “GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH” come to a halt, Ivan Vargas, a sixth-generation circus performer from a long line of trapeze artists, clambers down into the muddy gravel. “I learned to walk on the train, my parents were living on the train when I was born,” he says, looking up and down the desolate train tracks. Here we are now, I just took my final train run.” They call it “the city without a zip code”. Sixty-one cars and a little over a mile long, the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey train is still the primary residence for most of the 107 performers and crew on the Red Unit, one of two remaining touring shows. There are 32 coaches divided into apartments of varying sizes, with as many as 16 people per car sleeping on narrow bunks. The youngest children sleep in the same car with their parents. Some of the families even keep cats and dogs. There is a single, six-table “Pie Car” with a fully functional kitchen staffed 24-hours-a-day when the train is in motion. Performers can shimmy down the razor-thin hallways that connect the cars, order a slab of meatloaf or a slice of pie, and watch the only continuously functioning TV. There is a shop car and a generator car, and 19 flatbeds filled with vehicles, costumes, equipment and tiger toys. The train is followed by a caravan of RVs and trucks ferrying the animals - seven camels, three ponies, 18 tigers, 12 poodles, plus horses, snakes, and goats. The production members hail from 13 different countries including Mongolia, Hungary, Russia, China, and Chile. All the show’s music is performed live, so a full band travels along, as well as a lighting and pyrotechnics crew, a team of veterinarians, vendor and concessions workers, the costume and wardrobe staff, the pie car chefs, interpreters and - at certain times - even a travelling circus ministry. By the time it pulls into Providence, the train had travelled 50,000 miles and visited 83 cities in the two-year tour, titled Circus XTREME. Vargas, 26, whose family is originally from Mexico, was born in between Sunday performances. His father - a trapeze artist - attended the birth while still in costume. Vargas was two years old the first time he got on a trapeze, and 14 the first time he performed in a Ringling Bros show, as an acrobat. When he turned 18, he became a clown, with his own train car room. To me it’s the best way to travel across the country. You take your small apartment with you. You step out on the vestibules and watch the country go by.” Ringling Bros is the last American circus that travels by rail, a tradition that began in the 1830s. In 1872, the showman Phineas T Barnum loaded his brand new circus on to the rails for the first time. By the time of his death, Barnum and his partner James Bailey had grown the show into a multi-ringed kaleidoscopic extravaganza of exotic animals, acrobats and strongmen, contortionists and sword-swallowers, and the train had become as iconic as the circus itself. “They would literally shut towns down when they arrived. Months in advance people knew it was coming,” says Janet Davis, a professor of American studies and history, and author of The Circus Age. “Schools cancelled their classes, factories shut their doors.” Five Wisconsin brothers named Ringling bought the Barnum & Bailey circus after its founders died, and in 1919, Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey debuted as a single show. Life on the circus train in the early days was exciting, seedy, and dangerous. “Love always seemed on the mind of circus folk, although given the cramped quarters, liaisons often took place in lumberyards, warehouses, or even, in extremis, ditches,” wrote photographer Loomis Dean, who travelled on the train as a circus employee. Terrible, unimaginable things happened in [the labourers’] cars, everything from fights to killings.” Courtesy of Circus World Museum This was also the heyday of the freakshow, invented by Barnum and perpetuated by Ringling. “Long, long before we thought about the animals being exploited it was common to exploit people like African Americans and differently abled people,” says Beth Macy, the author of Truevine, the story of two African-American albino brothers from Virginia who were snatched from their home and placed in the circus. Ringling purchased them in 1923. The brothers were first marketed as “Barnum’s monkey men”, then, after their blonde dreadlocks grew out, “Ambassadors from Mars”. It took 13 years for their mother to rescue them and bring them home. In 1956, the last of the circus-owning Ringlings, John Ringling North, announced that the circus would no longer perform under the canvas big top, nicknamed “Big Bertha”, but in brick and mortar arenas. It was a cost-cutting measure, but also seen as punishment for workers who’d attempted to unionise. Hundreds of “canvasmen” who set up and tore down the big top lost their jobs overnight. About a decade later, Irvin and Israel Feld - music promoters who worked with Chubby Checker, Fats Domino, and Paul Anka - bought the circus for $8m (£6.2m) with the help of investors. One of Irvin’s first acts as owner was to end the freakshow. Throughout its changing owners and acts in the constant pursuit of the new and novel, the one thing that remained constant was the train. Ivan Vargas, like generations of circus kids before him, first lived on the train with his parents, and attended school in the travelling classroom that set up amongst the dressing rooms at every stop along the tour. He had two teachers, one to shepherd him through grade school, another for high school, along with the other handful of children who spent 11 months out of the year on tour with their parents. He was not allowed to perform unless he went to class, which often took place in between shows. Sometimes Vargas wondered what it might be like to join the ranks of the “townies” - circus slang for non-circus people. I thought about how I would fit in being in a public school or going to a prom,” Ivan breaks down at the close of the final performance He continues, “but it never crossed my mind that I want to leave the show to go experience this. To me, I would never trade in the circus for anything.” He was married for a time, to a Ukrainian performer who came onto the unit in 2008. They fell in love as an 18-year-old Vargas introduced her to American malls and movies along the train route. But after she got her dream job with Cirque du Soleil and left the tour, the young couple who fell in love by spending 24 hours a day together on the train were unable to sustain the relationship on two weeks a year together. They divorced a year ago. We live so fast, it’s the way that it works.” “I’ve known people who literally come from different backgrounds, different cultures and countries, they don’t know each other. By the end of the tour they’ll be married and have a child already.” In the summer of 2016, for instance, Moroccan high wire walker Mustafa Danguir married Russian juggler Anna Lebedeva in a ceremony performed at the centre of a wire the width of a human thumb. The groom rode in on a camel, the bride did the splits at the “altar” 30 feet in the air. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus. The rise of television, movies, the internet and mobile phones has been siphoning off Ringling’s audience for decades, and the brand sustained irreparable damage during the animal rights movement that began in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Feld Entertainment has famously done battle with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, winning a $25m lawsuit against a group who claimed Ringling’s elephants were being abused. However, they’ve also been investigated and had to pay hefty fines to the US Department of Agriculture over various animal mistreatment allegations. Legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams Public opinion on captive exotic animals shifted, and changes in local laws were making it increasingly difficult to bring the elephants to different markets - cities and then entire states like California and Rhode Island banned the use of bullhooks on elephants, a tool the circus claims is for guiding and training, and which animal rights activists say is an implement of torture. The city of Asheville, North Carolina, banned the display of any exotic animal in its municipally-owned arena. Vargas was a clown on the Gold Unit, a third arm of the travelling tours of the circus, the year before Feld shut it down in 2015. The number of people in the remaining two units, Red and Blue, started to shrink. And in each city, the performers were met with crowds of angry animal rights protesters, and smaller and smaller audiences. In 2016, Feld yielded to public pressure, and the last 11 elephants on tour were transferred to a Florida preserve owned by the Felds. Vargas’ father and 65 others lost their jobs as elephant caretakers. (Some, like Vargas’ father, stayed on to care for the other animals or went to work at the Florida facility.) In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. Vargas also witnessed signs that not all was well with the circus.

In the year since the elephants left, Feld says circus attendance dropped precipitously. The final blow was delivered on 14 January, 2017, late one night after the last in a “six pack” of performances in Orlando, Florida. Posters printed in English, Portuguese, Ukrainian and Mongolian had gone up earlier in the day announcing a mysterious, mandatory all-staff meeting. There was speculation amongst the performers that the two units might be folded together, or that the rest of the animals would be leaving the tour. So when Feld Entertainment executives delivered the news that the circus was shutting down completely, it landed hard. “You watched hundreds of people burst into tears at the same time,” recalls ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson, Ringling Bros’ first female ringmaster. She had just given up her job, apartment and car to join the circus four months earlier. But the show had to go on. “The next day, we came in and did two more shows.” The five months leading up to the final performances haven’t been easy. Feld set up career counsellors at each stop. One by one, performers who found new gigs dropped off the tour. Foreign performers without new jobs will lose their work visas shortly after the final show, and the Felds are covering plane tickets and reimbursing mileage for road trips home. But it’s not all bad. The last days of the circus found screaming animal rights protesters replaced with sold-out crowds and teary fans. Well-wishers post themselves along the train tracks, sometimes waiting hours with hand-painted signs, hoping to catch a glimpse of the ringmaster waving from the vestibule one last time. For Vargas, the end of the circus is the end of the only way of life he’s ever known. On their day off before the start of performances in Providence, he heads to the local mall after a cursory and futile effort to pack up his train car. Over milkshakes and tater tots at Johnny Rockets, he says he couldn’t stand seeing the removal trucks and dumpsters lined up beside the train. I needed to do something normal, I just want to walk around and kind of be a person.” He wanders around with his 18-year-old cousin Tristan, the sole member of the final class of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey high school. Tristan will graduate that evening at the end-of-tour cast party, dressed in a red cap and gown with the circus insignia on it. They bump into other clowns, a BMX rider, some of the crew, the tiger trainer and his seven-year-old son, Gunther, named after the legendary Ringling Bros big cat and elephant trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams. In their street clothes, they all look just like ordinary people. That Sunday, the performers wake up and log on to social media to mark the last day in the circus. “Worst. Day. Ever,” writes band trombonist Megan O’Malley, along with a picture of her completely empty room on the train. “The final time putting on my RBBB Circus Xtreme makeup,” Ivan Vargas captions an Instagram photo of himself. The Red Unit gathers for a final circus mass, and a prayer from Circus and Travelling Show Ministries’ Father Francis Cancro: Bless with your holy light concession workers, floor crews, transportation crews and office workers and all who make the world of the circus a reality by their labour. Bless those who manifested beauty through the use of their gifts and talents as they walk, run, jump and fly across the sky. Send your angels as their protection. Circus alumni begin descending on Providence, including dozens of retired clowns and showgirls. Brian and Tina Miser, married cannonball coaches who mentored Sanders, arrive with their 13-year-old daughter. Skyler has already been shot out of a miniature, 8-foot cannon built by her father. She will never realise her dream to become a Ringling Bros cannonball. Chimgee Haltarhuu, a former acrobat with the Mongolian State Circus, flies in from her home in Minnesota where she now teaches a circus school. She wants to personally thank Feld Entertainment chief executive Kenneth Feld for hiring her in the ‘90s. The decision whisked her and her 5-year-old son out of an abusive marriage in Mongolia, where there were no resources for victims of domestic violence. Haltarhuu now makes yearly trips to Mongolia to run free circus demos to start a conversation with village women and children about abuse. Chimgee Haltarhuu with the coach of the current “Mongolian Marvels”” Ringling saved my life,” she says. “We built a good life. I have a house, I have a good job and a good husband, so I’m really happy.” If attendees of the last-ever pre-show - when ticket holders are allowed onto the arena floor to mingle with the clowns, contortionists, dancers and BMX bikers - were paying attention, they might have noticed their hosts struggling to maintain their cheery disposition. They might have noticed that Ivan Vargas’ make-up is pooling in milky droplets on his chin. They might have seen that after the camel trainer cheerfully asked the audience to return to their seats, she rushes backstage in tears. Scattered all over the cavernous dressing room areas, performers are finding private corners to try to compose themselves. Outside on the floor it is impossible to tell anything is amiss. The Danguir high wire act is flawless. The Mongolian contortionists beam as they hang upside down from the backs of their camels. The audience gasps as an acrobat jumps rope 50 feet above the arena floor as the Wheel of Steel spins below his feet. Sanders’ lands safely, cradled in the huge black air bag one last time. Then comes Taba Maluenda’s tiger act. A burly, bald Chilean with a scar across one cheek, Maluenda is one of the only performers with his own microphone. It picks up a sob that escapes his throat as the 13 tigers watch curiously from their perches. He summons one of them down and buries his face in her fur. It’s their last time working together - though he’s raised some of the tigers since they were cubs, they don’t belong to him, and Feld is not disclosing where they are being sent. Maluenda thanks each tiger by name as they exit the caged ring. These guys put food on my table for 13 years.” Then he turns to his 19-year-old daughter Tabata, an assistant in the act who is standing on the other side of the cage door. She’s been on the Ringling Bros train since she was seven. “Tabata, I’m sorry for papa stayed and took care of these animals and forgetted about you,” he says. “That’s never gonna happen again - papa love you.” At the end of the act, he gets down on his knees and kisses the arena floor. As ringmaster Wilson closes out their final show with a rendition of Auld Lang Syne - an old, tour-ending tradition - the rest of the circus children come running onto the floor. Some clamber onto the trampolines with their acrobat parents, others are inconsolable. “We never say good-bye in the circus life, all we say is we’ll see you down the road,” Wilson booms into the microphone for the final time, doffing her glittering top hat. “So ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, thank you. We’ll see you down the road.” Monday morning in the train yard after the final performance is quiet, and there’s a sweet smelling breeze wafting off of a nearby bread factory. Parked all along the train are little cars, giant moving trucks, a pick-up truck whose bed is stacked with a unicycle and an APPLAUSE sign. Adam Craig, the owner of the pick-up, is driving his son Stephen, one of the clowns, back home to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. “If his career never went any further, to have done this would be the exclamation point on anybody else’s career,” says Craig, a granite countertop fabricator. “I remember how exciting it was the first day that we came out and saw the train.” A little girl walking a teensy chihuahua on a leash steps down from her train car. She’s followed by her mother, Irina Prostetsova, a second-generation circus dog trainer from Moscow who’s been with Ringling Bros for five years. Out of her big baggy costume, Prostetsova is dressed casual but chic. In the show her blonde hair is gelled straight up, now, it’s swept softly to one side of her face. For her, there is nothing to cry about today. It was my last performing day. I’m not a performer anymore. I took not one costume, not one prop, nothing.” Prostetsova has been performing in circuses since she was 11 years old. Her father and her brother also trained dogs for the circus. She was an acrobat as well. She married another circus performer, Alex Emelin, and together they and their 12 poodles came to the US to join Ringling. A year into their contract, Prostetsova and Emelin divorced.Despite the fact that they were in the worst throes of the break-up, they continued performing and travelling together with Ringling. Now, three years later, she says she and Emelin are friends again, but the end of the circus is the first time she’ll be able to live away from her ex-husband. “It’s a good thing,” she says. “Finally, I can start my new life.” She’s enrolled in a beauty school. She and her seven-year-old daughter Valentina are driving to Georgia, to close on a townhouse in a tiny city about 45 minutes from Atlanta. Prostetsova’s father and mother are joining them from Moscow - her mother has ALS, and is paralysed, a perilous condition in wintry Russia. Prostetsova and Emelin found homes for all 12 of their standard and miniature poodles. “No more performing for dogs,” says Prostetsova. “Guys gonna sit on the couch, and just go to the park, and just enjoy the life.” Her greatest hope is that Valentina does not become a circus performer. Maybe, she says, she could be a dentist. Prostetsova, Valentina, and their little dog Yumiko climb into a black SUV hitched to a U-Haul trailer and drive away. One by one, in cars and in taxis and moving vans, all 107 members of the Red Unit drive away from the train yard until it is empty. For some, they’re driving towards permanent addresses, towards apartments with full size stoves and refrigerators, to nine-to-five jobs and consistent wifi signals, toward high schools with homecomings and proms, utility bills and bathtubs instead of showers that suddenly - with an odd curve of the train tracks - tilt so far to the side that the water starts pooling and overflowing, and has to be bailed out the window. A quieter life. Ivan Vargas is joining a pirate-themed dinner theatre in Myrtle Beach called Pirates Voyage, where he’ll be learning to sword fight and stunt dive. The Wheel of Steel act is joining a circus in Spain. The Danguir high wire troupe are going back to Morocco, where they are semi-finalists on the Simon Cowell-produced TV show Arabs Got Talent. Nicole Sanders nearly signed a deal to do cannon in South Africa, but it fell apart at the last minute. She was offered a contract at a smaller American circus, but says the pay was less than minimum wage, with no health insurance. She turned it down. Performing, you know you’re not going to make a load of money, but you want to be able to survive.” She catches a flight to New Orleans, Louisiana, to stay with her mother while she figures out her next move. The last person at the train yard in Providence is ringmaster Kristen Michelle Wilson. She was hired to be Ringling Bros first female ringmaster, and had held the title for exactly one month when she found out that she would also be its last. Before being whisked into the national spotlight as the face of Circus XTREME, she’d been playing a ringmaster in a circus-themed dinner theatre in Orlando, Florida. She’s heading back to her hometown of Tallahassee without concrete plans for the future. With much groaning and shuddering, the train cars start moving down the track heading north, and slowly pick up speed. The bright red “RINGLING BROS AND BARNUM & BAILEY” banner stamped on the side of each car rolls past Wilson dozens and dozens of times. The Red Unit train will join the Blue Unit train in New Jersey in preparation for their final performance on 21 May in Uniondale, New York. Along the way, the cars that have been purchased at auction (minimum bid: $10,000) will be uncoupled and left behind to be picked up by their new owners. The Misers bought one that will be delivered to their cannonball training grounds in Peru, Indiana, and used as a guest house. At least one is destined to become a dinner train in Cincinnati, Ohio, albeit with the Ringling Bros name scraped off. What is left of the train will make the long, final journey south to the circus’ headquarters in Florida. Unsold cars will be scrapped for metal. The final car disappears over the horizon, the shrill squealing noises get tinier and tinier until they’re gone. An older man in a ball cap who was watching the departure approaches a sleep-deprived Wilson, who’s standing alone outside her moving truck with tears streaming down her face. “Excuse me,” he asks in a thick New England accent. “Are you the ringmaster?” Wilson answers simply, “Yeah,” and they both laugh joylessly. Long after the train has left the yard, Wilson lingers filming the tracks on her iPhone, pacing up and down the parking lot, and fretting because she forgot to thank the circus’ concession workers in her final speech. The sky is filling slowly with ominous dark clouds. Finally, she stops at the cab of her huge yellow moving truck. “It’s been amazing,” she sighs. “Time to get in this bad boy and figure out what I’m gonna do. “I’ll see you down the road.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.99996245
"Middlesbrough's Gaston Ramirez was shown a yellow card for simulation at Bournemouth - before picking up a second and being sent off Players who dive in English football will face bans from next season under new Football Association regulations. Under the new rules, passed by the governing body at its annual general meeting on Thursday, a panel will review footage each Monday looking for cases of simulation. Any player unanimously found guilty of diving would be given a suspension. The FA also announced it has passed reforms it proposed in March, followingcriticism over the way it is run. The FA defines the new offence for which players will be punished as ""successful deception of a match official"". Only incidents that result in a player winning a penalty or lead to an opponent being sent off - through either a direct red card or two yellow cards - will be punished. The FA says it will act ""where there is clear and overwhelming evidence to suggest a match official has been deceived by an act of simulation, and as a direct result, the offending player's team has been awarded a penalty and/or an opposing player has been dismissed"". Its panel will consist of one former match official, one ex-manager and one ex-player. The announcement follows what the FA said was ""a period of consultation with stakeholders over the past few months"". The rule change also required approval from the Premier League, the EFL and the Professional Footballers' Association. Speaking in December, Burnley manager Sean Dyche said he thought diving would be eradicated from football""in six months""if retrospective bans were introduced. Such bans have been utilised in Scottish football since 2011. This video can not be played 'Utter rubbish' - Allardyce on new diving ban BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson: The Scottish Football Association compliance officer - Tony McGlennan - reviews incidents in matches and determines whether or not notices of complaint should be raised. If a player is deemed to have dived during a game and the match officials did not recognise that at the time, the player will be issued with a disciplinary notice. The player can then either acknowledge guilt and accept the punishment offered by the compliance officer, or appeal. If it is the latter, a hearing is convened with an independent three-man panel - including people from legal and football backgrounds - who consider the case made by the compliance officer and the player before making a ruling. This video can not be played How Scottish football has punished divers In December, five former FA bosses asked the government to intervene and change an organisation they described as being held back by""elderly white men"". Sports Minister Tracey Crouch had said the FA could lose Â£30m-Â£40m of public funding if it did not modernise. In March, the FA announced proposed reforms to: Establish three positions on the FA board reserved for female members by 2018; Reduce the size of the board to 10 members; Add 11 new members to the FA Council so it ""better reflects the inclusive and diverse nature of English football""; Limit board membership to three periods of three years; Introduce term limits for FA Council membership. These were passed after a vote by shareholders at Thursday's annual general meeting, having already been approved by the FA Council in April. ""I'm absolutely delighted the FA has understood the importance of good governance and implemented these reforms,"" Crouch said. The proposals were criticised for not going far enough when first announced in March. Lord Herman Ouseley, the chairman of anti-racism group Kick It Out, said he had ""no confidence in the FA's proposals"" and described the reforms as a ""sham"". He added certain minority groups would continue to be under-represented, and that ""by prioritising women on boards, all other protected groups are being left behind"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan Given the FA's traditional resistance to change, this will come as a huge relief to many in the game, and be seen as a major victory for chairman Greg Clarke, who has succeeded where others before him had failed. It means the FA avoids the funding cut it had been threatened with by the government. Some critics believe the game's deficiencies are cultural - rather than structural - and these changes on their own will do little to address under-representation of minorities, inequality of wealth and power, standards of grassroots facilities and youth coaching, and a failing England team. But the hope will be that decision-making is improved, and that administrators - knowing they now only have a certain amount of time in post - are more likely to make a difference, and act in the interests of the whole of football.

"There is already no electricity in the Gaza Strip for up to 20 hours per day By night, much of the Gaza Strip is plunged into darkness with streets lit only by the headlights of passing cars. Inside their apartment, south of Gaza City, the children of the Abu Shaban family are studying for their end-of-year exams by candlelight. ""We have no electricity when we teach our children,"" says Suniya, their mother. ""This problem will affect their grades a lot."" ""The children are worried about the candles,"" she adds. ""We know they're dangerous but we can't afford batteries for lights or back-up power."" ""The refrigerator and most of our electrical appliances have burnt out because the power comes and goes so much. We're constantly chasing after electricity."" The UN has purchased emergency fuel to maintain essential services at Gaza's hospitals Gaza has long struggled with an energy shortage, but recently the situation has got much worse. Mains electricity is switched off for 16 to 20 hours a day. Behind the crisis is an escalating political power struggle between the Islamist group, Hamas, and the Palestinian Authority (PA), dominated by the rival Fatah movement. Hamas seized control of Gaza almost a decade ago - a year after it won legislative elections - ousting forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas. So far, all attempts at reconciliation have failed. Gaza's sole power plant was forced to shut down completely on 17 April Now, Mr Abbas's West Bank-based government appears to be piling on financial pressure as it tries to reassert its authority over the Strip. It has cut the salaries of more than 60,000 civil servants in the impoverished territory by a third, a step it blames on decreasing foreign aid. Gaza's only power plant, which runs on diesel, was shut down last month after the PA scrapped a tax exemption, more than doubling the price of the fuel. The plant had been producing about 60MW of power a day, about 30% of the energy normally available. Now, the PA says it will no longer honour any invoices for an additional 125MW of electricity supplied by Israel. The UN has warned that basic services are grinding to a halt in Gaza Its latest moves come amid fresh efforts by the United States to revive the moribund Middle East peace process. President Donald Trump is expected to visit Israel and the West Bank next week. The US, European Union and Israel, among others, consider Hamas a terrorist group. Israel and Egypt tightened a blockade of Gaza after the Hamas takeover in 2007. ""The Americans and mainly the Israelis have been accusing President Abbas of being weak, [saying] he has no control over the Gaza Strip and is therefore no partner for peace,"" says Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at al-Azhar University - Gaza. ""He wants to restore his power over Gaza, to be taken more seriously."" Hamas called the PA's decision to halt payments ""a grave escalation and an act of madness"" The lack of energy is forcing hospitals here to cancel non-emergency surgeries. The United Nations has donated some fuel for generators. It is also helping desalination plants to continue running, but at just 15% of their capacity. The reductions mean water supplies are reduced. Wastewater in Gaza is not being treated properly and pumped out to sea. That means some raw sewage is being discharged just off the coast. Wastewater treatment has largely halted, resulting in the discharge of sewage into the sea ""The UN can only alleviate some of the humanitarian suffering of those who are most vulnerable,"" says the UN Special Co-ordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nikolay Mladenov. ""We cannot foot the bill for the electricity in Gaza."" Mr Mladenov warns the ""very grave"" situation could become ""catastrophic"" if power from Israel is stopped. A spokesperson for Cogat, Israel's military co-ordinator for civilian activities in the Palestinian Territories, says: ""In the absence of the PA, payments for electricity in Gaza can be made through the international community or private entities."" The payments amounts to $11.1m (Â£8.6m) a month. This video can not be played When the lights go out, people turn to this Palestinian engineer for creative ways to get by The Strip gets some power from Egypt but supplies are often disrupted because of unrest in the Sinai peninsula. Previously, Qatar and Turkey, both major donors to Gaza, have given diesel. Mr Mladenov says he is working hard to pass on the message to ""all sides"" that a political settlement is needed. ""The only reasonable political solution is in fact, to work on returning Gaza to the legitimate Palestinian Authority, the government,"" he adds. Hamas seized control of Gaza almost a decade ago President Abbas wants Hamas to dissolve a committee it recently set up to manage affairs in Gaza. He is pushing for the PA to take control of border crossings and government offices and help set up a unity administration that can prepare for new elections. Meanwhile, Hamas rejects Mr Abbas's efforts to take greater control of Gaza. Damaging rivalry between the main Palestinian factions looks set to remain a potential stumbling block for peace efforts. Many of Gaza's almost two million residents are hoping for a short-term solution. They point out that the holy month of Ramadan is approaching, when observant Muslims fast from dawn until sunset. Seasonal temperatures are also rising. But for now they are being left in the dark over what happens next.

The United Nations has donated some fuel for generators. It is also helping desalination plants to continue running, but at just 15% of their capacity. The reductions mean water supplies are reduced. Wastewater in Gaza is not being treated properly and pumped out to sea. That means some raw sewage is being discharged just off the coast. Wastewater treatment has largely halted, resulting in the discharge of sewage into the sea ""The UN can only alleviate some of the humanitarian suffering of those who are most vulnerable,"" says the UN Special Co-ordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nikolay Mladenov. ""We cannot foot the bill for the electricity in Gaza."" Mr Mladenov warns the ""very grave"" situation could become ""catastrophic"" if power from Israel is stopped. A spokesperson for Cogat, Israel's military co-ordinator for civilian activities in the Palestinian Territories, says: ""In the absence of the PA, payments for electricity in Gaza can be made through the international community or private entities."" The payments amounts to $11.1m (Â£8.6m) a month.

Previously, Qatar and Turkey, both major donors to Gaza, have given diesel. Mr Mladenov says he is working hard to pass on the message to ""all sides"" that a political settlement is needed. ""The only reasonable political solution is in fact, to work on returning Gaza to the legitimate Palestinian Authority, the government,"" he adds. Hamas seized control of Gaza almost a decade ago President Abbas wants Hamas to dissolve a committee it recently set up to manage affairs in Gaza. He is pushing for the PA to take control of border crossings and government offices and help set up a unity administration that can prepare for new elections. Meanwhile, Hamas rejects Mr Abbas's efforts to take greater control of Gaza. Damaging rivalry between the main Palestinian factions looks set to remain a potential stumbling block for peace efforts. Many of Gaza's almost two million residents are hoping for a short-term solution. They point out that the holy month of Ramadan is approaching, when observant Muslims fast from dawn until sunset. Seasonal temperatures are also rising. But for now they are being left in the dark over what happens next.

"Comet Ping Pong restaurant has been the target of fake news and malicious gossip on the internet. University of Washington researcher Kate Starbird's research into online rumours lead her to an information war being waged through a web of highly politicised conspiracy theories. In 2013, in the time between when two homemade bombs detonated near the Boston marathon finish line and when police cornered and caught bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a conspiracy theory began to spread online. Internet sleuths, analysing pictures released by the FBI, said they saw evidence of a false flag attack - proof that the bombing had been staged or carried out by the US government. University of Washington professor Kate Starbird and some of her research team noticed these accusations on Twitter, since they were studying how rumours spread on social media during events likeÂ mass shootings and terror attacks. While other online rumours would gain traction and die away as facts became clear, the Boston false flag speculation did not abate, even after Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan were identified as the bombers. Â At the time, Starbird and her team saw the conspiracy theory as something of a curiosity. ""We didn't want to go there,"" she says. ""It just seemed messy."" But after taking a closer look at those rumours, she now says her research suggests there is an ""emerging alternative media ecosystem"" that is growing in reach, and that may have underlying political agendas. Researcher Kate Starbird first began exploring social media rumours during the 2013 Boston Bombing Starting in January 2016, she and her team began mapping sites generating conspiracy theories. They tracked Twitter reaction to shootings along with references to terms like ""false flag"" and ""hoax"" and the websites that used them. Starbird has dubbed what they discovered the ""the information wars,external"". Thework,externalis nominated for best paper at aninternational web and social media conference,externalin Montreal this week. Highly politicised alternative narratives to events were being spread by a mishmash of websites: anti-mainstream media sites, anti-corporatist ""alt-Right"" and ""alt-Left"" sites, conspiracy-focused White Nationalist and anti-Semitic sites, Muslim Defense sites and Russian propaganda. ""There are different actors,"" she says. ""Some are (acting) for financial motives, some are for political motives. Some people are true believers."" Calling her finding an ""information war"" is not a nod towards talk show host Alex Jones' alternative news website Infowars, which focuses on Alt-Right and conspiracy theory themes. His site rose to mainstream prominence during the 2016 American election. But she has written tongue-in-cheek that ""this work suggests that Alex Jones is indeed a prophet"". Looking back on their older research, they found hints of similar conspiracy activity around the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which devastated the Gulf Coast of the US. In 2016, the university researchers found sites that helped propagate these conspiracy theory tweetsÂ were often so-called ""alternative media"" domains like VeteransToday.com and BeforeItsNews.com. The researchers also found sites like TheRealStrategy.com, which appeared to be generating automated conspiracy theory tweets with ""bots""Â in order to propagate politicised content. Many of the tweets had a political element. For example, a mass shooting might be blamed as a ""false flag"" by the US government, with speculation that the attack was planned to to gain support for gun control. Tweets also included hashtags linked to online political conversations like #obama, #nra, or #teaparty. Sandy Hook to Trump: 'Help us stop conspiracy theorists' Avril Lavigne conspiracy theory returns The saga of 'Pizzagate' While belief in certainconspiracy theories,externalcan be sometimes linked political beliefs, Starbird's research suggested that political content on sites pushing the alternative narratives was less about left-wing versus right-wing - no political leaning was immune - but instead had a broad anti-globalist bent. There was also plenty ofÂ anti-vaccine, anti-GMO, and anti-climate science content, as well conspiracies about the world's wealthy and powerful citizens. Starbird's research points to an intentional use of disinformation to muddle thinking and ""undermine trust in information just generally"". She says big questions remain, like who might be behind any possible intentional disinformation campaigns and to what extent these messages are coordinated. Twitter But she says she is concerned that as these fringe theories gain traction in the public sphere ""it is not healthy for society ""When there's no shared reality, there's no set of facts, society at large can become easily manipulated,"" she says.

"Sergio Romero has made just two Premier League appearances for Manchester United this season Sergio Romero made a series of fine saves as Southampton and Manchester United played out a goalless draw at St Mary's. Saints should have gone ahead within five minutes when Eric Bailly was adjudged to have handled in the area, but United goalkeeper Romero saved Manolo Gabbiadini's penalty. Bailly's sharp shot was stopped by Fraser Forster, as the United defender created his side's best chance of the first half. Southampton forced Romero to make multiple blocks after the break while Anthony Martial hit the post from 25 yards for the visitors. With Jose Mourinho's side guaranteed a sixth-place finish before kick-off and one eye firmly on next Wednesday's Europa League final, it always looked like being a sedate affair on the south coast and that is how it turned out. Saints may decide Puel's future next week Relive Romero's goalkeeping masterclass against Southampton Man Utd wait on Fellaini injury Man Utd interested in buying back Keane Claude Puel's side have won six league games at St Mary's this season Southampton fans have only seen 37 goals at St Mary's this season - only Old Trafford, with 36, has seen fewer Premier League goals in 2016-17. Their terrible run in front of goal at St Mary's continued - they have now gone 365 minutes without scoring at home - and suffered yet another miss from the penalty spot. Romero pulled off a superb low save to stop Gabbiadini's strike, as Southampton missed their third penalty in the past five games. Withspeculation surrounding his future, Puel's nerves would have been eased by a victory to tighten their grip on eighth spot. His side host Stoke on the final day of the season on Sunday but could still finish as low as 11th. They are one point ahead of West Brom in ninth and Bournemouth in 10th. Leicester, who are three points behind in 11th, have a game in hand against Tottenham on Thursday. But with aLeague Cup final appearanceunder his belt, the 55-year-old Puel could have done enough to earn another season at St Mary's. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United did not finish outside of the top three in the Premier League era, but since his departure in 2013 United have not finished inside the top three. It will also be the first time that current boss Mourinho has finished lower than third in his managerial career. Mourinho made clear in recent weeks that his focus is firmly on winning the Europa League and securing Champions League qualification next season. Following consecutive league defeats by Arsenal and Tottenham, he made four changes against Saints and had youngsters Demetri Mitchell and Scott McTominay on the substitutes' bench. His side were once again lacklustre against Southampton and they would have slipped to a third consecutive league defeat had it not been for Argentine goalkeeper Romero. One downside for Mourinho was that the sight of midfielder Marouane Fellaini limping off after 75 minutes. Jose Mourinho has been highly critical of Manchester United's fixture list this season While Romero will play in goal in the Europa League final, Mourinho also confirmed that third-choice goalkeeper Joel Pereira will make his Premier League debut against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Injured David de Gea did not travel with the squad to Southampton, but when asked about the Spaniard's future, Mourinho said the 26-year-old will play for the club again. ""He'll play the first match against LA Galaxy in pre-season in Los Angeles,"" he said. ""I hope to play Sergio in the final and hopefully we don't have problems with the keepers. David is top of the world and obviously we want to keep the top in the world."" Second-choice goalkeeper Romero has conceded six goals in 17 appearances for Manchester United this season This video can not be played Puel rues 'many opportunities' wasted Southampton manager Claude Puel said:""We can feel shame after this game because we had many opportunities in the second half. ""We had two different halves - the first one was without intensity and it was very difficult after the penalty because that would have given us the confidence. ""The second half was interesting as there was quality and many chances without a good reward. ""But this point is important for us in the table."" When asked about his future, Puel said: ""I think it's important to stay focused on the last game and to finish strong. After the last game it is normal to have a discussion about the season."" This video can not be played Mourinho praises Romero's 'great save' Manchester United have drawn 15 league games this season - their most ever in a Premier League season and most in a league campaign since 1991-92 (also 15). Southampton had six shots on target - only Tottenham (seven on Sunday) have had more in a match against Manchester United this season in all competitions. However, that included a missed penalty which means Saints have now missed their last three Premier League spot kicks, after Dusan Tadic v Hull and Shane Long v Middlesbrough. Sergio Romero became the eighth different United keeper to save a Premier League penalty, and first since David de Gea against Everton in October 2014. Southampton have now gone four top-flight home games without a goal for the first time in their history. Even if United win their remaining game, this will be their lowest tally of wins in a single Premier League season (currently 17). They last had fewer in 1990-91 (16 wins). Southampton host Stoke City on the final day of the season on Sunday while Manchester United host Crystal Palace at Old Trafford (both 15:00 BST). Jose Mourinho's side then travel to Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax on Wednesday, 24 May (19:45 BST).

"Alex Hanscombe was two years old and with his mother when she was attacked and killed In July 1992 a young mother, Rachel Nickell, was stabbed repeatedly and killed on Wimbledon Common in London. She was with her son, Alex, who was just two years old. He was the only witness. Now aged 27, Alex Hanscombe has spoken toBBC Woman's Hourabout that time and how he has moved on. ""More than anything, I remember just after the attack reaching out to my mother and asking her to get up. I realised in a split second that she was gone and wasn't coming back."" Alex's memories about the attack are vivid.  He recalls the assailant washing his hands in a nearby stream. He also remembers seeing a cash receipt which had fallen from his mother's pocket - he rested it on her forehead. This video can not be played Alex explains how he came to terms with seeing his mother being murdered. It took many years for the killer to be caught. A man called Colin Stagg was wrongly accused of her killing and a judge criticised the police investigation which deployed a ""honey trap"". In 2008 a man called Robert Napper pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Napper, who had schizophrenia, had already been convicted of a 1993 double killing. He is at Broadmoor high security hospital. There was intense media interest in the case, so Alex's father, Andre, took him to rural France to start a new life. After a while the press found out where they lived, so they moved once more - this time to Spain. Alex with his mother, who had been a model People knowing where they lived presented a risk to Alex's life. He was the only person to have witnessed his mother's killing and for as long as the killer was at large, he was in danger. He insists that he was never scared, although he acknowledges that ""my life could have ended that very morning"". He says certain situations used to trigger very strong reactions in him as a child, especially if he saw someone who looked like his mother's killer. Alex has always strived not to be defined by what happened. ""There were all sorts of claims that were made about me, such as I'd never talk again, I'd end up living under a bridge or even repeat the same cycle of violence. But it's about creating your path and living your own way,"" he said. It is 25 years this year since Rachel Nickell was killed on Wimbledon Common He has recently returned to the spot on Wimbledon Common where his mother was killed. ""I had this strong urge to go back there and something magical happened. ""I knelt down and said a prayer. I said thank you for all my blessings and for making the pieces of the puzzle come together in the right way. And at that very moment I heard someone call, ""Molly, Molly"". ""I thought I was dreaming but it was a man calling out to his dog, Molly."" Alex's father Andre, left, moved the family to France, then Spain, to avoid intense media interest Molly was the pet dog with Rachel and Alex when she was attacked 25 years ago. ""The coincidence and this happening: it's all there for a reason,"" he says. Alex lives in Barcelona with his father. He studies hypnotherapy, handwriting analysis and yoga.
