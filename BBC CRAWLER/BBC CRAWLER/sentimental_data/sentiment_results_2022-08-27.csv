"Middle-earners, as well as low earners, are likely to need government help to pay their energy bills this winter, Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has warned. The energy regulator hiked the price cap on household bills by 80% on Friday, meaning the average bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said even those earning Â£45,000 a year may need support. He said the Treasury was exploring ""all the options"" to help households. He added that the country was in a ""national economic emergency [that] could go on for 18 months, two years"". Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, one of whom will be announced as the next prime minister on 5 September, have pledged further support, though neither has given details. Environment Secretary George Eustice defended the wait for policy announcements from either candidate, saying it was right that whoever got the top job would ""want to look at all of the options, properly costed"" when they take office. ""Both candidates have said they will do more - you don't have long to wait,"" Mr Eustice told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""They've both made clear that this will be absolutely at the top of their in tray,"" he added. The government has already said that all households will get a Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650. Mr Salvatierra is unsure he'll be able to have another child because of the cost of living crisis Francisco Salvatierra, 37, in Cardiff has been a teacher for the last seven years and earns Â£38,000 teaching Spanish in Caerphilly.  He and his wife's joint household income is about Â£56,000. Even with two incomes, we're facing financial difficulties. Our rent has increased by Â£200, and our energy bills are likely to hit Â£350 a month. What does it say in a country where people are working but they can't afford to pay for their energy? I have a decent job, but it doesn't stop me from experiencing financial struggles. Getting a mortgage is science fiction. It's almost Â£1,000 in rent for our flat alone, so how are we going to save for a 10% deposit. I have had to accept that I'll never be able to get onto the housing ladder. I'd love to have a second baby, but it was hard enough to have a first one [which is due on Boxing Day]. We kept postponing the decision because of financial worries, but having a second one - I now don't think that's going to happen. The idea of getting a Â£400 payment doesn't solve anything. We need more than charity, we need social and financial justice, like taxing energy companies who have billions in profits. The rise in the energy price cap- which is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge households per unit of energy - means millions of households will see their annual bills rise from about Â£1,971 currently. Typical prepayment meter customers will also see their bills rise to Â£3,608. Charities and experts have warned that the rise will have a devastating impact on households and that lives will be at risk without government intervention. 'Lives at risk' as energy price cap soars by 80% What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? In his interview with the Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said he was also concerned about those who were not on benefits. ""If you are a senior nurse or a senior teacher on Â£45,000 a year, you're having your energy bills go up by 80% and will probably rise even higher in the new year - it's really hard. ""If you're a pensioner, it's really hard. So Universal Credit is a really effective way of targeting, but I'm looking at what else we can do to make sure we help those who really need the help."" The price cap, set by the regulator, Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 Mr Zahawi said the options being drawn up for the next prime minister to consider included an increase in benefits and a loan scheme for energy suppliers to stop them having to pass costs on to consumers. He said a price cap freeze had not been ruled out, though he expressed concern that the measure would also benefit households that could afford to pay higher energy costs. Mr Zahawi added that a number of measures to help small businesses, including temporary reductions to VAT, business rates, or green levies, were being considered, saying a failure to help business would leave a ""longer-term scarring effect on the economy"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for failing to respond to the growing crisis. Labour says its own plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid for in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Asked whether it was right that even the richest would benefit, Labour's Darren Jones - chair of the department for business, energy and industrial strategy committee of MPs - said ""the vast majority of people"" would be affected by the rises. He added that the government was not set up well enough to get money to people in a targeted way. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said people were already saying they would be unable to heat their homes or put food on their tables. ""These are costs people simply can't afford,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""The government has a responsibility to step in."" Mr Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter, and added: ""This is an emergency as big as the Covid crisis. In such a scenario, the government has a responsibility to act."" Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Mr Zahawi also split with cabinet colleagues who have so far resisted suggestions that households should be encouraged to reduce their energy usage. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that choices about energy consumption remained ""decisions for individuals"". Asked about the issue, Mr Zahawi said: ""The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption."" He told the Telegraph the country would have to be resilient as it continued to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion. ""Putin has worked out that he can use energy as a tool to hit back at us,"" he said. ""And we're going to need to send a message back to Putin that this is not going to soften our resolve.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Millions affected by heavy flooding in Pakistan The Prime Minister of Pakistan has said the ""magnitude of the calamity"" is bigger than expected, after visiting flood-hit areas. Shehbaz Sharif wasspeaking from Sindh province,external- which has had nearly eight times its average August rainfall. The floods have killed nearly 1,000 people across Pakistan since June, while thousands have been displaced - and millions more affected. As the BBC drove through Sindh, there were displaced people in every village. The full scale of the devastation in the province is yet to be fully understood - but the people described it as the worst disaster they've survived. Floods are not uncommon in Pakistan, but people here said these rains were different - more than anything that's ever been seen. One local official called them ""floods of biblical proportions"". Near the city of Larkana, thousands of mud homes have sunk under water. For miles all that's visible is treetops. Where the water level is slightly lower, thatched roofs creep out from underneath the water. In one village, the people are desperate for food. In another, many children have developed waterborne diseases. When a mobile truck pulled over, scores of people immediately ran towards it. Children carrying other children made their way to the long queue. One 12-year-old girl said she and her baby sister had not eaten for a day. ""No food has come here, but my sister is sick, she has been vomiting,"" the girl said. ""I hope they can help."" The desperation was evident in every community. People ran towards car windows to ask for help - anything. Stranded people are evacuated on boats in Sukkur On one of the main streets out of the city of Sukkur, hundreds of people have settled. Many of them walked from remote villages, and were told that help is easier to get in the urban areas. But there's not much difference here. On Friday, PM Sharif said 33 million people had been hit by the floods - about 15% of the country's population. He said the losses caused by floods this season were comparable to thoseduring the floods of 2010-11, said to be the worst on record. The country has appealed for more international aid. Flood victims queue up outside a bank to receive financial assistance in southern Sindh province In Sindh, it's not that local authorities are not trying, but they admit that they are out of their depth. The provincial government says this is a ""climate change catastrophe"" and that the people of Pakistan, especially in the poorer communities, have been the worst affected. The solutions will not be quick - acres of land are waterlogged and the water is not receding fast enough for any rebuilding to take place here. There's not much to do for the people but to wait - wait for the rains to stop, wait for the water to go down, wait for more resources to be allocated to these kinds of communities. In the meantime, life continues to be difficult.

"Waste is piling up in Edinburgh's Grassmarket Scotland's national public health agency has warned of a risk to public health as bin strikes continue across the country. Public Health Scotland said people could be at risk from the build up of food, animal and human waste like nappies. It has issued advice to councils to ""decontaminate"" areas where bins have overflowed. The warning came as another day of talks to resolve the dispute ended. More talks between Cosla and the unions are expected to resume at 14:00 on Sunday. It is understood discussions are focusing on a new deal for the lowest-paid workers. BBC Scotland has been told that no deal is imminent but ""slow progress"" is being made. Is there a bin strike in my area? The people using baths and hiring skips to store rubbish Read more stories from Scotland Public Health Scotland said theimpact of waste on health depended on factors including the type of waste and the weather,external. ""If organic waste builds up it can become a risk to human health,"" the agency said. ""Organic waste includes food waste, animal waste (from food or excrement), human waste (including nappies) and manure."" It said it had recommended councils decontaminate public areas where bins had overflowed to reduce the risk to people's health. And it issued a series of precautions people can take at home: Wash hands when handling waste at home Where possible, organic and medical waste should be stored in containers If containers are not available, waste which is likely to rot should be double bagged The public should avoid contact with refuse in public areas The accumulation of waste may increase fire risk, so households should ""consider their fire safety preparedness"". Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said the piled of rubbish building up throughout Edinburgh are ""deeply concerning"" for public health. Cameron Anderson works at the ice cream parlour in the Grassmarket The owners of one ice cream parlour in the Grassmarket took the decision to shut earlier this week due to the mounting piles of rubbish in the street Overlangshaw Farmhouse's shop, which is in a former police box, reopened on Saturday after a community effort to tidy the waste. Cameron Anderson, who works at the ice cream parlour, told BBC Scotland: ""This is our first day open since Tuesday which is awful because usually the Fringe is the busiest time of the year for us and we've not been doing any business. ""There were plenty of people about but nobody wanted ice cream when they were surrounded by rubbish. The sight of it is off-putting, the smell, everything - it was just a health hazard."" He said the situation was much better now. A religious group - the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church - has put 30 trade bins in five locations across the city centre which will be filled, then removed by its volunteers. Waste has been tidied into bags next to the ice cream parlour ""There's been lots of volunteers from local business, community members - they haven't been cleaning up the rubbish but just condensing it, putting it into piles,"" Mr Anderson said. ""It's making it much more bearable."" ""We stand fully in support of the strikes and the workers,"" he added. The waste has forced many street performers from the Grassmarket during the Fringe but on Saturday some were performing on nearby Victoria Street. The refuse workers in Edinburgh are more than halfway through the two-week strike which has left bins overflowing and rubbish piled high during festival season. Staff in a further 20 council areas are also now on strike, with the industrial action due to continue until the middle of next week. Unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England. That included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay offer, which the union said would benefit the lowest paid the most. BBC Scotland correspondent Jamie McIvor said the fact that negotiations were continuing was a positive sign. He added: ""The councils are very sympathetic to the claims being made by the unions, they understand the cost of living crisis and what that means for so many of their staff. ""It is that question of what councils can actually afford to pay, even with the extra Â£140m they have been given by the Scottish government."" Glasgow bin workers joined the strike this week and bins were already overflowing in the city centre Council body Cosla said the Unite, Unison and GMB unions had rejected an offer earlier this week that would have meant the lowest paid 12% of council workers would get a pay increase of more than 5%. It has also said the latest pay offer amounted to ""one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers"" with some workers getting an overall 7.36% increase. Unite regional officer Wendy Dunsmore told BBC Scotland they are anticipating an offer in the ""very near future"". Unions have called for more funding from the Scottish government to pay for an improved offer and rejected a request to suspend the strikes while further negotiations were held. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""After constructive discussions over recent days, we are aware that Cosla held a meeting of local authority leaders to discuss a potential proposition. ""It would not be appropriate for the Scottish government to comment further beyond encouraging both sides to continue to seek a fair resolution of this dispute.""

"Allseas berthed at Greenock Ocean Terminal More than a million bottles of whisky will leave the west coast of Scotland later in the country's first direct shipping container service to China. The new shipping route has been hailed as a ""game changer for Scotland"". The Allseas Pioneer arrived in Greenock from Ningbo in China earlier, carrying containers of textiles, furniture and toys for sale in Scotland. The direct sailings will reduce freight transit times, compared to services via Europe or southern UK ports. Six ships - each capable of carrying about 1,600 shipping containers - will operate on the route, which was established as a response to growing global supply chain pressures. The new service with three sailings per month in each direction is expected to cut the journey time from about 60 days to an estimated 33 by eliminating unscheduled port congestion delays in Rotterdam. Check out the latest headlines from Scotland Read more business stories from Scotland Greenock Ocean Terminal, which opened in 1969, is currently responsible for the handling of 100,000 containers a year Jim McSporran of Peel Ports, which operates the Clydeport in Greenock - Scotland's deepest container terminal, said it was ""great to finally welcome this vital service"". He said: ""We believe this partnership will prove to be a hugely positive development for businesses and customers, as well as boosting the wider supply chain, and we look forward to continuing to work with our partners on this service in the coming months."" The direct link between the two countries was established in a partnership between KC Liner Agencies, DKT Allseas and China Xpress. The maiden voyage is scheduled to berth at Greenock Ocean Terminal next month David Milne, KC Group Shipping managing director, said the company has been ""amazed at the level of immediate interest"" in the route. He said they needed the support of Scottish importers and exporters to ""safeguard the long-term future"" of the new service. ""Our direct trading link to China cuts through frustrating transhipment delays, which is a massive boost for Scottish businesses and can only help consumers in these difficult times,"" he said. ""I described this as a game changer for Scotland, and the uptake in the service is certainly proving that case, for Scotland's furniture, pharmaceuticals, packaging and spirits sectors."" Cllr Stephen McCabe, leader of Inverclyde Council, said the new route was a ""ringing endorsement of Greenock and Inverclyde as an important location for exports, imports and visitors"". He added: ""The freight side of Greenock Ocean Terminal can often be overshadowed and sometimes forgotten about because of the busy cruise ship schedule. ""But the container shipping side of the terminal has also grown substantially in recent years, and the new Glasgow City Region cruise ship visitor centre development, including the dedicated cruise ship pontoon, has created more capacity for both container and passenger vessels to aid the continued growth of both markets and further boost the economy locally, regionally and nationally.""

"Officers were flagged down on Kingston Bridge, the Metropolitan Police said A man has died after entering the River Thames while being arrested by police. Officers were flagged down on Kingston Bridge at about 22:30 BST on Friday, the Metropolitan Police said. A ""verbal altercation"" involving a man and a woman known to each other was taking place and an allegation of theft was made, the force added. Officers were in the process of arresting the man, but he had not been placed in handcuffs, when he entered the water, the Met said. The force's Marine Policing Unit, the National Police Air Service, London Fire Brigade and the RNLI were all involved in the search for the man, who was believed to be in his 20s. He was recovered from the water at about 00:30 BST and was treated by paramedics, but was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The man's family had been informed and the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), according to the Met. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: ""My thoughts, and those of the Metropolitan Police Service, are with the friends and family of the man who has sadly lost his life following this incident. ""I fully appreciate the public will be very concerned. We of course share that concern. ""The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards made an immediate referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as is protocol in any incident in which a person comes to harm following police contact."" The IOPC said its investigators had taken initial accounts from the officers involved. In a statement, an IOPC spokesperson said: ""We have now begun the process of gathering and reviewing evidence, including footage of the interaction between officers and the man.

"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman ran into her home Two men who were arrested on suspicion of the murder of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool have been released on bail. Police said one of the men, aged 36, had been recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence. Olivia was fatally shot after a gunman chased a man - both of whom had no links to her family - into her home. Her mum was injured as she tried to the shut the door but the attacker fired more shots at the man he had pursued. On Thursday, Merseyside Police arrested the 36-year-old man on suspicion of Olivia's murder and two counts of attempted murder. They also detained a 33-year-old man for the same offences on Friday. A spokeswoman for Merseyside Police said: ""Both men have been released on bail and the 36-year-old man has been recalled to prison after breaching the terms of his licence."" Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey were also killed this August Police appealed for more information about a black Audi Q3 that was seen leaving Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, after Monday's shooting and is believed to be the same car used to take intended target Joseph Nee, 35, to hospital. They said they wanted information about the car's movements in the days before Olivia's death. She was one of four people who were killed in a week in Merseyside amid a recent rise of gun and knife crimes. A number of people have been arrested after the deaths of Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey this August. Earlier on Saturday, thousands of football fans applauded in memory of Olivia during the ninth minute of Liverpool's game at Anfield, with fans singing You'll Never Walk Alone. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson wore a shirt in tribute to Olivia It was part of a series of tributes in the city to the four victims of the violence. Balloons were released at the city's Sefton Park in memory of Ashley Dale, who was gunned down in her garden on Sunday.

"Whoever becomes prime minister will be faced with difficult decisions from day one A sense of scale is important when considering the size of the energy crisis now facing every household in the country - and what the government will have to do about it. Average energy bills of nearly Â£300 per month are unthinkable and unmanageable for several million households. Friday's energy price cap announcement from Ofgem puts them at this level from October onwards. But some predictions have that number at Â£550 per month by April - closer to the average cost of a mortgage - as wholesale gas prices have surged yet higher in recent days. For an average household on Â£31,000 income per year, energy costs are set to exceed income tax bills. Or alternatively, the energy rise we will have seen since last year, is the equivalent of adding 15p to 20p to the basic rate of tax. It will drain the disposable income of several million households. And it is not just an issue which will transform the path of the economy. These rises are so large and so widespread that they could test the nation's social resilience too. Even the energy industry itself doesn't think these rises are possible. At a recent meeting with the government to discussthe Energy Tariff Deficit Fund, a key takeaway was that not one energy firm believed that it is feasible to charge the nation what the companies themselves are having to pay to purchase gas. That is an amazing and remarkable situation. So that gaping hole, that is getting larger every day, week and month is now in the hands of the government. Ultimately, the government must choose who needs help. It will be over half of households at least. Extending it to everyone will cost much more, but will also rein in the overall inflation rate, and be far simpler. There is a vein of thinking that wealthier households that accumulated savings during the pandemic should pay their own way. It comes down to a choice between tens of billions of pounds and several tens of billions. And so far, we are getting very little of the relevant detail from the Conservative leadership, and future Prime Minister, candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Then there is also the question of who should pay eventually. Government borrowing will go up at first. But the energy industry has suggested that customers essentially repay this back with higher bills for the next decadethrough the Energy Tariff Deficit Fund. The net result would be to keep bills from rising much above Â£2,000 on average, but there would have to be acceptance that they would come down only very slowly into the 2030s, even if the war in Ukraine is over. This may not work. So those parts of the energy industry making even greater profits from exactly the same gas extraction might face a further tax grab. Or general taxes might have to increase. This would require a breaking of some of the promises in the Conservative leadership campaign even before it is over. Extra borrowing could take the strain. But market interest rates are already surging and high inflation is also fast increasing the price of government borrowing. The Bank of England also faces even higher inflation and even higher government borrowing. It is a potent mix: inflation, recession, high debts, and the core reason for it all, a wartime energy shock And perhaps that is the point. It is not the market driving this. It is geopolitics, diplomacy and conflict. Margaret Thatcher's former energy secretary Lord David Howell, told the BBC this week the country needed to be on ""a war-footing"" as regards energy and that these bills were simply ""impossible"". At the very moment that most households come to see that the ""energy price cap"" is not really a cap on the price they pay for energy, it seems likely that the government may have to encourage immediate measures to save energy. The new Prime Minister will have to make an ominous judgement even before they get the keys to Downing Street.

"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman ran into her home Thousands of football fans have paid tribute to nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel, who was shot inside her home. Applause rang out in the ninth minute of Liverpool's game at Anfield, while fans sang You'll Never Walk Alone. Merseyside Police issued an appeal for information before the match started with Bournemouth. Two men, aged 33 and 36, arrested on suspicion of Olivia's murder on Monday have been released on bail, police said. Fans applauded in the ninth minute of Liverpool's match in tribute to Olivia Pratt-Korbel Olivia was shot after a gunman chased a man - both of whom had no links to her family - into her home. Her mother was shot in the wrist as she tried to the shut the door but the attacker then fired two more shots at the man he had pursued. Each of the arrested men have also been detained on two counts of attempted murder. The applause at Anfield was part of a series of tributes in the city, after four people were killed in the space of a week in Merseyside.

"Glasgow bin workers joined the strike this week and bins were already overflowing in the city centre Talks to end a wave of bin strikes affecting two thirds of Scotland's council areas have yet to reach an agreement. Negotiations between councils and unions continued late into Friday night after a second day of talks. It is understood discussions are focusing on a new deal for the lowest-paid workers. BBC Scotland has been told that no deal is imminent but ""slow progress"" is being made. Council leaders are said to be discussing what kind of offer they could afford. Unions are seeking an agreement similar to the one made to council workers in England. That deal included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay offer, which the union said would benefit the lowest paid the most. Is there a bin strike in my area? The people using baths and hiring skips to store rubbish Read more stories from Scotland BBC Scotland correspondent Jamie McIvor said the fact that negotiations were continuing was a positive sign in itself. He added: ""There is the possibility of talks continuing into the weekend or Monday. ""The councils are very sympathetic to the claims being made by the unions, they understand the cost of living crisis and what that means for so many of their staff. ""It is that question of what councils can actually afford to pay, even with the extra Â£140m they have been given by the Scottish government."" The Grassmarket area of Edinburgh has been badly affected by the bin strike Council body Cosla said the Unite, Unison and GMB unions had rejected an offer earlier this week that would have meant the lowest paid 12% of council workers would get a pay increase of more than 5%. It has also said the latest pay offer amounted to ""one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers"" with some workers getting an overall 7.36% increase. Unions have called for more funding from the Scottish government to pay for an improved offer and rejected a request to suspend the strikes while further negotiations were held. Refuse workers in Edinburgh are more than halfway through a two-week strike that has left bins overflowing and rubbish piled high on many streets of the capital. People living in flats have been told to keep their rubbish at home rather than putting it out in the street. Staff in a further 20 council areas are also now on strike, with the industrial action due to continue until the middle of next week. Further bin strikes are due to be held in many areas early next month, with schools and nurseries also due to be hit by industrial action. James David Lee and Megan Alexander have tidied up the rubbish scattered in front of overflowing bins on the Grassmarket Charity groups and local businesses are attempting to clear some of the mess in Edinburgh city centre. James David Lee, a member of staff at Biddy Mulligan's pub in the Grassmarket area, said he and his colleagues had taken to cleaning up the mess nine days into the strike. He said: ""It's got so bad now and it's outside our work so we are cleaning it up. ""We take pride in our work and we don't like to see the outside of our pub looking like this. ""Something we have seen is the disappearance of performers due to the bins overflowing. Normally the Grassmarket would be full of performers and jugglers.""

It's certainly not our job. I feel a bit upset about it all. ""Our neighbour who runs an ice-cream shop has had to close due to the rubbish. ""His queue is normally way down the Grassmarket.

"Waste is piling up in Edinburgh's Grassmarket Scotland's national public health agency has warned of a risk to public health as bin strikes continue across the country. Public Health Scotland said people could be at risk from the build up of food, animal and human waste like nappies. It has issued advice to councils to ""decontaminate"" areas where bins have overflowed. The warning came as another day of talks to resolve the dispute ended. More talks between Cosla and the unions are expected to resume at 14:00 on Sunday. It is understood discussions are focusing on a new deal for the lowest-paid workers. BBC Scotland has been told that no deal is imminent but ""slow progress"" is being made. Is there a bin strike in my area? The people using baths and hiring skips to store rubbish Read more stories from Scotland Public Health Scotland said theimpact of waste on health depended on factors including the type of waste and the weather,external. ""If organic waste builds up it can become a risk to human health,"" the agency said. ""Organic waste includes food waste, animal waste (from food or excrement), human waste (including nappies) and manure."" It said it had recommended councils decontaminate public areas where bins had overflowed to reduce the risk to people's health. And it issued a series of precautions people can take at home: Wash hands when handling waste at home Where possible, organic and medical waste should be stored in containers If containers are not available, waste which is likely to rot should be double bagged The public should avoid contact with refuse in public areas The accumulation of waste may increase fire risk, so households should ""consider their fire safety preparedness"". Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said the piled of rubbish building up throughout Edinburgh are ""deeply concerning"" for public health. Cameron Anderson works at the ice cream parlour in the Grassmarket The owners of one ice cream parlour in the Grassmarket took the decision to shut earlier this week due to the mounting piles of rubbish in the street Overlangshaw Farmhouse's shop, which is in a former police box, reopened on Saturday after a community effort to tidy the waste. Cameron Anderson, who works at the ice cream parlour, told BBC Scotland: ""This is our first day open since Tuesday which is awful because usually the Fringe is the busiest time of the year for us and we've not been doing any business. ""There were plenty of people about but nobody wanted ice cream when they were surrounded by rubbish. The sight of it is off-putting, the smell, everything - it was just a health hazard."" He said the situation was much better now. A religious group - the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church - has put 30 trade bins in five locations across the city centre which will be filled, then removed by its volunteers. Waste has been tidied into bags next to the ice cream parlour ""There's been lots of volunteers from local business, community members - they haven't been cleaning up the rubbish but just condensing it, putting it into piles,"" Mr Anderson said. ""It's making it much more bearable."" ""We stand fully in support of the strikes and the workers,"" he added. The waste has forced many street performers from the Grassmarket during the Fringe but on Saturday some were performing on nearby Victoria Street. The refuse workers in Edinburgh are more than halfway through the two-week strike which has left bins overflowing and rubbish piled high during festival season. Staff in a further 20 council areas are also now on strike, with the industrial action due to continue until the middle of next week.

"This video can not be played Watch: Millions affected by heavy flooding in Pakistan The Prime Minister of Pakistan has said the ""magnitude of the calamity"" is bigger than expected, after visiting flood-hit areas. Shehbaz Sharif wasspeaking from Sindh province,external- which has had nearly eight times its average August rainfall. The floods have killed nearly 1,000 people across Pakistan since June, while thousands have been displaced - and millions more affected. As the BBC drove through Sindh, there were displaced people in every village. The full scale of the devastation in the province is yet to be fully understood - but the people described it as the worst disaster they've survived. Floods are not uncommon in Pakistan, but people here said these rains were different - more than anything that's ever been seen. One local official called them ""floods of biblical proportions"". Near the city of Larkana, thousands of mud homes have sunk under water. For miles all that's visible is treetops. Where the water level is slightly lower, thatched roofs creep out from underneath the water. In one village, the people are desperate for food. In another, many children have developed waterborne diseases. When a mobile truck pulled over, scores of people immediately ran towards it. Children carrying other children made their way to the long queue. One 12-year-old girl said she and her baby sister had not eaten for a day. ""No food has come here, but my sister is sick, she has been vomiting,"" the girl said. ""I hope they can help."" The desperation was evident in every community. People ran towards car windows to ask for help - anything. Stranded people are evacuated on boats in Sukkur On one of the main streets out of the city of Sukkur, hundreds of people have settled. Many of them walked from remote villages, and were told that help is easier to get in the urban areas. But there's not much difference here. On Friday, PM Sharif said 33 million people had been hit by the floods - about 15% of the country's population. He said the losses caused by floods this season were comparable to thoseduring the floods of 2010-11, said to be the worst on record. The country has appealed for more international aid.

"Jerome Powell in Wyoming Stock markets in the US ended the week sharply down following tough comments by the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve. The bank's chairman, Jerome Powell, said the bank must continue to raise interest rates to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy. His words sent US stocks into a tailspin, with markets tumbling 3%. It comes as Americans are having to pay more for basic goods. Inflation in the world's largest economy is at a four-decade high. During a highly anticipated speech at a conference in Wyoming on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve would probably impose further interest rate hikes in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"". ""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,"" he said at the meeting in Jackson Hole. Investors are concerned that if economic growth falters, higher interest rates will increase the likelihood of a recession. Mr Powell conceded that getting inflation under control would come at a cost to American households and businesses but he argued it was a price worth paying. ""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to household and businesses,"" he said. ""These are unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain."" Mr Powell wants to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Simply put, that means if people believe inflation will be high, they will alter their behaviour accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, someone who thinks prices will go up 3% next year is more likely to seek a 3% rise in wages. The last time this happened, Mr Powell's predecessor, Paul Volcker, had to slam on the brakes, raising interest rates dramatically and sending the economy into recession. In March, the Federal Reserve's key interest rate was almost zero; it has since been raised to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% in an effort to tackle inflation.

"Stansted airport now charges Â£7 for a 15 minutes drop-off, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. More than two thirds of the UK's 22 busiest airports have introduced or increased charges for drivers to drop off passengers since the start of the pandemic, the RAC says. Stansted charges the most of drop-offs, while London City is free and Belfast and Cardiff are free for set amounts of time, the motoring group says. Sixteen of the 22 airports analysed introduced or increased the charges. The RAC said it appeared airports were trying to recoup pandemic losses. The motoring group said drivers would be ""stunned"" by some of the ""sky-high"" fees. Researchers for the organisation found Stansted currently charges Â£7 for 15 minutes, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. This was closely followed by Manchester Airport, which charges Â£5 for five minutes - up from Â£3 in three years ago. Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's busiest airports have introduced a charges of Â£5 for drop-offs. Supermarkets not passing on lower fuel price - RAC Bristol had 'fastest recovery' of any UK airport Heathrow extends passenger cap to end of October Meanwhile, Luton, Bristol, Leeds Bradford and Southend all charge Â£5 for 10 minutes. The RAC said in Scotland, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow airports doubled their fees compared to 2019 levels, charging Â£4 for a 10 minute stay. It said London City is the cheapest as it is free and has no time limit, while Belfast City is free for 10 minutes and Cardiff is free for five. Birmingham and Belfast International airports were among five out of the 22 to have kept their fees the same since 2019. Manchester Airport increased its charges by Â£3, according to the research The Airport Operators Association, the body which represents airports, said customers had been provided clear information on the cost of car parking and drop-off options, adding many airports offered free drop-off and pick-up alternatives with good links to the terminals. A spokesperson added that charges for dropping off directly outside terminals were operated for a number of different reasons, including to manage congestion. Nicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, said that the airports had hiked fees to ""partially make up"" for the lost revenue during the pandemic. ""Anyone dropping a loved one off at the terminal this summer will be stunned by some of these sky-high, kiss-and-drop charges,"" he said. ""And for those using the UK's two busiest airports, the luxury of free drop-offs outside the terminal building has been replaced by some pretty high fees. ""Minute for minute and pound for pound, some of these charges could almost be as high as the airfare itself,"" he added. Mr Lyes warned people to be aware that many airports use cameras to spot drop-off cars in the wrong areas and said going over the time limit could typically cost more than the initial parking fee.

"Many high street shops, supermarkets and banks change their logos, adding new window displays and selling special products to celebrate Pride Major retailers are slapping rainbows on products in a bid to cash in on Pride, LGBTQ+ campaigners have claimed. The Queer Emporium said they welcomed the extra visibility, but said very little money was going to the community and it felt like a ""money grab"". An activist said there were also concerns around the exploitation ofworkers making merchandise in countries where it is illegal to be gay. Pride Cymru said it was ""heartening"" to see many brands embracing Pride. ""Huge amounts of massive companies do just slap rainbows on their products and sell them at a higher price,"" said Yan White, founder and director of social enterprise and not-for-profit Queer Emporium. Pride at 50: Rare photos of early marches Protest, joy, safety: What does Pride mean to you? He added that even when a portion of profit was donated to a community group or charity, it was relatively ""minuscule"". Mr White felt that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, are not held to account because people just choose to ignore it ""Lots of brands will create rainbow versions of their products, but the reality is there's very little, if any money actually going back to the LGBTQ+ community. He added that whilst the increased visibility was good, as well as things like LGBTQ+ networks in companies, he believed businesses profiting from merchandise could do more to help communities. ""I think the trans community is by far the most persecuted in the UK in the media and on a political level as well, so I think a lot of those companies could throw their weight behind that particular group, I think that could make a bigger difference if they really do want to do something progressive."" Have attitudes to LGBTQ+ people really changed? Initially set up for four weeks during last year's Pride month, to offer a more localised service to people who wanted to celebrate the occasion, the Cardiff store has remained open and now works with around 20 LGBTQ+ businesses. The rainbow flag is an important symbol for pride, but there is more than one kind of rainbow flag, and some parts of the LGBTQ+ community have their own flags The rainbow flag - a symbol for the LGBTQ+ community - first appeared back in 1978, when artist Gilbert Baker made a design with eight stripes to be used on gay freedom day in San Francisco. It's use spread across America, and by the 1990s it was a symbol for people trying to get equal rights for the community. The range of bright colours are used by some as a symbol to celebrate differences, to say everyone should feel included no matter who they love or how they feel about themselves, and to show support for the community. The red stripe represents life, orange represents healing, yellow represents sunlight, green represents nature, blue represents art and violet represents the human spirit. Over the last few years the flag has changed and been updated to represent more communities. This video can not be played Pride in London: What do the flags mean? Mr White said he had noticed a growing desire among customers for ethically made products. ""I think there is a problem where if you want to shop in a shop like mine, you would expect that level of ethics to be there. ""I'm glad we're held to account but I feel that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, just aren't, because people just choose to ignore it."" Mr White said what many of the massive companies donate to LGBTQ+ organisations was minuscule compared to how much money they have Izzy McLeod from Cardiff said while it was nice to have reached a place where rainbows were on a lot of products, they were concerned about conditions for workers making the products. ""We shouldn't be relying on exploitation of other people for us to celebrate ourselves,"" the activist said. Pride clothes made in anti-gay countries 'Huge step' for Pride Cymru - 35 years ago Izzy said people should prioritise buying pride merchandise from LGBTQ+ creatives all year round, not just during Pride season ""These corporations are doing it because it is profitable, and when they're doing it in a way that's saying 'we support LGBTQ+ people whilst making merchandise in countries where maybe it's illegal to be gay', then it comes across as very 'we're going to take your money, but we're not going to do the work,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Pride should be about queer liberation for all, not just capitalising on the pink pound, we cannot continue to let brands pander to one part of the LGBTQ community, while participating in the exploitation of another."" Izzy said no-one should feel guilty if they had already bought merchandise from a major retailer - the focus should be more on calling out brands who could do more. ""It's about empowering people to make a change, but while shouting at those who do have the power to make those changes,"" the campaigner added. Izzy started the campaign ""Who Made My Pride Merch?"" which asks brands who is making their pride collections, and standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ garment workers worldwide They would also like to see customers support queer creatives wherever possible, not just for Pride merchandise but all year round. Izzy added that more people were now aware of the origins of Pride, in that it is both a protest and a party, and question if organisations getting involved are reflecting the right values. ""When I've been to prides across the UK, there are several corporate organisations with their rainbow logos in the parade, but you don't see any community organisations, or people who try and join get kicked off and that's the opposite of what should be happening."" ""These brands should be helping, not taking up the space themselves - they are never going to change, unless we make them change."" This video can not be played Cardiff Pride march - and how it took its first steps in 1985 A spokesperson for Pride Cymru said: ""Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have seen so many household names embracing Pride so openly in their brand and it is heartening for staff and customers to see they are loved and valued. ""Although we do think profit sharing with LGBTQ+ charities should be considered on Pride themed merchandise, we also wholeheartedly agree that companies must have ethical supply chains, which enhance the rights of our LGBTQ+ family around the world."" Pride in Cardiff is back this year, after it was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic The Welsh Retail Consortium said retailers were keen to support the LGBTQ+ community. ""The selling of items that promote the LGBTQ+ community shows a huge step forward in the attitudes of the country towards this minority group, furthermore, nearly eighty leading retailers came together in 2021 to sign the WRC's Diversity and Inclusion charter, which aims to embed better representation of minority groups, including LGBTQ+, within all levels of retail.""

Russia objected to adraft text,externalciting ""grave concern"" over military activities around Ukraine's nuclear plants, in particular Zaporizhzhia. Participants in the last review in 2015 alsofailed to reach an agreement. The 2022 meeting, which had been due in 2020, was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The failure to agree a joint declaration followed a four-week conference in New York. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she was ""deeply disappointed"" at the lack of agreement.

Campaigners hail new era for nuclear disarmament Who can have nuclear weapons? Russia was opposed to a section of the text expressing ""grave concern"" over military activities around Ukrainian power plants - including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which Russia seized early on in the war in Ukraine.

Russia's representative, Igor Vishnevetsky, said the draft final text lacked ""balance"". ""Our delegation has one key objection on some paragraphs which are blatantly political in nature,"" he said - adding that other countries also disagreed with the text. The final document needed approval of all countries at the conference. A number of countries, includingthe Netherlands,externalandChina,external, expressed disappointment that no consensus had been reached. The Dutch said they were ""content with the useful discussions"", but ""very disappointed that we have not reached consensus"". China's ambassador, meanwhile, said despite the lack of agreement, the process was ""an important practice of common security and genuine multilateralism"". The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons regretted,externalthat ""in a year when a nuclear-armed state invaded a non-nuclear armed state, a meeting of nearly all countries in the world failed to take action on nuclear disarmament"", while the Washington-based Arms Control Association said the conference represented a ""missed opportunity to strengthen the treaty and global security"".

Russia's military took control of the plant, the largest nuclear plant in Europe, in early March, but it is still being operated by Ukrainian staff under difficult conditions.

"Jerome Powell in Wyoming Stock markets in the US ended the week sharply down following tough comments by the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve. The bank's chairman, Jerome Powell, said the bank must continue to raise interest rates to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy. His words sent US stocks into a tailspin, with markets tumbling 3%. It comes as Americans are having to pay more for basic goods. Inflation in the world's largest economy is at a four-decade high. During a highly anticipated speech at a conference in Wyoming on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve would probably impose further interest rate hikes in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"". ""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,"" he said at the meeting in Jackson Hole. Investors are concerned that if economic growth falters, higher interest rates will increase the likelihood of a recession. Mr Powell conceded that getting inflation under control would come at a cost to American households and businesses but he argued it was a price worth paying. ""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to household and businesses,"" he said. ""These are unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain."" Mr Powell wants to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Simply put, that means if people believe inflation will be high, they will alter their behaviour accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, someone who thinks prices will go up 3% next year is more likely to seek a 3% rise in wages. The last time this happened, Mr Powell's predecessor, Paul Volcker, had to slam on the brakes, raising interest rates dramatically and sending the economy into recession. In March, the Federal Reserve's key interest rate was almost zero; it has since been raised to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% in an effort to tackle inflation.

"Stansted airport now charges Â£7 for a 15 minutes drop-off, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. More than two thirds of the UK's 22 busiest airports have introduced or increased charges for drivers to drop off passengers since the start of the pandemic, the RAC says. Stansted charges the most of drop-offs, while London City is free and Belfast and Cardiff are free for set amounts of time, the motoring group says. Sixteen of the 22 airports analysed introduced or increased the charges. The RAC said it appeared airports were trying to recoup pandemic losses. The motoring group said drivers would be ""stunned"" by some of the ""sky-high"" fees. Researchers for the organisation found Stansted currently charges Â£7 for 15 minutes, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. This was closely followed by Manchester Airport, which charges Â£5 for five minutes - up from Â£3 in three years ago. Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's busiest airports have introduced a charges of Â£5 for drop-offs. Supermarkets not passing on lower fuel price - RAC Bristol had 'fastest recovery' of any UK airport Heathrow extends passenger cap to end of October Meanwhile, Luton, Bristol, Leeds Bradford and Southend all charge Â£5 for 10 minutes. The RAC said in Scotland, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow airports doubled their fees compared to 2019 levels, charging Â£4 for a 10 minute stay. It said London City is the cheapest as it is free and has no time limit, while Belfast City is free for 10 minutes and Cardiff is free for five. Birmingham and Belfast International airports were among five out of the 22 to have kept their fees the same since 2019. Manchester Airport increased its charges by Â£3, according to the research The Airport Operators Association, the body which represents airports, said customers had been provided clear information on the cost of car parking and drop-off options, adding many airports offered free drop-off and pick-up alternatives with good links to the terminals. A spokesperson added that charges for dropping off directly outside terminals were operated for a number of different reasons, including to manage congestion. Nicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, said that the airports had hiked fees to ""partially make up"" for the lost revenue during the pandemic. ""Anyone dropping a loved one off at the terminal this summer will be stunned by some of these sky-high, kiss-and-drop charges,"" he said. ""And for those using the UK's two busiest airports, the luxury of free drop-offs outside the terminal building has been replaced by some pretty high fees. ""Minute for minute and pound for pound, some of these charges could almost be as high as the airfare itself,"" he added. Mr Lyes warned people to be aware that many airports use cameras to spot drop-off cars in the wrong areas and said going over the time limit could typically cost more than the initial parking fee.

"Many high street shops, supermarkets and banks change their logos, adding new window displays and selling special products to celebrate Pride Major retailers are slapping rainbows on products in a bid to cash in on Pride, LGBTQ+ campaigners have claimed. The Queer Emporium said they welcomed the extra visibility, but said very little money was going to the community and it felt like a ""money grab"". An activist said there were also concerns around the exploitation ofworkers making merchandise in countries where it is illegal to be gay. Pride Cymru said it was ""heartening"" to see many brands embracing Pride. ""Huge amounts of massive companies do just slap rainbows on their products and sell them at a higher price,"" said Yan White, founder and director of social enterprise and not-for-profit Queer Emporium. Pride at 50: Rare photos of early marches Protest, joy, safety: What does Pride mean to you? He added that even when a portion of profit was donated to a community group or charity, it was relatively ""minuscule"". Mr White felt that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, are not held to account because people just choose to ignore it ""Lots of brands will create rainbow versions of their products, but the reality is there's very little, if any money actually going back to the LGBTQ+ community. He added that whilst the increased visibility was good, as well as things like LGBTQ+ networks in companies, he believed businesses profiting from merchandise could do more to help communities. ""I think the trans community is by far the most persecuted in the UK in the media and on a political level as well, so I think a lot of those companies could throw their weight behind that particular group, I think that could make a bigger difference if they really do want to do something progressive."" Have attitudes to LGBTQ+ people really changed? Initially set up for four weeks during last year's Pride month, to offer a more localised service to people who wanted to celebrate the occasion, the Cardiff store has remained open and now works with around 20 LGBTQ+ businesses. The rainbow flag is an important symbol for pride, but there is more than one kind of rainbow flag, and some parts of the LGBTQ+ community have their own flags The rainbow flag - a symbol for the LGBTQ+ community - first appeared back in 1978, when artist Gilbert Baker made a design with eight stripes to be used on gay freedom day in San Francisco. It's use spread across America, and by the 1990s it was a symbol for people trying to get equal rights for the community. The range of bright colours are used by some as a symbol to celebrate differences, to say everyone should feel included no matter who they love or how they feel about themselves, and to show support for the community. The red stripe represents life, orange represents healing, yellow represents sunlight, green represents nature, blue represents art and violet represents the human spirit. Over the last few years the flag has changed and been updated to represent more communities. This video can not be played Pride in London: What do the flags mean? Mr White said he had noticed a growing desire among customers for ethically made products. ""I think there is a problem where if you want to shop in a shop like mine, you would expect that level of ethics to be there. ""I'm glad we're held to account but I feel that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, just aren't, because people just choose to ignore it."" Mr White said what many of the massive companies donate to LGBTQ+ organisations was minuscule compared to how much money they have Izzy McLeod from Cardiff said while it was nice to have reached a place where rainbows were on a lot of products, they were concerned about conditions for workers making the products. ""We shouldn't be relying on exploitation of other people for us to celebrate ourselves,"" the activist said. Pride clothes made in anti-gay countries 'Huge step' for Pride Cymru - 35 years ago Izzy said people should prioritise buying pride merchandise from LGBTQ+ creatives all year round, not just during Pride season ""These corporations are doing it because it is profitable, and when they're doing it in a way that's saying 'we support LGBTQ+ people whilst making merchandise in countries where maybe it's illegal to be gay', then it comes across as very 'we're going to take your money, but we're not going to do the work,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Pride should be about queer liberation for all, not just capitalising on the pink pound, we cannot continue to let brands pander to one part of the LGBTQ community, while participating in the exploitation of another."" Izzy said no-one should feel guilty if they had already bought merchandise from a major retailer - the focus should be more on calling out brands who could do more. ""It's about empowering people to make a change, but while shouting at those who do have the power to make those changes,"" the campaigner added. Izzy started the campaign ""Who Made My Pride Merch?"" which asks brands who is making their pride collections, and standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ garment workers worldwide They would also like to see customers support queer creatives wherever possible, not just for Pride merchandise but all year round. Izzy added that more people were now aware of the origins of Pride, in that it is both a protest and a party, and question if organisations getting involved are reflecting the right values. ""When I've been to prides across the UK, there are several corporate organisations with their rainbow logos in the parade, but you don't see any community organisations, or people who try and join get kicked off and that's the opposite of what should be happening."" ""These brands should be helping, not taking up the space themselves - they are never going to change, unless we make them change."" This video can not be played Cardiff Pride march - and how it took its first steps in 1985 A spokesperson for Pride Cymru said: ""Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have seen so many household names embracing Pride so openly in their brand and it is heartening for staff and customers to see they are loved and valued. ""Although we do think profit sharing with LGBTQ+ charities should be considered on Pride themed merchandise, we also wholeheartedly agree that companies must have ethical supply chains, which enhance the rights of our LGBTQ+ family around the world."" Pride in Cardiff is back this year, after it was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic The Welsh Retail Consortium said retailers were keen to support the LGBTQ+ community. ""The selling of items that promote the LGBTQ+ community shows a huge step forward in the attitudes of the country towards this minority group, furthermore, nearly eighty leading retailers came together in 2021 to sign the WRC's Diversity and Inclusion charter, which aims to embed better representation of minority groups, including LGBTQ+, within all levels of retail.""

"Middle-earners, as well as low earners, are likely to need government help to pay their energy bills this winter, Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has warned. The energy regulator hiked the price cap on household bills by 80% on Friday, meaning the average bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said even those earning Â£45,000 a year may need support. He said the Treasury was exploring ""all the options"" to help households. He added that the country was in a ""national economic emergency [that] could go on for 18 months, two years"". Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, one of whom will be announced as the next prime minister on 5 September, have pledged further support, though neither has given details. Environment Secretary George Eustice defended the wait for policy announcements from either candidate, saying it was right that whoever got the top job would ""want to look at all of the options, properly costed"" when they take office. ""Both candidates have said they will do more - you don't have long to wait,"" Mr Eustice told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""They've both made clear that this will be absolutely at the top of their in tray,"" he added. The government has already said that all households will get a Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650. Mr Salvatierra is unsure he'll be able to have another child because of the cost of living crisis Francisco Salvatierra, 37, in Cardiff has been a teacher for the last seven years and earns Â£38,000 teaching Spanish in Caerphilly.  He and his wife's joint household income is about Â£56,000. Even with two incomes, we're facing financial difficulties. Our rent has increased by Â£200, and our energy bills are likely to hit Â£350 a month. What does it say in a country where people are working but they can't afford to pay for their energy? I have a decent job, but it doesn't stop me from experiencing financial struggles. Getting a mortgage is science fiction. It's almost Â£1,000 in rent for our flat alone, so how are we going to save for a 10% deposit. I have had to accept that I'll never be able to get onto the housing ladder. I'd love to have a second baby, but it was hard enough to have a first one [which is due on Boxing Day]. We kept postponing the decision because of financial worries, but having a second one - I now don't think that's going to happen. The idea of getting a Â£400 payment doesn't solve anything. We need more than charity, we need social and financial justice, like taxing energy companies who have billions in profits. The rise in the energy price cap- which is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge households per unit of energy - means millions of households will see their annual bills rise from about Â£1,971 currently. Typical prepayment meter customers will also see their bills rise to Â£3,608. Charities and experts have warned that the rise will have a devastating impact on households and that lives will be at risk without government intervention. 'Lives at risk' as energy price cap soars by 80% What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? In his interview with the Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said he was also concerned about those who were not on benefits. ""If you are a senior nurse or a senior teacher on Â£45,000 a year, you're having your energy bills go up by 80% and will probably rise even higher in the new year - it's really hard. ""If you're a pensioner, it's really hard. So Universal Credit is a really effective way of targeting, but I'm looking at what else we can do to make sure we help those who really need the help."" The price cap, set by the regulator, Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 Mr Zahawi said the options being drawn up for the next prime minister to consider included an increase in benefits and a loan scheme for energy suppliers to stop them having to pass costs on to consumers. He said a price cap freeze had not been ruled out, though he expressed concern that the measure would also benefit households that could afford to pay higher energy costs. Mr Zahawi added that a number of measures to help small businesses, including temporary reductions to VAT, business rates, or green levies, were being considered, saying a failure to help business would leave a ""longer-term scarring effect on the economy"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for failing to respond to the growing crisis. Labour says its own plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid for in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Asked whether it was right that even the richest would benefit, Labour's Darren Jones - chair of the department for business, energy and industrial strategy committee of MPs - said ""the vast majority of people"" would be affected by the rises. He added that the government was not set up well enough to get money to people in a targeted way. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said people were already saying they would be unable to heat their homes or put food on their tables. ""These are costs people simply can't afford,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""The government has a responsibility to step in."" Mr Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter, and added: ""This is an emergency as big as the Covid crisis. In such a scenario, the government has a responsibility to act."" Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Mr Zahawi also split with cabinet colleagues who have so far resisted suggestions that households should be encouraged to reduce their energy usage. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that choices about energy consumption remained ""decisions for individuals"". Asked about the issue, Mr Zahawi said: ""The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption."" He told the Telegraph the country would have to be resilient as it continued to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion. ""Putin has worked out that he can use energy as a tool to hit back at us,"" he said. ""And we're going to need to send a message back to Putin that this is not going to soften our resolve.""

The price cap, set by the regulator, Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 Mr Zahawi said the options being drawn up for the next prime minister to consider included an increase in benefits and a loan scheme for energy suppliers to stop them having to pass costs on to consumers. He said a price cap freeze had not been ruled out, though he expressed concern that the measure would also benefit households that could afford to pay higher energy costs. Mr Zahawi added that a number of measures to help small businesses, including temporary reductions to VAT, business rates, or green levies, were being considered, saying a failure to help business would leave a ""longer-term scarring effect on the economy"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for failing to respond to the growing crisis. Labour says its own plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid for in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Asked whether it was right that even the richest would benefit, Labour's Darren Jones - chair of the department for business, energy and industrial strategy committee of MPs - said ""the vast majority of people"" would be affected by the rises. He added that the government was not set up well enough to get money to people in a targeted way. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said people were already saying they would be unable to heat their homes or put food on their tables. ""These are costs people simply can't afford,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""The government has a responsibility to step in."" Mr Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter, and added: ""This is an emergency as big as the Covid crisis. In such a scenario, the government has a responsibility to act."" Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Mr Zahawi also split with cabinet colleagues who have so far resisted suggestions that households should be encouraged to reduce their energy usage. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that choices about energy consumption remained ""decisions for individuals"". Asked about the issue, Mr Zahawi said: ""The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption."" He told the Telegraph the country would have to be resilient as it continued to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion. ""Putin has worked out that he can use energy as a tool to hit back at us,"" he said. ""And we're going to need to send a message back to Putin that this is not going to soften our resolve.""

"Many high street shops, supermarkets and banks change their logos, adding new window displays and selling special products to celebrate Pride Major retailers are slapping rainbows on products in a bid to cash in on Pride, LGBTQ+ campaigners have claimed. The Queer Emporium said they welcomed the extra visibility, but said very little money was going to the community and it felt like a ""money grab"". An activist said there were also concerns around the exploitation ofworkers making merchandise in countries where it is illegal to be gay. Pride Cymru said it was ""heartening"" to see many brands embracing Pride. ""Huge amounts of massive companies do just slap rainbows on their products and sell them at a higher price,"" said Yan White, founder and director of social enterprise and not-for-profit Queer Emporium. Pride at 50: Rare photos of early marches Protest, joy, safety: What does Pride mean to you? He added that even when a portion of profit was donated to a community group or charity, it was relatively ""minuscule"". Mr White felt that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, are not held to account because people just choose to ignore it ""Lots of brands will create rainbow versions of their products, but the reality is there's very little, if any money actually going back to the LGBTQ+ community. He added that whilst the increased visibility was good, as well as things like LGBTQ+ networks in companies, he believed businesses profiting from merchandise could do more to help communities. ""I think the trans community is by far the most persecuted in the UK in the media and on a political level as well, so I think a lot of those companies could throw their weight behind that particular group, I think that could make a bigger difference if they really do want to do something progressive."" Have attitudes to LGBTQ+ people really changed? Initially set up for four weeks during last year's Pride month, to offer a more localised service to people who wanted to celebrate the occasion, the Cardiff store has remained open and now works with around 20 LGBTQ+ businesses. The rainbow flag is an important symbol for pride, but there is more than one kind of rainbow flag, and some parts of the LGBTQ+ community have their own flags The rainbow flag - a symbol for the LGBTQ+ community - first appeared back in 1978, when artist Gilbert Baker made a design with eight stripes to be used on gay freedom day in San Francisco. It's use spread across America, and by the 1990s it was a symbol for people trying to get equal rights for the community. The range of bright colours are used by some as a symbol to celebrate differences, to say everyone should feel included no matter who they love or how they feel about themselves, and to show support for the community. The red stripe represents life, orange represents healing, yellow represents sunlight, green represents nature, blue represents art and violet represents the human spirit. Over the last few years the flag has changed and been updated to represent more communities. This video can not be played Pride in London: What do the flags mean? Mr White said he had noticed a growing desire among customers for ethically made products. ""I think there is a problem where if you want to shop in a shop like mine, you would expect that level of ethics to be there. ""I'm glad we're held to account but I feel that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, just aren't, because people just choose to ignore it."" Mr White said what many of the massive companies donate to LGBTQ+ organisations was minuscule compared to how much money they have Izzy McLeod from Cardiff said while it was nice to have reached a place where rainbows were on a lot of products, they were concerned about conditions for workers making the products. ""We shouldn't be relying on exploitation of other people for us to celebrate ourselves,"" the activist said. Pride clothes made in anti-gay countries 'Huge step' for Pride Cymru - 35 years ago Izzy said people should prioritise buying pride merchandise from LGBTQ+ creatives all year round, not just during Pride season ""These corporations are doing it because it is profitable, and when they're doing it in a way that's saying 'we support LGBTQ+ people whilst making merchandise in countries where maybe it's illegal to be gay', then it comes across as very 'we're going to take your money, but we're not going to do the work,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Pride should be about queer liberation for all, not just capitalising on the pink pound, we cannot continue to let brands pander to one part of the LGBTQ community, while participating in the exploitation of another."" Izzy said no-one should feel guilty if they had already bought merchandise from a major retailer - the focus should be more on calling out brands who could do more. ""It's about empowering people to make a change, but while shouting at those who do have the power to make those changes,"" the campaigner added. Izzy started the campaign ""Who Made My Pride Merch?"" which asks brands who is making their pride collections, and standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ garment workers worldwide They would also like to see customers support queer creatives wherever possible, not just for Pride merchandise but all year round. Izzy added that more people were now aware of the origins of Pride, in that it is both a protest and a party, and question if organisations getting involved are reflecting the right values. ""When I've been to prides across the UK, there are several corporate organisations with their rainbow logos in the parade, but you don't see any community organisations, or people who try and join get kicked off and that's the opposite of what should be happening."" ""These brands should be helping, not taking up the space themselves - they are never going to change, unless we make them change."" This video can not be played Cardiff Pride march - and how it took its first steps in 1985 A spokesperson for Pride Cymru said: ""Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have seen so many household names embracing Pride so openly in their brand and it is heartening for staff and customers to see they are loved and valued. ""Although we do think profit sharing with LGBTQ+ charities should be considered on Pride themed merchandise, we also wholeheartedly agree that companies must have ethical supply chains, which enhance the rights of our LGBTQ+ family around the world."" Pride in Cardiff is back this year, after it was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic The Welsh Retail Consortium said retailers were keen to support the LGBTQ+ community. ""The selling of items that promote the LGBTQ+ community shows a huge step forward in the attitudes of the country towards this minority group, furthermore, nearly eighty leading retailers came together in 2021 to sign the WRC's Diversity and Inclusion charter, which aims to embed better representation of minority groups, including LGBTQ+, within all levels of retail.""

"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door A second man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool. The 33-year-old, from Dovecot, Liverpool, was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. He was arrested by armed officers on Lunsford Road, Dovecot, and is being questioned by detectives. Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of their Liverpool home on Monday. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: ""The investigation into Olivia's tragic murder is ongoing and we still need to build up a strong evidential picture so that we can bring those responsible to justice."" The force earlier released aerial footage of the arrest of a 36-year-oldman on suspicion of murder. The man, from Huyton, was detained during an operation involving armed officers on Thursday night. Floral and written tributes have been left in memory of Olivia near where the shooting happened He was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. Olivia was killed after Cheryl Korbel, 46, opened her front door on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at 22:00 BST in response to a commotion outside. The intended target of the attack, 35-year-old Joseph Nee, was being chased by a gunman. The men - complete strangers to the family - burst in and Olivia was fatally shot. Ms Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door and has now been released from hospital. Olivia was described by her family as a ""unique, chatty, nosey little girl who broke the mould when she was born"". Nee, from Dovecot, was shot in the upper body and taken to hospital in a black Audi by a third man. Once his treatment is completed, Nee will be recalled to prison for allegedly breaching the terms of his licence conditions. Earlier police released an image of the car believed to have taken the intended target to hospital. This video can not be played Footage of the arrest of a man on suspicion of murdering Olivia Pratt-Korbel is released The vehicle has been seized and is in the process of being forensically examined, officers said, as they appealed to anyone who saw the black Audi Q3 in the days leading up to the shooting to get in touch. Det Supt Mark Baker said: ""Although we have made an arrest in connection with the horrific murder of Olivia, I want to make it completely clear that we need any information about this vehicle or the wider investigation as much as ever.

"Participants in the review met at UN headquarters in New York, starting on 1 August Russia has blocked the adoption of a joint declaration by a United Nations conference on nuclear disarmament. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is reviewed by its 191 signatories every five years, aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

"Jerome Powell in Wyoming Stock markets in the US ended the week sharply down following tough comments by the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve. The bank's chairman, Jerome Powell, said the bank must continue to raise interest rates to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy. His words sent US stocks into a tailspin, with markets tumbling 3%. It comes as Americans are having to pay more for basic goods. Inflation in the world's largest economy is at a four-decade high. During a highly anticipated speech at a conference in Wyoming on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve would probably impose further interest rate hikes in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"". ""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,"" he said at the meeting in Jackson Hole. Investors are concerned that if economic growth falters, higher interest rates will increase the likelihood of a recession. Mr Powell conceded that getting inflation under control would come at a cost to American households and businesses but he argued it was a price worth paying. ""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to household and businesses,"" he said. ""These are unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain."" Mr Powell wants to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Simply put, that means if people believe inflation will be high, they will alter their behaviour accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, someone who thinks prices will go up 3% next year is more likely to seek a 3% rise in wages. The last time this happened, Mr Powell's predecessor, Paul Volcker, had to slam on the brakes, raising interest rates dramatically and sending the economy into recession.

"Stansted airport now charges Â£7 for a 15 minutes drop-off, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. More than two thirds of the UK's 22 busiest airports have introduced or increased charges for drivers to drop off passengers since the start of the pandemic, the RAC says. Stansted charges the most of drop-offs, while London City is free and Belfast and Cardiff are free for set amounts of time, the motoring group says. Sixteen of the 22 airports analysed introduced or increased the charges. The RAC said it appeared airports were trying to recoup pandemic losses. The motoring group said drivers would be ""stunned"" by some of the ""sky-high"" fees. Researchers for the organisation found Stansted currently charges Â£7 for 15 minutes, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. This was closely followed by Manchester Airport, which charges Â£5 for five minutes - up from Â£3 in three years ago. Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's busiest airports have introduced a charges of Â£5 for drop-offs. Supermarkets not passing on lower fuel price - RAC Bristol had 'fastest recovery' of any UK airport Heathrow extends passenger cap to end of October Meanwhile, Luton, Bristol, Leeds Bradford and Southend all charge Â£5 for 10 minutes. The RAC said in Scotland, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow airports doubled their fees compared to 2019 levels, charging Â£4 for a 10 minute stay. It said London City is the cheapest as it is free and has no time limit, while Belfast City is free for 10 minutes and Cardiff is free for five. Birmingham and Belfast International airports were among five out of the 22 to have kept their fees the same since 2019. Manchester Airport increased its charges by Â£3, according to the research The Airport Operators Association, the body which represents airports, said customers had been provided clear information on the cost of car parking and drop-off options, adding many airports offered free drop-off and pick-up alternatives with good links to the terminals. A spokesperson added that charges for dropping off directly outside terminals were operated for a number of different reasons, including to manage congestion. Nicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, said that the airports had hiked fees to ""partially make up"" for the lost revenue during the pandemic. ""Anyone dropping a loved one off at the terminal this summer will be stunned by some of these sky-high, kiss-and-drop charges,"" he said. ""And for those using the UK's two busiest airports, the luxury of free drop-offs outside the terminal building has been replaced by some pretty high fees. ""Minute for minute and pound for pound, some of these charges could almost be as high as the airfare itself,"" he added.

"Participants in the review met at UN headquarters in New York, starting on 1 August Russia has blocked the adoption of a joint declaration by a United Nations conference on nuclear disarmament. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is reviewed by its 191 signatories every five years, aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

Russia's representative, Igor Vishnevetsky, said the draft final text lacked ""balance"".

"Jerome Powell in Wyoming Stock markets in the US ended the week sharply down following tough comments by the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve. The bank's chairman, Jerome Powell, said the bank must continue to raise interest rates to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy. His words sent US stocks into a tailspin, with markets tumbling 3%. It comes as Americans are having to pay more for basic goods. Inflation in the world's largest economy is at a four-decade high. During a highly anticipated speech at a conference in Wyoming on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve would probably impose further interest rate hikes in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"". ""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,"" he said at the meeting in Jackson Hole. Investors are concerned that if economic growth falters, higher interest rates will increase the likelihood of a recession. Mr Powell conceded that getting inflation under control would come at a cost to American households and businesses but he argued it was a price worth paying. ""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to household and businesses,"" he said. ""These are unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain."" Mr Powell wants to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Simply put, that means if people believe inflation will be high, they will alter their behaviour accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, someone who thinks prices will go up 3% next year is more likely to seek a 3% rise in wages. The last time this happened, Mr Powell's predecessor, Paul Volcker, had to slam on the brakes, raising interest rates dramatically and sending the economy into recession. In March, the Federal Reserve's key interest rate was almost zero; it has since been raised to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% in an effort to tackle inflation.

"Stansted airport now charges Â£7 for a 15 minutes drop-off, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. More than two thirds of the UK's 22 busiest airports have introduced or increased charges for drivers to drop off passengers since the start of the pandemic, the RAC says. Stansted charges the most of drop-offs, while London City is free and Belfast and Cardiff are free for set amounts of time, the motoring group says. Sixteen of the 22 airports analysed introduced or increased the charges. The RAC said it appeared airports were trying to recoup pandemic losses. The motoring group said drivers would be ""stunned"" by some of the ""sky-high"" fees. Researchers for the organisation found Stansted currently charges Â£7 for 15 minutes, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. This was closely followed by Manchester Airport, which charges Â£5 for five minutes - up from Â£3 in three years ago. Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's busiest airports have introduced a charges of Â£5 for drop-offs. Supermarkets not passing on lower fuel price - RAC Bristol had 'fastest recovery' of any UK airport Heathrow extends passenger cap to end of October Meanwhile, Luton, Bristol, Leeds Bradford and Southend all charge Â£5 for 10 minutes. The RAC said in Scotland, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow airports doubled their fees compared to 2019 levels, charging Â£4 for a 10 minute stay. It said London City is the cheapest as it is free and has no time limit, while Belfast City is free for 10 minutes and Cardiff is free for five. Birmingham and Belfast International airports were among five out of the 22 to have kept their fees the same since 2019. Manchester Airport increased its charges by Â£3, according to the research The Airport Operators Association, the body which represents airports, said customers had been provided clear information on the cost of car parking and drop-off options, adding many airports offered free drop-off and pick-up alternatives with good links to the terminals. A spokesperson added that charges for dropping off directly outside terminals were operated for a number of different reasons, including to manage congestion. Nicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, said that the airports had hiked fees to ""partially make up"" for the lost revenue during the pandemic. ""Anyone dropping a loved one off at the terminal this summer will be stunned by some of these sky-high, kiss-and-drop charges,"" he said. ""And for those using the UK's two busiest airports, the luxury of free drop-offs outside the terminal building has been replaced by some pretty high fees. ""Minute for minute and pound for pound, some of these charges could almost be as high as the airfare itself,"" he added. Mr Lyes warned people to be aware that many airports use cameras to spot drop-off cars in the wrong areas and said going over the time limit could typically cost more than the initial parking fee.

"Many high street shops, supermarkets and banks change their logos, adding new window displays and selling special products to celebrate Pride Major retailers are slapping rainbows on products in a bid to cash in on Pride, LGBTQ+ campaigners have claimed. The Queer Emporium said they welcomed the extra visibility, but said very little money was going to the community and it felt like a ""money grab"". An activist said there were also concerns around the exploitation ofworkers making merchandise in countries where it is illegal to be gay. Pride Cymru said it was ""heartening"" to see many brands embracing Pride. ""Huge amounts of massive companies do just slap rainbows on their products and sell them at a higher price,"" said Yan White, founder and director of social enterprise and not-for-profit Queer Emporium. Pride at 50: Rare photos of early marches Protest, joy, safety: What does Pride mean to you? He added that even when a portion of profit was donated to a community group or charity, it was relatively ""minuscule"". Mr White felt that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, are not held to account because people just choose to ignore it ""Lots of brands will create rainbow versions of their products, but the reality is there's very little, if any money actually going back to the LGBTQ+ community. He added that whilst the increased visibility was good, as well as things like LGBTQ+ networks in companies, he believed businesses profiting from merchandise could do more to help communities. ""I think the trans community is by far the most persecuted in the UK in the media and on a political level as well, so I think a lot of those companies could throw their weight behind that particular group, I think that could make a bigger difference if they really do want to do something progressive."" Have attitudes to LGBTQ+ people really changed? Initially set up for four weeks during last year's Pride month, to offer a more localised service to people who wanted to celebrate the occasion, the Cardiff store has remained open and now works with around 20 LGBTQ+ businesses. The rainbow flag is an important symbol for pride, but there is more than one kind of rainbow flag, and some parts of the LGBTQ+ community have their own flags The rainbow flag - a symbol for the LGBTQ+ community - first appeared back in 1978, when artist Gilbert Baker made a design with eight stripes to be used on gay freedom day in San Francisco. It's use spread across America, and by the 1990s it was a symbol for people trying to get equal rights for the community. The range of bright colours are used by some as a symbol to celebrate differences, to say everyone should feel included no matter who they love or how they feel about themselves, and to show support for the community. The red stripe represents life, orange represents healing, yellow represents sunlight, green represents nature, blue represents art and violet represents the human spirit. Over the last few years the flag has changed and been updated to represent more communities. This video can not be played Pride in London: What do the flags mean? Mr White said he had noticed a growing desire among customers for ethically made products. ""I think there is a problem where if you want to shop in a shop like mine, you would expect that level of ethics to be there. ""I'm glad we're held to account but I feel that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, just aren't, because people just choose to ignore it."" Mr White said what many of the massive companies donate to LGBTQ+ organisations was minuscule compared to how much money they have Izzy McLeod from Cardiff said while it was nice to have reached a place where rainbows were on a lot of products, they were concerned about conditions for workers making the products. ""We shouldn't be relying on exploitation of other people for us to celebrate ourselves,"" the activist said. Pride clothes made in anti-gay countries 'Huge step' for Pride Cymru - 35 years ago Izzy said people should prioritise buying pride merchandise from LGBTQ+ creatives all year round, not just during Pride season ""These corporations are doing it because it is profitable, and when they're doing it in a way that's saying 'we support LGBTQ+ people whilst making merchandise in countries where maybe it's illegal to be gay', then it comes across as very 'we're going to take your money, but we're not going to do the work,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Pride should be about queer liberation for all, not just capitalising on the pink pound, we cannot continue to let brands pander to one part of the LGBTQ community, while participating in the exploitation of another."" Izzy said no-one should feel guilty if they had already bought merchandise from a major retailer - the focus should be more on calling out brands who could do more. ""It's about empowering people to make a change, but while shouting at those who do have the power to make those changes,"" the campaigner added. Izzy started the campaign ""Who Made My Pride Merch?"" which asks brands who is making their pride collections, and standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ garment workers worldwide They would also like to see customers support queer creatives wherever possible, not just for Pride merchandise but all year round. Izzy added that more people were now aware of the origins of Pride, in that it is both a protest and a party, and question if organisations getting involved are reflecting the right values. ""When I've been to prides across the UK, there are several corporate organisations with their rainbow logos in the parade, but you don't see any community organisations, or people who try and join get kicked off and that's the opposite of what should be happening."" ""These brands should be helping, not taking up the space themselves - they are never going to change, unless we make them change."" This video can not be played Cardiff Pride march - and how it took its first steps in 1985 A spokesperson for Pride Cymru said: ""Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have seen so many household names embracing Pride so openly in their brand and it is heartening for staff and customers to see they are loved and valued. ""Although we do think profit sharing with LGBTQ+ charities should be considered on Pride themed merchandise, we also wholeheartedly agree that companies must have ethical supply chains, which enhance the rights of our LGBTQ+ family around the world."" Pride in Cardiff is back this year, after it was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic The Welsh Retail Consortium said retailers were keen to support the LGBTQ+ community. ""The selling of items that promote the LGBTQ+ community shows a huge step forward in the attitudes of the country towards this minority group, furthermore, nearly eighty leading retailers came together in 2021 to sign the WRC's Diversity and Inclusion charter, which aims to embed better representation of minority groups, including LGBTQ+, within all levels of retail.""

"Middle-earners, as well as low earners, are likely to need government help to pay their energy bills this winter, Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has warned. The energy regulator hiked the price cap on household bills by 80% on Friday, meaning the average bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said even those earning Â£45,000 a year may need support. He said the Treasury was exploring ""all the options"" to help households. He added that the country was in a ""national economic emergency [that] could go on for 18 months, two years"". Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, one of whom will be announced as the next prime minister on 5 September, have pledged further support, though neither has given details. Environment Secretary George Eustice defended the wait for policy announcements from either candidate, saying it was right that whoever got the top job would ""want to look at all of the options, properly costed"" when they take office. ""Both candidates have said they will do more - you don't have long to wait,"" Mr Eustice told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""They've both made clear that this will be absolutely at the top of their in tray,"" he added. The government has already said that all households will get a Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650. Mr Salvatierra is unsure he'll be able to have another child because of the cost of living crisis Francisco Salvatierra, 37, in Cardiff has been a teacher for the last seven years and earns Â£38,000 teaching Spanish in Caerphilly.  He and his wife's joint household income is about Â£56,000. Even with two incomes, we're facing financial difficulties. Our rent has increased by Â£200, and our energy bills are likely to hit Â£350 a month. What does it say in a country where people are working but they can't afford to pay for their energy? I have a decent job, but it doesn't stop me from experiencing financial struggles. Getting a mortgage is science fiction. It's almost Â£1,000 in rent for our flat alone, so how are we going to save for a 10% deposit. I have had to accept that I'll never be able to get onto the housing ladder. I'd love to have a second baby, but it was hard enough to have a first one [which is due on Boxing Day]. We kept postponing the decision because of financial worries, but having a second one - I now don't think that's going to happen. The idea of getting a Â£400 payment doesn't solve anything. We need more than charity, we need social and financial justice, like taxing energy companies who have billions in profits. The rise in the energy price cap- which is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge households per unit of energy - means millions of households will see their annual bills rise from about Â£1,971 currently. Typical prepayment meter customers will also see their bills rise to Â£3,608. Charities and experts have warned that the rise will have a devastating impact on households and that lives will be at risk without government intervention. 'Lives at risk' as energy price cap soars by 80% What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? In his interview with the Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said he was also concerned about those who were not on benefits. ""If you are a senior nurse or a senior teacher on Â£45,000 a year, you're having your energy bills go up by 80% and will probably rise even higher in the new year - it's really hard. ""If you're a pensioner, it's really hard. So Universal Credit is a really effective way of targeting, but I'm looking at what else we can do to make sure we help those who really need the help."" The price cap, set by the regulator, Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 Mr Zahawi said the options being drawn up for the next prime minister to consider included an increase in benefits and a loan scheme for energy suppliers to stop them having to pass costs on to consumers. He said a price cap freeze had not been ruled out, though he expressed concern that the measure would also benefit households that could afford to pay higher energy costs. Mr Zahawi added that a number of measures to help small businesses, including temporary reductions to VAT, business rates, or green levies, were being considered, saying a failure to help business would leave a ""longer-term scarring effect on the economy"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for failing to respond to the growing crisis. Labour says its own plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid for in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Asked whether it was right that even the richest would benefit, Labour's Darren Jones - chair of the department for business, energy and industrial strategy committee of MPs - said ""the vast majority of people"" would be affected by the rises. He added that the government was not set up well enough to get money to people in a targeted way. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said people were already saying they would be unable to heat their homes or put food on their tables. ""These are costs people simply can't afford,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""The government has a responsibility to step in."" Mr Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter, and added: ""This is an emergency as big as the Covid crisis. In such a scenario, the government has a responsibility to act."" Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Mr Zahawi also split with cabinet colleagues who have so far resisted suggestions that households should be encouraged to reduce their energy usage. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that choices about energy consumption remained ""decisions for individuals"". Asked about the issue, Mr Zahawi said: ""The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption."" He told the Telegraph the country would have to be resilient as it continued to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion. ""Putin has worked out that he can use energy as a tool to hit back at us,"" he said. ""And we're going to need to send a message back to Putin that this is not going to soften our resolve.""

Our rent has increased by Â£200, and our energy bills are likely to hit Â£350 a month. What does it say in a country where people are working but they can't afford to pay for their energy? I have a decent job, but it doesn't stop me from experiencing financial struggles. Getting a mortgage is science fiction. It's almost Â£1,000 in rent for our flat alone, so how are we going to save for a 10% deposit. I have had to accept that I'll never be able to get onto the housing ladder. I'd love to have a second baby, but it was hard enough to have a first one [which is due on Boxing Day]. We kept postponing the decision because of financial worries, but having a second one - I now don't think that's going to happen. The idea of getting a Â£400 payment doesn't solve anything. We need more than charity, we need social and financial justice, like taxing energy companies who have billions in profits. The rise in the energy price cap- which is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge households per unit of energy - means millions of households will see their annual bills rise from about Â£1,971 currently. Typical prepayment meter customers will also see their bills rise to Â£3,608. Charities and experts have warned that the rise will have a devastating impact on households and that lives will be at risk without government intervention. 'Lives at risk' as energy price cap soars by 80% What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? In his interview with the Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said he was also concerned about those who were not on benefits. ""If you are a senior nurse or a senior teacher on Â£45,000 a year, you're having your energy bills go up by 80% and will probably rise even higher in the new year - it's really hard. ""If you're a pensioner, it's really hard. So Universal Credit is a really effective way of targeting, but I'm looking at what else we can do to make sure we help those who really need the help."" The price cap, set by the regulator, Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 Mr Zahawi said the options being drawn up for the next prime minister to consider included an increase in benefits and a loan scheme for energy suppliers to stop them having to pass costs on to consumers. He said a price cap freeze had not been ruled out, though he expressed concern that the measure would also benefit households that could afford to pay higher energy costs. Mr Zahawi added that a number of measures to help small businesses, including temporary reductions to VAT, business rates, or green levies, were being considered, saying a failure to help business would leave a ""longer-term scarring effect on the economy"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for failing to respond to the growing crisis. Labour says its own plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid for in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Asked whether it was right that even the richest would benefit, Labour's Darren Jones - chair of the department for business, energy and industrial strategy committee of MPs - said ""the vast majority of people"" would be affected by the rises. He added that the government was not set up well enough to get money to people in a targeted way. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said people were already saying they would be unable to heat their homes or put food on their tables. ""These are costs people simply can't afford,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""The government has a responsibility to step in."" Mr Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter, and added: ""This is an emergency as big as the Covid crisis. In such a scenario, the government has a responsibility to act."" Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Mr Zahawi also split with cabinet colleagues who have so far resisted suggestions that households should be encouraged to reduce their energy usage. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that choices about energy consumption remained ""decisions for individuals"". Asked about the issue, Mr Zahawi said: ""The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption."" He told the Telegraph the country would have to be resilient as it continued to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion. ""Putin has worked out that he can use energy as a tool to hit back at us,"" he said. ""And we're going to need to send a message back to Putin that this is not going to soften our resolve.""

"Many high street shops, supermarkets and banks change their logos, adding new window displays and selling special products to celebrate Pride Major retailers are slapping rainbows on products in a bid to cash in on Pride, LGBTQ+ campaigners have claimed. The Queer Emporium said they welcomed the extra visibility, but said very little money was going to the community and it felt like a ""money grab"". An activist said there were also concerns around the exploitation ofworkers making merchandise in countries where it is illegal to be gay. Pride Cymru said it was ""heartening"" to see many brands embracing Pride. ""Huge amounts of massive companies do just slap rainbows on their products and sell them at a higher price,"" said Yan White, founder and director of social enterprise and not-for-profit Queer Emporium. Pride at 50: Rare photos of early marches Protest, joy, safety: What does Pride mean to you? He added that even when a portion of profit was donated to a community group or charity, it was relatively ""minuscule"". Mr White felt that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, are not held to account because people just choose to ignore it ""Lots of brands will create rainbow versions of their products, but the reality is there's very little, if any money actually going back to the LGBTQ+ community. He added that whilst the increased visibility was good, as well as things like LGBTQ+ networks in companies, he believed businesses profiting from merchandise could do more to help communities. ""I think the trans community is by far the most persecuted in the UK in the media and on a political level as well, so I think a lot of those companies could throw their weight behind that particular group, I think that could make a bigger difference if they really do want to do something progressive."" Have attitudes to LGBTQ+ people really changed? Initially set up for four weeks during last year's Pride month, to offer a more localised service to people who wanted to celebrate the occasion, the Cardiff store has remained open and now works with around 20 LGBTQ+ businesses. The rainbow flag is an important symbol for pride, but there is more than one kind of rainbow flag, and some parts of the LGBTQ+ community have their own flags The rainbow flag - a symbol for the LGBTQ+ community - first appeared back in 1978, when artist Gilbert Baker made a design with eight stripes to be used on gay freedom day in San Francisco. It's use spread across America, and by the 1990s it was a symbol for people trying to get equal rights for the community. The range of bright colours are used by some as a symbol to celebrate differences, to say everyone should feel included no matter who they love or how they feel about themselves, and to show support for the community. The red stripe represents life, orange represents healing, yellow represents sunlight, green represents nature, blue represents art and violet represents the human spirit. Over the last few years the flag has changed and been updated to represent more communities. This video can not be played Pride in London: What do the flags mean? Mr White said he had noticed a growing desire among customers for ethically made products. ""I think there is a problem where if you want to shop in a shop like mine, you would expect that level of ethics to be there. ""I'm glad we're held to account but I feel that sometimes larger businesses, particularly chains, just aren't, because people just choose to ignore it."" Mr White said what many of the massive companies donate to LGBTQ+ organisations was minuscule compared to how much money they have Izzy McLeod from Cardiff said while it was nice to have reached a place where rainbows were on a lot of products, they were concerned about conditions for workers making the products. ""We shouldn't be relying on exploitation of other people for us to celebrate ourselves,"" the activist said. Pride clothes made in anti-gay countries 'Huge step' for Pride Cymru - 35 years ago Izzy said people should prioritise buying pride merchandise from LGBTQ+ creatives all year round, not just during Pride season ""These corporations are doing it because it is profitable, and when they're doing it in a way that's saying 'we support LGBTQ+ people whilst making merchandise in countries where maybe it's illegal to be gay', then it comes across as very 'we're going to take your money, but we're not going to do the work,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Pride should be about queer liberation for all, not just capitalising on the pink pound, we cannot continue to let brands pander to one part of the LGBTQ community, while participating in the exploitation of another."" Izzy said no-one should feel guilty if they had already bought merchandise from a major retailer - the focus should be more on calling out brands who could do more. ""It's about empowering people to make a change, but while shouting at those who do have the power to make those changes,"" the campaigner added. Izzy started the campaign ""Who Made My Pride Merch?"" which asks brands who is making their pride collections, and standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ garment workers worldwide They would also like to see customers support queer creatives wherever possible, not just for Pride merchandise but all year round. Izzy added that more people were now aware of the origins of Pride, in that it is both a protest and a party, and question if organisations getting involved are reflecting the right values. ""When I've been to prides across the UK, there are several corporate organisations with their rainbow logos in the parade, but you don't see any community organisations, or people who try and join get kicked off and that's the opposite of what should be happening."" ""These brands should be helping, not taking up the space themselves - they are never going to change, unless we make them change."" This video can not be played Cardiff Pride march - and how it took its first steps in 1985 A spokesperson for Pride Cymru said: ""Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have seen so many household names embracing Pride so openly in their brand and it is heartening for staff and customers to see they are loved and valued. ""Although we do think profit sharing with LGBTQ+ charities should be considered on Pride themed merchandise, we also wholeheartedly agree that companies must have ethical supply chains, which enhance the rights of our LGBTQ+ family around the world."" Pride in Cardiff is back this year, after it was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic The Welsh Retail Consortium said retailers were keen to support the LGBTQ+ community. ""The selling of items that promote the LGBTQ+ community shows a huge step forward in the attitudes of the country towards this minority group, furthermore, nearly eighty leading retailers came together in 2021 to sign the WRC's Diversity and Inclusion charter, which aims to embed better representation of minority groups, including LGBTQ+, within all levels of retail.""

"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door A second man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool. The 33-year-old, from Dovecot, Liverpool, was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. He was arrested by armed officers on Lunsford Road, Dovecot, and is being questioned by detectives. Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of their Liverpool home on Monday. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: ""The investigation into Olivia's tragic murder is ongoing and we still need to build up a strong evidential picture so that we can bring those responsible to justice."" The force earlier released aerial footage of the arrest of a 36-year-oldman on suspicion of murder. The man, from Huyton, was detained during an operation involving armed officers on Thursday night. Floral and written tributes have been left in memory of Olivia near where the shooting happened He was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. Olivia was killed after Cheryl Korbel, 46, opened her front door on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at 22:00 BST in response to a commotion outside. The intended target of the attack, 35-year-old Joseph Nee, was being chased by a gunman. The men - complete strangers to the family - burst in and Olivia was fatally shot. Ms Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door and has now been released from hospital. Olivia was described by her family as a ""unique, chatty, nosey little girl who broke the mould when she was born"". Nee, from Dovecot, was shot in the upper body and taken to hospital in a black Audi by a third man. Once his treatment is completed, Nee will be recalled to prison for allegedly breaching the terms of his licence conditions. Earlier police released an image of the car believed to have taken the intended target to hospital. This video can not be played Footage of the arrest of a man on suspicion of murdering Olivia Pratt-Korbel is released The vehicle has been seized and is in the process of being forensically examined, officers said, as they appealed to anyone who saw the black Audi Q3 in the days leading up to the shooting to get in touch. Det Supt Mark Baker said: ""Although we have made an arrest in connection with the horrific murder of Olivia, I want to make it completely clear that we need any information about this vehicle or the wider investigation as much as ever.

"Participants in the review met at UN headquarters in New York, starting on 1 August Russia has blocked the adoption of a joint declaration by a United Nations conference on nuclear disarmament. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is reviewed by its 191 signatories every five years, aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

"Jerome Powell in Wyoming Stock markets in the US ended the week sharply down following tough comments by the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve. The bank's chairman, Jerome Powell, said the bank must continue to raise interest rates to stop inflation from becoming a permanent aspect of the US economy. His words sent US stocks into a tailspin, with markets tumbling 3%. It comes as Americans are having to pay more for basic goods. Inflation in the world's largest economy is at a four-decade high. During a highly anticipated speech at a conference in Wyoming on Friday, Mr Powell said the Federal Reserve would probably impose further interest rate hikes in the coming months and could keep them high ""for some time"". ""Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,"" he said at the meeting in Jackson Hole. Investors are concerned that if economic growth falters, higher interest rates will increase the likelihood of a recession. Mr Powell conceded that getting inflation under control would come at a cost to American households and businesses but he argued it was a price worth paying. ""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labour market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to household and businesses,"" he said. ""These are unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain."" Mr Powell wants to avoid inflation becoming entrenched. Simply put, that means if people believe inflation will be high, they will alter their behaviour accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, someone who thinks prices will go up 3% next year is more likely to seek a 3% rise in wages. The last time this happened, Mr Powell's predecessor, Paul Volcker, had to slam on the brakes, raising interest rates dramatically and sending the economy into recession.

"Stansted airport now charges Â£7 for a 15 minutes drop-off, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. More than two thirds of the UK's 22 busiest airports have introduced or increased charges for drivers to drop off passengers since the start of the pandemic, the RAC says. Stansted charges the most of drop-offs, while London City is free and Belfast and Cardiff are free for set amounts of time, the motoring group says. Sixteen of the 22 airports analysed introduced or increased the charges. The RAC said it appeared airports were trying to recoup pandemic losses. The motoring group said drivers would be ""stunned"" by some of the ""sky-high"" fees. Researchers for the organisation found Stansted currently charges Â£7 for 15 minutes, up from Â£4 for 20 minutes in 2019. This was closely followed by Manchester Airport, which charges Â£5 for five minutes - up from Â£3 in three years ago. Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's busiest airports have introduced a charges of Â£5 for drop-offs. Supermarkets not passing on lower fuel price - RAC Bristol had 'fastest recovery' of any UK airport Heathrow extends passenger cap to end of October Meanwhile, Luton, Bristol, Leeds Bradford and Southend all charge Â£5 for 10 minutes. The RAC said in Scotland, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow airports doubled their fees compared to 2019 levels, charging Â£4 for a 10 minute stay. It said London City is the cheapest as it is free and has no time limit, while Belfast City is free for 10 minutes and Cardiff is free for five. Birmingham and Belfast International airports were among five out of the 22 to have kept their fees the same since 2019. Manchester Airport increased its charges by Â£3, according to the research The Airport Operators Association, the body which represents airports, said customers had been provided clear information on the cost of car parking and drop-off options, adding many airports offered free drop-off and pick-up alternatives with good links to the terminals. A spokesperson added that charges for dropping off directly outside terminals were operated for a number of different reasons, including to manage congestion. Nicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, said that the airports had hiked fees to ""partially make up"" for the lost revenue during the pandemic. ""Anyone dropping a loved one off at the terminal this summer will be stunned by some of these sky-high, kiss-and-drop charges,"" he said. ""And for those using the UK's two busiest airports, the luxury of free drop-offs outside the terminal building has been replaced by some pretty high fees. ""Minute for minute and pound for pound, some of these charges could almost be as high as the airfare itself,"" he added. Mr Lyes warned people to be aware that many airports use cameras to spot drop-off cars in the wrong areas and said going over the time limit could typically cost more than the initial parking fee.

"Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills. Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. From April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales. Energy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay Â£1,690 a year. That's a drop of Â£238 (or about Â£20 a month) from the previousenergy price cap,external- the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used. It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What is the Ofgem energy price cap and how much are bills going down? About5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier,external, research by Citizens Advice suggests. The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024. Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. If you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed orswitch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection. If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: live alone live only with pensioners, or under-18s Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements. These were brought in after aninvestigation by The Times,externalfound debt agents acting for British Gaswrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Therules,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"". Meters cannot be fitted for: customers over 75, without someone else in the home, or anyone with a terminal illness people with health conditions that could be worsened by a cold home those with children under the age of two those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons households where no-one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem. Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same. If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier. You can ask for a review of your payments anddebt repayments,external, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay andaccess to hardship funds,external. If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support,the Priority Services Register,external. It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons. Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check theMoneyHelper benefits guide,externalor use theEntitledto,externalandTurn2us,externalbenefits calculators. Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can gethelp with energy bills,external.

"Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February. However, the payments have not tackled the extent of the financial problems many people face, a group of MPs says. It is available to households who receive these benefits,external: universal credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance income support working tax credit child tax credit pension credit The final instalment of Â£299 follows two others last year, of Â£301 and Â£300. To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, orreport it here,external. The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS. Cost of living payments do not affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive. Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits. A Â£150 payment was also made to up to six million people receiving disability benefits, between 20 June and 4 July. All cost of living payments go straight into recipients' bank accounts.

There was particular concern for some larger families. The report said the payments have had an important impact, but the system was relatively unsophisticated, meaning some of those in need slipped through the net.

"Prices are shooting up and millions of people are starting to feel the effects. The new prime minister has announced some help with energy bills,capping a typical household bill at Â£2,500, but many will still be watching their wallets as we head into autumn. Here are some of the key dates and events in the coming weeks that are almost certain to mean more belt-tightening. Despite household bills and prices in the shops going up, for some households there is some help on the way. People on disability benefits will receive a one-off cost-of-living payment of Â£150 from 20 September. More than eight million low-income households on means-tested benefits will also receive Â£324 - the second instalment of a cost-of-living payment - this autumn. The first instalment of Â£326 was made in July. Those on tax credits have had to wait longer, as the first payment for most was made between 2 and 7 September, and the second will be made during the winter. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Bank of England raised interest rates for the seventh time in a row,from 1.75% to 2.25%, as it tries to stem soaring inflation. To give an idea of what that might mean, a quarter-point rise on a Â£250,000 standard variable rate mortgage, paid back over 25 years, could mean paying an extra Â£30 a month, explains Andrew Montlake, of Coreco mortgage brokers. And people on a fixed-rate mortgage also face problems. ""We're starting to see 'payment shock',"" says Montlake, referring to the nasty surprise people get when their fixed period expires and they're faced with higher rates. He adds that it may take a while to feel the full impact of these rate rises. ""Over the next few months and the beginning of next year, when you're faced with an increase in mortgage payments together with an increase in energy payments, that's when people might start to struggle."" Of course, any increase in interest rates is good news for savers, although banks do not always pass on the full rate rise when it comes to their savings accounts. For instance, after the last increase of half a percentage point in August,Santander only applied that increase to its Help to Buy ISA- the rates on its other saver accounts went up by only a quarter of a percentage point. How does an interest rate rise affect me? Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will deliver a mini-budgetto deliver tax cuts promised by Liz Truss during her Tory leadership campaign. The new PM has vowed to cut taxes to boost the economy and help people with rising living costs. With electricity and gas prices going up, Ms Truss stepped in to limit the effect on households and businesses. The government's Energy Price Guarantee replaces the existing energy price cap and will limit the amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. It means an annual bill for a typical household will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. However, it is still almost twice what people were paying last winter. The scheme will last two years and applies to all households in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the ""same level of support"" will be available. Businesses will be protected for six months initially,but it is still unclear how much help they will get. The first instalment ofthe government's Â£400 energy rebate will start to arriveabout now too. A discount of Â£66 or Â£67 will be applied to households' energy bills every month until March 2023. How you get it depends on how you pay your bill - see our charthere for more details. What the new energy plan means for you How high will my energy bill go? This is a key date for pensioners. The Office for National Statistics will reveal September's inflation figure and it is this figure that will be used to set the rise in the state pension which will come in in April 2023. After beingsuspended for a yeardue to pressures from the pandemic on public finances, the so-called ""triple lock"" will be restored. This ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. With inflation currently running at around 10% and forecast to go up even further, that would mean pensions will see double-digit rises. Though this will be welcome news to pensioners, critics havecalled the move ""ludicrous"". Other benefits are also linked to September's inflation rate, including universal credit, disability support and jobseeker's allowance. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward There would usually be a Budget at the end of October or beginning of November, in which tax rises or cuts, public spending plans and other measures affecting people's finances would be announced. However, the government has not confirmed this. It has said there will be a Budget ""this fiscal year"", which means by the end of March 2023. Another rise in interest rates could well be on the cards, and so there'll be interest in what the Bank of England has to say about inflation and economic growth. After its last Monetary Policy Report was published in August,the central bank predicted a long recession. Households that receive the Winter Fuel Payment - which is worth Â£200-Â£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - will receive an additional one-off Â£300 in November or December. That should cover nearly all pensioners across the UK. Christmas Eve is typically the biggest shopping day of the year, apart from Black Friday - the last Friday in November. However, given the cost pressures, people will start saving up for presents much earlier than usual, Barclaycard predicts. Yet another rate rise could come at the end of the year. The Bank of England will assess the impact of its previous actions, but most forecasters expect interest rates to rise to 3% next year, with some saying they could go as high as 4%. The government has said thatregulated train fares in England will rise below the rate of inflation next year, though it has not confirmed what the exact figure will be. The rise will come into effect in March 2023. What do you want to understand better on the cost of living crisis? What advice and tips would help you?

"Participants in the review met at UN headquarters in New York, starting on 1 August Russia has blocked the adoption of a joint declaration by a United Nations conference on nuclear disarmament.

"The government has published a plan to reduce sewage discharges into England's rivers and the sea, promising the ""strictest targets ever"". Water firms will have to deliver the ""largest infrastructure programme in water company history"", it says. Last week pollution warnings were in place on nearly 50 beaches after heavy rainfall led to water companies discharging untreated sewage. The Liberal Democrats branded the new plan a ""cruel joke"". They said consumers would pay for ""the mess made by water companies"". Water companies discharged untreated sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times in 2020,according to official figures.,external The Liberal Democrats called the government's targets ""flimsy"", predicting they would still allow 325,000 sewage dumps a year in 2030. French anger at UK sewage dumped in sea Sewage hits dozens of UK beaches after heavy rain Why is raw sewage being pumped into the sea? The plan will require water firms to invest Â£56bn over 25 years on improving infrastructure. It also states that by 2035 water companies will have to ""improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and improve 75% of overflows discharging to high-priority nature sites"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Between now and 2025, water companies will be investing Â£3bn in order to reduce the use of storm overflows by 25%. ""There are 15,000 storm overflows. We have had them since the Victorian era - they've always been there as an emergency release valve when you get extreme rainfall events, but they are starting in some cases to be used far too often."" Mr Eustice said it was ""regrettable"" that the issue had not been addressed over the past 40 or 50 years. He said there would be a ""modest increase in water bills over time"" as a result of the action announced, but it would be a ""price people would be willing to pay"". ""There will be no change to water bills until at least 2025, and between then and 2030, the average annual rise in water bills will be about Â£12."" There is a major continuing investigation,externalby the Environment Agency and industry regulator Ofwat into how all wastewater companies manage their treatment works. Enforcement cases,externalare being pursued against South West Water, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. Public anger over the continuing discharges has been building over recent weeks as reports of sewage pollution have become more frequent. Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron criticised the plans, saying ""by 2030 there will still be 325,000 sewage dumps a year in our waterways"". ""By the time these flimsy targets come into effect, our beaches would have been pumped full of disgusting sewage."" Thelegal obligation,externalon water companies set by a 2012 European Court of Justice Ruling was for discharges to only occur in very rare ""exceptional circumstances."" Water-quality campaigner Feargal Sharkey believes that the legal duty on water companies has now been relaxed. Under the new plan, they will be allowed to discharge from a storm overflow, ""where they can demonstrate that there is no local adverse ecological impact."" Mr Sharkey said: ""We've gone from a position where it should in 99.9% of cases be illegal â¦ the law was quite clear. We've now gone to a position to where it's about reduction in adverse impact - what does that even mean?"" To help protect human health, the plan instructs water companies to apply ""disinfection"" or reduce the ""frequency of discharges"". Jim McMahon, Labour's environment, food and rural affairs spokesman, said: ""This document is neither a plan, nor does it eliminate sewage dumping into our natural environment. Under the government's weak improvement 'target', based on last year's data, we'd face another 4.8 million sewage spill events in our country between now and 2035. ""Last year Tory MPs had the opportunity to vote meaningful action into law, but blocked measures that would have progressively eliminated the discharge of raw sewage in our natural environment."" A spokesperson for South West Water said: ""We welcome the government's storm overflows discharge reduction plan to improve the water industry's infrastructure network and improve the health of our rivers and seas. ""We're investing Â£2bn between 2020 and 2025, with most investment going to improving our wastewater assets and environmental performance.""

"Middle-earners, as well as low earners, are likely to need government help to pay their energy bills this winter, Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has warned. The energy regulator hiked the price cap on household bills by 80% on Friday, meaning the average bill will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said even those earning Â£45,000 a year may need support. He said the Treasury was exploring ""all the options"" to help households. He added that the country was in a ""national economic emergency [that] could go on for 18 months, two years"". Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, one of whom will be announced as the next prime minister on 5 September, have pledged further support, though neither has given details. Environment Secretary George Eustice defended the wait for policy announcements from either candidate, saying it was right that whoever got the top job would ""want to look at all of the options, properly costed"" when they take office. ""Both candidates have said they will do more - you don't have long to wait,"" Mr Eustice told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. ""They've both made clear that this will be absolutely at the top of their in tray,"" he added. The government has already said that all households will get a Â£400 rebate on energy bills, with low income and vulnerable households receiving an additional Â£650.

He and his wife's joint household income is about Â£56,000. Even with two incomes, we're facing financial difficulties. Our rent has increased by Â£200, and our energy bills are likely to hit Â£350 a month. What does it say in a country where people are working but they can't afford to pay for their energy? I have a decent job, but it doesn't stop me from experiencing financial struggles. Getting a mortgage is science fiction. It's almost Â£1,000 in rent for our flat alone, so how are we going to save for a 10% deposit. I have had to accept that I'll never be able to get onto the housing ladder. I'd love to have a second baby, but it was hard enough to have a first one [which is due on Boxing Day]. We kept postponing the decision because of financial worries, but having a second one - I now don't think that's going to happen. The idea of getting a Â£400 payment doesn't solve anything. We need more than charity, we need social and financial justice, like taxing energy companies who have billions in profits. The rise in the energy price cap- which is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge households per unit of energy - means millions of households will see their annual bills rise from about Â£1,971 currently. Typical prepayment meter customers will also see their bills rise to Â£3,608. Charities and experts have warned that the rise will have a devastating impact on households and that lives will be at risk without government intervention. 'Lives at risk' as energy price cap soars by 80% What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? What can be done to tackle the energy crisis? In his interview with the Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said he was also concerned about those who were not on benefits. ""If you are a senior nurse or a senior teacher on Â£45,000 a year, you're having your energy bills go up by 80% and will probably rise even higher in the new year - it's really hard. ""If you're a pensioner, it's really hard. So Universal Credit is a really effective way of targeting, but I'm looking at what else we can do to make sure we help those who really need the help."" The price cap, set by the regulator, Ofgem, is rising by 80% in October The price of electricity will rise on average from 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) to 52p and gas will go up from 7p to 15p per kWh A typical annual energy bill paid by direct debit is currently Â£1,971. In October, that will rise to Â£3,549 Prepayment meter customers will pay an extra Â£59 a year from October, taking the new typical bill on a prepayment meter to Â£3,608 Mr Zahawi said the options being drawn up for the next prime minister to consider included an increase in benefits and a loan scheme for energy suppliers to stop them having to pass costs on to consumers. He said a price cap freeze had not been ruled out, though he expressed concern that the measure would also benefit households that could afford to pay higher energy costs. Mr Zahawi added that a number of measures to help small businesses, including temporary reductions to VAT, business rates, or green levies, were being considered, saying a failure to help business would leave a ""longer-term scarring effect on the economy"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the government for failing to respond to the growing crisis. Labour says its own plan to freeze energy prices this winter - paid for in part by a windfall tax on energy companies - would save someone on the minimum wage more than Â£40 a week. Asked whether it was right that even the richest would benefit, Labour's Darren Jones - chair of the department for business, energy and industrial strategy committee of MPs - said ""the vast majority of people"" would be affected by the rises. He added that the government was not set up well enough to get money to people in a targeted way. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said the energy price cap rise was ""nothing short of a catastrophe for millions of families and pensioners"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said people were already saying they would be unable to heat their homes or put food on their tables. ""These are costs people simply can't afford,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""The government has a responsibility to step in."" Mr Blackford warned businesses could ""go to the wall"" over winter, and added: ""This is an emergency as big as the Covid crisis. In such a scenario, the government has a responsibility to act."" Speaking to broadcasters on Friday, Mr Zahawi also split with cabinet colleagues who have so far resisted suggestions that households should be encouraged to reduce their energy usage. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that choices about energy consumption remained ""decisions for individuals"". Asked about the issue, Mr Zahawi said: ""The reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption."" He told the Telegraph the country would have to be resilient as it continued to help Ukraine resist the Russian invasion. ""Putin has worked out that he can use energy as a tool to hit back at us,"" he said. ""And we're going to need to send a message back to Putin that this is not going to soften our resolve.""
