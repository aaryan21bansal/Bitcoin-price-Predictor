" By Dominic Casciani In a cupboard, in a caravan park in northern England, there is a pair of Italian leather dancing shoes. Every now and then they are brought out and polished up, before their owner spins across Northern Soul dance floors. Those shoes are treasured by their owner, a hard-working man called Mick. The man who gave them to him was his new Italian neighbour. His name was Gennaro Panzuto.     People liked the gregarious charismatic Italian guy trying to grow pots of basil in the wind-swept chill of rural Lancashire. And Gennaro liked the caravan park because it was a good place to live quietly. It was a good place to hide from the truth written in blood on the streets of Naples. But that truth was soon to catch up with him.  It is June 2019, about 12 years on from when he gave those shoes to Mick, and I’m waiting inside a maximum security prison. I’m almost as far north in the Italian Alps as I can get before they start serving French cheese. It’s claustrophobic inside the bleached hot walls of the dilapidated jail. The only view is of the sky and - if you can find a decent window - the stunning mountain peaks.  Prison near Aosta, northern Italy    A jailor unlocks an internal gate, and Gennaro Panzuto walks towards me. The 45-year-old is fit and lightly-built. He’s not in a prison uniform, but a pair of snug jeans and a designer denim shirt and trainers. We exchange pleasantries. And then we’re down to business: the confessions of a mafia man. He’s got an important story to tell about his life - and questions to answer about what on earth he was doing in the UK all those years ago. We know it is a story that starts with appalling crimes in Naples, and ends with a mafia summit in the middle of Lancashire. But will he be honest and straight? What crimes have you committed, I ask?  Gennaro Panzuto talks to Dominic Casciani    “My crimes range from murder, attempted murder and mafia association, extortion, drug trafficking, arms trafficking and money laundering.” How many murders were you involved in? How many did you personally commit? This is, after all, supposedly a confession. Panzuto hesitates. More than 10? “No, less.” More than five? “No, wait…” Panzuto says he wants to be frank - but his frankness is tempered by an apparent reluctance to incriminate himself beyond what he has already been convicted for. He insists that his time in prison has given him time to think - and he wants to tell his story as a warning to others not to follow his path.     Gennaro Panzuto was born in the chaotic city of Naples in 1974. His family’s tiny apartment was in La Torretta, an enclave of dirt-poor families amid the rich elite near the waterfront. It was in an area known as the “Bassi”, or “The Lows”, a maze of dark, damp alleys at the lowest levels of the city’s ancient streets.  Gennaro Panzuto as a young man    If you lived in the Bassi, you were looked down upon, metaphorically and literally, by those above you wealthy enough to inhabit the sun-kissed rooftops. He wanted to escape the poverty. And like so many other teenage boys there, his route out would be crime. By the time he was 14, he had discovered he was an efficient thief. He had the guile and brass neck to steal watches - particularly Rolexes - straight off the wrists of the unsuspecting rich. “It’s all about being cunning and sharp,” he recalls, showing me how he would steal a watch as he leapt from a moped. Panzuto was so good at it, the people he was selling them on to asked him to move to Spain, where there were richer pickings. From Monday to Friday he would be stealing watches. Then on Saturday he would bring home his haul, and party. “I was really renowned. That was my bad luck.” It was his bad luck because he had been talent-spotted by the Camorra - Naples’ mafia clans.     Gennaro Panzuto was born in the chaotic seafront city of Naples in 1974. His family’s tiny apartment was in La Torretta, an enclave of dirt-poor families amid the rich elite near the waterfront. It was in an area known as the “Bassi”, or “The Lows”, a maze of dark, damp alleys at the lowest levels of the city’s ancient streets.

Panzuto was so good at it, the people he was selling them on to asked him to move to Spain, where there were richer pickings. From Monday to Friday he would be stealing watches. Then on Saturday he would bring home his haul, and party. “I was really renowned. That was my bad luck.” It was his bad luck because he had been talent-spotted by the Camorra - Naples’ mafia clans.      The Camorra are completely different to the Hollywood stereotype of a single all-powerful family controlling an entire city or country. Dr Felia Allum, of the University of Bath, has spent her career researching the clans - and their unique criminal alliances across Naples. “In every district you would find a criminal family that controlled the territory,” she says. But a family alone was weak. And so across Naples there are wider, shifting alliances. Felia Allum     “What those alliances tended to do, in order to be powerful and strong, was to recruit smaller clans. “That’s the flexibility and the fluidity of the Camorra.” Panzuto’s introduction to the Camorra came via an aunt who had married into the mob. Her husband, Rosario Piccirillo, headed one of the clans in his impoverished district and managed tax-free cigarette smuggling which made huge profits for his particular alliance in the city. But Rosario wasn’t a brilliant leader, and had few foot soldiers to do his bidding. He realised he needed to train an apprentice whom he could trust with his life, to help the clan survive. Rosario Piccirillo     Panzuto was called home from Spain for what would become a life-changing meeting. He met his Uncle Rosario at Mergellina Marina - a playground of the rich on the edge of the clan’s territory. There, Panzuto was introduced to a senior Camorra fixer - a man who solved problems for the alliance. This man had a proposal for the street thief. Rivals were planning to shoot Rosario in a growing tit-for-tat battle for control of that part of the city. “Kill the person who wants to kill him,” Panzuto was told. “You have to do it because you’re his family.” Panzuto agreed to become a killer. As he told me about his decision, he did so in such a matter-of-fact way that it didn’t make any sense to me. Didn’t he think it was wrong? He was being asked to become a murderer - and he didn’t stop to say no?    “When you grow up in the world into which I was born, this [decision] was normal. I grew up with rules which meant that when I was bound to someone, I was also capable of murder.” Panzuto kept to his promise to protect the family from enemies. The first rival clansman he was told to target escaped with his life - but only because the police arrested him first. But it wasn’t long before he ambushed another Camorrista and shot him dead. It was his job, he says, and he got on with it without thinking too much about the enormity of his crimes. Today - after 12 years in prison - Panzuto insists he finally realises the horror of what he did. He’s been through several periods of psychotherapy designed to make violent offenders take responsibility for their actions. He says he’s also put up walls inside his head to cope with his own inhumanity - but there are memories he can never escape. “I don’t remember the faces,” he says. “I remember the dull thud of the bodies falling after you’ve shot them. “I remember the screams of the children, the women, ringing in my ears.” Over the next decade, Panzuto came to play a leading role in both extortion, and shipping drugs on his home turf, La Torretta. And by 2005 Uncle Rosario was so up to his neck in police problems that the apprentice had to take over, to stop the clan collapsing.     Pietro Ioia is a former drug trafficker gone straight. He had met Panzuto during his rise. He says the young mobster was so assertive and quick to act that other crooks nicknamed him “Terremoto” - Earthquake. “Panzuto was really respected by the other clans and had value as a boss. His Camorra career was intense - but short,” says Ioia. Pietro Ioia    In the winter of 2005-06, a new inter-clan war erupted, and Panzuto’s allies asked for his help holding the La Sanita area. Michele Del Prete is a senior anti-mafia prosecutor who investigated Panzuto. He says the young leader took advantage of the opportunity to make his mark. “Panzuto needed to assert his own criminal character - his criminal weight,” he says: “As a killer, but also as someone who wanted to replace his uncle as a manager. He wanted to head a clan that could extend to other areas of the city.” Over that winter, there was a spate of shootings and murders, as gangs tried to kill each other’s leaders and foot soldiers. Eventually one of these murders - of a gangster named Graziano Borelli - could be linked directly to Panzuto. Graziano Borelli (l) and a scene from a murder during the inter-clan war  The police had intercepted a conversation in which Panzuto had told his gunmen to carry out the murder, and they had enough evidence to launch a blitz of arrests. But Panzuto was nowhere to be seen. He had fled the country.   The average temperature at the height of spring in Naples is 24C. In Lancashire it’s 16C. And if there’s one thing that Italians moan about when they come to England - other than the food - it's the weather. But Preston, in Lancashire, was where Panzuto fled to in the early months of 2006. So why this unlikely corner of England? Panzuto explained it to me during our prison meeting. The Camorra has links around Europe, in order to do business. Some of its profits come from the illegal tax-free movement of goods in and out of Naples, and the clans do that with the help of overseas partners. One of Panzuto’s closest associates in Naples had made deep connections to an organised crime gang in north-west England.    This gang - made up almost entirely of British men - was making a lot of money without needing to be violent on the streets. One of their scams involved shipping shoes into Naples without paying any VAT - the Camorra would sell them on and undercut legitimate traders. The British gang was headed by a businessman who appeared to be an entirely upstanding member of his community. He had a lawyer who was as bent as they come and an accountant who cooked the books in case the tax man came looking. Panzuto had met the British businessman in Naples. As the police closed in on him after the Borelli murder, Panzuto’s British friends offered him sanctuary in Lancashire. This presented him with two opportunities - a chance to hide out for a while, and also to learn about a lucrative business. When he arrived at Liverpool John Lennon Airport, the British boss had a special welcome for his Camorra friend. A Rolls Royce was there to collect him. “You don’t know how much I smiled,” Panzuto says. “These English guys - and they were scrambling to meet me -  they sent me this chauffeur. And then we went to the pub.” Once there, he met the wider circle around the businessman and was given important insights into their operations - all over a pint of bitter. Panzuto told them his priority was to lie low, and the British businessman said he could sort that out right away. Gennaro Panzuto in the UK    The Six Arches Caravan Park lies in a bend in the River Wyre, halfway between Preston and Lancaster. Apart from the occasional high-speed train passing, it is a peaceful spot - a short drive from the Forest of Bowland, and the seaside delights of Blackpool and Morecambe. Panzuto rented a unit at the caravan park, and his wife and children arrived from Naples. He was a little vague about his background. But, being a chatty kind of guy, he quickly made friends. Park staff remember their new guest had a thing for flash cars - and had to be ticked off for breaking the 5mph speed restrictions. The cars, including a Porsche, were gifts from his host. It was a welcoming place, and neighbours happily lent the family a phone to call home. It didn’t occur to anyone at the time that this was a bit odd, given he clearly had money. And one of the neighbours who helped the Panzutos settle in was Mick Bury. Had Mick known at the time what he knows now, he may have thought twice about banging on Panzuto’s door after the Italian had driven into his car. “I was that worked up about it, I said, ‘Oi! Have you seen what you have done to my car? Couldn’t you see it?’”  Mick Bury   Gennaro Panzuto, confronted with a furious Lancastrian yelling at 100mph, gesticulated apologetically. Then he gave Mick a piece of paper with a phone number on it. Mick phoned the number and a man with a local accent said he would be there in 20 minutes to sort it out. The local man - arriving in a nice car and wearing a suit - listened to Mick’s complaint. He looked at the damage and - there and then - peeled off £200 from a wodge of notes. He told Mick there would be another £200 the following week. “No questions asked - he just wanted it sorted,” says Mick. And then, Mick and Panzuto became friends. During that summer’s World Cup Finals in Germany, they shared a laugh and a beer, as they watched Italy win the tournament for the fourth time. “The joke - when I went out with my friends - was, ‘Hey, you need to watch out, he might be a mafia man…’” In time, their friendship became such that Panzuto gave Mick, a dedicated dancer, a gift of Italian dancing shoes. They were made of the softest black leather, with a stripe of brown across the toe. The smooth sole was made to glide. “I still wear them now - I couldn’t afford them. He was very generous.” Panzuto made other friends on the site. Russ, the maintenance manager, remembers the Neapolitan buying people drinks in the park’s social club. He would turn up with sample shoes and leather coats - and then give them away. People loved the extravagant new resident. And Panzuto was beginning to enjoy his life in England. There was, he told me in prison, a peace and quiet unlike Naples. But it wasn’t a holiday. The British businessman boss who was helping to hide him, now needed the favour paid back in a way that only Panzuto could do.      Panzuto’s host was owed a fortune by other crooks who were part of his extended network of dodgy companies and tax scams. The Italian wanted to learn more about these companies - and the British businessman said he’d teach him everything he knew. But first, Panzuto was needed to turn the screw on his debtors. The businessman - who liked to clock off early and go to the pub to brag about his mafia mate - wanted an efficient solution. And so Panzuto said he would deal with this problem the Camorra way. He set up a fake business dinner at an Italian restaurant in the Preston area with a foreign businessman who was causing the most upset. The target was refusing to pay his debt to Panzuto’s British host. “He was the cockiest of them all,” said Panzuto. “He not only owned him money - he was threatening, too. “I took him to the car park. He thought that we were going to take the car. Instead… I grabbed him and head-butted him. I threw him to the ground.” The victim was stunned by this sudden attack. “I said to him, ‘Remember what I’ve done. Tell everyone this is how the wind blows now.’"" And then he committed an act of extraordinary violence. He bit off the victim’s ear - and Panzuto says the British boss saw it happen. The message had been sent by a Camorra man. And the debtors started paying up. Now it was time for him to learn what he could from the British. Within months of coming to the UK, Panzuto was shown by the British businessman how easy it was to open bogus companies - unlike in Italy. That made white-collar crime - hiding criminal profits in apparently honest transactions - very easy. Unlike the Camorra, the British boss didn’t need to sell drugs, or extort money from local businesses. He simply shifted goods around company after company, while dodging the 20% VAT that other traders had to legitimately cough up. Panzuto tells me he never understood entirely what was going on, but it amounted to carousel fraud - a crime that costs governments billions every year.    The scam usually involves sending goods across EU borders - in this case to and from Italy. The VAT that is owed is never recovered, as the companies are wound up and the goods disappear. And it’s the type of fraud which Italian investigators have long been most concerned about. Panzuto had foot soldiers to support back in Naples - including welfare payments to the families of jailed associates. These white-collar scams were proving lucrative - and the British businessman boss said he could help move more shoes, bathroom parts and cars, to cover Panzuto’s outgoings. Panzuto said the plan would help his people - and he knew it would help his own position on the Camorra’s greasy pole. He began investigating setting up a network of front shops and warehouses in nearby Preston - and possibly Manchester - to generate even more cash to send to Naples. But the ambitious young boss, lulled into a false sense of security by the arrogance of his British associates, was already making mistakes.    Back in Naples, Panzuto was a prime suspect for the city’s mafia-hunting Flying Squad. Then, Inside the elite police unit’s smoke-filled, nicotine-scoured offices, detectives got a breakthrough - thanks to five repeated numbers. 00-44-7. The international prefix for UK mobile phone numbers. As the Italian state directed its surveillance tools at a wanted killer, his associates and family in Naples appeared to be connecting to British mobile numbers - 12 different numbers in total. One of them may have been Mick Bury’s handset at the caravan park - given that Panzuto’s wife had been borrowing it to call home. “It was definitely a surprise for us. It was a novelty to consider the UK,” says prosecutor Michele Del Prete, who was far more used to finding men hiding in the warmer climes of Spain. The detectives needed to know for sure whether Panzuto was in England. They asked Scotland Yard and the Serious Organised Crime Agency to help. And that was when their quarry may have made two massive errors. Panzuto's address in Garstang, Lancashire     By 2007, Panzuto had moved from the caravan park to a semi-detached house on Cock Robin Lane, Garstang - a lovely quiet village north of Preston. His first mistake was to fly his wife in regularly, and then his girlfriend, when his wife left. He now believes that their movements gave away his location. Secondly, his closest lieutenants were flying in every few weeks to discuss business. All of these movements gave the Italian police leads to follow. Panzuto was now in executive control of operations from far away, ensuring the dirty work got done, without getting his own hands dirty. Such was his power - even from England - that he once ordered a rival to be burned out of his  home in Naples. His soldiers delegated the job to a drug addict, who set fire to the wrong apartment. “I was angry,” Panzuto later admitted in an interview with prosecutors. “I told [my lieutenants] to beat him for the mistake.” The underlings then duly went back to burn out the correct target. To reinforce his growing power, Panzuto was bold enough to invite all of his allies to a mafia summit at Cock Robin Lane. About a dozen leaders from across his alliance made the trip - including bosses from three of the biggest Naples clans. He disguised the meeting as a family BBQ. There were two items on the agenda as the meat sizzled on the grill. Item one - more hits against the enemy. The 2005-2006 war that led Panzuto to flee had been painful - and members of the alliance wanted a final push to eliminate all threats. But Panzuto wanted to focus on item two - easy cash. “I made them understand that this war had led to a bunch of arrests - now was the moment to pause, and reflect on economic plans,” recalls Panzuto. He had a long list of plans - including an ambitious attempt to profit from the refurbishment of the marina in Naples, where he had been recruited 10 years previously. By now he was also in negotiations with his English helpers about how to leverage their financial muscle into his own world. The plan involved setting up a front business in England, posing as a network of shoe stores, to help shift cash back to Naples. But it never got off the ground. On 16 May 2007, the knock on the door came. Police mugshot of Gennaro Panzuto     “I remember that day like it was yesterday. I went to look out and there were men in plain clothes - at the front and at the back. And then I knew.” The polite British officers asked if there were any guns in the house. Panzuto confirmed there were none, and he surrendered quietly. None of his neighbours realised what had happened - or indeed who he was - until he was gone. Amid the media frenzy that followed, a British court heard he was wanted for the Borelli murder and was linked to many others. Gennaro Panzuto - with all his plans to make it big - didn’t fight extradition. Back at the Caravan Park, Mick Bury was absolutely gob-smacked. “He nearly moved into my house in Blackpool as well,” he says. Gennaro Panzuto, with the help of his British businessman host, had flitted around Lancashire, from the caravan park to Cock Robin Lane in Garstang. He would have no choice over his bed for the next 12 years. The rising mafia boss was up for murder, and facing life in prison. Until he was offered the possibility of a new life - after release from prison. But that would mean breaking the mafia code of silence - or Omertà.        The Italian justice system has operated a “state collaboration” system for more than 40 years. Mafia men and women can seek lesser sentences in return for evidence that will bring down their co-conspirators. They can ask to be relocated, and given a new identity. Italians are divided over the wisdom of the programme - given that it allows some gangsters to evade full punishment for their crimes. But there is no doubt that it’s led to some remarkable successes in dismantling mafia gangs. A state collaborator is colloquially called a “Pentito” - a Penitent. This - eventually - was Panzuto’s choice.    “My girlfriend begged me to confess - to collaborate. I didn’t want to listen to her at first - but I was missing her deeply. “And one day she went straight to the prosecutor’s office and said: ‘Let’s go see Gennaro. I will convince him to collaborate.’” Michele Del Prete was sceptical. Was Panzuto really going to confess, or was it a ruse to avoid a long sentence. “I was very strict in my initial judgment of this collaboration,” he says. “We’re talking about someone who has committed very serious crimes. Therefore it is up to us prosecutors to be very careful, and evaluate [the value] of the contribution.”  Michele Del Prete, anti-mafia prosecutor    Gennaro Panzuto was being held far from Naples. And that distance gave him time to think. “The only good thing about hard time in prison is that you can reflect long and hard - you’re going deep inside. “And when you go that deep, it’s not difficult to ask myself: ‘Do I need to now spend my life in prison - and if so, who am I doing this for?’ I chose my family.” Panzuto agreed to be a collaborator. Over the course of several interviews with Michele Del Prete he named names, events and crimes; murders and murderers; drug traffickers and extortion gangs; robbers and leaders; arsonists and thieves. And he told the prosecutors everything about his British associates. He told them about the scams - the name of the businessman, his bent lawyer and his dodgy accountant. Michele Del Prete passed to the UK all the information about Panzuto’s British businessman host. “I remember the British told us that [the businessman] was definitely involved in scams - they’d known about this character,” says Michele Del Prete. “But his links with the Neapolitan Camorra - that was news to them. We don’t know what they did with the information.” The BBC has learnt that Lancashire Police did open an investigation - but nobody will tell us what happened to it. The force says there is nobody in post today who has knowledge of the Panzuto affair - one of the biggest organised crime catches in the region. The British businessman who helped Panzuto is still out there today working scams - and we cannot name him for legal reasons.     Back in Naples, the police squeezed every drop out of Panzuto’s evidence, and his confessions have helped put away a string of mafia men. In return, Gennaro Panzuto was given a date when he would leave prison and have a chance at that new life. In Naples, the state collaborator programme has been so successful that most of the Camorra’s experienced bosses are in jail. But there is now a new threat. “Baby Gangs are now in the areas where there are no more historical clans,” says Pietro Ioia, the old crook who’s gone straight.    “They are young people, who take over the neighbourhood where there’s a power vacuum. “They’re crazy loose cannons… shooting, shooting, shooting. Young people don’t discuss, they just shoot.”      I ask Giovanni Melillo, Naples’ chief prosecutor, how serious a threat the Baby Gangs are to his city now. The Camorra clans are still the primary threat, he says. They’ve not gone away just because the state collaborator system has led to more bosses going to jail. “What’s important to emphasise is precisely the ability to turn violence into business - criminal networks into business networks,” he says. “Corruption and money laundering are powerful levers - much more important than the use of street violence.” The kids in the Baby Gangs may think they’re top of the tree. But they are just one bullet away from being a footnote in the police archives. The real power still lies within deeper clan networks and the white-collar criminals who are hard to detect. It’s easy to despair about all of this - and Alessandra Clemente has more cause than most to do so.  Alessandra Clemente    In 1997 her mother, Silvia Ruotolo, was gunned down in the street - a crime that shocked the nation. The teacher was an innocent woman, walking home with her five-year-old son. Today Clemente is a city councillor and one of the most well-known anti-mafia figures in Italy. She points to a piece of graffiti on the wall of the city council building where she works.  Anti-Camorra graffiti   It says “Camorra Merda” - “Camorra shit”. It’s been there for a few years. “The graffiti was spontaneous,” she says. “Naples is an anti-Camorra city. We can fight two ways: through the courts, through the culture.” The solution, she says, is to find a way to offer hope and jobs. “Every day we can take away the fuel of the Camorra - the young - by giving young people opportunities.” Ioia is more downbeat. “The Camorra’s always here. It’s the cancer of our city.”           Gennaro Panzuto may leave jail as early as 2021, as part of his agreement with the Italian state. But he will never set foot in Naples again. He will be relocated and, if necessary, be given a new identity. At the beginning of our meeting, when I asked Panzuto if he had left his old life behind, he said he had “changed his skin”. “I’m going to tell you the truth. I repented for love. For the love of my partner - for the love of my children.” Panzuto tells me he is in an “existential crisis” - not knowing his true self anymore. He showed me the marks on his body from acts of self-harm in prison. He has paid a high personal price for breaking the code of silence. “You never get to forget one single day the choice you made, the codes you violated, the people you let down. “I have a brother and three sisters. I have not seen or heard from them since I became a collaborator.” What about the cost to the families of his victims? Does he not think about that, rather than himself? “I am as ashamed as a dog. Murdering people doesn’t take anything - it just takes great cowardice. That’s all.”    Maps: Google Graziano Borelli images: Simone Di Meo Lancashire countryside image: Alamy Thanks to Dr Felia Allum, University of Bath Dominic Casciani can be contacted in confidence atdominic.casciani@bbc.co.uk Or via a DM on Twitterhttps://twitter.com/BBCDomC    Published Friday 14 February 2020 On the BBC News Channel: Sat 15 Feb 2020 - 04:30, 21:30 Sun 16 Feb 2020 - 03:30, 21:30 Orview online  Dyatlov Pass: Why did nine people die mysteriously?

"Michael Avenatti could face more than 40 years in prison Michael Avenatti, who represented porn star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against President Trump, has been found guilty of attempted extortion. The lawyer was accused of seeking to extort up to $25m (Â£18.9m) from Nike. He had threatened to release information that might be harmful to the popular sports brand. Avenatti emerged as a vocal critic of Mr Trump two years ago when he began representing Ms Daniels, and even suggested he might run for president. He was found guilty by a jury after a three-week trial and could face up to 42 years in prison when sentenced in June. Federal prosecutors in New York said Avenatti, 48, met a lawyer for Nike in March 2019. During their meeting, he threatened to release damaging information about Nike unless it paid him between $15m and $25m. At the time he approached Nike, Avenatti had been representing his then-client Gary Franklin, who ran a youth basketball league in Los Angeles. Court papers said Avenatti threatened to hold a press conference alleging Nike had made illicit payments to young basketball players in Los Angeles. Revealing this would wipe billions from Nike's stock value, he had suggested. Nike immediately reported the matter to federal prosecutors. Avenatti was arrested shortly after announcing he would hold a news conference about a scandal surrounding the company. ""This was an old-fashioned shakedown,"" prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said at the time. The jury heard that Avenatti had been at least $11m in debt. Last month,Avenatti's lawyers said he was suffering while being held in solitary confinementand under 24-hour lockdown in the same Manhattan prison cell that housed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Avenatti previously represented porn star Stormy Daniels Avenatti formerly represented Stormy Daniels, who tried to sue the president to get out of a non-disclosure agreement she had signed before the 2016 presidential election. The non-disclosure agreement related to an affair she said he had with Mr Trump in 2006, but the case was eventually dismissed. In May last year, Avenatti was charged with defrauding her of book proceeds, and faces trial in New York in April. He denies all the charges. He also faces another trial in Los Angeles in May on accusations he defrauded clients and others of millions of dollars.

"As he bowed out, Mr Griveaux said no-one should be subjected to such a ""torrent of mud"" A sex video has ended French ruling party candidate Benjamin Griveaux's hopes of becoming mayor of Paris. The ex-spokesman for President Emmanuel Macron's government, who was already trailing in the race, was apparently targeted by a Russian protest artist accusing him of hypocrisy. ""No-one should be subjected to such abuse,"" said Mr Griveaux, 42. The video, showing a man in a compromising position, quickly spread on social media late on Thursday. Petr Pavlensky, who sought asylum from Russia in 2017, said he had posted the video online. Opponents from across the political spectrum voiced their outrage. Incumbent Mayor Anne Hidalgo appealed for respect for people's private lives, while far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon condemned the attack as ""odious"". Far-right leader Marine Le Pen suggested that for the sake of democracy Mr Griveaux should perhaps not have resigned. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe expressed his support for his former colleague and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner went further, warning that publishing videos without the author's consent was an offence punishable by a significant fine and up to two years in jail. The video appeared on a little known website that featured a profile of Mr Griveaux's political ambitions and his ""fanatical faith in family values"". It then alleged that Mr Griveaux had exchanged intimate mobile phone messages with a young woman and sent her a personal video. A link to the site was shared by an MP who was forced to resign from Mr Macron's LREM (Republic on the Move) party in late 2018. Mr Griveaux told the BFMTV news channel that for the past year he and his family had been subjected to ""defamatory remarks, lies, rumours, anonymous attacks... and even death threats"". ""This torrent of mud has affected me and above all hurt the people I love."" Mr Griveaux's lawyer said he would press charges over the publication of the video, which he said violated the right to a private life. Mr Pavlensky, who says he posted the video online, first gained notoriety by nailing his scrotum to Moscow's Red Square in 2013. He fled Russia and sought asylum in France when he was accused by the authorities of a sexual assault that he denied. Russian artist held over Paris bank fire Artist flees Russia sex claim for France He served seven months in jail for setting the front door of the FSB intelligence agency on fire in Moscow. He later caused minor damage to a Banque de France branch by setting that alight. This video can not be played Pyotr Pavlensky set fire to the door of the FSB, Russia's security service He told French news channel LCI that Mr Griveaux was only the first politician that he would target: he had only just begun, he claimed. Politicians had to be honest and he said he would carry on fighting the ""propaganda and puritanism of politicians"". French media have traditionally avoided prying into the private lives of people in public life and a number of figures referred distastefully to the ""Americanisation"" of politics. ""I don't like people mixing up political life with people's privacy,"" said MP Alexis CorbiÃ¨re. Lawyer Marie-Anne SoubrÃ© told a French talk show she was sick to her stomach that France had got to this point. ""To what new low have we fallen in public life that anyone is prepared to publish this kind of thing to bring down politicians?"" Mr Griveaux was not favourite to win the mayoral race in March, but he has been a very close ally of the president and his political demise is inevitably an embarrassment for the president, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris. He was trailing in third place, his campaign hampered by a dissident Macronite candidate called CÃ©dric Villani. Mr Villani described the ""outrageous attack"" on Mr Griveaux and his family as a serious threat to French democracy. Macron vows to save Mont Blanc from overcrowding French beating scandal reveals Macron's feet of clay Macron appeals to strikers not to ruin Christmas Ms Hidalgo, the current Socialist mayor, is leading in the polls, ahead of Republicans candidate Rachida Dati. Mr Macron came to power in 2017 and his new LREM party secured a majority in the National Assembly. However, the party has seen a spate of defections in recent months and now has only 299 MPs in the National Assembly, down from 314 three years ago. LREM is expected to have poor local election results next month, but its majority in parliament is safe because of its alliance with the MoDem party.

"This video can not be played Car seen on wrong side of road near Harry Dunn base A new video has emerged on social media of a car being driven on the wrong side of the road outside the RAF base near where 19-year-old Harry Dunn died. Mr Dunn was killed after a crash by RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire which led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving the UK under diplomatic immunity. The footage appears to have been recorded on Thursday.Another car was recorded being driven on the wrong side of the roadnear the base last month. Police said they would investigate. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said the emergence of the latest video near RAF Croughton was ""shocking but not a surprise"". The crash that killed Mr Dunn happened on 27 August outside the RAF base where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked as a US intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, is to be charged with causing death by dangerous driving. In January, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the UK's request for her extradition. Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley met the US air base's commander on Thursday to discuss safety. He said his meeting with Colonel Bridget McNamara was ""encouraging"". A joint statement released by the police and the colonel said Ms McNamara ""provided a detailed brief of all the proactive measures that the base continues to do to help those living on the base adjust to UK driving standards"". ""It was clear from the meeting that the base already had a significant number of measures in place in ensuring driver safety,"" Mr Adderley said. ""The base and the force have continued to work together."" 'No haggle' over Dunn suspect and Prince Andrew Harry Dunn police want 'wrong-way' driving talks 'No plans' for Harry Dunn death public inquiry ""Additional provisions"" are to be introduced and both parties ""are doing all that they can to prevent any future harm on the roads in and around the site"", he said. Colonel McNamara said Northamptonshire Police had been a ""steadfast partner of our base"" and she looked forward to its continued relationships. Mr Seiger said the family was ""shocked"" at the news of the meeting, and said Mr Dunn's family ""should have been there"". He said Northamptonshire Police and the US Air Force ""fail to acknowledge that there is a problem"". ""As evidenced by further video today, a further tragedy is inevitable,"" he added.

"This video can not be played New Chancellor Rishi Sunak was all smiles as the new cabinet met for the first time Boris Johnson has told his new cabinet to focus on delivering Tory election promises following a reshuffle that saw Sajid Javid quit as chancellor. Addressing his new team in Downing Street, the PM said they must get on with the ""basic work"" of improving lives and spreading opportunity. Mr Javidquit on Thursdayafter he was told he could keep his job but only if he fired his team of advisers. His successor Rishi Sunak has said he has ""lots to get on with"". Opening Friday's cabinet meeting, the PM congratulated those present on ""achieving or retaining"" their cabinet jobs after a wide-ranging shake-up which saw a host of senior figures sacked. ""We have to repay the trust of people who voted for us in huge numbers in December and who look forward to us delivering,"" he said. Is development department merging with FCO? Johnson chooses power over personnel Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Mr Javid, who had been due to deliver his first Budget in March, said he was left with ""no option"" but to resign because ""no self-respecting minister"" could accept the prime minister's demands. His departure from the cabinet follows rumours of tension between Mr Javid and the prime minister's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. In his resignation letter, Mr Javid - who was in his Bromsgrove constituency on Friday opening a Pensioners Fair - said: ""I believe it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with."" Downing Street said there would now be a joint team of economic advisers for both the chancellor and prime minister. Losing a chancellor is no small event, and it wasn't what Boris Johnson set out to do. But yesterday shows that No 10's priority was political control rather than keeping personnel they valued. When Mr Javid refused, they chose instead to see him leave. This begs a wider question - is it stronger to share power or hoard it? Boris Johnson and his team have made the choice to do the latter - to lose a chancellor rather than allow a rival faction offering different political advice to the next door neighbour. Read more from Laura here. Mr Sunak, who was previously Mr Javid's deputy at the Treasury, has addressed staff in the department following his unexpected promotion. Allow Twitter content?

A Downing Street spokesman would not confirm whether or not the Budget scheduled for 11 March would go ahead as planned, saying ""extensive preparations"" had already been carried and they would continue ""at pace"". Amid reports No 10 was looking at ways of re-writing its fiscal rules to allow for more public expenditure, it said there would continue to be a ""clear framework"" for borrowing levels. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it was ""sensible"" to amalgamate the teams of advisers currently working for the prime minister and the chancellor. ""It is right that there is a co-ordinated economic function in this country,"" he told Breakfast. ""We need to have a strong team working as one."" Mr Johnson told his team to work with ""energy and determination"" At Friday's meeting, the cabinet agreed the introduction of a new points-based immigration system on 1 January, 2021, when the current post-Brexit transition period with the EU ends. A No 10 spokesman said it would put an end to the UK's ""reliance on cheap unskilled labour"" from the continent and reduce overall levels of inward migration.

Julian Smith was also sacked as Northern Ireland Secretary- weeks after he brokered the deal that restored the power-sharing administration in Stormont. Speaking on Friday, he said his dismissal was ""not a surprise"" and his wished his successor Brandon Lewis well in dealing with the ""key"" challenges facing Northern Ireland, including historical legacy issues and abortion law reforms.

There had been rumours that the Department for International Development could be closed, but while it remains open, No 10 appears to have merged its ministerial team with the Foreign Office. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there had been two joint ministers ahead of the reshuffle, but by the end of Thursday, there were seven joint posts across the two departments.

"Michael Avenatti could face more than 40 years in prison Michael Avenatti, who represented porn star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against President Trump, has been found guilty of attempted extortion. The lawyer was accused of seeking to extort up to $25m (Â£18.9m) from Nike. He had threatened to release information that might be harmful to the popular sports brand. Avenatti emerged as a vocal critic of Mr Trump two years ago when he began representing Ms Daniels, and even suggested he might run for president. He was found guilty by a jury after a three-week trial and could face up to 42 years in prison when sentenced in June. Federal prosecutors in New York said Avenatti, 48, met a lawyer for Nike in March 2019. During their meeting, he threatened to release damaging information about Nike unless it paid him between $15m and $25m. At the time he approached Nike, Avenatti had been representing his then-client Gary Franklin, who ran a youth basketball league in Los Angeles. Court papers said Avenatti threatened to hold a press conference alleging Nike had made illicit payments to young basketball players in Los Angeles. Revealing this would wipe billions from Nike's stock value, he had suggested. Nike immediately reported the matter to federal prosecutors. Avenatti was arrested shortly after announcing he would hold a news conference about a scandal surrounding the company. ""This was an old-fashioned shakedown,"" prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said at the time. The jury heard that Avenatti had been at least $11m in debt. Last month,Avenatti's lawyers said he was suffering while being held in solitary confinementand under 24-hour lockdown in the same Manhattan prison cell that housed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Avenatti previously represented porn star Stormy Daniels Avenatti formerly represented Stormy Daniels, who tried to sue the president to get out of a non-disclosure agreement she had signed before the 2016 presidential election. The non-disclosure agreement related to an affair she said he had with Mr Trump in 2006, but the case was eventually dismissed. In May last year, Avenatti was charged with defrauding her of book proceeds, and faces trial in New York in April. He denies all the charges. He also faces another trial in Los Angeles in May on accusations he defrauded clients and others of millions of dollars.

"More than 63,000 people in China have been infected with the coronavirus Beijing has ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment in the latest attempt to contain the deadly new coronavirus, state media report. Residents were told to ""self-quarantine or go to designated venues to quarantine"" after returning to the Chinese capital from holidays. The measure came as Egypt confirmed the first coronavirus case in Africa. Over 1,500 people have died from the virus, which originated in Wuhan city. The notice on Friday from Beijing's virus prevention working group was issued as residents returned from spending the Lunar New Year in other parts of China. The holiday was extended this year to help contain the outbreak. More than 20 million people live in Beijing.

China's national health commission on Saturday reported 143 new deaths, bringing the toll to 1,523. All but four of the latest victims were in hard-hit Hubei province. A further 2,641 people have been newly confirmed as infected, bringing the national total to 66,492. Outside mainland China, there have been more than 500 cases in 24 countries, and three deaths: one each in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan. A World Health Organization (WHO)-led mission to China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the virus - officially named Covid-19 - is spreading and its severity, director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The mission, including international experts, will also look at how and when more than 1,700 health workers contracted the virus. The team consists of 12 international members and their 12 Chinese counterparts. ""Particular attention will be paid to understanding transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures,"" said Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme. Egypt's health ministry on Friday confirmed the first case of the coronavirus in Africa. The ministry described the person as a foreigner, but did not disclose the nationality. It said it had notified the WHO, and the patient had been placed in isolation in a hospital. Experts had earlier warned that it may not be long before the first case was confirmed in Africa, given its increasingly close ties to China. Chinese officials say six health workers have died. Zeng Yixin, vice minister of China's National Health Commission, said 1,102 medical workers had been infected in Wuhan and another 400 in other parts of Hubei province.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has carried out a reshuffle of ministers in cabinet positions, two months after winning the general election. There was speculation ahead of the reshuffle about how diverse the new Cabinet would be, particularly considering women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Who's in what job? Here's a guide to the people that make up Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces and who's changed places. Boris Johnson's election win in December secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. While his election campaign promised to ""get Brexit done"", Mr Johnson has said his ""one nation government"" will also ""massively increase investment in the NHS"". Mr Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, having served as foreign secretary since 2016 in what was only his first cabinet post. His views on how to deliver Brexit brought him into conflict with Mrs May, and led to his resignation in 2018. Rishi Sunak replaces Sajid Javid, who resigned as Chancellor during the reshuffle on Thursday. Appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July, Rishi Sunakâs status as a rising star was highlighted when he was sent to stand in for Boris Johnson at the BBCâs seven-party election debate. He was previously a successful businessman, co-founding a large investment firm. Mr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy daughter of an Indian billionaire. The couple lived in California for a number of years before coming back to the UK. They now have two daughters. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Dominic Raab was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet in July and remains in post. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. He is married with two sons. Michael Gove is the cabinet minister with the most experience - but his aspirations for the top job are well known. He lost out to Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership campaign in summer 2019. Mr Gove became environment secretary in June 2017 and proved a key advocate of Theresa Mayâs Brexit deal, while other Brexiteer cabinet ministers resigned. In 2016, he famously scuppered the leadership hopes of his friend Boris Johnson, by announcing his own candidature on the morning of Johnson's own campaign launch. Mr Gove was a key ally of former Prime Minister David Cameron and has served as MP for Surrey Heath since 2005. He made his name as a radical education secretary, bringing in major changes to exams and the curriculum and battling teaching unions during his four years in the role. Appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson last July, Ben Wallace previously served as security minister. Mr Wallace backed Remain in 2016 and has warned that leaving the EU without a deal would hit UK-EU security ties and have a ""real impact"" on protecting the public. After training at Sandhurst, Mr Wallace joined the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. He spent eight years in the Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. Liz Truss was made international trade secretary and also women and equalities minister when Boris Johnson took office and remains in that role. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Mr Hancock remains in post as health secretary. At 40, he was youngest contender in the Tory leadership race in the summer of 2019. He quit the contest a day after he came sixth in the first ballot and later endorsed Boris Johnson. The ambitious MP for West Suffolk was promoted to health secretary in 2018 after only a few months as culture secretary. He campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum but backed both Theresa May's and Mr Johnson's Brexit deal. The former Bank of England economist likes to see himself as one of the most technology-savvy politicians at Westminster - he was the first MP to have his own smartphone app. Gavin Williamson made a swift return to the cabinet last July following his sacking by Theresa May two months earlier after row over the leaking of information from the National Security Council. Mr Williamson is influential within the Tory party, having served as a ministerial aide to David Cameron and then as chief whip, in charge of party discipline. At that time, he famously kept a tarantula named Cronus on his desk in the House of Commons. Mr Williamson, who backed remain in the EU referendum, also helped to run Boris Johnsonâs campaign in the first phase of the Tory leadership contest last summer. The 41-year old MP for Hertsmere is a rising star in the Conservative ranks and replaces Nicky Morgan as Culture Secretary. Since last summer, he has been a minister in the Cabinet Office â playing a key role working with No 10 in implementing government policy. Before becoming an MP, the Cambridge-educated law graduate worked in public relations and cut his teeth in the Conservative Research Department. He then worked as an adviser to David Cameron, becoming his deputy chief of staff in Downing Street. He subsequently received a CBE for his services. In his maiden speech, he told the House of Commons he could make a legitimate claim to be the MP for TV soap Eastendersâ Albert Square, as it was filmed in his constituency. During his five years in the Commons, he has campaigned on greater legal protection for the Green Belt, more money for education and simplification of the tax system. The former International Development Secretary replaces Andrea Leadsom. The MP for Reading West backed Boris Johnson for prime minister and joined the cabinet in July 2019. Mr Sharma will also be the minister responsible for the Glasgow COP26 climate summit in November. Prior to being elected in 2010, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked in banking. He is married with two daughters. Former Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick represented the Conservatives on the under 30s Question Time debate during the general election campaign. In the summer he joined other rising stars Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden in saying Boris Johnson was the only one who could save the Tory party from an ""existential threat"". He drew criticism in 2017 when, as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on international trade, he attended US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Mr Jenrick was elected as MP for Newark in a by-election in June 2014 after Patrick Mercer resigned in disgrace, and won the seat with an increased majority at the general election of 2015. He voted Remain in the EU referendum. Former environment minister Therese Coffey was appointed after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and later voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she has since spoken about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department in May 2019. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". Mr Buckland campaigned to remain in the EU, but has said it is important to deliver on the result of the referendum. He has, however, previously spoken out against a no-deal Brexit and of the need for compromise. He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He had previously practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaces Alok Sharma as International Development Secretary. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. The former international development minister Grant Shapps became transport secretary in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. A former remainer, he has since said he is backing Brexit ""as hard as you like"". He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps, a father-of-three, was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice replaces Theresa Villiers as environment secretary. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Brandon Lewis replaces Julian Smith as Northern Ireland Secretary. The former Conservative Party chairman rejoined cabinet under Boris Johnson as home office minister in July 2019. Previous positions include minister without portfolio, minister for housing and and minister for immigration. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood Borough Council, Essex, Mr Lewis has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Simon Hart was appointed as Welsh secretary to replace Alun Cairns last November. Mr Cairns resigned at the start of the general election campaign amid a row over what he knew about an aide's role in the collapse of a rape trial. The job was a promotion for Mr Hart, who has represented Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire since 2010. He previously served as a junior minister in the Cabinet Office. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also director of the New Schools Network, the organisation set up by Rachel Wolf, which runs the free schools programme. Amanda Milling replaces James Cleverly as Conservative Party chairman and will attend Cabinet as minister without portfolio. She was previously deputy chief whip, and was elected to Parliament as member for Cannock Chase in 2015. Amanda Milling is known as a key ally of Boris Johnson and worked on his leadership campaign. Jacob Rees Mogg is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit, and has long argued that the UK would be best to leave the EU with no deal. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it is his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. During the election campaign, he was criticised for saying it would have been ""common sense"" to flee the Grenfell Tower fire, ignoring fire brigade advice. Boris Johnson's chief enforcer, in theory, has an easier job now the party has a large majority. But Mr Spencer is no stranger to the role, having served in the whips' office since 2016. He has also been given the role of parliamentary secretary to the Treasury. From farming family, Mr Spencer did not attend Oxbridge, unlike many of his colleagues. He attended Shuttleworth Agricultural College before joining the family farming business. He started his political career as a local councillor and won the Sherwood seat from Labour in the 2010 general election. Suella Braverman replaces Geoffrey Cox as attorney general. A strong Brexit supporter, Ms Braverman chaired the European Research Group from June 2017 to January 2018 and became a minister at the Department for Leaving the EU under Theresa May. She resigned in November 2018 in protest at Mrs May's draft EU withdrawal deal Suella Braverman has served as MP for Fareham since 2015. Stephen Barclay will attend Cabinet in a new role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Barclay previously served as Brexit secretary under Theresa May and Boris Johnson - a position which became defunct at 11.01pm on 31 January as the UK left the EU. He was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. Note:BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) is a term widely used in the UK to describe people of non-white descent, as defined by the Institute of Race Relations. This is the second reshuffle for Mr Johnson, who became prime minister last July after winning a Conservative leadership election. Big names to have left cabinet on Thursday includedChancellor Sajid Javid, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. The make-up of the cabinet has also changed. The proportion of women in it has increased - but the actual number has fallen from eight to seven because some positions were closed. Members of the cabinet are more than 10 times more likely to have gone to a private school than members of the public. Under Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, 70% of cabinet had not been privately educated, whereas almost 70% of Mr Johnson's new cabinet have. According to the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at Oxford - except for Gordon Brown.  Half of Mr Johnson's cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 27% of all Conservative MPs and 18% of Labour MPs. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said December's election led to a seismic shift in the political landscape and Conservative MPs now represent a more diverse range of constituencies than before. ""Yet in terms of educational background, the make-up of Johnson's cabinet is still over 60% from independent schools,"" he said. ""Today's findings underline how unevenly spread the opportunities are to enter the elites and this is something Boris Johnson must address."" Michael Gove is by far the most experienced of Mr Johnson's new top team. The ministers who have had 204 days of cabinet experience are new faces appointed by the PM when he took power in July last year. Click here,externalif you cannot see the Cabinet Guide.

"Dominic Raab at a UK-Africa investment summit last month Beneath the unexpected bloodletting of his cabinet reshuffle, Boris Johnson has quietly but radically reformed the way his ministers will handle foreign affairs. For the prime minister has decided that every single junior Foreign Office minister will also be a joint minister with the Department for International Development. Or vice versa, depending on your view down Whitehall. There are now seven ministers who hold this hybrid duality: the ministers of state - James Cleverly, Nigel Adams, Lord Ahmad and Lord Goldsmith - and the parliamentary under secretaries of state James Duddrige, Wendy Morton and Lady Sugg. Mordaunt back as PM reshuffles ministers Cabinet reshuffle: Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? PM tells cabinet to focus on delivering promises This is not the first time there have been ministers with joint roles in different departments. The practice was common in the New Labour years and continued under David Cameron. Anne-Marie Trevelyan is the new International Development Secretary Francis Maude was a minister both at the Foreign Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Lady Warsi was at the Foreign Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government. But the practice of having joint FCO/DFID ministers is relatively new. It was first used by Theresa May in 2017. She wanted to try to get both departments working more closely. Alistair Burt and Rory Stewart were the first incumbents. Before Thursday's reshuffle, their respective roles were held by Andrew Murrison and Andrew Stephenson, both of whom have moved on. It is, however, unprecedented for every single junior minister in both departments to have a joint role. And it raises many questions. How will their responsibilities be divided up? To whom will they be accountable - Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary. or Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the new International Development Secretary? Lord Goldsmith is one of the ministers with a dual role Will these ministers have one or two private offices? Some FCO sources suggest they will have one, some DFID sources say two. Will their private secretaries be FCO or DFID? There may be a battle royal as officials divide up the spoils. Then there is the bigger question: is this just the start of things to come? In DFID some folk are breathing a sigh of relief that their department has not been merged into the FCO, as had been predicted. They insist they still have an independent department with an independent secretary of state. But the prime minister is on record in calling for such a change in the past. Foreign aid 'to be used for UK interests' UK aid budget to help boost trade agenda Senior ministers talk of DFID ""running a shadow foreign policy"" and the need to adopt a more joined-up approach. And there is still a strong vein of traditional aid scepticism on the Tory backbenches. Some folk will wonder if this ministerial merger is merely a taste of things to come. One former minister described the changes to me as ""a takeover by stealth"". Some in government see the reshuffle as a stay of execution for DFID, the start of a period of probation in which the department has a chance to prove it can do joined up foreign policy without the need for full amalgamation with the FCO. It is easy to forget that DFID - or its equivalent - has been in and out of the Foreign Office since the Ministry of Overseas Development was first created in the 1960s. It only separated from the FCO in its current form under Tony Blair in 1997. What is clear from my own discussions with senior Whitehall sources is that this administration remains determined to provide UK aid policy with greater political direction, so that the Â£14bn budget does not just help tackle extreme poverty but it also promotes Britain's national interests. Quite how they try to do that remains unclear. But a joint ministerial team is a clear step in that direction. As Anne-Marie Trevelyan tweeted this morning: ""I want to show the British public we are delivering the best results for their aid, transforming the lives of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people, while promoting Britain's economic and security interests."" The new DFID Secretary of State has in the past been sceptical about UK aid, with comments and retweets indicating she questioned the priorities of spending taxpayers' money helping the poor overseas. But in her first statement in the new role she said the government remained committed to spending 0.7% of its income on development: ""I know from my previous role as Armed Forces Minister how UK aid, alongside our world class defence and diplomacy, supports peace and prosperity around the world. ""As International Development Secretary I will ensure that UK aid promotes girls' education around the world, tackles climate change, works to end preventable deaths and helps countries receiving aid become self-sufficient."" For DFID, this reshuffle marks a continuing period of ministerial instability. The department has now had six secretaries of state in the last four years. Justine Greening left in July 2016, followed by Priti Patel (16 months), Penny Mordaunt (19 months), Rory Stewart (3 months), Alok Sharma (6 months) and now Ms Trevelyan. And for the Foreign Office, this is also a time of yet more change. It has just lost four ministers: Chris Pincher, Andrew Murrison, Andrew Stephenson and Heather Wheeler, all of whom were appointed only in July last year, along with Dominic Raab. Lord Ahmad is the longest serving minister, appointed in June 2017. This means there is a lot of new blood in King Charles Street but little institutional memory. That can mean a power shift to officials but it rarely helps UK foreign policy. Much diplomacy is about relationships. Foreign governments are rarely impressed by revolving doors. Longstanding former Foreign Office ministers like Alistair Burt, David Lidington and Alan Duncan were effective because they were known and trusted by ministers and officials around the world. They could engage in the discreet conversations that quietly promote UK national interests in the corridors of power. All that is harder with a bunch of newly-appointed ministers trying to work out who their boss is and where the coffee machine is kept.

"Authorities in Wuhan have had to create extra hospital space to cope with large numbers of cases Chinese officials have given figures for health workers infected with the new coronavirus, amid concerns about shortages of protective equipment. Six health workers have died and 1,716 have been infected since the outbreak, they said. The death a week ago of Doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to warn authorities early on about the virus, provoked a burst of public anger and grief. More than 1,300 people are now known to have died from the virus. The latest figures show 122 new deaths in China, bringing the toll to 1,381. The total number of infections has jumped to 63,922 cases, according to the National Health Commission. TheWorld Health Organization said there was no major shift in the virus's pattern of mortality or severity, despite a spike in cases in Hubei, the epicentre of the disease, on Tuesday. The doctor who tried to warn others Are coronavirus tests flawed? What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Most of this was down to Hubei using a broader definition to diagnose people, said Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme. There was also no significant rise in cases outside China, the WHO said. However, a cruise ship docked in Japan, the Diamond Princess, saw 44 new cases, bringing the total there to 218. Zeng Yixin, vice minister of China's National Health Commission, said 1,102 medical workers had been infected in Wuhan, where the outbreak began, and another 400 in other parts of Hubei province. He said the number of infections among staff was increasing. This video can not be played Medics in Wuhan resort to shaving their heads in a bid to prevent cross-infection of the coronavirus ""The duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great, and the risk of infection is high,"" Mr Zeng said, quoted by Reuters. Local authorities have struggled to provide protective equipment such as respiratory masks, goggles and protective suits in hospitals in the area. One doctor told AFP news agency that he and 16 colleagues were showing possible symptoms of the virus. Another medical worker said she and more than 100 other staff at her hospital had been quarantined,external. A further 30 had been confirmed to have been infected there out of a staff of 500 she told CNN. On 7 February the plight of medical workers was highlighted by the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who had tried to issue the first warning about the virus on 30 December. Li Wenliang contracted the virus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital He had sent out a warning to fellow medics but police told him to stop ""making false comments"".

"Manchester City have made 10 appearances in Uefa's premier club competition Manchester City have been banned from European club competition for the next two seasons after being found to have committed ""serious breaches"" of Uefa's club licensing and financial fair play regulations. The reigning Premier League champions have also been fined 30m euros (Â£25m). The decision is subject to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Manchester City say they are ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the ""prejudicial"" decision and will appeal. The independent Adjudicatory Chamber of the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) said City had broken the rules by ""overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016"", adding that the club ""failed to cooperate in the investigation"".

""For years we have been calling for severe action against Manchester City and Paris St-Germain, we finally have a good example of action and hope to see more. Better late than never."" By Simon Stone, BBC Sport This is massive news. Given the speed of their statement in response, it is fair to assume Manchester City were braced for this decision, but maybe not the severity of it. City have said publicly and privately they intend to fight the decision. They are adamant an independent judiciary - they do not think this was - will clear them. However, as it stands, the club are out of the Champions League for two seasons, which raises massive immediate questions. Pep Guardiola has always maintained he would remain at City at least until his contract expires in 2021 but has also said he trusts the club's hierarchy when they tell him they have done nothing wrong. Whether they win the Champions League this season or not, will Guardiola decide to move on? And if he does, what about the future of the club's star players, many of whom joined because he was the manager. And does this mean an extra place in the Champions League will be available should the Blues miss out? It is an absolutely fascinating situation and, clearly, we are far from a definitive final outcome. Uefa launched an investigation after German newspaper Der Spiegel published leaked documents in November 2018 alleging City had inflated the value of a sponsorship deal, misleading European football's governing body. Reports alleged City - who have always denied wrongdoing - deliberately misled Uefa so they could meet FFP rules requiring clubs to break even. City were fined Â£49m in 2014 for a previous breach of regulations. Financial Fair Play was introduced by Uefa to prevent clubs in its competitions from spending beyond their means and stamp out what its then president Michel Platini called ""financial doping"" within football. Under the rules, financial losses are limited and clubs are also obliged to meet all their transfer and employee payment commitments at all times. Clubs need to balance football-related expenditure - transfers and wages - with television and ticket income, plus revenues raised by their commercial departments. Money spent on stadiums, training facilities, youth development or community projects is exempt. The CFCB, set up by Uefa, has the ultimate sanction of banning clubs from Uefa competitions, with other potential punishments including warnings, fines, withholding prize money, transfer bans, points deductions, a ban on registration of new players and a restriction on the number of players who can be registered for Uefa competitions.

It is an absolutely fascinating situation and, clearly, we are far from a definitive final outcome. Uefa launched an investigation after German newspaper Der Spiegel published leaked documents in November 2018 alleging City had inflated the value of a sponsorship deal, misleading European football's governing body. Reports alleged City - who have always denied wrongdoing - deliberately misled Uefa so they could meet FFP rules requiring clubs to break even. City were fined Â£49m in 2014 for a previous breach of regulations. Financial Fair Play was introduced by Uefa to prevent clubs in its competitions from spending beyond their means and stamp out what its then president Michel Platini called ""financial doping"" within football. Under the rules, financial losses are limited and clubs are also obliged to meet all their transfer and employee payment commitments at all times. Clubs need to balance football-related expenditure - transfers and wages - with television and ticket income, plus revenues raised by their commercial departments. Money spent on stadiums, training facilities, youth development or community projects is exempt. The CFCB, set up by Uefa, has the ultimate sanction of banning clubs from Uefa competitions, with other potential punishments including warnings, fines, withholding prize money, transfer bans, points deductions, a ban on registration of new players and a restriction on the number of players who can be registered for Uefa competitions.

"Midrar Ali was starved of oxygen due to complications at birth Doctors can stop providing medical treatment for a brain dead baby, the Court of Appeal has ruled. The three appeal judges analysed evidence on four-month-old Midrar Ali after the High Court concluded that treatment could be withdrawn. Midrar's father had argued his son had been showing ""signs of life"" and said the ruling was ""terrible"". But doctors at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester said the baby should be allowed a ""kind and dignified death"". Mrs Justice Lieven, who analysed evidence at a trial in the Family Division of the High Court in Manchester last month, had concluded that Midrar was brain-stem dead. Midrar's parents, Karwan Ali, 35, and Shokhan Namiq, 28, who live in Manchester, had asked appeal judges to overturn the ruling. They said he was still growing and that doctors could not be sure that he will not improve, which meant more tests should be carried out. Karwan Ali and Shokhan Namiq had asked appeal judges to overturn the High Court ruling But appeal judges Sir Andrew McFarlane, Lord Justice Patten and Lady Justice King dismissed their challenge. They concluded that Midrar's parents did not have an arguable case and declared that their son died at 20:01 GMT on 1 October, when he would have been 14 days old. Sir Andrew said evidence showed that ""awfully"" Midrar no longer has a ""brain that is recognisable as such"". ""There is no basis for contemplating that any further tests would result in a different outcome,"" he said. Midrar was starved of oxygen when the umbilical cord came out ahead of his birth on 18 September, causing complications. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which runs St Mary's Hospital, has previously said that Midrar has always been on a ventilator and has never breathed independently. Midrar Ali's parents Karwan Ali and Shokhan Namiq wanted his treatment to continue It said his organs were deteriorating and continuing to treat Midrar was ""undignified"". Lawyers representing the hospital's trust said three tests had confirmed brain stem death. Speaking after the latest legal ruling, Mr Ali said: ""I'm just reading what the appeal judges have said, then we'll discuss it with our lawyers. ""He's still growing. They can't be 100% sure he is dead. He's still growing. His eyes move. I've seen them move."" Brain injury baby treatment 'can be withdrawn' Dad of brain injury baby 'pressured' by medics Baby boy in life support legal row 'is brain dead' The family's solicitor, David Foster, said Midrar's parents were considering an appeal and would like the court to ""give weight to experts from outside the UK"". The next step would be to take the case to the Supreme Court. ""They believe the law in this area should be reviewed and do not consider Midrar's condition is necessarily irreversible,"" Mr Foster. A spokesperson for the hospital trust said it ""acknowledges the judgement made today and recognises that these are incredibly sad circumstances"". ""Our thoughts remain with baby Midrar's family at this very difficult time,"" they added.

"Boris Johnson has described a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland as a ""very interesting idea"" Scotland's transport minister has branded the UK's government's proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland a Â£20bn ""vanity project"". Michael Matheson criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not consulting Holyrood before announcingofficials were looking into the idea. Mr Matheson said the money earmarked for a new bridge would be better spent on projects ""that will improve lives"". Downing Street has said the PM believes the bridge ""would have some merit"". It was revealed on Monday that work was under way ""by a range of government officials"" to look at the idea of building the bridge. Boris Johnson described it as a ""very interesting idea"", while Ireland's premier Leo Varadkar said it was ""worth examining"". Will the 'Boris Bridge' ever rise from the seas? Work 'under way' into Scotland-NI bridge feasibility Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge 'worth examining' Two routes have previously been put forward - from Portpatrick to Larne or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast. The Portpatrick route would be more than 20 miles across the North Channel. Mr Matheson has written to his UK government counterpart Grant Shapps to express his ""concerns"" about the proposals. He said there had not been any discussions with the Holyrood or Stormont administrations, despite transport being a devolved issue. Mr Matheson wrote: ""I strongly believe that if Â£20bn is available for investment in infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland that rather than indulging the prime minister with this vanity project, such funding should be made available to our respective governments so it could be better spent on meeting the priorities of the people we represent. ""I therefore request immediate discussions with your officials on releasing to us the Â£20bn of funding you have identified so it can be invested in the priorities of Northern Ireland and Scotland."" Mr Matheson also raised concerns about a reported ""munitions dump"" at Beaufort's Dyke in the North Channel, on the path of construction for the proposed bridge. He said money spent to work around the problem ""could be put to better use on practical, deliverable projects"". The Scottish minister has been backed by Northern Ireland's infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who said she was ""surprised and concerned"" by the proposals. She added: ""I am extremely concerned that pursuit of this project, costing Â£20bn, will be a waste of significant money and resource that could be put to better use by addressing pressures and deliverable projects here in Northern Ireland and elsewhere."" Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, to Larne, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, is one potential route for a bridge The price of any construction would, obviously, be dependent on the route chosen. More than a decade ago the think tank the Centre for Cross Border Studiessuggested a 21-mile bridge from Dumfries and Galloway could provide international rail links and ease the strain on air services.,external At that time it estimated the cost of the scheme would be about Â£3.5bn. However, by last year the suggested price tag had risen considerably. Some experts have suggested Â£15bn might be required for the project but others have said that  Â£20bn would be a ""conservative estimate"".

"This video can not be played Will Jackson Carlaw be Boris Johnson's chief Scottish cheerleader? Jackson Carlaw has been confirmed as the new leader of the Scottish Conservatives after winning a vote of party members. Mr Carlaw had been the party's interim leader since Ruth Davidson quit the role in August. He has now won the job full time after defeating fellow MSP Michelle Ballantyne by 4,917 votes to 1,581. Mr Carlaw had been the clear favourite in the contest, and was backed by most of the party's MPs and MSPs. He said he was now ""ready to hit the ground running and win"" in next year's Scottish Parliament election by attracting voters from ""middle Scotland"". The new leader has already promised a full review of the party's policies and a ""new, reinvigorated"" frontbench team at Holyrood. Within hours of his election Mr Carlaw announced that Glasgow MSP Annie Wells would become a joint deputy leader of the party alongside North East MSP Liam Kerr. Rachael Hamilton, the Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire MSP, will become a party chairwoman with existing chairman Rab Forman. More changes will be announced next week. Ruth Davidson quits as Scottish Tory leader Mr Carlaw said: ""This is not about asking the people of Scotland to re-elect us as a strong opposition, this is about offering the people of Scotland a clear alternative to the SNP and then fighting all the way to polling day next year to provide them with an alternative government. ""I have a bigger share of the vote than Boris Johnson achieved in his leadership election, I have a bigger share of the vote than Ruth Davidson achieved, a bigger share of the vote than David Cameron achieved in any of the previous Conservative Party leadership elections. ""So I have a clear mandate from the party in Scotland now to make the changes required to lead us into the election next year."" Opinion polls suggest that the SNP, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,remains on course to win a fourth successive term in government,externalin next year's election - with the Conservatives currently a distant second. The new party leader was congratulated by his defeated opponent when the result was announced The leadership contest - which was delayed by December's general election - had been bad-tempered at times, with the two candidates trading insults ahead of the result being announced. Ms Ballantyne, who claimed to have strong grassroots support, accused Mr Carlaw of running a general election campaign that""lacked vision and ambition"",external, with the party losing seven of its 13 MPs. Mr Carlaw hit back by claiming his opponent was the only member of the Tory frontbench team at Holyroodnever to have submitted a ""single policy proposal"",external. Allow Twitter content?

The Scottish Conservatives are currently the second biggest party at Holyrood, with Ms Davidson widely credited with turning around its electoral fortunes in her eight years as leader. But she quit shortly after returning from maternity leave, saying that ""much had changed"" both politically and personally in recent months. As well as the birth of her son, Ms Davidson had been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Boris Johnson - particularly over his approach to Brexit. The new leader is a close political ally of his predecessor, Ruth Davidson Jackson Carlaw worked as a car salesman in the west of Scotland for 25 years before being elected as an MSP, but has been involved in politics since joining the Conservatives as teenager in the late 1970s. He first stood as a candidate in the 1982 Queen's Park by-election, and after several other unsuccessful attempts was eventually elected as a list MSP for the West of Scotland region in the 2007 and again in 2011 - when he also became Ms Davidson's deputy leader. Mr Carlaw, who is married with two children, was elected as the MSP for Eastwood in 2016, and served as acting leader when Ms Davidson went on maternity leave ahead of the birth of her son in May of last year.

When Ms Davidsonresigned as party leader in August, Mr Carlaw was immediately appointed as interim leader - with some of his supporters hoping he would be given the role on a permanent basis without a leadership contest being required. The 60-year-old says he wants the party to appeal to ""middle Scotland"" ahead of next year's Scottish Parliament election, when he says his goal is to ""take down"" Ms Sturgeon and the SNP. Among his key policy proposals are increasing the number of teachers in Scotland by 2,000, bringing income taxes into line with the rest of the UK, and scrapping the Scottish government's plan to introduce a so-calledparking tax. Mr Carlaw has faced Nicola Sturgeon during the weekly First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament while acting as interim leader He told his official campaign launch last month that he stands for ""a decent, generous-spirited, aspirational conservatism that promotes the values and ambitions of middle Scotland"". Mr Carlaw secured public support from the majority of Conservative MSPs and MPs during the leadership contest, as well as all of the party's local council leaders. He points to the experience he has built up in his lengthy stint as acting leader - which saw him go head-to-head with Ms Sturgeon during first minister's questions every week. But critics say that Mr Carlaw's tenure included last month's general election, when the Scottish Conservatives lost seven of the 13 seats they had won under Ms Davidson in 2017 despite the Tories winning a majority across the UK as a whole.

"Student Olly Finch had mumps despite being vaccinated Health officials are urging people to have both parts of the MMR vaccine after cases of mumps in England reached their highest level in a decade. Outbreaks in universities and colleges raised the number of cases of the painful viral illness to 5,042 in 2019 - four times the number in 2018. Most were in young adults who missed out on the MMR jab. Public Health England said the full two doses of the vaccination were needed to maximise protection. Mumps: Why adults might still need the MMR jab The vaccine prevents most cases of mumps - but not all, and so some young people are still getting the illness. There were also increases in mumps cases inWalesandScotland,externalin 2019. It is a viral infection that used to be very common in children before the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988. A classic sign is puffy cheeks under the ears. Mumps is contagious and spread through infected droplets of saliva breathed in through the mouth or nose. painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face headache fever joint pain feeling tired loss of appetite Most people usually recover without treatment. But in rare cases, there can be serious complications, such as inflammation of the testicles in males, meningitis and deafness. Source:NHS UK,external Flora Cox, a Leeds student, had mumps ""I went to bed normal, everything fine, and then I woke up, and bang - my face was so puffed out, so swollen,"" says Olly Finch, a student at Leeds University. ""I got prescribed morphine - it was that bad."" Flora Cox, another Leeds student, said: ""It started out with just neck pain in my ear and jaw, and then it started swelling - it was so painful. ""Your jaw pretty much locks."" David Buckley, 32, ended up with a swollen testicle ""the size of an avocado"" when he had mumps. That followed 10 days at home in bed with symptoms and a trip to hospital with a locked jaw. ""It was so painful, really horrible. I tried to ice it... but it's just something you have to ride out,"" he told Radio 1 Newsbeat. David wasn't sure if he'd had the second dose of the MMR vaccine, so he got the jab again - just in case. Mumps - is it the forgotten disease? Why are university students catching mumps? The best and safest way is to gettwo doses of the MMR vaccine,external- the middle 'M' stands for mumps. It's never too late to catch up, says Dr Vanessa Saliba, from Public Health England. ""We encourage all students and young people who may have missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past to contact their GP practice and get up to date as soon as possible,"" she said. Adults and children who missed out on the vaccine as babies can also have it on the NHS at any age - it is given in two doses, with the second at least a month after the first. The part of the triple vaccine that specifically protects against mumps isn't quite as effective as the elements protecting against measles and rubella. However, getting the jab is still crucial - because the more people who are protected, the less likely mumps is to be shared around. During outbreaks among students, which are common, completely unvaccinated people are at highest risk. Even if you get the illness after being vaccinated, you are likely to have a less serious form of it and fewer complications. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella Cases of mumps consistently outnumber measles and rubella cases every year. Teenagers and young adults in colleges and universities are now the ones who tend to be affected - for several reasons. Many of the 2019 cases were born in the late 1990s and early 2000s and missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children. Research by a disgraced UK doctor falsely linking the vaccine to autismundoubtedly had an impact on uptake. Current students may also be too old to have been immunised or offered the MMR, or may only have had one dose of the vaccine and thus not be fully protected. It is also possible the vaccine's protection against mumps may have worn off. Despite the recent rise in cases, mumps hasn't just reappeared. Before the MMR vaccine, eight out of 10 people developed it and most of them were children of school age. At that time, there were five deaths a year from mumps, mainly due to encephalitis or swelling of the brain. The illness then became relatively rare before returning in the 2000s. There was a particularlylarge outbreak (43,000 cases) in 2005,external.

"This video can not be played Alison Rose: ""My focus is on making sure we're a safe, smart bank for the future"" Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Group has said it plans to change its name later this year, as it reported a near doubling of annual profits. The Edinburgh-based bank, which owns RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank, said it would rename itself as NatWest Group. The bank reported profits of Â£3.1bn,externalfor 2019, nearly double the Â£1.6bn seen the year before. New RBS chief executive Alison Rose called the results the ""start of a new era"" for the bank. It is thought that Ms Rose is hoping a rebrand will help shift the lender's image away from its association with the financial crisis. The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of Â£45bn and it is still 62% state-owned. What will bank branches look like in the future? Ms Rose told the BBC's Today programme that the name change would not alter any services for RBS or NatWest customers. About 80% of the bank's customers are thought to use NatWest. Names of individual NatWest and RBS branches will remain the same. She also said that the name change would not result in any job cuts across the group. This is Ms Rose's first set of results for the lender. She became the first woman to lead one of the so-called big four largest UK banks when she was appointed last year. Today's announcement was not just the first set of full-year results unveiled by new chief executive Alison Rose but also the long-awaited unveiling of her strategy. But many crucial questions remain unanswered, with Ms Rose failing to address recent press reports that claimed job cuts may be in store. RBS was the subject of a Â£45bn state bailout during the financial crisis, and remains 62% taxpayer-owned. A 25-year veteran of the bank, Alison Rose is one of the few senior executives left from the pre-crisis era, when former boss Fred Goodwin's overambitious expansion plans left the bank in a perilous state. More than a decade on, it falls to her to complete the clean-up operation. She says the name change for the parent company marks a new era, but the real challenge is to prove she can get the bank back into a state where the remaining stake can be sold without incurring a hefty loss for taxpayers. RBS also announced it was committed to ""at least halve the climate impact"" of its financing activity by 2030. It says it will stop lending to coal companies by the end of the decade. The bank also confirmed it would make its own operations ""net carbon zero"" by the end of this year. That follows on from a pledge by Lloyds Banking Group to halve the amount of carbon emissions it finances through personal and business loans by 2030. Chief executive Alison Rose was appointed in 2019 Ms Rose has been at RBS for more than 25 years, mainly in a number of roles in its investment bank. She was previously deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, and before Ms Rose was appointed chief executive of the RBS group she was head of commercial and private banking. She worked her way up after joining the bank as a graduate trainee in 1992. Unlike her predecessor Ross McEwan, she is based solely in London, although the bank has its headquarters in Edinburgh. Ms Rose is also paid more than her predecessor, with her annual salary set at Â£1.1m compared with Mr McEwan's Â£1m. RBS's share price fell by more than 6% in Friday trading after its results came out. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said markets needed ""some convincing"", despite the jump in profits. But he said ""it's clear RBS is putting legacy conduct issues behind it and has got the payment protection insurance (PPI) monkey off its back"". The bank took a Â£900m charge for mis-sold PPI in 2019, which was at the top end of its expectations. Mr Wilson added: ""Now that the PPI deadline has passed, the bank has much greater visibility of future cash generation."" What will bank branches look like in the future?

RBS also announced it was committed to ""at least halve the climate impact"" of its financing activity by 2030. It says it will stop lending to coal companies by the end of the decade. The bank also confirmed it would make its own operations ""net carbon zero"" by the end of this year. That follows on from a pledge by Lloyds Banking Group to halve the amount of carbon emissions it finances through personal and business loans by 2030. Chief executive Alison Rose was appointed in 2019 Ms Rose has been at RBS for more than 25 years, mainly in a number of roles in its investment bank. She was previously deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, and before Ms Rose was appointed chief executive of the RBS group she was head of commercial and private banking. She worked her way up after joining the bank as a graduate trainee in 1992. Unlike her predecessor Ross McEwan, she is based solely in London, although the bank has its headquarters in Edinburgh. Ms Rose is also paid more than her predecessor, with her annual salary set at Â£1.1m compared with Mr McEwan's Â£1m. RBS's share price fell by more than 6% in Friday trading after its results came out. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said markets needed ""some convincing"", despite the jump in profits. But he said ""it's clear RBS is putting legacy conduct issues behind it and has got the payment protection insurance (PPI) monkey off its back"". The bank took a Â£900m charge for mis-sold PPI in 2019, which was at the top end of its expectations. Mr Wilson added: ""Now that the PPI deadline has passed, the bank has much greater visibility of future cash generation."" What will bank branches look like in the future?

"Billie Eilish is the youngest artist ever to record a Bond theme Billie Eilish's theme for the new James Bond film is a dramatic, unsettling ballad that hints the plot will centre around the secret agent's betrayal. The lyrics to No Time To Die reference lies and deceit, as Eilish sings:""You were never on my side."" The song was released at 00:00 GMT, at the same time as the latesttrailer for the film,external, starring Daniel Craig. Eilish, who turned 18 in December, is the youngest singer ever to record a theme for the franchise. Its release was highly anticipated at the end of a week that saw her performing to a worldwide TV audience at the Oscars. Allow YouTube content?

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. No Time To Die opens with a haunting piano motif, with the star's voice weary as she sings, ""I should have known I'd leave alone"". A familiar tremolo guitar ushers in the chorus, where the singer develops her theme: ""I've fallen for a lie... Are you death or paradise?"" ""Now you'll never see me cry,""she concludes. ""There's just no time to die."" The words seem to confirm a fan theory that Daniel Craig's final outing as Bond will see him double-crossed by Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), his love interest from the previous film, Spectre. Eilish wrote and produced the title song with her elder brother Finneas O'Connell late last year. Speaking at the Grammys in January, she said working on the franchise had always been one of their goals. ""Subconsciously and consciously, we've been trying to write a Bond theme for our whole lives,"" she told E! News. Billie Eilish is the big winner at the Grammys What we learned from the first James Bond trailer James Bond's greatest hits - and biggest misses Shrewdly, the duo retain their dark, off-kilter style throughout the song, while incorporating several of the film series' musical touchstones - swelling strings, discordant brass, and, best of all, it finishes with the distinctive minor 9th chord that closes out Monty Norman's original Bond theme. Lyrically, they touch upon the psychological toll of 007's licence to kill, with the observation: ""The blood you bleed is just the blood you owe"". But the song is very much about a romantic betrayal. ""Was I stupid to love you? / Was I reckless to help?"" asks Eilish in the bridge. The musician is known for her intimate, designed-for-headphone vocal style, but she rises to the challenge of the song's soaring climax, with her early vulnerability transforming into strength and resolve. It's easily the most audacious and atmospheric take on the Bond theme in recent memory. No Time To Die marks Daniel Craig's swansong as James Bond Eilish will give her first live performance of the song at next week's Brit Awards, accompanied by composer Hans Zimmer and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. The singer is up for best international female at the ceremony; just two weeks after sweeping all four of the main categories at the Grammys. This video can not be played Billie Eilish says ""anything is possible"" after making history at the Grammys No Time To Die could also earn her another trophy: The last two Bond themes, Adele's Skyfall and Sam Smith's Writing's On The Wall, both won an Oscar. No Time To Die, the film, is due to hit cinemas in April. Alongside Craig and Seydoux, it stars Lashana Lynch, as a 00 agent who entered the service after Bond's retirement; and Rami Malek as the villain Safin. It has been written by the regular Bond team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, with additional material from director Cary Joji Fukunaga and Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The Independent,externallabelled the Grammy winner's Bond theme as ""one of the best we've had in some time"". ""The flourish of violins, electronic guitar and faint brass all pay tribute to classic Bond theme tropes, but Eilish's subtle synth motif makes this song her own,"" wrote Roisin O'Connor. The Guardian,externaldescribed the track ""a Bond theme befitting of the Craig era"". ""The pop sensation sidelines her trademarks for a tasteful track that matches the haunted solitude of its leading man,"" said Alexis Petridis. Eilish's ""downbeat noir is spine-tingling"", according toThe Telegraph,external's Neil McCormick. Finally, BBC entertainment correspondentColin Paterson tweeted,externalhe thought the track was the ""first serious Oscar contender for next year"". Fans of Sir Elton John, who won the best song Oscar last weekend, should look away now, though... because Paterson added the track was ""better than any song nominated this year"". The song's release was marked with a one-hour special on BBC Radio 1. You canhear the full show on BBC Sounds. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Midrar Ali was starved of oxygen due to complications at birth Doctors can stop providing medical treatment for a brain dead baby, the Court of Appeal has ruled. The three appeal judges analysed evidence on four-month-old Midrar Ali after the High Court concluded that treatment could be withdrawn. Midrar's father had argued his son had been showing ""signs of life"" and said the ruling was ""terrible"". But doctors at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester said the baby should be allowed a ""kind and dignified death"". Mrs Justice Lieven, who analysed evidence at a trial in the Family Division of the High Court in Manchester last month, had concluded that Midrar was brain-stem dead. Midrar's parents, Karwan Ali, 35, and Shokhan Namiq, 28, who live in Manchester, had asked appeal judges to overturn the ruling. They said he was still growing and that doctors could not be sure that he will not improve, which meant more tests should be carried out. Karwan Ali and Shokhan Namiq had asked appeal judges to overturn the High Court ruling But appeal judges Sir Andrew McFarlane, Lord Justice Patten and Lady Justice King dismissed their challenge. They concluded that Midrar's parents did not have an arguable case and declared that their son died at 20:01 GMT on 1 October, when he would have been 14 days old. Sir Andrew said evidence showed that ""awfully"" Midrar no longer has a ""brain that is recognisable as such"". ""There is no basis for contemplating that any further tests would result in a different outcome,"" he said. Midrar was starved of oxygen when the umbilical cord came out ahead of his birth on 18 September, causing complications. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which runs St Mary's Hospital, has previously said that Midrar has always been on a ventilator and has never breathed independently. Midrar Ali's parents Karwan Ali and Shokhan Namiq wanted his treatment to continue It said his organs were deteriorating and continuing to treat Midrar was ""undignified"". Lawyers representing the hospital's trust said three tests had confirmed brain stem death. Speaking after the latest legal ruling, Mr Ali said: ""I'm just reading what the appeal judges have said, then we'll discuss it with our lawyers. ""He's still growing. They can't be 100% sure he is dead. He's still growing. His eyes move. I've seen them move."" Brain injury baby treatment 'can be withdrawn' Dad of brain injury baby 'pressured' by medics Baby boy in life support legal row 'is brain dead' The family's solicitor, David Foster, said Midrar's parents were considering an appeal and would like the court to ""give weight to experts from outside the UK"". The next step would be to take the case to the Supreme Court. ""They believe the law in this area should be reviewed and do not consider Midrar's condition is necessarily irreversible,"" Mr Foster. A spokesperson for the hospital trust said it ""acknowledges the judgement made today and recognises that these are incredibly sad circumstances"". ""Our thoughts remain with baby Midrar's family at this very difficult time,"" they added.

"This video can not be played Will Jackson Carlaw be Boris Johnson's chief Scottish cheerleader? Jackson Carlaw has been confirmed as the new leader of the Scottish Conservatives after winning a vote of party members. Mr Carlaw had been the party's interim leader since Ruth Davidson quit the role in August. He has now won the job full time after defeating fellow MSP Michelle Ballantyne by 4,917 votes to 1,581. Mr Carlaw had been the clear favourite in the contest, and was backed by most of the party's MPs and MSPs. He said he was now ""ready to hit the ground running and win"" in next year's Scottish Parliament election by attracting voters from ""middle Scotland"". The new leader has already promised a full review of the party's policies and a ""new, reinvigorated"" frontbench team at Holyrood. Within hours of his election Mr Carlaw announced that Glasgow MSP Annie Wells would become a joint deputy leader of the party alongside North East MSP Liam Kerr. Rachael Hamilton, the Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire MSP, will become a party chairwoman with existing chairman Rab Forman. More changes will be announced next week. Ruth Davidson quits as Scottish Tory leader Mr Carlaw said: ""This is not about asking the people of Scotland to re-elect us as a strong opposition, this is about offering the people of Scotland a clear alternative to the SNP and then fighting all the way to polling day next year to provide them with an alternative government. ""I have a bigger share of the vote than Boris Johnson achieved in his leadership election, I have a bigger share of the vote than Ruth Davidson achieved, a bigger share of the vote than David Cameron achieved in any of the previous Conservative Party leadership elections. ""So I have a clear mandate from the party in Scotland now to make the changes required to lead us into the election next year."" Opinion polls suggest that the SNP, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,remains on course to win a fourth successive term in government,externalin next year's election - with the Conservatives currently a distant second. The new party leader was congratulated by his defeated opponent when the result was announced The leadership contest - which was delayed by December's general election - had been bad-tempered at times, with the two candidates trading insults ahead of the result being announced. Ms Ballantyne, who claimed to have strong grassroots support, accused Mr Carlaw of running a general election campaign that""lacked vision and ambition"",external, with the party losing seven of its 13 MPs. Mr Carlaw hit back by claiming his opponent was the only member of the Tory frontbench team at Holyroodnever to have submitted a ""single policy proposal"",external. Allow Twitter content?

The Scottish Conservatives are currently the second biggest party at Holyrood, with Ms Davidson widely credited with turning around its electoral fortunes in her eight years as leader. But she quit shortly after returning from maternity leave, saying that ""much had changed"" both politically and personally in recent months. As well as the birth of her son, Ms Davidson had been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Boris Johnson - particularly over his approach to Brexit. The new leader is a close political ally of his predecessor, Ruth Davidson Jackson Carlaw worked as a car salesman in the west of Scotland for 25 years before being elected as an MSP, but has been involved in politics since joining the Conservatives as teenager in the late 1970s. He first stood as a candidate in the 1982 Queen's Park by-election, and after several other unsuccessful attempts was eventually elected as a list MSP for the West of Scotland region in the 2007 and again in 2011 - when he also became Ms Davidson's deputy leader. Mr Carlaw, who is married with two children, was elected as the MSP for Eastwood in 2016, and served as acting leader when Ms Davidson went on maternity leave ahead of the birth of her son in May of last year.

When Ms Davidsonresigned as party leader in August, Mr Carlaw was immediately appointed as interim leader - with some of his supporters hoping he would be given the role on a permanent basis without a leadership contest being required. The 60-year-old says he wants the party to appeal to ""middle Scotland"" ahead of next year's Scottish Parliament election, when he says his goal is to ""take down"" Ms Sturgeon and the SNP. Among his key policy proposals are increasing the number of teachers in Scotland by 2,000, bringing income taxes into line with the rest of the UK, and scrapping the Scottish government's plan to introduce a so-calledparking tax. Mr Carlaw has faced Nicola Sturgeon during the weekly First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament while acting as interim leader He told his official campaign launch last month that he stands for ""a decent, generous-spirited, aspirational conservatism that promotes the values and ambitions of middle Scotland"". Mr Carlaw secured public support from the majority of Conservative MSPs and MPs during the leadership contest, as well as all of the party's local council leaders. He points to the experience he has built up in his lengthy stint as acting leader - which saw him go head-to-head with Ms Sturgeon during first minister's questions every week. But critics say that Mr Carlaw's tenure included last month's general election, when the Scottish Conservatives lost seven of the 13 seats they had won under Ms Davidson in 2017 despite the Tories winning a majority across the UK as a whole.

"Some UK dentists may have to ""down drills"" if the shortage of face masks caused by the coronavirus outbreak continues, according to the British Dental Association. All practices are now restricted to ordering 100 masks a day, leaving larger ones with several dentists running out of supplies. Even small surgeries are using up their allocation completely, the BDA says. Ministers said central stockpiles of face masks were available. The dentists' trade union says it has been inundated with calls from members about the shortage of masks. Current guidance means dentists across the UK must wear disposable face masks when treating patients. But China is the world's major manufacturer and prices have tripled since January,when the new coronavirus started circulatingin the country. And the BDA says supply problems and panic-buying have taken their toll. Police, as well as civilians, have been wearing face masks across China because of the coronavirus outbreak Its chairman, Mick Armstrong, said dentists had been hit by ""clumsy rationing and naked profiteering"" in recent weeks. ""Sadly a 'one size fits all' approach from suppliers is leaving many larger practices with few options,"" he said. ""Our abiding interest is the safety of our patients, who face imminent disruption to their care. ""Unless we see a rapid increase in supply, dentists without face masks will have little choice but to down drills."" A typical NHS surgery with one dentist can get through 250 masks a week - but larger surgeries with more dentists would run out completely under the current restrictions. The BDA said it had been contacted by concerned dental practices, some of whom had up to 13 dentists. It said dentists would be running out of masks as early as next week. The shortage is not just affecting the UK - the BDA says dentists in Australia have also expressed their concern over a lack of face masks. A spokesman from the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We have central stockpiles of a range of medical products, including face masks, to mitigate supply problems and help ensure the uninterrupted supply to the NHS. He added: ""We have well-established procedures to deal with supply problems, regardless of the cause, and work closely with industry, the NHS and others in the supply chain to help prevent shortages and to ensure that the risks to patients are minimised.""

"This video can not be played Alison Rose: ""My focus is on making sure we're a safe, smart bank for the future"" Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Group has said it plans to change its name later this year, as it reported a near doubling of annual profits. The Edinburgh-based bank, which owns RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank, said it would rename itself as NatWest Group. The bank reported profits of Â£3.1bn,externalfor 2019, nearly double the Â£1.6bn seen the year before. New RBS chief executive Alison Rose called the results the ""start of a new era"" for the bank. It is thought that Ms Rose is hoping a rebrand will help shift the lender's image away from its association with the financial crisis. The bank was rescued by the government in 2008 in the aftermath of the financial crisis at a cost of Â£45bn and it is still 62% state-owned. What will bank branches look like in the future? Ms Rose told the BBC's Today programme that the name change would not alter any services for RBS or NatWest customers. About 80% of the bank's customers are thought to use NatWest. Names of individual NatWest and RBS branches will remain the same. She also said that the name change would not result in any job cuts across the group. This is Ms Rose's first set of results for the lender. She became the first woman to lead one of the so-called big four largest UK banks when she was appointed last year. Today's announcement was not just the first set of full-year results unveiled by new chief executive Alison Rose but also the long-awaited unveiling of her strategy. But many crucial questions remain unanswered, with Ms Rose failing to address recent press reports that claimed job cuts may be in store. RBS was the subject of a Â£45bn state bailout during the financial crisis, and remains 62% taxpayer-owned. A 25-year veteran of the bank, Alison Rose is one of the few senior executives left from the pre-crisis era, when former boss Fred Goodwin's overambitious expansion plans left the bank in a perilous state. More than a decade on, it falls to her to complete the clean-up operation. She says the name change for the parent company marks a new era, but the real challenge is to prove she can get the bank back into a state where the remaining stake can be sold without incurring a hefty loss for taxpayers. RBS also announced it was committed to ""at least halve the climate impact"" of its financing activity by 2030. It says it will stop lending to coal companies by the end of the decade. The bank also confirmed it would make its own operations ""net carbon zero"" by the end of this year. That follows on from a pledge by Lloyds Banking Group to halve the amount of carbon emissions it finances through personal and business loans by 2030. Chief executive Alison Rose was appointed in 2019 Ms Rose has been at RBS for more than 25 years, mainly in a number of roles in its investment bank. She was previously deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, and before Ms Rose was appointed chief executive of the RBS group she was head of commercial and private banking. She worked her way up after joining the bank as a graduate trainee in 1992. Unlike her predecessor Ross McEwan, she is based solely in London, although the bank has its headquarters in Edinburgh. Ms Rose is also paid more than her predecessor, with her annual salary set at Â£1.1m compared with Mr McEwan's Â£1m. RBS's share price fell by more than 6% in Friday trading after its results came out. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said markets needed ""some convincing"", despite the jump in profits. But he said ""it's clear RBS is putting legacy conduct issues behind it and has got the payment protection insurance (PPI) monkey off its back"". The bank took a Â£900m charge for mis-sold PPI in 2019, which was at the top end of its expectations.

She says the name change for the parent company marks a new era, but the real challenge is to prove she can get the bank back into a state where the remaining stake can be sold without incurring a hefty loss for taxpayers. RBS also announced it was committed to ""at least halve the climate impact"" of its financing activity by 2030. It says it will stop lending to coal companies by the end of the decade. The bank also confirmed it would make its own operations ""net carbon zero"" by the end of this year. That follows on from a pledge by Lloyds Banking Group to halve the amount of carbon emissions it finances through personal and business loans by 2030. Chief executive Alison Rose was appointed in 2019 Ms Rose has been at RBS for more than 25 years, mainly in a number of roles in its investment bank. She was previously deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, and before Ms Rose was appointed chief executive of the RBS group she was head of commercial and private banking. She worked her way up after joining the bank as a graduate trainee in 1992. Unlike her predecessor Ross McEwan, she is based solely in London, although the bank has its headquarters in Edinburgh. Ms Rose is also paid more than her predecessor, with her annual salary set at Â£1.1m compared with Mr McEwan's Â£1m. RBS's share price fell by more than 6% in Friday trading after its results came out. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said markets needed ""some convincing"", despite the jump in profits. But he said ""it's clear RBS is putting legacy conduct issues behind it and has got the payment protection insurance (PPI) monkey off its back"". The bank took a Â£900m charge for mis-sold PPI in 2019, which was at the top end of its expectations. Mr Wilson added: ""Now that the PPI deadline has passed, the bank has much greater visibility of future cash generation."" What will bank branches look like in the future?

"Student Olly Finch had mumps despite being vaccinated Health officials are urging people to have both parts of the MMR vaccine after cases of mumps in England reached their highest level in a decade. Outbreaks in universities and colleges raised the number of cases of the painful viral illness to 5,042 in 2019 - four times the number in 2018. Most were in young adults who missed out on the MMR jab. Public Health England said the full two doses of the vaccination were needed to maximise protection. Mumps: Why adults might still need the MMR jab The vaccine prevents most cases of mumps - but not all, and so some young people are still getting the illness. There were also increases in mumps cases inWalesandScotland,externalin 2019. It is a viral infection that used to be very common in children before the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1988. A classic sign is puffy cheeks under the ears. Mumps is contagious and spread through infected droplets of saliva breathed in through the mouth or nose. painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face headache fever joint pain feeling tired loss of appetite Most people usually recover without treatment. But in rare cases, there can be serious complications, such as inflammation of the testicles in males, meningitis and deafness. Source:NHS UK,external Flora Cox, a Leeds student, had mumps ""I went to bed normal, everything fine, and then I woke up, and bang - my face was so puffed out, so swollen,"" says Olly Finch, a student at Leeds University. ""I got prescribed morphine - it was that bad."" Flora Cox, another Leeds student, said: ""It started out with just neck pain in my ear and jaw, and then it started swelling - it was so painful. ""Your jaw pretty much locks."" David Buckley, 32, ended up with a swollen testicle ""the size of an avocado"" when he had mumps. That followed 10 days at home in bed with symptoms and a trip to hospital with a locked jaw. ""It was so painful, really horrible. I tried to ice it... but it's just something you have to ride out,"" he told Radio 1 Newsbeat. David wasn't sure if he'd had the second dose of the MMR vaccine, so he got the jab again - just in case. Mumps - is it the forgotten disease? Why are university students catching mumps? The best and safest way is to gettwo doses of the MMR vaccine,external- the middle 'M' stands for mumps. It's never too late to catch up, says Dr Vanessa Saliba, from Public Health England. ""We encourage all students and young people who may have missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past to contact their GP practice and get up to date as soon as possible,"" she said. Adults and children who missed out on the vaccine as babies can also have it on the NHS at any age - it is given in two doses, with the second at least a month after the first. The part of the triple vaccine that specifically protects against mumps isn't quite as effective as the elements protecting against measles and rubella. However, getting the jab is still crucial - because the more people who are protected, the less likely mumps is to be shared around. During outbreaks among students, which are common, completely unvaccinated people are at highest risk. Even if you get the illness after being vaccinated, you are likely to have a less serious form of it and fewer complications. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella Cases of mumps consistently outnumber measles and rubella cases every year. Teenagers and young adults in colleges and universities are now the ones who tend to be affected - for several reasons. Many of the 2019 cases were born in the late 1990s and early 2000s and missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children. Research by a disgraced UK doctor falsely linking the vaccine to autismundoubtedly had an impact on uptake. Current students may also be too old to have been immunised or offered the MMR, or may only have had one dose of the vaccine and thus not be fully protected. It is also possible the vaccine's protection against mumps may have worn off. Despite the recent rise in cases, mumps hasn't just reappeared. Before the MMR vaccine, eight out of 10 people developed it and most of them were children of school age. At that time, there were five deaths a year from mumps, mainly due to encephalitis or swelling of the brain. The illness then became relatively rare before returning in the 2000s. There was a particularlylarge outbreak (43,000 cases) in 2005,external.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: I had no option but to resign Sajid Javid has shocked Westminster by quitting as chancellor in the middle of Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle. Mr Javid rejected the prime minister's order to fire his team of aides, saying ""no self-respecting minister"" could accept such a condition. He has been replaced as chancellor by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak - who just seven months ago was a junior housing minister. Mr Javid had been due to deliver his first Budget in four weeks' time. The former home secretary was appointed chancellor by Mr Johnson when he became prime minister in July.

""I felt I was left with no option but to resign,"" he said, adding that Mr Sunak and the rest of the government retained his ""full support"". In his resignation letter, Mr Javid explained that he could not accept the PM's conditions saying: ""I believe it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with.""

Losing a chancellor is no small event, and it wasn't what Boris Johnson set out to do. But today shows that No 10's priority was political control rather than keeping personnel they valued. When Mr Javid refused, they chose instead to see him leave. This begs a wider question - is it stronger to share power or hoard it?

Amid reports No 10 was looking at ways of re-writing its fiscal rules to allow for more public expenditure, it said there would continue to be a ""clear framework"" for borrowing levels. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it was ""sensible"" to amalgamate the teams of advisers currently working for the prime minister and the chancellor. ""It is right that there is a co-ordinated economic function in this country,"" he told Breakfast. ""We need to have a strong team working as one.""

"Boris Johnson promised not so long ago that Sajid Javid would be his chancellor, in front of an audience and the TV cameras. In characteristically bombastic style, before he could be completely sure he would be back as PM, he said: ""I'm going to give you an absolutely categorical assurance I will keep Sajid Javid as my chancellor. I think he's a great guy, and I think he is doing a fantastic job."" So what on earth has just then happened? As one cabinet minister suggested, it seems Sajid Javid's departure is ""a little bit of accident and a little bit of design"". Two weeks ago, if the now former chancellor had been fired it might not have seemed that surprising. There were well-known tensions between the two teams, not necessarily between the two men themselves. Sajid Javid quits as chancellor Cabinet reshuffle: Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Shock resignation means test for new chancellor And there was plenty of briefing around that the relationship was strained between Mr Javid and the prime minister's top adviser, Dominic Cummings. There were not profound policy clashes perhaps, but there was certainly some of the traditional friction - No 10 that wants to be able to spend, No 11 that wants to hold the cheque book tightly. But in recent days, there had been plenty of warm noises that Mr Javid was safe in government. Even though No 10 has bold ideas for reform, they had concluded it seemed there wasn't much point ripping up the relationship at the top. What however they were determined to change was the atmosphere and the balance between the wider institutions - the political machine of Downing Street and the wider Treasury team. This video can not be played Sajid Javid: I had no option but to resign For a deeply motivated group inside No 10, that meant forcing changes on the chancellor as noted by the well plugged-in Conservative blogger Paul Goodman earlier this month. The possibility of that had not gone unnoticed by the Treasury team, and I understand that Mr Javid had discussed with friends what to do in that circumstance. If he were presented with a fait accompli, he had considered that he might have to quit. Walking in front of the cameras at Downing Street this morning therefore, he was aware of what might have been about to happen. I'm told the meeting between the two powerful men started cordially, with Mr Johnson praising Mr Javid's time in the job, before hitting him with the demand that he'd love him to stay, but without his team. Whispers suggest the chancellor (still in the job at that point) asked the prime minister for what precisely his advisers had actually done wrong, but he was short on evidence. After the pair went ""round in circles"", they took a break, at which point in a series of ""side meetings"" senior figures like the chief whip and Eddie Lister, another senior No 10 adviser, tried to persuade Mr Javid to stay. He did not back down though, and then it's said in another one-on-one meeting with the PM, he tendered his resignation. Mr Javid was appointed chancellor by the prime minister last July In the coming days, the blow-by-blow accounts of what exactly happened will be the subject of spin in plenty of different directions. Sajid Javid may decide to give a fuller account. But right now, his departure seems not therefore to have been a dastardly, and deliberate plan to force him out. No 10 hoped he would go for it, but must have gamed the possibility that he might not accept, just as Mr Javid had gamed the possibility that he might be asked to choose between his job and his team. Losing a chancellor is no small event, and it wasn't what Boris Johnson set out to do. But today shows that No 10's priority was political control rather than keeping personnel they valued. When Mr Javid refused, they chose instead to see him leave. This begs a wider question - is it stronger to share power or hoard it? Boris Johnson and his team have made the choice today to do the latter - to lose a chancellor rather than allow a rival faction offering different political advice to the next door neighbour. Of course, any prime minister is entitled to do this. And there is nothing written in scripture that says the occupant of No 11 must be forever considered a near equal competitor to the PM next door. Stalwarts of the department believe it is a vital check on prime ministers who would otherwise simply splash the cash. But one former minister, no fan of the current administration, suggested there is a very good case to be made for cutting back the political power of the Treasury, rethinking its role as a rival centre of power to No 10. And Javid is, by nature, unlikely to become a deliberate pain on the backbenches. Maybe then, as a minister told me tonight, the ultimate effect of this confusing cock-up will be ""benign"". But the manner of Sajid Javid's exit may really counts - a symbol of a government that wants, if you are diplomatic, a smooth and complete focus on its agenda at the very top. Put that less kindly, a group that wants to grab control of everything it sees. For now, it may make it easier for Boris Johnson to push through his desires. But centralising power in one building centralises risk too. If and when things go well, credit may flow in one direction. If and when things go wrong, there may be only one target for the blame.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus in the UK: Five things you need to know about Covid-19 Many more people may be forced to self-isolate as part of efforts to stop the coronavirus spreading in Britain, the head of NHS England has warned. Sir Simon Stevens said more than 80 people discharged from quarantine on Thursday set an ""important example"". Meanwhile, officials are tracing the contacts of the ninth person in the UK to test positive for the virus. The woman went to hospital in an Uber, but Public Health England (PHE) said the driver is not at ""high risk"". The new case - announced on Wednesday evening - is the first to be identified in London after she contracted the virus in China. She ""self-presented"" at the A&E department of University Hospital Lewisham on Sunday 9 February, hospital chief executive Ben Travis said. PHE said the Uber driver is ""not considered high risk"" because the journey was less than 15 minutes and there was not ""close sustained contact"". Uber said it had temporarily suspended the driver's account ""out of an abundance of caution"". Asked if it would be compensating the driver for lost income, the company said: ""We will be providing support to this driver."" GMB legal director Susan Harris said: ""If Uber is genuinely concerned for his well-being - or for that of the public -  they must make sure he receives payment during this enforced period of unemployment."" Britain's race to contain the coronavirus Coronavirus: How worried should we be? 'If someone coughs, it makes me nervous' Mr Travis said the patient was immediately given a mask and escorted to be tested in a dedicated area outside the A&E building. After that, she was assessed further in an isolation room in the emergency department. She was later discharged and taken home by ambulance. All staff who had contact with the patient have been contacted, and two are undergoing ""active surveillance"" at home for 14 days on the advice of PHE, Mr Travis said. On Wednesday, the test came back positive and she was taken for treatment at a specialist unit at St Thomas' Hospital that evening. Meanwhile, a nurse who went into self-isolation after showing symptoms after sustained contact with someone who was being tested for the virus, has criticised the lack of advice she was given by PHE. The unnamed nursetold Brighton newspaper the Argus,externalshe was sent home in a taxi in which she wore a medical mask but the driver did not. She said she called NHS 111 but had to wait 15 hours to get advice from PHE on how to get tested - and felt she was given little guidance on how to stop the spread of the virus. In other developments: Tests for the virus have been carried out on 2,521 people in the UK as of 14:00 GMT on Thursday - an increase of 763 from Wednesday - with all but nine being negative Dental surgeries in the UK are facing a shortage of face masks due to supply problems in China following the outbreak,the British Dental Association has warned,external Heavy machinery manufacturerJCB cut the hours of 4,000 company and agency shop floor staff because of a shortage of components from China The Church of England has recommended thatparishioners with coughs and sneezes are encouraged to receive only the bread and not to share the wine at Holy Communion,external.

They are one of two groups of British nationals evacuated from Wuhan, with the second quarantined near Milton Keynes. Repatriated UK citizen Matt Raw punched the air in celebration as he left quarantine Sir Simon said: ""They have set an important example, recognising that over the coming weeks many more of us may need to self-isolate at home for a period to reduce this virus's spread,"" he said. Matt Raw, one of those quarantined on the Wirral, said as he left the accommodation block: ""It is absolutely lovely to be out and I'll no doubt be going out for a pint a little bit later."" The ninth UK case illustrates the challenge the authorities face in trying to contain the coronavirus. The guidance is clear about what to do if you suspect you might be infected. Phone NHS 111 and self-isolate yourself. Jumping into an Uber and heading into a busy A&E unit - where there will be lots of people with potentially weakened immune systems - is the last thing someone should be doing. We don't know why the ninth case did this. They could have been unaware of the advice. They may have been scared. Or they may have had trouble getting through to 111 or have been unhappy with the response. I have heard from people who have self-isolated themselves after becoming ill after returning from one of the at-risk countries, but then complained they were frustrated about the slow response from the NHS. Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was hoped China ""gets on top of the epidemic"". He said: ""We basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain; the second of these is to delay; the third of these is to do the science and the research; and the fourth is to mitigate so we can brace the NHS.""

Another cluster of cases began with British businessman Steve Walsh - now recovered - who contracted the virus in Singapore and passed it to 11 people at a ski resort in France. Five of these returned to the UK. The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service.
