"Who will take the seats at the cabinet table after the reshuffle? Prime ministers do not, as Theresa May well knows, have as much power to shape their fortunes as the trappings of the grand office suggests. However, one of the things they can control is the timing of reshuffles, and at least the initial set of decisions. They are the moment when the boss does the hiring and firing of their team - to punish or reward and to position supporters or enemies into the most politically convenient spots. Whether reshuffles are forced upon leaders by political accidents, such as scandals or resignations, or a desire to refresh the look and direction of the government - it is both in this case - as with many other big set piece moments in politics, they are times of huge potential reward, but huge risk too. Because of that, there are a few conventions, if not rules, to bear in mind: Prime ministers need to avoid creating a bigger problem than the one they sought to solve by getting rid of an awkward colleague. Disgruntled at being sacked, annoyed at being ignored, some fired ministers will go on to become bigger irritants on the backbenches - where they can arguably cause more trouble than they did around the cabinet table. There, at least publicly, their loyalty was more or less guaranteed. Ministers sometimes refuse to budge when they are told they are being moved, and conversely, others being offered jobs inside government sometimes turn them down. The responses of individuals can disrupt the best laid plans. There is not necessarily a direct relationship between successful reshuffles and prime ministerial authority. Strong leaders have botched them sometimes. But clever reshuffles can embolden weak prime ministers. Unless a reshuffle is epic - don't expect that this time - the public probably doesn't notice very much, as, quite rightly, the majority of people have got more to worry about than who the new parliamentary under secretary for paper clips is. But they do matter to political parties very much. Reshuffles can erase old grudges and create new ones in the space of a few short hours. And, of course, they matter hugely to government departments and people whose lives are affected by the decisions in one sector or another. Reshuffle days in Westminster are like bingo for political observers, but the decisions made have much bigger ramifications after that frenzied 24 hours. Even limited ministerial moves mean that different decisions and different priorities can be set in Whitehall that have real consequences for the country. Who is in charge of the government's existing plans does make a difference. Despite that, new faces alone don't mean a new direction. Changing the personnel doesn't necessarily reset the government. This time, with the posteriors on the biggest seats in government expected to stay the same, don't expect Theresa May to change tack substantially.

"Jeremy Hunt is staying as health secretary The reshuffle isn't over, but we already know that it was not just the prime minister who had her say today, but her ministers too. Jeremy Hunt, who has stayed as health secretary, and Greg Clark, who has stayed as business secretary, were both in No 10 for more than an hour this afternoon. I understand that rather than meekly accepting whatever was being dangled before him (at least one of the likely jobs was a move to become business secretary, possibly a job swap with Greg Clark) the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in fact argued his case for staying at the Department for Health and expanding his role to take on planning for the future of social care in England. The risk and reward of reshuffles Lewis made Tory chairman in reshuffle It is said the situation was ""fluid"", and the PM was ""persuaded"" by his arguments, agreeing to keep him in position at the end of their conversation. Senior government sources dispute that Greg Clark also refused to move - Hunt getting his way and staying at health had clear knock on effects which meant Clark's conversation was merely about staying in his role. There's still a mystery over the potential appointment of Chris Grayling as chairman at Tory HQ. Number 10 disputes it was ever the plan, but two other sources say they had been told it was the case, and that in the end No 10 had to ""fiddle with the whiteboard"", appointing well liked Brandon Lewis in his place. But Theresa May's detractors will claim this as evidence that she didn't have the authority to move her own ministers. One senior MP said ""this reshuffle is embarrassingâ¦ far from asserting her authority, or some new found strength it's just highlighted how weak the PM is"". No 10 is promising more moves before the end of the evening and more diverse new appointments through the day tomorrow. But while this isn't the most dramatic of reshuffles, it seems to have followed the tradition of not going quite according to plan.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Exclusive first look at Byton's concept car A new car designed by former BMW and Apple employees has been unveiled. The Byton - which sports a huge touchscreen dashboard - reimagines what it feels like to be inside a car. While on paper the electric vehicle doesn't quite match Tesla on performance or price, the firm behind it told the BBC it hoped people in future would care more about ""digital power"" than horsepower. But experts say it currently lacks the charging infrastructure it requires. The name Byton refers to the phrase Bytes on Wheels. ""We want to be the company bringing into the market the first real smart car,"" said Carsten Breitfeld, its chief executive. The car features a huge dashboard screen Ahead of the concept vehicle's official launch at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas, Byton gave the BBC an exclusive look at the technology. It was being kept in an unmarked warehouse just off the city's famous strip, hidden from spying eyes behind a black curtain. More from CES 2018:,external Bodybuilding in the virtual reality gym App uses saliva to recommend what to eat Preview of CES's coolest new tech The house that hears burglars The company refers to the car's interior as being a ""digital lounge"" The company is bankrolled with money from China, and believes it has the development know-how to overcome the hurdles that see most new car companies fail. To solve perhaps its biggest problem, Byton will need to strike a deal with Tesla's Elon Musk. ""What we want to try to do is merge your life outside of the car with your experience inside the car,"" explained Jeff Chung, head of Byton's Intelligent Car Experience division. In front of us is a huge display that stretches out across almost the entire dashboard. During the day it is bright white, but at night it inverts to be less distracting. The dashboard can be controlled with hand gestures or touch The screen is part of what Mr Chung, formerly of Apple's Mac team, calls the ""digital lounge"". It can be controlled using touch, voice and Minority Report-esque gestures. A tablet computer is situated in the middle of the steering wheel, while an extra screen can be found on the back of each front seat. The main display can show any number of things - video clips, calendars, mapping, health data and so on. As you sit in the car, internal cameras will determine who you are and load your profile, adjusting the driving seat position and other customisations. When in full self-driving mode, or stationary, the front seats can turn towards each other for an apparently more comfortable and sociable position - opening up the middle of the car so that those in the back can see the large display. It's the most sophisticated interface I've seen in a car. But I put it to Mr Chung that taking your hand off the wheel to wiggle your fingers about in mid-air might be extremely distracting while driving. ""I actually agree,"" he said. ""[But] all features of the car will be accessible via touch. And so you'll have the ability on the driver's tablet to make all the selections that you do with gestures. There are touchsreens in the steering wheel and back of the front seats ""After you buy the car, we might actually pare down the gestures as people aren't very accustomed to it. ""We would never want to force any driver to do gestures to control specific features. Having the ability to customise is the key."" Fearful of the car being spotted and posted on social media, my test ride was limited to a small area of the warehouse. It means I can't speak first-hand to the car's performance - but according to Byton's own figures, it will do 0-60mph (0-97km/h) in about five seconds. That makes the $45,000 (Â£33,187) Byton slower than Tesla's $35,000 Model 3. Indeed, on most performance benchmarks, Byton's car is less impressive. But Mr Breitfeld thinks to dwell on that would be missing the point. Just like our smartphones, he suggested the majority of consumers would base their purchase on which option has the best software rather than speed specs. The car is kitted out with the sensors it needs to deliver ""level 4"" autonomy - the level at which a driver can safely - in theory - go to sleep at the wheel. The car is scheduled to go into production in 2019 That won't come for a few years, so at first the car will only offer ""level 3"", meaning it can drive itself, but drivers must stay alert and ready to retake control at all times. Last year, Faraday Future unveiledits production car, the FF91, with huge fanfare and a pledge to get started on building it as soon as possible. Since then, it has cancelled plans to build a huge factory in Nevada, and its chief backer - LeEco's Jia Yueting -has been embroiled in money problemsthat have seen his assets seized in China. Faraday Future followed a pattern of brazen new car companies finding it incredibly difficult to make their concept cars a reality. This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC was given a test ride of Faraday Future's FF91 last year Even Tesla has struggled to manufacture its Model 3 car quickly enough to meet demand, frustrating investors who feel it is a make-or-break product. Mr Breitfeld told the BBC he felt Byton was protected from such pitfalls. ""I spent 20 years at BMW, responsible for the i8 programme,"" he said. ""I built this company right from the first day in a way that we have the people on board who know how to industrialise a car, which is a huge job. ""We've started the construction of our plant in Nanjing, China. We are well underway."" Unlike Faraday Future, the company is not relying on one major investor with ""too much control"". Among its investors is Chinese internet giant, Tencent. But one obvious challenge that might stump Byton is a lack of fast-charging stations. While Tesla offers its customers some 8,496 superchargers around the world, Byton has zero. Mr Breitfeld said he expects Tesla would be happy - or be forced - to share its stations. Byton hopes to share access to Tesla's superchargers ""We have to come together and share this infrastructure across the companies,"" he said. ""This is not a differentiating factor. This is something which makes the whole industry successful."" Tesla did not respond to the BBC's request for comment - and Mr Breitfeld would not say whether discussions had taken place between the companies. ""It seems highly unlikely that Tesla will want to share the infrastructure they've worked so hard to build with a rival - unless there's some kind of altruistic view that it's for the greater good,"" commented Ben Wood, an analyst at the consultancy CCS Insight. ""It underlines the challenges of electric vehicles. Building the cars is relatively simple these days, but you need everything that goes around it. Charging infrastructure, more than anything, is the challenge."" That said, Tesla has appeared to be open to sharing its chargers in the past. In 2014, Mr Musk told British gadget site Pocket-lint that it would accommodate competitors, but they had to pay a reasonable share of the costs. Byton intends to launch its car in China ahead of it going on sale in the US and Europe ""The intent of the supercharger network is not to create a walled garden,"" Mr Musk said. ""Any other manufacturer that's interested in using them, we'd be happy to accommodate. They'd need to contribute to the capital costs proportional to their fleet's usage of the network."" For Mr Breitfeld, it's an inevitability. Just as motorists don't have different petrol stations for different car brands - so electric charging stations must work in a similar manner, he said.

"This video can not be played WATCH: LG's marketing chief said Cloi ""doesn't like me"" after it ignored his commands A robot created by LG to help users control their smart home repeatedly failed on stage at its CES debut. Cloi was meant to be the centrepiece of the South Korean firm's presentation where it was supposed to show how new artificial intelligence tech could enhance use of kitchen appliances. Instead it gave no response to three consecutive commands beyond blinking. Experts say the demo represented a ""disastrous"" debut for the bot, which was mocked on social media. The event was the first press conference of the morning at the Las Vegas tech fair. Samsung, Intel, HTC and Sony are among other big companies scheduled to unveil products over the course of the day. LG's focus this year was to promote ThinQ, its in-house AI software, which it intends to roll out across various products to make them easier to use and capable of ""evolving"" to meet customers' needs. Although LG also includes Google's Assistant in some of its latest TVs and smart speakers, it has chosen to rely on its own solution for its robots. The firm already has robots in use in South Korean shopping centres and airports, and also makes robotic vacuums for the home. But Cloi -  which is pronounced Kloh-ee - represents a push to put the technology at the heart of consumers' homes. LG said that Cloi had been deliberately designed to appear cute The machine was described as being the ""ultimate in simplicity when managing your smart home,"" when it was presented on stage by David VanderWaal, LG's US marketing chief. And it initially behaved as planned when he asked it for his schedule. But subsequent requests to find out if his washing was ready, what was planned for dinner and what recipes it could suggest for chicken all fell flat. ""The first time it failed everyone laughed and thought it was just a glitch,"" commented Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, who was in the audience. ""The second time, there was a realisation that something was wrong. ""And when it failed again, there was a stunned silence in the audience and then a bit of hubbub as people felt sorry for this guy."" More from CES 2018:,external Smart bottle thirsts for drinking data LG Display shows off rollable TV screen Bodybuilding in the VR gym Android camera makes 3D spinnable selfies Although it is far from the first time a CES demo has gone awry, Mr Wood said it highlighted a problem with many of the AI-based technologies being pitched to the public. ""It will be damaging to LG and highlights a broader point about all the companies exhibiting here: is their technology really ready for prime time?"" Mr VanderWaal later unveiled a further three robots, highlighting LG's ambitions in the sector. LG describes its three new commercial robots as being ""concepts"" at this stage They included,external: Porter Robot, which is designed to carry hotel guests luggage to their room and provide check-in and check-out services without the need to queue at a front desk Shopping Cart Robot, which features a bar code scanner so that supermarket visitors can log each item they put inside before paying via the machine as well Serving Robot, which is designed to deliver meals and drinks in restaurants and airport lounges However, by this point many viewers of the firm's YouTube livestream were more preoccupied by making jokes about Cloi's earlier appearance. One suggested that she was a feminist who did not enjoy being bossed about in the kitchen, while another posted: ""RIP Cloiï»¿ 2018-2018"". Twitter users also joined in the fun.

One industry-watcher said LG was likely to take a short-term hit to its brand as a result of the event, but said that it would also serve as a reminder that the promise of a ""seamless"" smart home was still some way off. ""The target market for these kinds of products is still hi-tech-friendly early adopters who are willing to put in more effort than the regular user,"" said Tuong Nguyen from the consultancy Gartner. ""But even for early adopters, it tends to be a little more work than expected. ""The challenge for manufacturers is that they not only to offer a good user experience but also have to get all the different technologies involved to work together.

"Black Box believes virtual reality will help make gym exercise more ""addictive"" Start-up Black Box VR has developed a full-body workout in the form of a 30-minute virtual reality experience. It uses a bespoke resistance training machine and an HTC Vive headset. The entire set-up is about the size of a family bathroom. It is one of several innovations at the CES tech show in Las Vegas to propose mixing VR and fitness training. But one expert said the firm would need to address safety concerns for the idea to be a success. The Idaho-based firm's solution involves participants entering a virtual arena, where they compete against an avatar and, eventually, one another. The firm's founders, Ryan DeLuca and Preston Lewis, were also behind the successful fitness empire bodybuilding.com. Black Box VR's business plan is to open boutique gyms across the US, in which each member will enter their own ""black box"" space for the gamified work-out, which will track their progress. More from CES 2018:,external Preview of CES's coolest new tech Can your saliva affect the way you shop? Psion's digital assistant gets Android makeover Electric VR suit shocks gamers An at-home version of the equipment could be developed in the future, the firm said. ""Most people stop going [to the gym] after a couple of weeks so adherence is something that's a critical factor of what we're trying to solve,"" general manager Jim Bradbury told the BBC. Black Box VR says its use of a dynamic resistance gym kit creates an immersive experience as users do not need to make manual adjustments One VR-industry watcher said the idea had potential, but had concerns. ""Human beings in general find it hard to retain the habit of exercise and there's been many attempts to try and make it more appealing - so, VR makes sense from the perspective of trying to make the gym less boring,"" said J P Gownder from the consultancy Forrester. ""But the cost of the equipment is going to make it an expensive get-up. ""And will it be safe enough for people to use? ""I'm not aware of the Vive having been stress-tested for this kind of use, and [Black Box VR] is going to need to prove that it has taken account of impact on the body of using the headset during strenuous exercise."" Job Stauffer, a games developer who now works with the VR Health Institute - who is helping Black Box VR with promotional activities at CES - says he has personally benefited from virtual reality. He told the BBC he had lost more than 82lb (37kg) playing such games in addition to improving his diet. ""Late in 2016, I was probably the unhealthiest I'd ever been in my life, well over 300 pounds,"" he said. ""And I started playing games on HTC Vive and Oculus and I started to notice that wow, like I'm sweating I'm getting the best workout I've ever had."" The VR controllers are designed to be ""hands-free"" to let users grip gym equipment Mr Stauffer said he started by playing the indie game Sound Boxing, which he described as ""Guitar Hero for the arms"". He said he then moved onto Space Pirate Trainer, which he compared with using an elliptical machine - or cross-trainer - in terms of calories burned. The VR Health Institute is now developing a Pan European Game Information (Pegi)-style rating system for games to grade them according to their activity level, he added. ""A lot of people in the games business work an incredible amount of hours and often don't get the time that they need to take care of themselves,"" he said. ""At the same time playing games is a sedentary experience but VR changes all of that - that room-scale experiences are engaging your body in full."" Virtual reality and fitness is a small but growing market. At last year's CES a firm called Icaros showed off a cradle that simulated flight while giving users a work out asthey planked their way across a mountain range. At this year's event a Czech start-up, Sense Arena, is promoting the use of VR to train athletes to play ice hockey, basketball and football. It suggests the tech could ultimately lead tofewer injuries during matches,external. Meanwhile at the VR Fit gym in Columbus, Ohio, members can already work out with a virtual reality personal trainer for $60 (Â£44) per session. In my two-minute demonstration, I chest-pressed my way to victory in front of a crowd in a huge virtual arena, punching out bowling balls of fire and, inexplicably, large green birds as I pulled the machine, with more resistance piling on at every repetition. I was rewarded with a virtual sweat band in a prize box and aching biceps for the rest of the afternoon. There was no noticeable latency between my action and the action I saw in VR, and the graphics, while a bit strange, were immersive. It certainly beat watching rolling news programmes in the gym with the sound down. The demo appears to have been designed with male testers in mind - the reps were heavy, and the only available profile to compete against was a macho avatar called Razer wearing green armour. But the firm was at pains to point out to me that ultimately people could compete against each other, and that other computer-based avatars would also be developed. Of course the concept of getting fit while playing a game is as old as sport itself, and Black Box has been developed by people who are already very motivated by fitness. After my brief experience I couldn't say whether it would hold my attention in the long run. But on the other hand, neither has my gym membership.

"The CES tech trade show runs until Friday 12 January The chief of the CES tech trade show has pledged to try to have more female keynote speakers at future events. The Consumer Technology Association's Gary Shapiro said his team would ""redouble our efforts to expand women's voices"". It follows criticism that all the major ""keynote"" presentations were scheduled to be by men this year. The CTA said it had, however, added two female leaders to a panel on the future of video. They are Nancy Dubuc, president of A+E Networks - an entertainment media company - and Kristin Dolan, chief executive of 605 - a TV data analytics provider. The CTA announced Nancy Dubuc (left) and Kristin Dolan as late additions to its speakers However, the only invitees set to give standalone presentations remain men: Jim Hackett - chief executive of Ford Richard Yu - chief executive of Huawai's consumer business group Brian Krzanich - chief executive of Intel This follows an all-male line-up of major speakers in 2017. The CTA had previously said that it had sought female keynote speakers but had struggled to find people who met its criteria.

"Women's right groups have criticised Theresa May's decision to appoint an MP who opposed the decriminalisation of abortion to a role representing women. Maria Caulfield, new Conservative vice chair for women, said decriminalisation would lead to ""abortion on demand"". Abortion provider BPAS said the PM's decision to appoint Ms Caulfield to the role was incredibly disappointing. Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party (WEP) leader, said Ms Caulfield could ""never advocate effectively"" for women. The BBC has contacted Ms Caulfield - the Conservative MP for Lewes and a former nurse - for a response. Abortion should not be a crime, say doctors Online abortion pill sales 'increasing' Currently, women in England and Wales have to prove to two medical professionals that carrying on with the pregnancy is detrimental to their health or wellbeing, before having a termination. Without permission, abortion remains a criminal offence under the 1967 Abortion Act. In March last year, a Ten Minute Rule Bill called for changes to the law, to prevent the prosecution of women who end their own pregnancies without permission. The proposed changes would have meant women who, for example, order abortion pills online and self-administer would not risk prosecution. However,Ms Caulfield spoke out against the bill,externalsaying the idea would leave young women less safe and ""embolden"" men who force women into abortion. She said it would become a ""charter for extreme abortion practices"", including sex-selective abortion. Ms Caulfield, a member of the all-party pro-life parliamentary group, said she feared the proposal would fuel ""unethical and unsafe"" procedures. Allow Twitter content?

In a statement, BPAS (the British Pregnancy Advisory Service) said it was ""shocked"" the Conservative Party had appointed an MP ""who supports the criminalisation of women who end their own pregnancies"". It said Ms Caulfield had been a ""leading opponent"" of the proposed bill, which did not become law and has not been reintroduced since last year's general election. ""That the new Conservative vice chair for women believes that these women should face up to life imprisonment is appalling. Maria Caulfield has stated that she wants to be a 'voice for the unborn child',"" BPAS said. ""It is profoundly disappointing that the Conservative Party did not think that a better choice for vice chair for women would be someone willing and able to speak up for the one in three women who will have an abortion in their lifetime."" In a string of tweets, BPAS added that Ms Caulfield's views were ""out of step with members of the public and her own parliamentary party"". Sophie Walker, of the WEP, and feminist author Judith Orr also objected to the appointment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Members at the British Medical Association's annual conference voted to scrap legislation that an abortion without permission was a criminal offence. However, fellow Conservative MP Nadine Dorries tweeted her support for Ms Caulfield, whom she felt had been attacked for holding a ""different point of view"". Allow Twitter content?

"Bethany Shipsey was at the end of the corridor in the emergency department because it was so busy, an inquest heard A woman who died after taking diet pills did not get appropriate care because an A&E department was overcrowded, an inquest has heard. Bethany Shipsey, 21, from Worcester, took an overdose of tablets containing the substance DNP in February 2017. A junior doctor who saw her said it was ""one of the busiest days"" he had seen. Dr Alireza Niroumand said Ms Shipsey was at the end of the corridor in the emergency department in Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Midlands Live: Alton Towers' safety pledge over new wooden 'coaster; Man charged with murder over playground stabbing He said he could not transfer her to the resuscitation room because the department was full. He added he should have consulted the poisons department when he saw Ms Shipsey at 18:30 to understand the drug he had ""never seen before"" and did not use a database called ""Toxbase"" for information, because the files he needed had been given to him by a nurse. Worcestershire Coroner's Court was told Dr Niroumand should have referred the case to the intensive care team, but did not. The inquest heard Ms Shipsey was having ongoing treatment for mental health issues, linked to trauma from when she was raped by a previous partner, but was ""not considered a suicide risk"", despite previously taking 14 overdoses. Bethany was a vegan and an animal welfare supporter Dr Nirvana Chandrappa, a senior consultant psychiatrist from Worcestershire Health and Care, said he had found 24 red and yellow diet pills in her jacket at a meeting in January 2017. He said he spoke to Ms Shipsey about the dangers of using the diet pills but she told hospital staff she had stopped using them. Kirsty South, a senior sister at the hospital and co-ordinator of the A&E department at the time Ms Shipsey was admitted, described the day as ""one of the most challenging shifts"" she had worked and ""more than busy"". She added: ""It wasn't that we couldn't cope, it is just that we got busier and busier and busier throughout the day. ""I would say [the number of patients] was very close to exceptional.""

"Iran's supreme leader has criticised foreign influence through languages in the past Iran has banned teaching the English language in primary schools, calling the subject a ""cultural invasion"". The education ministry ""envisages strengthening Persian language skills and Iranian Islamic culture of pupils at the primary school stage"", its secretary told state media. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has previously expressed concern about the teaching of English. It is seen as an important skill by many Iranians and is widely studied. English is a foreign language option for many at secondary level, which begins at the age of 12, but its popularity has led to classes being offered by some schools much earlier. ""Teaching of foreign languages has not been recommended by any means"" at primary level, Mehdi Navid-Adham, secretary of the Supreme Education Council, told the state-run IRIB news agency. He also said that primary schools which teach English as an extra class outside of school hours were committing a ""violation"". The ban does not affect foreign-language tuition at secondary school or popular private institutes which teach English outside the educational system. Broadcast and print media in Iran are controlled by the statebut include several English-language outlets, including the Islamic Republic News Agency and PressTV. Analysis by Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian This move is in line with the supreme leader's anti-Western, isolationist view of the world. He has repeatedly said that teaching English to children from an early age could lead to ""western cultural infiltration"". He says the language of science is not necessarily English and that children should be taught other languages like Spanish, French, or eastern languages. President Hassan Rouhani disagrees with him, and has said that knowing English will help young people join the job market. But he had little power to stop the ban. However, it is unlikely to stop families from pushing their children to learn English. Many middle class families already take their kids to independent language institutions after school hours because the methods used to teach English at normal schools aren't very successful. Ayatollah Khamenei laid out his views on the issue in a 2016 speech given to teachers, criticising the spread of English to nursery schools. He said such developments were part of a Western idea of instilling ""thought and culture to the younger generation of countries"". ""These remarks do not mean terminating English language teaching at schools, but the main issue is to know our rival and how precisely the opposite party has made planning to influence the country's future generation,"" he said. The move comes amid significant turmoil in Iran. At least 21 people have been killed in anti-government protestswhich began in late December over standards of living. More than 1,000 people are said to have been arrested, including at least 90 students. Ayatollah Khamenei blamed unspecified external ""enemies"" for the unrest.

"Many parents are worried about the amount of time their children spend on their phones Big investors havecalled on Apple,externalto develop software that limits how long children can use its smartphones. The call came from two investment groups that hold $2bn (Â£1.48bn) of Apple stock between them. A letter calling for the digital locks, signed by Jana Partners and a California teachers' pension fund, was sent to the iPhone maker this weekend. The call for better controls was welcomed by academics studying youngsters' use of technology. Jana Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) called on Apple to consider the impact excessive use of smartphones had on the mental health of young people. In their letter, the two pointed to numerous studies which suggest excessive phone use can disrupt lessons, harm students' ability to concentrate on school work and deprive them of sleep. The document also mentioned the impact that ""heavy use"" of social media can have on self-esteem and its possible influence on childhood depression. The two are worried that if Apple does not address growing concerns about smartphone use, its stock market value and general reputation could be damaged. According to a Reuters report, half of US teenagers believe they are addicted to their mobile phones,externaland feel the need to respond immediately to messages. The investment groups acknowledged that a variety of factors were at work in determining a young person's outlook and mental health. But, they added, it ""would defy common sense"" to argue that high levels of phone use were not having some impact. The makers of such ""powerful products"" also needed to help parents ensure phones are being used optimally. They called on Apple to improve its current parental control systems which, they said, were a ""binary, all or nothing approach"". The two groups said they would welcome the chance to talk about the issues they raised with Apple's board of directors. Children are encountering smartphones at earlier ages than ever, suggests research Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics, said it was good to hear the call from the investors. She added there needed to be one voice between device manufacturers, social media companies and internet service providers (ISPs) on the issue of smartphone use. ""For a long time the concern has been to not do anything that would impact a friction-free experience,"" Prof Livingstone told the BBC. ""Everyone would like to have a well balanced life, but the way that devices are designed currently causes a lot of conflict with parents."" She called on Apple and other device manufacturers to have all notifications on smartphones switched off by default and for the creation of occasional reminders that urged youngsters to take a break from their phone after long periods of use. Prof Livingstone, who also runs aparenting blog,external, did question the use of the term ""addiction"" for those who spend a long time using a smartphone, however. ""Everyone will agree that there is excessive use and even obsession with smartphones, but I don't believe it's addiction,"" she said. In a statement Apple said that it had ""always looked out for kids."" Apple added: ""We work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online. We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system. With today's iOS devices, parents have the ability to control and restrict content including apps, movies, websites, songs and books, as well as cellular data, password settings and other features. Effectively anything a child could download or access online can be easily blocked or restricted by a parent.""

"The new year is a time when many plan to shape up after the excesses of the festive period. Now there is good news for those who fear it might be too late in life to improve their fitness. People into late middle age can reverse or reduce the risk of heart failure caused by decades of sedentary living by exercising, a study has found. But there is a catch - it takes two years of aerobic exercise, four to five days a week, researchers said. The study, published in the journal Circulation,external, analysed the hearts of 53 adults aged 45-64 who were healthy but had no history of exercising regularly. Research has shown that sedentary behaviours - such as sitting or reclining for long periods of time - increase the risk of heart disease. The study's participants were divided into two groups, with one following an aerobic exercise routine that progressed in intensity over the two years and another doing yoga, balance training and weight training three times a week, also for two years. The aerobic exercise group showed an 18% improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25% improvement in ""plasticity"" in the left ventricular muscle of the heart - both markers of a healthier heart. However, the benefits were not seen in the second group. Middle-aged told to walk faster Twenty million Britons 'physically inactive' Exercise 'keeps the mind sharp' in over-50s Dr Benjamin Levine, lead author of the study and the founder and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, a joint programme between Texas Health Resources and UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, Texas, said: ""The key to a healthier heart in middle age is the right dose of exercise, at the right time in life. ""We found what we believe to be the optimal dose of the right kind of exercise, which is four to five times a week, and the 'sweet spot' in time, when the heart risk from a lifetime of sedentary behaviour can be improved - which is late-middle age. ""The result was a reversal of decades of a sedentary lifestyle on the heart for most of the study participants."" At least one long session a week of aerobic exercise featured in the study participants' routine Participants exercised generally in 30-minute sessions, plus a warm-up and cool-down. Their routine included: One high-intensity aerobic session, such as four-by-four interval training where participants did four sets of four minutes of exercise at 95% of their maximum heart rate followed by three minutes of active recovery at 60-75% peak heart rate Two or three days a week of moderate intensity exercise (where exercisers sweat but can still carry on a conversation) At least one weekly strength training session At least one long session of aerobic exercise a week, such as an hour of tennis, cycling, running, dancing or brisk walking They built up to those levels, beginning with three 30-minute moderate exercise sessions for the first three months after which high intensity exercise was included. Dr Levine told the BBC the take-home message from the research is that exercise needs to be a part of people's personal hygiene, like teeth brushing. ""It's not something that gets added on to the end of the day: You brush your teeth, you change your clothes, you eat food and drink water. ""You do these things for personal hygiene. Exercise is equally important. You need to find ways to incorporate it into your daily activities."" Dr Richard Siow, vice-dean for the faculty of life sciences and medicine at King's College London and director of ageing research at King's, told the BBC the study was valuable in that shows we can delay cardiovascular ageing. He said it provided further evidence that ""we can, in a way, rejuvenate or make the cells in the heart, and also in the blood vessels for that matter, resemble younger cells through an exercise programme"". ""I think that's a very important take-home message for those of us who may have a doom and gloom view there's nothing we can do about it. Yes there is, we can start by getting off the couch to have a more active lifestyle."" Dr Siow said the study also had ramifications for conditions relating to cognitive decline, such as dementia, because improved heart function facilitates blood flow to the brain. ""The wider ramifications of this study for healthy ageing need to be explored,"" he said. Previous studies have shown improvements in heart elasticity in young people after a year of training, but little change if the training was started after the age of 65, the report's authors said. They said the aerobic exercise regimen should be started before the age of 65 when the heart appears to retain ""plasticity"" and the ability to remodel itself. Dr Levine told the BBC his team would next look at whether the same kind of improvements shown in the study can be made in people at high risk of heart failure, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those who are obese. However, researchers said there were a couple of limitations to the study. One was that volunteers were willing and able to participate in an intensive exercise regimen, which may not be the case for the general adult population. Another potential limitation was that most of the study's participants were white and it was not clear whether the results would apply to other racial groups, researchers said. It also does not mention diet or other factors that can affect health, such as pollution. ""It needs to be taken into the context of a healthy lifestyle as well,"" Dr Siow added.

"Toby Young's appointment to the board of the new Office for Students has left the university regulator with its ""credibility in tatters"", says Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow secretary for women and equalities. It follows accusations that Mr Young had made offensive comments on Twitter. But Universities Minister Jo Johnson rejected ""armchair critics"" and said Mr Young had already apologised. The prime minister had said she was ""not impressed""by Mr Young's language. Ms Butler, challenging the appointment of Mr Young, told the House of Commons she was ""flabbergasted"" by Mr Young's comments, which she said ""makes a mockery"" of any commitment to equality. There has been sustained scrutiny of Mr Young's comments on women, schools' support for the disabled and working class students at university. Labour MPs have argued that they make him unsuitable to sit on a body representing the interests of students - and that the appointment should be reversed. Mr Johnson told MPs the new regulator's comments were ""obnoxious and repellent"", but that Mr Young had been on a ""developmental journey"" and had given undertakings not to repeat such comments. The universities minister said he should be judged on his achievements in setting up schools and ""not foolish and obnoxious tweets from the distant past"". His ""good work"" in education made him a worthy appointment for the new body, said Mr Johnson. This included commendations from the Fulbright Commission for Mr Young's work as a commissioner, said the universities minister. But the Conservative chairman of the Education Select Committee, Robert Halfon, called for a re-think on Mr Young's appointment, highlighting his writing about eugenics. Mr Halfon said this was ""incredibly dark and very dangerous stuff"". Mr Young has rejected this as a misunderstanding, saying he was writing about eugenics to warn how technology could compound inequality. Labour's former shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell, said the appointment was evidence of an indefensible ""chumocracy"". But Mr Young, writing last week, said some of his comments had been ""sophomoric and silly"", but he had been ""deliberately misinterpreted to try and paint me as a caricature of a heartless Tory toff"". ""For the record, I'm a supporter of women's rights and LGBT rights,"" wrote Mr Young. ""I'm also a defender of teaching children with disabilities in mainstream schools. I have an older brother with learning disabilities and I'm a patron of the residential care home he's lived in for 20 years."" He said that much of the criticism had been politically motivated. ""But I am a Tory, obviously, and for some people that alone is enough to disqualify me from serving on the OfS's board,"" he wrote.

Neither Ms Gracie, nor Ms Adler appeared on a list issued by the BBC last July, listing the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year. The US editor, Jon Sopel, earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999 - in Ms Gracie's words, ""at least 50% more"" than herself and Ms Adler.

Gender pay gap: More than 500 firms reveal their figures Ms Gracie told Radio 4's Woman's Hour the BBC had offered to raise her annual salary to Â£180,000, but she did not see that as a solution and there would still have been ""a big gap between myself and my male peers"". Asked whether those male workers should receive a pay cut, Ms Gracie said: ""I believe in public service broadcasting and I do think salaries at the top are unacceptably high... but I don't have the information to say this needs to happen or that should happen."" She added: ""I could not go back to China and collude knowingly in what I consider to be unlawful pay discrimination. I could not do it, nor could I stay silent and watch the BBC perpetuate a failing pay structure by discriminating against women."" This video can not be played Journalist Mariella Frostrup tells Today the gender pay situation hasn't improved in her lifetime Due to the BBC's impartiality rules, presenter Jane Garvey - who had tweeted support for Ms Gracie - said she was unable to conduct the interview. Instead, despite Ms Gracie being in the Woman's Hour studio, the interview was carried out by freelance journalistJane Martinson, from a radio car. BBC guidelines dictate that reporters should should not be ""exposed to conflicts of interest"", and there must be ""editorial separation"" of those reporting the story. Earlier, co-presenting the Today programme with John Humphrys, Ms Gracie said: ""The support I have had in the last few hours over this, I think it does speak to the depth of hunger for an equal, fair and transparent pay system."" Influential media in China have given prominent attention to Carrie Gracie's resignation as China editor, but have made no comment on her work. Global Times and China Daily highlighted her statement that women at the BBC are generally paid significantly less than men, and broadcaster CCTV shares a picture of Ms Gracie from her Twitter page holding an #equalpayday sign. Some social media users on the popular Sina Weibo praise her for speaking out and say they ""support"" her. ""We need to be treated equally!"" says one user, receiving hundreds of likes. Some say that men and women are paid the same in China, and one blames ""capitalism"" on her pay. Other users give damning comments on articles she has written that they perceive to be anti-China. Source: BBC Monitoring In an open letter issued on Sunday, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom in London ""where I expect to be paid equally"". This video can not be played The director general must explain how he is tackling the gender pay gap, says John Whittingdale In the letter, posted on her blog,,externalMs Gracie - a China specialist who is fluent in Mandarin - said licence fee payers had ""a right to know"" the organisation was ""breaking equality law and resisting pressure for a fair and transparent pay structure"". ""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's."" She said ""patience and goodwill"" among female staff was running out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, who forced the corporation to disclose salaries above Â£150,000, criticised the director general Tony Hall for not resolving the ""substantial difference"" in men and women's pay ""at the top level"". He added: ""It's now quite a long time since those figures came out. And nothing, as far as we're aware, has really happened since."" In a statement, a BBC spokeswoman said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" and the corporation would improve transparency on how pay is set. The BBC has said it hopes to close the gender pay gap by 2020, but this is different to the issue of equal pay. The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men's and women's average earnings in an organisation. Equal pay, as defined in the Equality Act 2010, means that men and women doing the same job should receive the same salary. There have been three investigations into gender pay: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. It found the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is still being carried out and will be published ""in the not too distant future"" Arriving at the Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles, actress Emma Watson said the BBC's commitment to equal pay was ""great... but we need to see them fulfil it"".

"Munir Mohammed and Rowaida El-Hassan met on an online dating site A man and woman have been found guilty of plotting a ""devastating"" terror attack in the UK using a homemade bomb. Food factory worker Munir Mohammed, 36, from Derby, and pharmacist Rowaida El-Hassan, 33, from north-west London, also exchanged messages about ricin. The Old Bailey heard asylum seeker Mohammed signed up for a ""new job in the UK"", while messaging an IS commander via Facebook. He used El-Hassan's chemical knowledge after theymet on a dating website. Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the couple were ""clearly attracted to each other through their support for Daesh's [IS's] violent ideology and its intolerance of those who do not subscribe to its views"". ""They planned to kill and injure innocent people in the UK and had the mind-set, the methodology and almost all the material needed for Mohammed to carry out an attack,"" she said. ""Both will be in prison, where they cannot plot together and will no longer be a danger to the public."" A bottle of hydrogen peroxide, which Mohammed believed was needed to make a bomb, was found in a wardrobe at his home At the time of his arrest in December 2016, Mohammed had two of the three components needed for TATP explosives, as well as manuals on how to make explosives, mobile phone detonators as well as the deadly poison ricin. The trial heard Mohammed, originally from Eritrea, who lived in Sudan for some time before coming to the UK, investigated making poison while working at a supermarket ready meals factory. The court was also told that he was using sophisticated false documents to access services and work in the UK illegally. Derby terror plot: The illegal worker and his lover Judge Michael Topolski QC remanded the pair in custody and warned them they faced jail when they are sentenced on 22 February. The pair both denied the charges, but a jury found them guilty of the plot The judge told Mohammed: ""You have been convicted of planning a potentially devastating terrorist attack by creating an explosive device and deploying it somewhere in the UK targeting those you regarded as enemies of the Islamic State. ""Rowaida El-Hassan, you share the extremist mindset with Munir Mohammed and you were ideologically motivated to provide him with support, motivation and assistance. ""You knew he was engaging and planning an attack. You knew he was planning an explosion to kill and maim innocent people in the cause of Islamic State."" Mohammed, of Leopold Street, Derby, was unanimously convicted of preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016. His co-accused El-Hassan, of Willesden Lane, north-west London, was convicted of the same charge by a majority of 10 to one jurors. The court was shown footage of Mohammed visiting an Asda store near his home in Derby where he allegedly tried to buy ingredients for a homemade bomb Munir Mohammed was trying to make a pressure-cooker bomb, like the device used at the Boston Marathon, detectives told me. They were also concerned that he posed a threat to the factory where he was making supermarket ready meals. In his bedroom, the police found bomb-making instructions and two of the three chemicals needed for a high-explosive called TATP. Derby's police commander, Ch Supt Jim Allen, said Derby was ""clearly on the sharp end of a very serious plot that presented a very real risk to very many people"". ""We don't know where his target was, but we have to be alarmed that he was so close to the centre of our city,"" he said. ""We arrested him within a few hundred metres of a large crowded shopping centre and we know that terrorists are attracted to that kind of location to do the most damage to create the most impact, and I can't rule that out."" Mohammed worked in Burton in Staffordshire in a job making sauces for ready meals sold in Tesco and Morrisons. Counter-terrorism officers discovered that he had been researching and trying to source the poison ricin, and he had pledged allegiance to an IS commander, called Abubakr Kurdi, who called for poison attacks on food. Det Ch Insp Paul Greenwood, who led the investigation, said officers did not believe Mohammed had selected a definite target by the time he was arrested but was awaiting orders from Islamic State. The officer said Mohammed was ""an extremely dangerous terrorist"". Mr Greenwood added: ""Had he not been arrested when he was - which was on 12 December 2016, at a time when he'd already started to acquire chemicals, already started to look at pressure cookers, on the delivery mechanism for an attack and was already in conversation with Islamic States operatives - I think he was very close to mounting some sort of attack. ""And that could well have occurred before Christmas 2016 and I think that attack would have involved the loss of life and multiple injuries had Mohammed had his way.""

"Women's right groups have criticised Theresa May's decision to appoint an MP who opposed the decriminalisation of abortion to a role representing women. Maria Caulfield, new Conservative vice chair for women, said decriminalisation would lead to ""abortion on demand"". Abortion provider BPAS said the PM's decision to appoint Ms Caulfield to the role was incredibly disappointing. Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party (WEP) leader, said Ms Caulfield could ""never advocate effectively"" for women. The BBC has contacted Ms Caulfield - the Conservative MP for Lewes and a former nurse - for a response. Abortion should not be a crime, say doctors Online abortion pill sales 'increasing' Currently, women in England and Wales have to prove to two medical professionals that carrying on with the pregnancy is detrimental to their health or wellbeing, before having a termination. Without permission, abortion remains a criminal offence under the 1967 Abortion Act. In March last year, a Ten Minute Rule Bill called for changes to the law, to prevent the prosecution of women who end their own pregnancies without permission. The proposed changes would have meant women who, for example, order abortion pills online and self-administer would not risk prosecution. However,Ms Caulfield spoke out against the bill,externalsaying the idea would leave young women less safe and ""embolden"" men who force women into abortion. She said it would become a ""charter for extreme abortion practices"", including sex-selective abortion. Ms Caulfield, a member of the all-party pro-life parliamentary group, said she feared the proposal would fuel ""unethical and unsafe"" procedures. Allow Twitter content?

It said Ms Caulfield had been a ""leading opponent"" of the proposed bill, which did not become law and has not been reintroduced since last year's general election. ""That the new Conservative vice chair for women believes that these women should face up to life imprisonment is appalling. Maria Caulfield has stated that she wants to be a 'voice for the unborn child',"" BPAS said. ""It is profoundly disappointing that the Conservative Party did not think that a better choice for vice chair for women would be someone willing and able to speak up for the one in three women who will have an abortion in their lifetime."" In a string of tweets, BPAS added that Ms Caulfield's views were ""out of step with members of the public and her own parliamentary party"".

"The new year is a time when many plan to shape up after the excesses of the festive period. Now there is good news for those who fear it might be too late in life to improve their fitness. People into late middle age can reverse or reduce the risk of heart failure caused by decades of sedentary living by exercising, a study has found. But there is a catch - it takes two years of aerobic exercise, four to five days a week, researchers said. The study, published in the journal Circulation,external, analysed the hearts of 53 adults aged 45-64 who were healthy but had no history of exercising regularly. Research has shown that sedentary behaviours - such as sitting or reclining for long periods of time - increase the risk of heart disease. The study's participants were divided into two groups, with one following an aerobic exercise routine that progressed in intensity over the two years and another doing yoga, balance training and weight training three times a week, also for two years. The aerobic exercise group showed an 18% improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25% improvement in ""plasticity"" in the left ventricular muscle of the heart - both markers of a healthier heart. However, the benefits were not seen in the second group. Middle-aged told to walk faster Twenty million Britons 'physically inactive' Exercise 'keeps the mind sharp' in over-50s Dr Benjamin Levine, lead author of the study and the founder and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, a joint programme between Texas Health Resources and UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, Texas, said: ""The key to a healthier heart in middle age is the right dose of exercise, at the right time in life. ""We found what we believe to be the optimal dose of the right kind of exercise, which is four to five times a week, and the 'sweet spot' in time, when the heart risk from a lifetime of sedentary behaviour can be improved - which is late-middle age. ""The result was a reversal of decades of a sedentary lifestyle on the heart for most of the study participants."" At least one long session a week of aerobic exercise featured in the study participants' routine Participants exercised generally in 30-minute sessions, plus a warm-up and cool-down. Their routine included: One high-intensity aerobic session, such as four-by-four interval training where participants did four sets of four minutes of exercise at 95% of their maximum heart rate followed by three minutes of active recovery at 60-75% peak heart rate Two or three days a week of moderate intensity exercise (where exercisers sweat but can still carry on a conversation) At least one weekly strength training session At least one long session of aerobic exercise a week, such as an hour of tennis, cycling, running, dancing or brisk walking They built up to those levels, beginning with three 30-minute moderate exercise sessions for the first three months after which high intensity exercise was included. Dr Levine told the BBC the take-home message from the research is that exercise needs to be a part of people's personal hygiene, like teeth brushing. ""It's not something that gets added on to the end of the day: You brush your teeth, you change your clothes, you eat food and drink water. ""You do these things for personal hygiene. Exercise is equally important. You need to find ways to incorporate it into your daily activities."" Dr Richard Siow, vice-dean for the faculty of life sciences and medicine at King's College London and director of ageing research at King's, told the BBC the study was valuable in that shows we can delay cardiovascular ageing. He said it provided further evidence that ""we can, in a way, rejuvenate or make the cells in the heart, and also in the blood vessels for that matter, resemble younger cells through an exercise programme"". ""I think that's a very important take-home message for those of us who may have a doom and gloom view there's nothing we can do about it. Yes there is, we can start by getting off the couch to have a more active lifestyle."" Dr Siow said the study also had ramifications for conditions relating to cognitive decline, such as dementia, because improved heart function facilitates blood flow to the brain. ""The wider ramifications of this study for healthy ageing need to be explored,"" he said. Previous studies have shown improvements in heart elasticity in young people after a year of training, but little change if the training was started after the age of 65, the report's authors said. They said the aerobic exercise regimen should be started before the age of 65 when the heart appears to retain ""plasticity"" and the ability to remodel itself. Dr Levine told the BBC his team would next look at whether the same kind of improvements shown in the study can be made in people at high risk of heart failure, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those who are obese. However, researchers said there were a couple of limitations to the study. One was that volunteers were willing and able to participate in an intensive exercise regimen, which may not be the case for the general adult population. Another potential limitation was that most of the study's participants were white and it was not clear whether the results would apply to other racial groups, researchers said. It also does not mention diet or other factors that can affect health, such as pollution. ""It needs to be taken into the context of a healthy lifestyle as well,"" Dr Siow added.

"Disney has admitted ""making up"" some white actors in order for them to ""blend"" into Asian crowd scenes for its upcoming Aladdin film. The company told Newsbeat they filled background performer roles with white people ""only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control"". Extra Kaushal Odedra appears in the film and says he saw ""around 20"" other actors being made up to look Arabian. He believes Disney are ""out of touch"". Kaushal says he finally got a part in Aladdin after he kept getting rejected The 32-year-old tells us he recognised several white actors on set. ""Aladdin was the perfect time to show diversity but also be accurate,"" he added. ""They're being out of touch with what's going on around them."" Many within the industry have criticised producers for not recruiting people with Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi or Arab heritage. Actor Kal Penn respondedon Twitter,externalsaying: ""When a PR person says they decided to put 100 people in brownface in 2018 because not enough of us are qualified, that's bs, someone just didn't want to spend the $ to do it right."" ""Great care was taken to put together one of the largest, most diverse casts ever seen on screen,"" a Disney spokesman told Newsbeat. ""Diversity of our cast and background performers was a requirement and only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control (special effects rigs, stunt performers and handling of animals) were crew made up to blend in."" Kaushal responded: ""I can understand it if it comes to stunt people and animal handling but I think they did have a choice."" There werewhitewashing claims in July 2017after a non-Arab actor, Naomi Scott, was cast in Princess Jasmine's role in the film. Scott, who's of British and Indian heritage, will star alongside Egyptian-Canadian actor Mena Massoud as Aladdin. Mena recently posted on Instagram urging people to watch the original Disney animation of Aladdin, saying he was just one years old when it was released 25 years ago.,external Filmmakers were also criticised in September 2017 forcontroversially introducing a white charactercalled Prince Anders, played by Billy Magnussen. There are no white characters in the original Middle Eastern folk story, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp from The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. Billy Magnussen will play Prince Anders who didn't appear in the 1992 animated version of Aladdin It's not the first time a production has been criticised for choosing white cast members to play Asian or black characters. Sky dropped a series that had Joseph Fiennes starring as Michael Jackson. British actor Ed Skreinpulled out of a rolein the Hellboy reboot last year after a backlash because he was cast as a character of Asian heritage. The Deadpool star said he didn't know the race of Major Ben Daimio when he accepted the part in the comic book adaptation.

"Many parents are worried about the amount of time their children spend on their phones Big investors havecalled on Apple,externalto develop software that limits how long children can use its smartphones. The call came from two investment groups that hold $2bn (Â£1.48bn) of Apple stock between them. A letter calling for the digital locks, signed by Jana Partners and a California teachers' pension fund, was sent to the iPhone maker this weekend. The call for better controls was welcomed by academics studying youngsters' use of technology. Jana Partners and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) called on Apple to consider the impact excessive use of smartphones had on the mental health of young people. In their letter, the two pointed to numerous studies which suggest excessive phone use can disrupt lessons, harm students' ability to concentrate on school work and deprive them of sleep. The document also mentioned the impact that ""heavy use"" of social media can have on self-esteem and its possible influence on childhood depression. The two are worried that if Apple does not address growing concerns about smartphone use, its stock market value and general reputation could be damaged. According to a Reuters report, half of US teenagers believe they are addicted to their mobile phones,externaland feel the need to respond immediately to messages. The investment groups acknowledged that a variety of factors were at work in determining a young person's outlook and mental health. But, they added, it ""would defy common sense"" to argue that high levels of phone use were not having some impact. The makers of such ""powerful products"" also needed to help parents ensure phones are being used optimally. They called on Apple to improve its current parental control systems which, they said, were a ""binary, all or nothing approach"". The two groups said they would welcome the chance to talk about the issues they raised with Apple's board of directors. Children are encountering smartphones at earlier ages than ever, suggests research Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics, said it was good to hear the call from the investors. She added there needed to be one voice between device manufacturers, social media companies and internet service providers (ISPs) on the issue of smartphone use. ""For a long time the concern has been to not do anything that would impact a friction-free experience,"" Prof Livingstone told the BBC. ""Everyone would like to have a well balanced life, but the way that devices are designed currently causes a lot of conflict with parents."" She called on Apple and other device manufacturers to have all notifications on smartphones switched off by default and for the creation of occasional reminders that urged youngsters to take a break from their phone after long periods of use. Prof Livingstone, who also runs aparenting blog,external, did question the use of the term ""addiction"" for those who spend a long time using a smartphone, however. ""Everyone will agree that there is excessive use and even obsession with smartphones, but I don't believe it's addiction,"" she said. In a statement Apple said that it had ""always looked out for kids."" Apple added: ""We work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online. We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system. With today's iOS devices, parents have the ability to control and restrict content including apps, movies, websites, songs and books, as well as cellular data, password settings and other features. Effectively anything a child could download or access online can be easily blocked or restricted by a parent.""

"Evelyn Johnston-Smith was born with a hole in her heart A baby born with a hole in her heart had to wait four months for a major operation to repair the defect, after the procedure was cancelled five times. Leanne Smith, 20, said her daughter Evelyn Johnston-Smith was at risk of cardiac arrest as she waited for surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. She said the wait had been ""traumatic"" but she did not blame the hospital. A hospital spokesperson said the ""difficult"" decision to cancel the operation was ""not taken lightly"". Evelyn's condition was spotted at the 20-week scan, and shortly after she was born she underwent a 14-hour operation in September 2016. Doctors said she would need a second operation within a year. Evelyn underwent an eight-and-a-half-hour open heart procedure in December The procedure was scheduled for September 2017 and medics put a deadline of 17 November in place. However, the operation was cancelled five times because of staff shortages, lack of beds and an emergency case. It was eventually carried out on 22 December. More stories from across Yorkshire Ms Smith said: ""It's just traumatic having it cancelled five times and being dragged into hospital three times. ""By leaving it so long my daughter could have gone into cardiac arrest but the hospital was working as fast as they could to reschedule."" Evelyn, one, is now recovering at home following the eight-and-a-half-hour open heart procedure. Ms Smith said her daughter is recovering at home after the procedure Dr Yvette Oade, chief medical officer for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said non-emergency, planned operations are sometimes postponed if there is no bed available in the paediatric intensive care unit. ""These decisions are not taken lightly but we have to ensure we put patient safety first and continue to provide the highest standards of care for our patients,"" she said. ""We empathise with Evelyn and her family and we are very sorry that their experience didn't match our high standards.""

"Mr Juncker sees Brexit posing a budget dilemma for the EU European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker says he believes Brexit will go ahead and the EU should tackle its looming budget shortfall. ""Don't believe those who say that it's not going to happen and that people in the UK have realised their error... I don't think that's going to be the case,"" he told a Brussels conference. The EU budget commissioner said the UK's departure would leave a hole of about â¬12-13bn (Â£11-12bn; $14-$16bn). The UK's exit is set for March 2019. Budget Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger said the budget gap would have to be closed with 50% spending cuts and 50% fresh money. He suggested a Europe-wide tax on plastic products as a source of extra revenue. The Commission will publish a proposal in May this year and has urged EU leaders to agree a budget deal by May 2019. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and former Prime Minister Tony Blair are among the prominent voices arguing that Brexit can still be reversed, possibly by holding a new referendum on whatever deal is reached on the UK withdrawal. The key Brexit dates in 2018 Brexit talks to move to next stage - EU Brexit: All you need to know The EU is bracing for hard bargaining between the bloc's net contributors and net recipients for the next budget period, 2020-2026. The UK is currently among the major net contributors. By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels â¬1 trillion- Rough amount that will be spent by the EU in 2014-2020, including on agriculture, energy, regional policy and administration â¬12-13bn- Permanent hole left in the budget each year by the UK's departure, according to the European Commission 1%- Size of the EU budget as a proportion of the European economy; Mr Juncker wants it to go up 85%- Size of eurozone as share of total EU economy after UK's departure - up from 73%, showing a shift of power to the eurozone after Brexit ""There will have to be cuts in some major [EU] programmes - some significant cuts,"" Mr Oettinger warned. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain will honour its current commitments to the EU budget, until 2020. The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. According to UK Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn. The total contribution was more, but the UK received a Â£4.6bn rebate. That annual rebate was won by the late Margaret Thatcher. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. On Monday the veteran pro-Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage met EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. ""Mr Barnier clearly did not understand why Brexit happened,"" he said after the meeting.

"Catriona Ogilvy spent the first months of her maternity leave at a neonatal ward hospital after her son, Samuel, was born 10 weeks early A council is giving extra leave to staff members who have premature babies needing hospital treatment. Employees at Waltham Forest Council are entitled to an extra week of leave for every week their premature baby spends in hospital before their due date. Campaigners hope the scheme will put pressure on ministers to change maternity and paternity leave laws. The government said the UK's maternity leave system was already one of the ""most generous in the world"". The council believes it is the first employer in the UK to introduce such a policy. When babies are born prematurely,parental leave starts the day after the birth,external. Catriona Ogilvy spent the first months of her maternity leave at a neonatal ward hospital after her son, Samuel, was born 10 weeks early. She said: ""Mothers like me lose precious time to bond and experience higher levels of mental health difficulties following the trauma of neonatal intensive care. ""They need more time once their baby finally comes home before going back to work"". Mrs Ogilvy, who has since founded the charityThe Smallest Things,external, said Waltham Forest Council's ""brilliant"" policy was beneficial for the employer, parents and babies alike. The council said up to 14 of the 109 employees currently on maternity or paternity leave would have been eligible for extra time off under the new rules. Waltham Forest councillorClyde Loakes told the BBC's Woman's Hour: ""We just want to give that extra bit of comfort and let that extra bit of stress out of what is a very difficult time for both fathers and mothers."" Parents of premature babies like Samuel start their leave the day after the birth However, Mrs Ogilvy said there were thousands more families whose employers will not be so flexible. She wants the law to be changed so that leave begins on the baby's due date. Her petition has more than 140,000 signatures. Mrs Ogilvy's local MP debated the issue in Parliament in 2016but the second reading of his proposed bill was cancelled. A spokesman from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK's maternity system is one of the most generous in the world. ""While the current system strikes the right balance between the needs of new mums and business, we'd expect employers to give working parents who have premature babies the support they need.""

"Reporting restrictions preventing Derryck John from being identified because of his age were lifted A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to carrying out acid attacks on six moped riders to steal their bikes. Derryck John, from Croydon, appeared at Wood Green Crown Court and admitted targeting the riders in the north and east of London on 13 July. He sprayed the riders in the face with a noxious liquid and stole two mopeds before trying to take another four. Earlier reporting restrictions preventing John from being identified because of his age were lifted. Police said one attack had left a rider with ""life-changing injuries"". John had been due to stand trial after he initially denied six counts of throwing a corrosive liquid with intent to ""disable, burn, maim, disfigure or cause grievous bodily harm"", two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted robbery. Judge Noel Lucas QC told Wood Green Crown Court there was an ""overwhelming, huge public interest"" in identifying the teenager despite his age after he pleaded guilty to the total of 12 counts. John was arrested at about 03:00 on 14 July, the court heard. Another unidentified person is listed on the indictment as also having been involved in the attacks. Emergency crews and other moped drivers went to the help of victims on 13 July The substance used in the attacks was thought to have had a pH of one or two, an acidity level similar to battery acid, the court heard. Judge Lucas, reading a note from the defendant, said the guilty pleas were entered ""on the basis that the acid was thrown to incapacitate the victims"" and ""the other male involved was much older than me"". The judge quoted John, saying: ""I really didn't appreciate the damage that would be done. ""I'm terrified of the sentence that I will receive and I'm very sorry for what I did and realise I will receive a significant sentence of imprisonment."" John did not enter a plea on a further charge of robbery on 25 June. The count will be dealt with at sentencing. Sentencing will take place on 9 March at Wood Green Crown Court.

She quit, citing pay inequality with male international editors earning more than her Â£135,000-a-year salary. She said she had refused a Â£45,000 rise as it still left a ""big gap"" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be ""made equal"". The BBC said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" to the corporation.

Gender pay gap: More than 500 firms reveal their figures Ms Gracie told Radio 4's Woman's Hour the BBC had offered to raise her annual salary to Â£180,000, but she did not see that as a solution and there would still have been ""a big gap between myself and my male peers"". Asked whether those male workers should receive a pay cut, Ms Gracie said: ""I believe in public service broadcasting and I do think salaries at the top are unacceptably high... but I don't have the information to say this needs to happen or that should happen."" She added: ""I could not go back to China and collude knowingly in what I consider to be unlawful pay discrimination. I could not do it, nor could I stay silent and watch the BBC perpetuate a failing pay structure by discriminating against women."" This video can not be played Journalist Mariella Frostrup tells Today the gender pay situation hasn't improved in her lifetime Due to the BBC's impartiality rules, presenter Jane Garvey - who had tweeted support for Ms Gracie - said she was unable to conduct the interview. Instead, despite Ms Gracie being in the Woman's Hour studio, the interview was carried out by freelance journalistJane Martinson, from a radio car. BBC guidelines dictate that reporters should should not be ""exposed to conflicts of interest"", and there must be ""editorial separation"" of those reporting the story. Earlier, co-presenting the Today programme with John Humphrys, Ms Gracie said: ""The support I have had in the last few hours over this, I think it does speak to the depth of hunger for an equal, fair and transparent pay system."" Influential media in China have given prominent attention to Carrie Gracie's resignation as China editor, but have made no comment on her work. Global Times and China Daily highlighted her statement that women at the BBC are generally paid significantly less than men, and broadcaster CCTV shares a picture of Ms Gracie from her Twitter page holding an #equalpayday sign. Some social media users on the popular Sina Weibo praise her for speaking out and say they ""support"" her. ""We need to be treated equally!"" says one user, receiving hundreds of likes. Some say that men and women are paid the same in China, and one blames ""capitalism"" on her pay. Other users give damning comments on articles she has written that they perceive to be anti-China. Source: BBC Monitoring In an open letter issued on Sunday, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"".

""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's.""

Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, who forced the corporation to disclose salaries above Â£150,000, criticised the director general Tony Hall for not resolving the ""substantial difference"" in men and women's pay ""at the top level"". He added: ""It's now quite a long time since those figures came out. And nothing, as far as we're aware, has really happened since."" In a statement, a BBC spokeswoman said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" and the corporation would improve transparency on how pay is set. The BBC has said it hopes to close the gender pay gap by 2020, but this is different to the issue of equal pay. The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men's and women's average earnings in an organisation. Equal pay, as defined in the Equality Act 2010, means that men and women doing the same job should receive the same salary. There have been three investigations into gender pay: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. It found the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is still being carried out and will be published ""in the not too distant future"" Arriving at the Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles, actress Emma Watson said the BBC's commitment to equal pay was ""great... but we need to see them fulfil it"".

"This video can not be played Nearly 200,000 Salvadoreans in the US who were granted Temporary Protected Status now face uncertainty Donald Trump's administration has decided to cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US. They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001. Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. The Trump administration has already removed TPS protection from tens of thousands of Haitians and Nicaraguans. Protections for Salvadoreans were set to expire on Monday, after nearly two decades of holding the humanitarian status due to the impact of the natural disaster that killed more than 1,000 people. The latest announcement comes four months after the government said it planned to scrap an Obama-era scheme, Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), that protected young undocumented immigrants, mostly Latin Americans, from deportation. Lawmakers in Congress have been given until March to decide on the fate of the 800,000 so-called Dreamers affected by the Daca decision. El Salvador country profile US sets final date for Nicaraguan immigrants' protected status Their protection will not be terminated until 9 September 2019,external""to allow for an orderly transition"", the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement announcing the decision on Monday. This video can not be played What is temporary protected status - and why is El Salvador losing it? ""The original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist,"" the agency said. ""Thus, under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be terminated."" The move will end the protected status of nearly 200,000 Salvadoreans living across America, forcing them to face possible deportation. More than 190,000 children born in the US to Salvadoreans with TPS will also be affected. While the children themselves are US citizens thanks to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on US soil, their parents will not automatically be allowed to stay and families could be broken up. Salvadoreans with TPS are established in large numbers in California, Texas and around the US capital, Washington DC. According to the Center for Migration Studies, they represent more than 135,000 households across the country, with a quarter of them home-owners: 88% part of the labour force 10% self-employed 10% married to US citizens The programme was created in 1990 and authorises immigrants from several countries to live and work in the US lawfully, regardless of whether they entered the country legally or not. It is only granted to countries affected by armed conflict, environmental disaster, or epidemics. Ten countries, making up over 300,000 US immigrants, have been granted TPS protections since it was first signed into law by President George Bush. Special protection status for 59,000 Haitians and 5,300 Nicaraguans was terminated late last year, and also takes effect in 2019. Salvadoreans are the largest group by far to receive TPS, after two earthquakes devastated communities the country in March 2001. Over the next 15 years, the programme was re-authorised by US presidents several times. Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, hailed Monday's decision as a ""long overdue move"". ""The idea that there should be a 'temporary status' that lasts for 19 years is ridiculous,"" he told BBC News. He believed the TPS law should be scrapped and replaced with a process in which Congress would have to vote to re-authorise temporary immigration protections. Demonstrations were held in Washington against Mr Trump's decision Meanwhile, Salvadoreans with the TPS status criticised the decision. ""My life is here,"" Minda HernÃ¡ndez, a 48-year-old housekeeper from Long Island who left El Salvador 20 years ago, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. ""This is where my home is, where I pay my taxes. I am happy here - even if I work myself to death."" The Salvadorean government has been lobbying the US to extend protections for people from their country living in the US. El Salvador's Foreign Minister Hugo MartÃ­nez said his government would work with the Trump administration to find a permanent solution for Salvadoreans working in the US. Money earned and sent back to families in El Salvador also makes a valuable contribution to the country's economy, the Center for American Progress says. The think tank estimates that in 2015, remittances made up more than 15% of El Salvador's GDP. Democrats in Congress have condemned the decision, with many criticising the move for ignoring the violence in El Salvador, which has one of the world's highest murder rates. ""Thousands of families will worry about being torn apart because of this callous and irrational decision,"" Washington DC Mayor Murial Bowser said. Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto said it was ""a poignant reminder that we have an anti-immigrant president who turns his back on hardworking families and insists on governing by fear and intimidation"".

Profile: James Brokenshire Reaction to Brokenshire resignation LIVE: Theresa May cabinet reshuffle Mr Brokenshire said recent health tests revealed that he has a ""small lesion"" in his right lung which needs to be removed.

The coalition led by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in fell apart whenthe late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first ministeron 9 January, 2017. Despite months of negotiations aimed at restoring power-sharing, the parties have been unable to reach a deal to return to government. In a letter to Mr Brokenshire, the prime minister wrote: ""While it is typical of you that your first thought was not for yourself, but for your duties as a cabinet minister and public servant, it is absolutely right that you should put your health first, for your sake and that of your family.""

From May 2011 to May 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office. That role included supporting Mrs May, the then home secretary, with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network. BBC News NI political correspondent Gareth Gordon As far as Theresa May was concerned, at a time of unprecedented upheaval, James Brokenshire was probably as near to a being a safe pair of hands as her current Cabinet possessed. But in Northern Ireland, as devolution collapsed around him, he was often dismissed as a ""do-nothing"" secretary of state who allowed the situation to drift when decisive action was required. For republicans and nationalists, he and his government were seen as being too close to the DUP. As far as some in the DUP were concerned, he should have already moved towards introducing direct rule in the face of what they saw as Sinn Fein intransigence. Caught between these two positions, he appeared to be impotent, but whoever replaces him will face exactly the same problems. His responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's extremism taskforce. He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the deportation of the radical cleric Abu Qatada.

"Disney has admitted ""making up"" some white actors in order for them to ""blend"" into Asian crowd scenes for its upcoming Aladdin film. The company told Newsbeat they filled background performer roles with white people ""only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control"". Extra Kaushal Odedra appears in the film and says he saw ""around 20"" other actors being made up to look Arabian. He believes Disney are ""out of touch"". Kaushal says he finally got a part in Aladdin after he kept getting rejected The 32-year-old tells us he recognised several white actors on set. ""Aladdin was the perfect time to show diversity but also be accurate,"" he added. ""They're being out of touch with what's going on around them."" Many within the industry have criticised producers for not recruiting people with Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi or Arab heritage. Actor Kal Penn respondedon Twitter,externalsaying: ""When a PR person says they decided to put 100 people in brownface in 2018 because not enough of us are qualified, that's bs, someone just didn't want to spend the $ to do it right."" ""Great care was taken to put together one of the largest, most diverse casts ever seen on screen,"" a Disney spokesman told Newsbeat. ""Diversity of our cast and background performers was a requirement and only in a handful of instances when it was a matter of specialty skills, safety and control (special effects rigs, stunt performers and handling of animals) were crew made up to blend in."" Kaushal responded: ""I can understand it if it comes to stunt people and animal handling but I think they did have a choice."" There werewhitewashing claims in July 2017after a non-Arab actor, Naomi Scott, was cast in Princess Jasmine's role in the film. Scott, who's of British and Indian heritage, will star alongside Egyptian-Canadian actor Mena Massoud as Aladdin. Mena recently posted on Instagram urging people to watch the original Disney animation of Aladdin, saying he was just one years old when it was released 25 years ago.,external Filmmakers were also criticised in September 2017 forcontroversially introducing a white charactercalled Prince Anders, played by Billy Magnussen. There are no white characters in the original Middle Eastern folk story, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp from The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. Billy Magnussen will play Prince Anders who didn't appear in the 1992 animated version of Aladdin It's not the first time a production has been criticised for choosing white cast members to play Asian or black characters. Sky dropped a series that had Joseph Fiennes starring as Michael Jackson. British actor Ed Skreinpulled out of a rolein the Hellboy reboot last year after a backlash because he was cast as a character of Asian heritage.

"Catriona Ogilvy spent the first months of her maternity leave at a neonatal ward hospital after her son, Samuel, was born 10 weeks early A council is giving extra leave to staff members who have premature babies needing hospital treatment. Employees at Waltham Forest Council are entitled to an extra week of leave for every week their premature baby spends in hospital before their due date. Campaigners hope the scheme will put pressure on ministers to change maternity and paternity leave laws. The government said the UK's maternity leave system was already one of the ""most generous in the world"". The council believes it is the first employer in the UK to introduce such a policy. When babies are born prematurely,parental leave starts the day after the birth,external. Catriona Ogilvy spent the first months of her maternity leave at a neonatal ward hospital after her son, Samuel, was born 10 weeks early. She said: ""Mothers like me lose precious time to bond and experience higher levels of mental health difficulties following the trauma of neonatal intensive care. ""They need more time once their baby finally comes home before going back to work"". Mrs Ogilvy, who has since founded the charityThe Smallest Things,external, said Waltham Forest Council's ""brilliant"" policy was beneficial for the employer, parents and babies alike. The council said up to 14 of the 109 employees currently on maternity or paternity leave would have been eligible for extra time off under the new rules. Waltham Forest councillorClyde Loakes told the BBC's Woman's Hour: ""We just want to give that extra bit of comfort and let that extra bit of stress out of what is a very difficult time for both fathers and mothers."" Parents of premature babies like Samuel start their leave the day after the birth However, Mrs Ogilvy said there were thousands more families whose employers will not be so flexible. She wants the law to be changed so that leave begins on the baby's due date. Her petition has more than 140,000 signatures. Mrs Ogilvy's local MP debated the issue in Parliament in 2016but the second reading of his proposed bill was cancelled. A spokesman from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK's maternity system is one of the most generous in the world.

"Munir Mohammed and Rowaida El-Hassan met on an online dating site A man and woman have been found guilty of plotting a ""devastating"" terror attack in the UK using a homemade bomb. Food factory worker Munir Mohammed, 36, from Derby, and pharmacist Rowaida El-Hassan, 33, from north-west London, also exchanged messages about ricin. The Old Bailey heard asylum seeker Mohammed signed up for a ""new job in the UK"", while messaging an IS commander via Facebook. He used El-Hassan's chemical knowledge after theymet on a dating website. Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the couple were ""clearly attracted to each other through their support for Daesh's [IS's] violent ideology and its intolerance of those who do not subscribe to its views"". ""They planned to kill and injure innocent people in the UK and had the mind-set, the methodology and almost all the material needed for Mohammed to carry out an attack,"" she said. ""Both will be in prison, where they cannot plot together and will no longer be a danger to the public."" A bottle of hydrogen peroxide, which Mohammed believed was needed to make a bomb, was found in a wardrobe at his home At the time of his arrest in December 2016, Mohammed had two of the three components needed for TATP explosives, as well as manuals on how to make explosives, mobile phone detonators as well as the deadly poison ricin. The trial heard Mohammed, originally from Eritrea, who lived in Sudan for some time before coming to the UK, investigated making poison while working at a supermarket ready meals factory. The court was also told that he was using sophisticated false documents to access services and work in the UK illegally. Derby terror plot: The illegal worker and his lover Judge Michael Topolski QC remanded the pair in custody and warned them they faced jail when they are sentenced on 22 February. The pair both denied the charges, but a jury found them guilty of the plot The judge told Mohammed: ""You have been convicted of planning a potentially devastating terrorist attack by creating an explosive device and deploying it somewhere in the UK targeting those you regarded as enemies of the Islamic State. ""Rowaida El-Hassan, you share the extremist mindset with Munir Mohammed and you were ideologically motivated to provide him with support, motivation and assistance. ""You knew he was engaging and planning an attack. You knew he was planning an explosion to kill and maim innocent people in the cause of Islamic State."" Mohammed, of Leopold Street, Derby, was unanimously convicted of preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016. His co-accused El-Hassan, of Willesden Lane, north-west London, was convicted of the same charge by a majority of 10 to one jurors. The court was shown footage of Mohammed visiting an Asda store near his home in Derby where he allegedly tried to buy ingredients for a homemade bomb Munir Mohammed was trying to make a pressure-cooker bomb, like the device used at the Boston Marathon, detectives told me. They were also concerned that he posed a threat to the factory where he was making supermarket ready meals. In his bedroom, the police found bomb-making instructions and two of the three chemicals needed for a high-explosive called TATP. Derby's police commander, Ch Supt Jim Allen, said Derby was ""clearly on the sharp end of a very serious plot that presented a very real risk to very many people"". ""We don't know where his target was, but we have to be alarmed that he was so close to the centre of our city,"" he said. ""We arrested him within a few hundred metres of a large crowded shopping centre and we know that terrorists are attracted to that kind of location to do the most damage to create the most impact, and I can't rule that out."" Mohammed worked in Burton in Staffordshire in a job making sauces for ready meals sold in Tesco and Morrisons. Counter-terrorism officers discovered that he had been researching and trying to source the poison ricin, and he had pledged allegiance to an IS commander, called Abubakr Kurdi, who called for poison attacks on food. Det Ch Insp Paul Greenwood, who led the investigation, said officers did not believe Mohammed had selected a definite target by the time he was arrested but was awaiting orders from Islamic State. The officer said Mohammed was ""an extremely dangerous terrorist"". Mr Greenwood added: ""Had he not been arrested when he was - which was on 12 December 2016, at a time when he'd already started to acquire chemicals, already started to look at pressure cookers, on the delivery mechanism for an attack and was already in conversation with Islamic States operatives - I think he was very close to mounting some sort of attack. ""And that could well have occurred before Christmas 2016 and I think that attack would have involved the loss of life and multiple injuries had Mohammed had his way.""

"For more than 50 years, Lale Sokolov lived with a secret - one born in the horrors of wartime Europe, in a place that witnessed some of the worst of man's inhumanity to man. It would not be shared until he was in his 80s, thousands of miles from that place. Lale had been the Tattooist of Auschwitz. Living out his life in a suburb of Melbourne, the man who had been born Ludwig ""Lale"" Eisenberg to Jewish parents in Slovakia in 1916 decided to share his story. ""This man, the tattooist from the most infamous concentration camp, kept his secret safe in the mistaken belief that he had something to hide,"" says Heather Morris, who spent three years recording Lale's story before he died in 2006. She has now written a book - The Tattooist of Auschwitz - based on how he tattooed a serial number on the arms of those at the camp who weren't sent to the gas chambers. ""The horrors of surviving nearly three years in a concentration camp left him with a lifetime of fear and paranoia,"" she says. ""The story took three years to untangle. I had to earn his trust and it took time before he was willing to embark on the deep self-scrutiny that parts of his story required."" He feared that he would be viewed as a Nazi collaborator. Keeping the secret, or what he described as a burden of guilt, would protect his family, he thought. It was only after his wife Gita died that he ""unburdened"" himself, revealing a tale not only of survival but of deep love. In April 1942, aged 26, Lale was taken to Auschwitz, the Nazis' biggest death camp. When the Nazis came to his hometown, Lale had offered himself as a strong, able-bodied young man in the hope that it would save the rest of his family from being split up. Unlike his siblings, he was unemployed and unmarried. At that time, he did not know of the horrors that went on at the camp in occupied south-west Poland. On arrival, the Nazis exchanged his name for a number: 32407. Prisoner number 32407 was set to work like many others, constructing new housing blocks as the camp expanded. Read more on the Holocaust: The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed Is this Switzerland's Schindler? The twins of Auschwitz He spent hours working on the rooftops, keeping a low profile from the SS guards and their unpredictable tempers. But shortly after he arrived at Auschwitz, Lale contracted typhoid. He was cared for by the man who had given him his identification tattoo, a French academic named Pepan. Pepan took Lale under his wing and set him to work as his assistant. He taught him not only the trade, but how to keep his head down and his mouth shut. Tattooed arms of Auschwitz prisoners Then one day Pepan disappeared, shipped out. Lale would never find out what happened to him. Partly because of his skills with languages - he knew Slovakian, German, Russian, French, Hungarian and a bit of Polish - Lale was made the main tattooist, the tetovierer, of the death camp. He was given a bag full of tattooing supplies and a paper bearing the words: Politische Abteilung. Lale now worked for the Political Wing of the SS. An officer was assigned to monitor him, which gave him a semblance of protection. Aerial view of Auschwitz in World War Two As the tetovierer, Lale lived a step further away from death than the other prisoners. He ate in an administration building. He was given extra rations. He slept in a single room. When his work was done, or when there were no new prisoners to tattoo, he was allowed free time. ""He never, ever saw himself as being a collaborator,"" Morris says. It was a real concern after the war - many saw the prisoners who worked for the SS at the camps as having taken part in their brutality. ""He did what he did to survive. He said he wasn't told he could have this job or that job,'' says Morris. ""He said you took whatever was being offered. You took it and you were grateful because it meant that you might wake up the next morning."" Despite his privileges, the threat of not waking up the next day was ever present. Josef Mengele (left) with other senior Nazi officers ""[Josef] Mengele, in particular, was a common sight as he chose his 'patients' from the new arrivals, sending them Lale's way,"" Morris wrote. ""On many occasions while whistling an operatic tune, he would sidle up to Lale and loudly terrorise him: 'One day, tetovierer, I will take you - one day.'"" Child prisoners at Auschwitz - photographed on orders of Josef Mengele For the next two years, Lale would tattoo hundreds of thousands of prisoners, with the help of assistants. These forced tattoos, the numbers shaky and stark against pale forearms, have become one of the most recognisable symbols of the Holocaust and its deadliest camp. Only prisoners at Auschwitz and its sub-camps, Birkenau and Monowitz, were tattooed. The practice began in autumn 1941 and by the spring of 1943, all prisoners were tattooed. Children of Auschwitz show their tattooed arms At first, a metal stamp was used to imprint the entire number into the skin. Ink was rubbed into the wound. When this method proved inefficient, the SS introduced a twin-needle device. This is the tool Lale used during his time as tattooist. When prisoners arrived at Auschwitz, they were selected either for forced labour or immediate execution. Their heads were shaved, their belongings taken. Arrival of prisoners at Auschwitz Women prisoners at Auschwitz deemed ""fit for work"", 1944 They exchanged their clothes for rags, and then lined up to receive their mark from the tetovierer. The only exceptions to this branding were the ""re-education"" prisoners of German ethnic origin and those sent directly to the gas chambers. It was the final peg in the brutal ""registration"" process, says Dr Piotr Setkiewicz, head of the research centre at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum. ""It was one thing in a series of humiliating, dehumanising things that happened on arrival to the camp. ""First it was painful, and second they understood at this moment they were losing their names. From this time on, the prisoners did not use officially their names. They had to use their numbers."" It's July 1942 and Lale is handed another piece of paper. In front of him are five digits: 3 4 9 0 2. Tattooing men is one thing, but when he holds the thin arm of a young girl in his hands, he feels horrified. He has not yet been made the tetovierer. Pepan urges him to do as he's told. If he doesn't, he will condemn himself to death. There is something about this girl and her bright eyes. Years later, Lale will tell Morris how in that moment, as he tattooed her number on her left arm, she tattooed her number in his heart. He learned that her name was Gita - she was in the women's camp, Birkenau. With the help of Lale's personal SS guard, he would smuggle letters to her. Letters led to secretive visits outside her block. He tried to take care of her, sneaking her his extra rations, even getting her moved to a better work station. He tried to give her hope. ""Gita, she had her doubts, very strong doubts,"" Morris says. ""She didn't see a future. He always, deep down, knew that he was going to survive. He didn't know how, but it comes back to that whole notion of being a survivor. He's a survivor because of luck, being in the right place at the right time, and being able to manipulate opportunities that he saw."" Knowing he was one of the lucky ones, Lale tried to help as many fellow prisoners as he could in his capacity as tetovierer. Food was the currency of Auschwitz, and he used his privileged rations to feed his former blockmates, Gita's friends, and the Roma families that arrived later on. He began trading jewels and money - given to him by other prisoners - with the villagers who worked near the camp to obtain more food and provisions for the most needy. Women at Auschwitz shortly after liberation by Soviet forces, 1945 In 1945, the Nazis began shipping prisoners out of the death camp before the Russians arrived. Gita was one of the women selected to leave Auschwitz. The woman he had fallen in love with was gone. Lale knew only her name - Gita Fuhrmannova - but not where she had come from. Lale eventually also left the camp and made his way back to his hometown of Krompachy in Czechoslovakia. He paid his way with the jewels he'd managed to steal from the Nazis. His sister Goldie had survived and so his childhood house still belonged to his family. The only thing left was to find out what happened to Gita. Could he dare to hope that he would ever find her again? Jewish families heading from Czechoslovakia towards US-controlled zones in Austria in 1946 In a horse and cart, he set off for Bratislava, the entry point for many survivors returning home to Czechoslovakia. Lale waited at the railway station for weeks, until the stationmaster advised him to go to the Red Cross instead. On his way there, a young woman stepped into the street in front of his horse. It was a familiar face. A pair of bright eyes. Gita had found him. Lale and Gita Sokolov, 1940s The couple married in October 1945 and changed their last name to Sokolov to better fit into Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. Lale set up a textile shop that was successful for a time. But they had been collecting and sending money out of the country to support the movement for an Israeli state. When the government discovered this, Lale was imprisoned and his business nationalised. It was while on weekend leave that he and Gita made their escape from Czechoslovakia. They went first to Vienna, then Paris, and finally, in an effort to get as far away from Europe as they could, set sail for Sydney. During the journey, they met a couple from Melbourne and were convinced to start a new life there. Lale started a textile business again, and Gita began designing dresses. In 1961, they had a son, Gary. Family snaps of Lale and Gita Sokolov - including their young son, Gary Melbourne in 1955 Lale and Gita lived out the rest of their lives in Melbourne. Gita visited Europe a few times before she died in 2003. Lale, on the other hand, never returned. Only close friends knew of the couple's love story. Photo of Gita and Lale Sokolov before Gita's death in 2003 ""I met several of his friends who all would immediately want to tell me, 'You know he and Gita met in Auschwitz? Who falls in love in a concentration camp?'"" Morris says. Even Gary would not know the full extent of the horrors his parents endured until years later. In fact, the full truth came to light only after Gita's death, when Morris came into the picture. ""I didn't find the idea - the idea found me,"" Morris says. Gary was searching for someone to tell his father's story and found Morris through a network of friends. Morris is not Jewish and that, she says, is why Lale - who was then 87 - chose to share his story with her. ""I questioned him about that straight up,"" Morris says. ""To him it was important that I had no baggage. He needed somebody who was perhaps naive, and who would hear his story and accept his story for how he was going to tell it. ""To him, it was all about looking into those eyes of that 18-year-old girl,"" Morris says. Lale Sokolov with writer Heather Morris Over the next three years, Morris would visit Lale several times a week. Most of what he remembered matched her own research. In addition to Lale and Gita's love story, the Tattooist of Auschwitz, the book Morris has written, brings to light a new piece of Holocaust history. The process of corroborating the anecdotes Morris gathered from Lale was key. Initially the novel was meant to be a screenplay. As a result, Film Victoria, the Australian government's film body, agreed to fund international research for the project. ""We had researchers out of the country, professional researchers who then went and examined and found the documents - found amazing documents to verify what he said,"" Morris says. Those documents led to the discovery that Lale's parents had been killed at Auschwitz a month before he arrived. Lale died in 2006, before he learned what happened to his parents. Regarding other documents, one was discovered with Lale's name and number in a list with other prisoners. ""The top of the document says Politische Abt - Aufnhmershreiber, Pramienauszahlung vom 26.7.44, which translates to - Political Wing Admittance Writer,"" Morris says. The document did not list specific jobs, but Morris and the research team ""considered it enough proof he was working for the Political Wing."" Cedric Geffen, president of Holocaust-memorial organisation March of the Living Australia, says he was ""fascinated"" by Lale's story. ""I had not given much thought to the question of the identity of the tattooist and whether or not they had been prisoners whom the Nazis forced into doing this unthinkable task,"" he says. ""I personally had not really reflected at length or in depth about the many questions around this role and the ramifications for the tattooist."" For Geffen, telling this story helps younger generations, those who never lived through these horrors, forge connections with history. ""It breaks it down into tangible emotions and experiences that undoubtedly accompanied each and every person that went through this period, most of whom did not live to tell their story,"" Geffen says. ""It is important to tell this story as it humanises a role that very few people think about when thinking about this horrific period,"" he adds. ""Who was the person tasked with inflicting this horrendous physical degradation? Why did he do it? What was his life like? Whatever happened to him?""

"Barry McElduff is the Sinn FÃ©in MP for West Tyrone Sinn FÃ©in has described a controversial video posted by one of its MPs and said to mock IRA victims as ""inexcusable"" and ""indefensible"". Declan Kearney expressed the party's ""deep regret"" over the ""huge offence"" caused by Barry McElduff's post. The video, posted on Twitter on Friday, showed the MP with a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head on the anniversary of the Kingsmills massacre. Ten Protestants were murdered by the IRA in the massacre on 5 January 1976. Mr McElduff has apologised and said he did not realise there could be a possible link between the bread brand and the anniversary. Survivor says McElduff video 'depraved' Sinn FÃ©in MP apologises over Kingsmill tweet Party colleague MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir has also apologised for retweeting the video. He said he saw the tweet as being ""wholly apolitical and retweeted it on that basis"". MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir said he retweeted the video as he believed it was ""wholly apolitical"" ""Once it was pointed out that the tweet had offended and hurt people and that Barry had rightly deleted his tweet, I retweeted his apology and, of course, apologise unreservedly for the pain and hurt caused by my retweet,"" he said. Mr McElduff is meeting Sinn FÃ©in leaders on Monday. Mr Kearney said the meeting would be an opportunity for the party leadership to record its ""very serious disapproval"" of the situation and discuss the ""serious fall-out"". In the original Twitter post, Mr McElduff said he was in a service station, then, mentioning the name of the shop, asked where they kept their bread while balancing a loaf on his head. The well-known brand of bread shares a very similar name with the south Armagh village that witnessed one of the most notorious incidents of the Troubles, when gunmen stopped a van carrying textile workers on their way home, identified the Protestant occupants, lined them up at the side of the road and shot them. Ulster Unionist Danny Kennedy told BBC Radio Ulster it had been a ""grim"" weekend for those affected by the massacre. He said the anniversary was a time of ""raw emotion"" and that hurt had been compounded by Mr McElduff and Mr Ã Muilleoir. He rejected the idea that the choice of bread was a coincidence and said Mr McElduff's apology was neither ""genuine or sincere"". ""Of the thousands of items in the shop, he chose bread,"" he said. ""Of all the bread brands, he chose Kingsmill and of all the days to do it, it was the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmills massacre. How sick is that?"" The victims of the Kingsmills massacre ranged in age from 19 to 58 Democratic Unionist Party MP Emma Little-Pengelly said she had been contacted by people from all sections of the community who wanted to express their disgust. ""The view is that he was giving a nod to people who want to make a mockery of victims,"" she said. ""Even if it was unintentional, when it was pointed out to him that people were being hurt by it, he should have taken it down immediately. ""He only took it down much much later after being contacted by a newspaper."" She said there had been no detailed explanation for the ""bizarre video"" from Mr McElduff, who has a history of putting items on his  head and posting the pictures on social media. There was a wider issue of rights and respect, she added, and said it was ""appalling"" that no senior Sinn FÃ©in figure had spoken out over the weekend. The only survivor of the Kingsmills massacre has said he believed the video was ""depraved"" and ""designed to hurt"". Alan Black, who survived despite being shot 18 times, said he did not accept Mr McElduff's apology. ""It was like a punch to the stomach, it was so callous. To mock the dead and dance on their graves is depraved,"" he said. ""He just wanted to hurt the Kingsmills families, but it's hurt a lot of people across the north of Ireland. He had to backtrack and give a half apology."" Mr McElduff has offered to meet families of the victims, but Mr Black said he was not interested in this. ""Absolutely not. I steer clear of bigots no matter where they come from,"" he said. Colin Worton, whose brother Kenneth was one of those murdered, said Mr McElduff's apology was not ""heartfelt"". Ten Protestant workmen were murdered in the 1976 Kingsmills massacre ""He's not sorry for the video that he's posted, he's sorrier for what's happened in the aftermath,"" he said. ""If there's any decency left in McElduff's DNA, he should resign."" The police have said they have received ""a number of reports of a post on a social media platform, made by a local public representative. Enquiries are ongoing.""

"Perry Coppins works as a security officer on board ships A British man detained in Dubai who claimed he was being denied treatment for prostate cancer has been freed, according to a campaign group. Perry Coppins, 61, was stopped by customs officials in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 1 November for having""too many pills"" on him. He said he was carrying legal anti-anxiety medication and prescription documents for a six-month ship voyage. Detained in Dubai (DiD) said charges against him have now been dropped. Mr Coppins told the BBC that he was ""exhausted"" following the ""tough"" experience. ""I can't wait to get on that plane,"" he said. ""I am furious about my treatment here. It has just been too much."" Live updates and more from the East Midlands The maritime security officer, from Eastwood in Nottinghamshire, was due to complete six months' work on a ship. He said he was carrying a supply of Temazepam, Clonazepam and Citalopram to last for the duration of the posting. The drugs are legal in the UAE when carried with prescription documentation, but despite having the papers he was jailed for five weeks. Dubai attracts global businesses but some visitors fall foul of its laws Mr Coppins was diagnosed with prostate cancer following his arrest and was denied medical treatment while in custody, DiD said. Despite being due to face trial on 15 January, DiD said his passport has now been returned and the charges against him dropped. The group's chief executive Radha Stirling welcomed the decision, and said it was ""a misjudgement"" that turned into a ""life-threatening situation"" for Mr Coppins. The campaigners said Mr Coppins was ""cash-strapped"" after spending his savings on legal expenses.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Exclusive first look at Byton's concept car A new car designed by former BMW and Apple employees has been unveiled. The Byton - which sports a huge touchscreen dashboard - reimagines what it feels like to be inside a car. While on paper the electric vehicle doesn't quite match Tesla on performance or price, the firm behind it told the BBC it hoped people in future would care more about ""digital power"" than horsepower. But experts say it currently lacks the charging infrastructure it requires. The name Byton refers to the phrase Bytes on Wheels. ""We want to be the company bringing into the market the first real smart car,"" said Carsten Breitfeld, its chief executive. The car features a huge dashboard screen Ahead of the concept vehicle's official launch at the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas, Byton gave the BBC an exclusive look at the technology. It was being kept in an unmarked warehouse just off the city's famous strip, hidden from spying eyes behind a black curtain. More from CES 2018:,external Bodybuilding in the virtual reality gym App uses saliva to recommend what to eat Preview of CES's coolest new tech The house that hears burglars The company refers to the car's interior as being a ""digital lounge"" The company is bankrolled with money from China, and believes it has the development know-how to overcome the hurdles that see most new car companies fail. To solve perhaps its biggest problem, Byton will need to strike a deal with Tesla's Elon Musk. ""What we want to try to do is merge your life outside of the car with your experience inside the car,"" explained Jeff Chung, head of Byton's Intelligent Car Experience division. In front of us is a huge display that stretches out across almost the entire dashboard. During the day it is bright white, but at night it inverts to be less distracting. The dashboard can be controlled with hand gestures or touch The screen is part of what Mr Chung, formerly of Apple's Mac team, calls the ""digital lounge"". It can be controlled using touch, voice and Minority Report-esque gestures. A tablet computer is situated in the middle of the steering wheel, while an extra screen can be found on the back of each front seat. The main display can show any number of things - video clips, calendars, mapping, health data and so on. As you sit in the car, internal cameras will determine who you are and load your profile, adjusting the driving seat position and other customisations. When in full self-driving mode, or stationary, the front seats can turn towards each other for an apparently more comfortable and sociable position - opening up the middle of the car so that those in the back can see the large display. It's the most sophisticated interface I've seen in a car. But I put it to Mr Chung that taking your hand off the wheel to wiggle your fingers about in mid-air might be extremely distracting while driving. ""I actually agree,"" he said. ""[But] all features of the car will be accessible via touch. And so you'll have the ability on the driver's tablet to make all the selections that you do with gestures. There are touchsreens in the steering wheel and back of the front seats ""After you buy the car, we might actually pare down the gestures as people aren't very accustomed to it. ""We would never want to force any driver to do gestures to control specific features. Having the ability to customise is the key."" Fearful of the car being spotted and posted on social media, my test ride was limited to a small area of the warehouse. It means I can't speak first-hand to the car's performance - but according to Byton's own figures, it will do 0-60mph (0-97km/h) in about five seconds. That makes the $45,000 (Â£33,187) Byton slower than Tesla's $35,000 Model 3. Indeed, on most performance benchmarks, Byton's car is less impressive. But Mr Breitfeld thinks to dwell on that would be missing the point. Just like our smartphones, he suggested the majority of consumers would base their purchase on which option has the best software rather than speed specs. The car is kitted out with the sensors it needs to deliver ""level 4"" autonomy - the level at which a driver can safely - in theory - go to sleep at the wheel. The car is scheduled to go into production in 2019 That won't come for a few years, so at first the car will only offer ""level 3"", meaning it can drive itself, but drivers must stay alert and ready to retake control at all times. Last year, Faraday Future unveiledits production car, the FF91, with huge fanfare and a pledge to get started on building it as soon as possible. Since then, it has cancelled plans to build a huge factory in Nevada, and its chief backer - LeEco's Jia Yueting -has been embroiled in money problemsthat have seen his assets seized in China. Faraday Future followed a pattern of brazen new car companies finding it incredibly difficult to make their concept cars a reality. This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC was given a test ride of Faraday Future's FF91 last year Even Tesla has struggled to manufacture its Model 3 car quickly enough to meet demand, frustrating investors who feel it is a make-or-break product. Mr Breitfeld told the BBC he felt Byton was protected from such pitfalls. ""I spent 20 years at BMW, responsible for the i8 programme,"" he said. ""I built this company right from the first day in a way that we have the people on board who know how to industrialise a car, which is a huge job. ""We've started the construction of our plant in Nanjing, China. We are well underway."" Unlike Faraday Future, the company is not relying on one major investor with ""too much control"". Among its investors is Chinese internet giant, Tencent. But one obvious challenge that might stump Byton is a lack of fast-charging stations. While Tesla offers its customers some 8,496 superchargers around the world, Byton has zero. Mr Breitfeld said he expects Tesla would be happy - or be forced - to share its stations. Byton hopes to share access to Tesla's superchargers ""We have to come together and share this infrastructure across the companies,"" he said. ""This is not a differentiating factor. This is something which makes the whole industry successful."" Tesla did not respond to the BBC's request for comment - and Mr Breitfeld would not say whether discussions had taken place between the companies. ""It seems highly unlikely that Tesla will want to share the infrastructure they've worked so hard to build with a rival - unless there's some kind of altruistic view that it's for the greater good,"" commented Ben Wood, an analyst at the consultancy CCS Insight. ""It underlines the challenges of electric vehicles. Building the cars is relatively simple these days, but you need everything that goes around it. Charging infrastructure, more than anything, is the challenge."" That said, Tesla has appeared to be open to sharing its chargers in the past. In 2014, Mr Musk told British gadget site Pocket-lint that it would accommodate competitors, but they had to pay a reasonable share of the costs. Byton intends to launch its car in China ahead of it going on sale in the US and Europe ""The intent of the supercharger network is not to create a walled garden,"" Mr Musk said. ""Any other manufacturer that's interested in using them, we'd be happy to accommodate. They'd need to contribute to the capital costs proportional to their fleet's usage of the network."" For Mr Breitfeld, it's an inevitability. Just as motorists don't have different petrol stations for different car brands - so electric charging stations must work in a similar manner, he said.

"Black Box believes virtual reality will help make gym exercise more ""addictive"" Start-up Black Box VR has developed a full-body workout in the form of a 30-minute virtual reality experience. It uses a bespoke resistance training machine and an HTC Vive headset. The entire set-up is about the size of a family bathroom. It is one of several innovations at the CES tech show in Las Vegas to propose mixing VR and fitness training. But one expert said the firm would need to address safety concerns for the idea to be a success. The Idaho-based firm's solution involves participants entering a virtual arena, where they compete against an avatar and, eventually, one another. The firm's founders, Ryan DeLuca and Preston Lewis, were also behind the successful fitness empire bodybuilding.com. Black Box VR's business plan is to open boutique gyms across the US, in which each member will enter their own ""black box"" space for the gamified work-out, which will track their progress. More from CES 2018:,external Preview of CES's coolest new tech Can your saliva affect the way you shop? Psion's digital assistant gets Android makeover Electric VR suit shocks gamers An at-home version of the equipment could be developed in the future, the firm said. ""Most people stop going [to the gym] after a couple of weeks so adherence is something that's a critical factor of what we're trying to solve,"" general manager Jim Bradbury told the BBC. Black Box VR says its use of a dynamic resistance gym kit creates an immersive experience as users do not need to make manual adjustments One VR-industry watcher said the idea had potential, but had concerns. ""Human beings in general find it hard to retain the habit of exercise and there's been many attempts to try and make it more appealing - so, VR makes sense from the perspective of trying to make the gym less boring,"" said J P Gownder from the consultancy Forrester. ""But the cost of the equipment is going to make it an expensive get-up. ""And will it be safe enough for people to use? ""I'm not aware of the Vive having been stress-tested for this kind of use, and [Black Box VR] is going to need to prove that it has taken account of impact on the body of using the headset during strenuous exercise."" Job Stauffer, a games developer who now works with the VR Health Institute - who is helping Black Box VR with promotional activities at CES - says he has personally benefited from virtual reality. He told the BBC he had lost more than 82lb (37kg) playing such games in addition to improving his diet. ""Late in 2016, I was probably the unhealthiest I'd ever been in my life, well over 300 pounds,"" he said. ""And I started playing games on HTC Vive and Oculus and I started to notice that wow, like I'm sweating I'm getting the best workout I've ever had."" The VR controllers are designed to be ""hands-free"" to let users grip gym equipment Mr Stauffer said he started by playing the indie game Sound Boxing, which he described as ""Guitar Hero for the arms"". He said he then moved onto Space Pirate Trainer, which he compared with using an elliptical machine - or cross-trainer - in terms of calories burned. The VR Health Institute is now developing a Pan European Game Information (Pegi)-style rating system for games to grade them according to their activity level, he added. ""A lot of people in the games business work an incredible amount of hours and often don't get the time that they need to take care of themselves,"" he said. ""At the same time playing games is a sedentary experience but VR changes all of that - that room-scale experiences are engaging your body in full."" Virtual reality and fitness is a small but growing market. At last year's CES a firm called Icaros showed off a cradle that simulated flight while giving users a work out asthey planked their way across a mountain range. At this year's event a Czech start-up, Sense Arena, is promoting the use of VR to train athletes to play ice hockey, basketball and football. It suggests the tech could ultimately lead tofewer injuries during matches,external. Meanwhile at the VR Fit gym in Columbus, Ohio, members can already work out with a virtual reality personal trainer for $60 (Â£44) per session. In my two-minute demonstration, I chest-pressed my way to victory in front of a crowd in a huge virtual arena, punching out bowling balls of fire and, inexplicably, large green birds as I pulled the machine, with more resistance piling on at every repetition. I was rewarded with a virtual sweat band in a prize box and aching biceps for the rest of the afternoon. There was no noticeable latency between my action and the action I saw in VR, and the graphics, while a bit strange, were immersive. It certainly beat watching rolling news programmes in the gym with the sound down. The demo appears to have been designed with male testers in mind - the reps were heavy, and the only available profile to compete against was a macho avatar called Razer wearing green armour. But the firm was at pains to point out to me that ultimately people could compete against each other, and that other computer-based avatars would also be developed. Of course the concept of getting fit while playing a game is as old as sport itself, and Black Box has been developed by people who are already very motivated by fitness. After my brief experience I couldn't say whether it would hold my attention in the long run. But on the other hand, neither has my gym membership.

"This video can not be played Huge plumes of smoke were seen rising from the tanker There are fears of an environmental disaster in the East China Sea as a tanker continues leaking oil two days after colliding with a cargo ship. Chinese officials have told state media the Sanchi is in danger of exploding and sinking. Rescuers trying to reach the burning tanker were beaten back by toxic clouds, the transport ministry says. The body of one crewman, among the 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis on board, has been found. The rest are missing. The spill Shetland survived,external Torrey Canyon: The day the sea turned black Is crude oil killing Nigeria's children? Exposure to oil sends birds off course The Panama-flagged Sanchi was bringing its cargo of oil from Iran to South Korea when it collided with the Hong Kong-registered freighter CF Crystal, carrying grain from the US, in the East China Sea. The incident occurred about 260km (160 miles) off the coast of Shanghai. The collision, in the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta, occurred on Saturday evening. The exact cause of the collision is not yet known. The tanker, run by Iran's leading oil shipping operator, has on board 136,000 tonnes of condensate, which is an ultra-light version of crude oil. That is about one million barrels and at current prices is worth roughly $60m (Â£44m). The Sanchi will also be carrying a certain amount of heavy - and toxic - shipping fuel. Condensate is very different from the black crude that is often seen in oil spills. It exists in gas form within high-pressure oil reservoirs and liquefies once extracted. It is highly toxic, low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude oil. Condensate, which does not need the heavy refining process of denser crude, creates products such as jet fuel, petrol, diesel and heating fuel. Condensate is certainly toxic. It is much lighter in colour and odour than heavy crudes, potentially making it a lot harder to detect and contain. Simon Boxall, of the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton, told the BBC there was another difference: ""It's not like crude, which does break down under natural microbial action; this stuff actually kills the microbes that break the oil down."" It cannot be picked off the surface like heavy crude. Dr Boxall said the best hope was to put out the fire and stop the ship from sinking. ""If she sinks with a lot of cargo intact, then you have a time bomb on the sea bed which will slowly release the condensate."" He added: ""There could be a long-term exclusion of fishing for many hundreds of kilometres in this area."" The Sanchi was still ablaze on Monday morning. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said weather conditions were ""not that favourable for search and rescue work"". A Chinese fire-fighting vessel tackles the blaze on the Sanchi There are no signs of survivors among the 32-strong crew, although the 21 Chinese nationals on the grain freighter were rescued. China has sent several ships to carry out search-and-rescue operations, while South Korea helped with a coast guard ship and a helicopter. The US Navy also sent a military aircraft to help with the rescue efforts. It is impossible to say at this point because it is unknown how much oil has been, or will be, spilled. The Sanchi's one million barrels is about 35 million gallons. Even if all of it spilled, it would be less than the major ship disasters listed below, but more than three times the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, which is considered one of the world's worst environmental disasters. So, how much the spill affects the environment depends on the location where it occurred. The Atlantic Empress incident listed below - the record spill from ships - saw little oil reach coastlines. Cleaning up after the Torrey Canyon disaster in 1967 There are also a lot of different types of spill. Arguably the worst was the deliberate release of up to 500 million gallons by the Iraqis in January 1991 during the Gulf War. The resultant slick covered some 10,300 sq km (4,000 sq miles). As far as ships are concerned: The Atlantic Empress and Aegean Captain collided off Trinidad and Tobago in 1979. The Atlantic Empress exploded and 26 crew members died. The 90 million gallon oil spill is a record from ships The ABT Summer exploded off Angola in 1991, spilling about 80 million gallons over 200 sq km The Castillo de Bellver caught fire and broke apart off Cape Town, spilling 78 million gallons The Amoco Cadiz spilled almost 69 million gallons after running aground off Brittany in France in 1978 The Torrey Canyon hit a reef off Cornwall, England, in 1967, spilling 36 million gallons of crude and affecting almost 200 miles of coastline The Exxon Valdez only spilled 11 million gallons in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989 but was a major environmental disaster Dozens missing as ships collide off China Women on mission to 'clean up oceans' Oil spill threatens popular Athens beaches At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Craig McLachlan has been accused of sexual misconduct during a Rocky Horror Show production Australian actor Craig McLachlan has denied allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by three women. The accusations against McLachlan, 52, concern his time performing in a 2014 production of the Rocky Horror Show. Three cast members accused the former Neighbours actor of inappropriate touching and harassment. McLachlan stepped down from the Rocky Horror Show's current Australian run on Monday, but rejected the allegations as ""entirely false"". ""Frankly, they seem to be simple inventions, perhaps made for financial reasons, perhaps to gain notoriety,""he wrote in response to allegations published by the Australian Broadcasting Corp,external. The actresses, Christie Whelan Browne, Erika Heynatz and Angela Scundi, said they had come forward to protect other cast members. McLachlan had been reprising his role as Dr Frank N. Furter in Adelaide. The allegations, also published by Fairfax Media on Monday,external, include that McLachlan pulled aside Whelan Browne's underwear during a performance and kissed her buttock. ""I think people who know him know that he's very generous, warm, funny... I saw a very different side come out in him which was terrifying,"" she told the ABC. Christie Whelan Brown (L) says she wants to help create a safer working culture Heynatz, who played Magenta, said she was forcibly kissed by the actor, while Scundi, a chorus member, said she was the subject of unwanted sexual advances. Two actresses raised concerns with the show's senior producers but no action was taken, the reports said. Police told the BBC they were ""investigating allegations of sexual offences dating back to 2014"", but would not give further details. In a statement on Monday, the musical's production company said it was ""shocked"" to learn of the accusations. ""In response, we have spoken to Craig and have mutually agreed that it is not appropriate for him to continue in the current production of the show,"" Gordon Frost Organisation said in a statement. It said it would co-operate with authorities and conduct and internal investigation. McLachlan is a veteran of the Australian entertainment industry, having won Australia's top television award - the Gold Logie - and starred in programmes including Home and Away and the Doctor Blake Mysteries.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons. Powerful speeches about Hollywood's sexual abuse scandal have dominated the 75th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first major Hollywood awards ceremony since the film industry was hit by sexual harassment scandals, with stars wearing black to honour victims. Oprah Winfrey summed up the mood, saying ""a new day is on the horizon"" as she collected an honorary award. The big film winner of the night was Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which took home four awards. In pictures: Stars wear black on red carpet Eight highlights from the Golden Globes Oprah's speech in full Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won four awards It won the best film drama award, with its star Frances McDormand also picking up a trophy for best actress. The Oscar-winning actress stars as a grieving mother who challenges police over the fact her daughter's killer has not been found. Big Little Lies won the most awards in the television categories, including honours for its stars Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard. It was also named best limited TV series. Kidman won the first award of the night for her role as a victim of domestic violence. She dedicated her win to her castmates, daughters and mother, saying: ""Wow, the power of women."" The Golden Globes are organised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and are seen as an indicator of which films are likely to do well at the Oscars, which take place on 4 March. The ceremony and red carpet as it happened Golden Globes 2018: Full list of winners Funniest moments of the Globes The main focus on the night was on the current atmosphere in Hollywood and campaigns like Me Too andTime's Up, which are focused on bringing about change for women not only in the entertainment industry but also around the world. Many winners and presenters at the Beverly Hills ceremony addressed the ongoing scandal - with host Seth Meyers setting the tone with his opening monologue. Seth Meyers hosted the event for the first time ""Welcome ladies and remaining gentlemen,"" he told the gathered stars of film and TV, before saying: ""It's 2018 and marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn't. ""For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won't be terrifying to hear your name read out loud."" 17 of Seth Meyers's best jokes from the Globes Who could be taking home an Oscar? Meyers also jokingly encouraged Oprah Winfrey to run for president against Donald Trump. He referred to the 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner when he and Barack Obama mocked the idea of Trump becoming US president. ""Some have said that night convinced him to run,"" he continued. ""So, if that's true, I just want to say, Oprah, you will never be president. You do not have what it takes."" This video can not be played Actors including The Crown's Claire Foy and Matt Smith wore black on the 75th Golden Globes's red carpet It was Oprah whose speech had the biggest reaction, with stars applauding and rising to their feet. Speaking as she was awarded the honorary Cecil B DeMille trophy - the first black woman to get the honour - she said: ""Speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. ""For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up!"" Laura Dern (left) with other Big Little Lies stars The theme was echoed by Laura Dern, winner of a best supporting actress for Big Little Lies, who said: ""Many of us were taught not to tattle. ""It was a culture of silencing, and that was normalised... May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture's new North Star."" Barbra Streisand used her presenting slot to express outrage that she remains the only woman to win the best director award at the ceremony - and that was back in 1984. ""Folks, time's up,"" she said. ""We need more women directors and more women to be nominated for best director."" Greta Gerwig, whose directorial debut Lady Bird was named best musical or comedy film, could be seen being hugged by her film's star, Saoirse Ronan, as Streisand made her comments. Gerwig was not nominated in the directing category - an award won by The Shape of Water's Guillermo del Toro - but neither was any woman. It was a fact that did not escape Natalie Portman's notice as she presented the best director award, pointedly referring to the ""all male nominees"". Portman presented the best director award with Ron Howard While many Britons had been nominated for honours, only three won. Gary Oldman was named best actor for portraying Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour - a feat he revealed took 63 applications of make-up. Ewan McGregor won the award for best actor in a television series for Fargo Martin McDonagh picked up the best screenplay trophy for Three Billboards. Irish actress Ronan was named best actress in a film comedy for Lady Bird, while James Franco won the equivalent award for best actor for The Disaster Artist. In the TV categories, The Handmaid's Tale and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel did well, with two awards each. Elisabeth Moss, named best actress in a TV drama for The Handmaid's Tale, dedicated her win to author Margaret Atwood, whose book is the source material for the series. After reading a quote from Atwood, she told the audience: ""We no longer live in the gaps... we are the story in print and we are writing the story ourselves."" They were apt words for a night when Hollywood seemed determined to turn a new page. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon played the title roles in 1991's Thelma and Louise At the same time, the ceremony did allow itself a few nostalgic nods back to its glittering past. Kirk Douglas was given a rapturous reception, at the age of 101, as he came on stage to present an award with daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones. And there was an on-stage reunion for Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, 27 years on from their on-screen partnership in Thelma and Louise. Even here, though, pointed commentary was no more than a breath away. Announcing the nominees for best actor in a drama, Davis joked they had all ""agreed to give half of their salary back, so the women can make more than them"". HFPA President Meher Tatna Prior to the ceremony, most stars wore black on the red carpet, as a mark of solidarity with victims of sexual assault and harassment. Actresses wore black gowns while many men wore Time's Up pin badges or black shirts with their suits. Some stars, such as German model Barbara Meier and actress Bianca Blanco chose not to wear black. Meier explained her choice on Instagram, saying that women should be able to wear something ""a little more sexy"" and that it wasn't their fault that ""men cannot control themselves"". Hollywood Foreign Press Association President Meher Tatna also wore red, witha source telling The Wrap,external, ""she wore the dress that she chose with her mother.

"Evelyn Johnston-Smith was born with a hole in her heart A baby born with a hole in her heart had to wait four months for a major operation to repair the defect, after the procedure was cancelled five times. Leanne Smith, 20, said her daughter Evelyn Johnston-Smith was at risk of cardiac arrest as she waited for surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. She said the wait had been ""traumatic"" but she did not blame the hospital. A hospital spokesperson said the ""difficult"" decision to cancel the operation was ""not taken lightly"". Evelyn's condition was spotted at the 20-week scan, and shortly after she was born she underwent a 14-hour operation in September 2016. Doctors said she would need a second operation within a year. Evelyn underwent an eight-and-a-half-hour open heart procedure in December The procedure was scheduled for September 2017 and medics put a deadline of 17 November in place. However, the operation was cancelled five times because of staff shortages, lack of beds and an emergency case. It was eventually carried out on 22 December. More stories from across Yorkshire Ms Smith said: ""It's just traumatic having it cancelled five times and being dragged into hospital three times. ""By leaving it so long my daughter could have gone into cardiac arrest but the hospital was working as fast as they could to reschedule."" Evelyn, one, is now recovering at home following the eight-and-a-half-hour open heart procedure. Ms Smith said her daughter is recovering at home after the procedure Dr Yvette Oade, chief medical officer for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said non-emergency, planned operations are sometimes postponed if there is no bed available in the paediatric intensive care unit.

"House prices grew much more slowly in 2017 than in the previous year, the UK's largest mortgage lender has reported. The Halifax said,externalprices rose by 2.7% in 2017 - compared with a 6.5% increase in 2016. On a calendar year basis, that is the lowest rise since 2012. The slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth and continuing uncertainty over the economy, it said. At the end of the year the average house price across the UK was Â£225,021. The Halifax research echoes last week's figures from the Nationwide, which suggested prices rose by 2.6% in 2017. During the month of December, the Halifax said that prices actually fell by 0.6%, the first monthly decline since June last year. Biggest house price rises for 2017 revealed London's most affordable commuter towns However, the Halifax still expects prices to continue rising in 2018. ""Nationally house prices in 2018 are likely to be supported by the ongoing shortage of properties for sale, low levels of housebuilding, high employment and a continuation of low interest rates making mortgage servicing affordable in relative terms,"" said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax Community Bank. ""Overall we expect annual price growth to continue in the range of 0-3% at the end 2018."" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said one reason that price growth was slowing was the gradual rise in mortgage rates. The cost of average fixed-rate mortgages has risen by between 0.1% and 0.2% since September. ""Halifax's data suggest that the recent jump in new mortgage rates has poured cold water on a market that already was flagging,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Carrie Gracie explains why she resigned as the BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie has said she resigned as the BBC's China editor because she could not ""collude"" in a policy of ""unlawful pay discrimination"". She quit, citing pay inequality with male international editors earning more than her Â£135,000-a-year salary. She said she had refused a Â£45,000 rise as it still left a ""big gap"" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be ""made equal"". The BBC said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" to the corporation.

The US editor, Jon Sopel, earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999 - in Ms Gracie's words, ""at least 50% more"" than herself and Ms Adler.

Gender pay gap: More than 500 firms reveal their figures Ms Gracie told Radio 4's Woman's Hour the BBC had offered to raise her annual salary to Â£180,000, but she did not see that as a solution and there would still have been ""a big gap between myself and my male peers"". Asked whether those male workers should receive a pay cut, Ms Gracie said: ""I believe in public service broadcasting and I do think salaries at the top are unacceptably high... but I don't have the information to say this needs to happen or that should happen."" She added: ""I could not go back to China and collude knowingly in what I consider to be unlawful pay discrimination. I could not do it, nor could I stay silent and watch the BBC perpetuate a failing pay structure by discriminating against women."" This video can not be played Journalist Mariella Frostrup tells Today the gender pay situation hasn't improved in her lifetime Due to the BBC's impartiality rules, presenter Jane Garvey - who had tweeted support for Ms Gracie - said she was unable to conduct the interview. Instead, despite Ms Gracie being in the Woman's Hour studio, the interview was carried out by freelance journalistJane Martinson, from a radio car. BBC guidelines dictate that reporters should should not be ""exposed to conflicts of interest"", and there must be ""editorial separation"" of those reporting the story. Earlier, co-presenting the Today programme with John Humphrys, Ms Gracie said: ""The support I have had in the last few hours over this, I think it does speak to the depth of hunger for an equal, fair and transparent pay system."" Influential media in China have given prominent attention to Carrie Gracie's resignation as China editor, but have made no comment on her work. Global Times and China Daily highlighted her statement that women at the BBC are generally paid significantly less than men, and broadcaster CCTV shares a picture of Ms Gracie from her Twitter page holding an #equalpayday sign. Some social media users on the popular Sina Weibo praise her for speaking out and say they ""support"" her. ""We need to be treated equally!"" says one user, receiving hundreds of likes. Some say that men and women are paid the same in China, and one blames ""capitalism"" on her pay. Other users give damning comments on articles she has written that they perceive to be anti-China. Source: BBC Monitoring In an open letter issued on Sunday, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom in London ""where I expect to be paid equally"".

""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's."" She said ""patience and goodwill"" among female staff was running out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, who forced the corporation to disclose salaries above Â£150,000, criticised the director general Tony Hall for not resolving the ""substantial difference"" in men and women's pay ""at the top level"". He added: ""It's now quite a long time since those figures came out. And nothing, as far as we're aware, has really happened since."" In a statement, a BBC spokeswoman said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" and the corporation would improve transparency on how pay is set. The BBC has said it hopes to close the gender pay gap by 2020, but this is different to the issue of equal pay. The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men's and women's average earnings in an organisation. Equal pay, as defined in the Equality Act 2010, means that men and women doing the same job should receive the same salary. There have been three investigations into gender pay: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. It found the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is still being carried out and will be published ""in the not too distant future"" Arriving at the Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles, actress Emma Watson said the BBC's commitment to equal pay was ""great... but we need to see them fulfil it"".

"Who will take the seats at the cabinet table after the reshuffle? Prime ministers do not, as Theresa May well knows, have as much power to shape their fortunes as the trappings of the grand office suggests. However, one of the things they can control is the timing of reshuffles, and at least the initial set of decisions. They are the moment when the boss does the hiring and firing of their team - to punish or reward and to position supporters or enemies into the most politically convenient spots. Whether reshuffles are forced upon leaders by political accidents, such as scandals or resignations, or a desire to refresh the look and direction of the government - it is both in this case - as with many other big set piece moments in politics, they are times of huge potential reward, but huge risk too. Because of that, there are a few conventions, if not rules, to bear in mind: Prime ministers need to avoid creating a bigger problem than the one they sought to solve by getting rid of an awkward colleague. Disgruntled at being sacked, annoyed at being ignored, some fired ministers will go on to become bigger irritants on the backbenches - where they can arguably cause more trouble than they did around the cabinet table. There, at least publicly, their loyalty was more or less guaranteed. Ministers sometimes refuse to budge when they are told they are being moved, and conversely, others being offered jobs inside government sometimes turn them down. The responses of individuals can disrupt the best laid plans. There is not necessarily a direct relationship between successful reshuffles and prime ministerial authority. Strong leaders have botched them sometimes. But clever reshuffles can embolden weak prime ministers. Unless a reshuffle is epic - don't expect that this time - the public probably doesn't notice very much, as, quite rightly, the majority of people have got more to worry about than who the new parliamentary under secretary for paper clips is. But they do matter to political parties very much. Reshuffles can erase old grudges and create new ones in the space of a few short hours. And, of course, they matter hugely to government departments and people whose lives are affected by the decisions in one sector or another. Reshuffle days in Westminster are like bingo for political observers, but the decisions made have much bigger ramifications after that frenzied 24 hours. Even limited ministerial moves mean that different decisions and different priorities can be set in Whitehall that have real consequences for the country. Who is in charge of the government's existing plans does make a difference. Despite that, new faces alone don't mean a new direction. Changing the personnel doesn't necessarily reset the government. This time, with the posteriors on the biggest seats in government expected to stay the same, don't expect Theresa May to change tack substantially.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Our NHS has been named as the safest and best health care system in the world"" The prime minister has defended her record and set out her plans for the coming year, as she prepares to reshuffle her cabinet. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, she defended NHS funding amid questions over the handling of winter pressures. Mrs May also defended rail fare rises and pledged parole reform afterthe decision to release sex attacker John Worboys. On the NHS, Labour said the PM lacked a plan to get ""people off the trolleys"". Theresa May confirmed a cabinet reshuffle was imminent, but refused to give any detail. She is expected to replace Damian Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state in December, but keep key figures such as Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs May also: Set out plans to createa new Northern Foreststretching from Liverpool to Hull Warned Toby Young about his languageamid calls for him to be sacked from his job on the board of the new university regulator for his tweets about women Said she knew one of John Worboys' victims, andshe wanted to bring ""greater openness"" to the parole system Dropped a manifesto pledge to hold a vote on the fox-hunting banduring this parliament Confirmed President Trump would be coming to the UK Said she wanted to fight the next general election, due in 2022 On the NHS, Theresa May said thousands of cancelled operations in January were ""part of the plan"" for coping with pressures on the health service. She said she wanted cancelled operations to be ""reinstated as soon as possible"", but added the government was ""making sure that those who most urgently need care"" get it quickly. Mr Marr disputed the idea that urgent care was being delivered in time, raising the case of Leah Butler-Smith and her mother, who, having suffered a stroke, waited an hour in an ambulance and a further four in A&E before seeing a doctor. ""If I'd been waiting for five hours before I'd seen a doctor after my stroke I would not be here talking to you,"" he said. ""This is about life and death, and up and down the country people are having horrendous experiences of the NHS."" The prime minister said she had not heard of the specific case and so could not comment, and insisted that the NHS was delivering more than ever before. ""But of course nothing's perfect and there is more for us to do"", she added. Mrs May also defended the rail fare increase announced at the beginning of January, saying that rises were in line with inflation. ""For every pound that somebody pays on a ticket in the railways, 97p of that goes back into investment in the railways."" she said. Theresa May wants to reset her premiership after a difficult few months. The message she wants people to hear is that her government is about more than just Brexit. So plans to develop a new forest on land between Liverpool and Hull have been announced and she's kicking a free vote on fox hunting into the long grass. But old problems haven't gone away. The New Year has brought with it another deep winter crisis in the NHS, with tens of thousands of operations cancelled. Mrs May told Andrew Marr that postponing operations was all ""part of the plan"" to help the NHS cope. But Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said that the current crisis was ""entirely predictable and preventable"" and blamed government cuts. The hike in rail prices is another issue that's getting in the way of the prime minister's efforts to present a more positive message. The interview comes ahead of a cabinet reshuffle, which is expected to take place across Monday and Tuesday. Several newspapers have reported that Education Secretary Justine Greening will be among those to lose her role, although No 10 has described this and other speculation as ""guesswork"". This video can not be played Mrs May confirmed that President Trump will come to the UK Mrs May told Mr Marr thatDamian Green's exit as first secretary of state in December- he was sacked after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008 - meant a reshuffle was needed, but she would not pre-empt what would be announced. Labour reacted angrily to rumours that Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, may be promoted to fill the vacancy. ""They should be demoting this health secretary. ""If she promotes this health secretary tomorrow it's a betrayal of those 75,000 people (waiting) in the back of ambulances,"" Mr Ashworth said. Two other cabinet ministers -Sir Michael FallonandPriti Patel- have also quit since November, but they have already been replaced as defence secretary and international development secretary respectively. While Mrs May is believed to be planning to promote more women and MPs from ethnic minorities, it is expected that prominent cabinet members such as Boris Johnson, David Davis and Philip Hammond will stay in their roles.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons. This year's Golden Globes ceremony was expected to be the most political in recent memory - and so it proved. Host Seth Meyers referenced the Hollywood harassment scandal with the caustic opener, ""Welcome, ladies and remaining gentlemen."" Star after A-list star walked the red carpet in black to show support for Time's Up, an initiative launched to fight sexual harassment in film and other industries. And on social media, little escaped the gaze of viewers who settled in to watch the drama unfold. Here are eight moments to raise a smile - or an eyebrow - from the Golden Globes 2018... Late-night TV host Meyers came out swinging with a series of near-the-mark jokes, including the following: ""It's 2018, marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn't. It's going to be a good year!"" ""There's a new era under way and I can tell, because it's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood."" Seth Meyers' savage humour included a joke about the death of Harvey Weinstein Addressing the elephant that ""isn't in the room"", he said: ""Harvey Weinstein isn't here tonight because I've heard rumours he's crazy and difficult to work with, but don't worry, he will be back in 20 years when he becomes the first person booed during the In Memoriam."" (Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.) ""For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won't be terrifying to hear your name read out loud. 'Did you hear about Willem Dafoe?' - 'Oh god no!' - 'He was nominated!' - 'Don't do that!'"" Reacting from the audience, Hollywood legend Dafoe produced a face that combined glee and terror in a single glorious grimace - and became an instant meme. Allow Twitter content?

The film is about the making of the legendary 2003 movie The Room, a cult classic once lauded as ""the best worst movie ever made"".

"The German-Russian suspect is only known as Sergei W A man on trial over the bombing of the Borussia Dortmund football team bus last year has admitted he detonated explosives along its route. Sergei W, 28, told a court in Dortmund that he had not intended to kill anyone. He is a German of Russian origin. His full name was not revealed. The attack left a defender, Marc Bartra, with a fractured wrist and a police officer with hearing loss. Prosecutors believe Sergei W gambled on the team's share price plunging. He has been charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which he denies. But he told the court: ""I deeply regret my behaviour"". He went on trial on 21 December. The bus attack saw Borussia Dortmund's Champions League quarter-final with AS Monaco rescheduled to a day later, withDortmund fans opening their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the bombing as a suspected terror attack by jihadists. Three bombs packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was attacked en route to a Champions League match against AS Monaco Sergei W was arrested 10 days later in Rottenburg, southern Germany. Prosecutors say he had bought more than 26,000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares, predicting that the share price would plunge after the attack. It is reckoned that if the share price had fallen to one euro, Sergei W could have made a profit of more than 500,000 euros (Â£443,270; $600,000), German media report. Borussia Dortmund is the only German football team whose shares are traded on the stock market. The suspect was staying at the team's L'ArrivÃ©e hotel in Dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. He had placed his bet in the week before the attack.

"This video can not be played Carrie Gracie explains why she resigned as the BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie has said she resigned as the BBC's China editor because she could not ""collude"" in a policy of ""unlawful pay discrimination"". She quit, citing pay inequality with male international editors earning more than her Â£135,000-a-year salary. She said she had refused a Â£45,000 rise as it still left a ""big gap"" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be ""made equal"". The BBC said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" to the corporation. BBC broadcasters including Mishal Husain, Lyse Doucet, Clare Balding, Emily Maitlis and Sarah Montague voiced their support for Ms Gracie; whileChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman,external, and Labour MPsHarriet Harman,externaland Jess Phillips andConservative MP Nadine Dorries,externalhave also reacted positively to the move.

Neither Ms Gracie, nor Ms Adler appeared on a list issued by the BBC last July, listing the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year. The US editor, Jon Sopel, earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999 - in Ms Gracie's words, ""at least 50% more"" than herself and Ms Adler.

Gender pay gap: More than 500 firms reveal their figures Ms Gracie told Radio 4's Woman's Hour the BBC had offered to raise her annual salary to Â£180,000, but she did not see that as a solution and there would still have been ""a big gap between myself and my male peers"". Asked whether those male workers should receive a pay cut, Ms Gracie said: ""I believe in public service broadcasting and I do think salaries at the top are unacceptably high... but I don't have the information to say this needs to happen or that should happen."" She added: ""I could not go back to China and collude knowingly in what I consider to be unlawful pay discrimination. I could not do it, nor could I stay silent and watch the BBC perpetuate a failing pay structure by discriminating against women."" This video can not be played Journalist Mariella Frostrup tells Today the gender pay situation hasn't improved in her lifetime Due to the BBC's impartiality rules, presenter Jane Garvey - who had tweeted support for Ms Gracie - said she was unable to conduct the interview. Instead, despite Ms Gracie being in the Woman's Hour studio, the interview was carried out by freelance journalistJane Martinson, from a radio car. BBC guidelines dictate that reporters should should not be ""exposed to conflicts of interest"", and there must be ""editorial separation"" of those reporting the story. Earlier, co-presenting the Today programme with John Humphrys, Ms Gracie said: ""The support I have had in the last few hours over this, I think it does speak to the depth of hunger for an equal, fair and transparent pay system."" Influential media in China have given prominent attention to Carrie Gracie's resignation as China editor, but have made no comment on her work. Global Times and China Daily highlighted her statement that women at the BBC are generally paid significantly less than men, and broadcaster CCTV shares a picture of Ms Gracie from her Twitter page holding an #equalpayday sign. Some social media users on the popular Sina Weibo praise her for speaking out and say they ""support"" her. ""We need to be treated equally!"" says one user, receiving hundreds of likes. Some say that men and women are paid the same in China, and one blames ""capitalism"" on her pay. Other users give damning comments on articles she has written that they perceive to be anti-China. Source: BBC Monitoring In an open letter issued on Sunday, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom in London ""where I expect to be paid equally"".

""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's.""

Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, who forced the corporation to disclose salaries above Â£150,000, criticised the director general Tony Hall for not resolving the ""substantial difference"" in men and women's pay ""at the top level"". He added: ""It's now quite a long time since those figures came out. And nothing, as far as we're aware, has really happened since."" In a statement, a BBC spokeswoman said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" and the corporation would improve transparency on how pay is set. The BBC has said it hopes to close the gender pay gap by 2020, but this is different to the issue of equal pay. The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men's and women's average earnings in an organisation. Equal pay, as defined in the Equality Act 2010, means that men and women doing the same job should receive the same salary. There have been three investigations into gender pay: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. It found the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is still being carried out and will be published ""in the not too distant future"" Arriving at the Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles, actress Emma Watson said the BBC's commitment to equal pay was ""great... but we need to see them fulfil it"".

"This video can not be played First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a no deal on Brexit was ""unthinkable"" Nicola Sturgeon has described a no-deal Brexit as ""unthinkable"", saying that ""no Brexit is preferable to no deal"". Scotland's first minister called Brexit a ""horror show"", saying she was seeking the ""least damaging"" outcome inside the single market. Theresa May is said to be considering appointing a minister for a no deal Brexit in a reshuffle of her cabinet. But Ms Sturgeon said this approach ""beggars belief"", saying Ms May was ""appeasing hard-line Brexiteers"". The Scottish and UK governments have beenlocked in dispute over the UK's exit from the EU, with Scottish ministers refusing to put forward Westminster Brexit legislation for consent votes at Holyrood until a deal is struck over powers returning from Brussels. Newspaper reports have speculated,externalthat the prime minister is set to appoint a junior minister to examine the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal, as a move to demonstrate to EU leaders that she is serious about this as an option if talks fail. Ms Sturgeon told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme she had read the reports ""in disbelief"" and ""despair"", saying: ""It beggars belief. It seems to give the impression that the UK government think this is some sort of game, that Theresa May is more concerned with appeasing the hard-line Tory Brexiteers than she is about acting in the best interests of the country."" ""No deal is unthinkable. Let me be absolutely clear, no Brexit is preferable to no deal."" Live: Theresa May's cabinet reshuffle Brian Taylor on Nicola Sturgeon's new year interviews The Scottish government is to set out papers later in January analysing the different possible outcomes of Brexit for Scotland's economy, including single market membership, a free trade agreement with the EU or no deal. Ms Sturgeon said: ""There's no doubt at all that staying within the single market, staying with the customs union is not the best outcome - staying in the EU in my view is the best outcome - but it's the least damaging outcome. ""I think 2018 has to be the year where we see jobs, the economy, the protections that come from EU membership like workers rights, consumers rights, really come to the fore, and the Tory Brexiteers sidelined rather than given greater precedence."" Ms Sturgeon said she would ""make an assessment and come to a judgement"" abouta possible Scottish independence referendum""once we see the outcome"" of the next stage of Brexit negotiations. On the prospect of a second EU vote, she said this was ""not the position of the SNP, it's not a policy we're campaigning for"", but added that ""as the situation develops, the argument for giving people a say on the final outcome may become irresistible"". She said: ""This is where the EU referendum in 2016 was very very different to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. In 2016 there was no detail about what the future relationship between the UK and the EU would be if there was a vote for Brexit, and we go into 2018 and we still don't have any detail about that. ""If we did get into a position for example where there was no deal, I'm very clear and I think a lot of people - certainly in Scotland but I suspect across the UK as a whole - would think that in those circumstances, no Brexit was absolutely preferable to a no-deal situation, which would be devastating for so many aspects of our economy and society."" Theresa May is preparing a reshuffle of her cabinet Mrs May has insisted that she wants to have a deal in place by the time the UK leaves the European Union in March 2019. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been a ""a real spirit of cooperation"" between negotiators from the UK and the EU, seeking ""a deal that is in everybody's best interests"". She said: ""What we want is our own free trade agreement with the European Union. It would be a free trade agreement to cover both goods and services, and what I want to do is to ensure that as we look at the Brexit deal going forward it's important we recognise why people voted to leave the European Union here in the UK. ""Some of that was about free movement, and an end to free movement. Some of it actually was about the issue of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and people wanting control, but at the same time I think people still want to have a good economic relationship with the EU so we want as frictionless and tariff-free a trading relationship with the EU as possible ""That's what we mean when we talk about having a free trade agreement which isn't modelled on somebody else's agreement, but is actually the right one for the UK.""

"Survivors are calling for a more central role in the inquiry Accountancy firm KPMG has quit its advisor role on the Grenfell inquiry amid concerns over its appointment. Campaigners had called for KPMG to be removed, saying it failed to disclose a conflict of interest. KPMG is the auditor of three of the firms under scrutiny by the inquiry into the tower block blaze, in which 71 people died on 14 June last year. The firm said it had ""mutually agreed with the inquiry that we will step down from our role with immediate effect"". Grenfell inquiry 'whitewash' upsets families Grenfell inquiry 'could bring closure' The accountancy firm audits the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where the tower is located. It also audits Rydon Construction, which refurbished the tower in 2015, and Celotex, which manufactured insulation material used in the tower. Pop star Lily Allen, two Labour MPs - Clive Lewis and Emma Dent-Coad - and a host of academics and campaigners had earlier signedan open letter to Theresa May,externalurging the prime minster to reverse KPMG's appointment. They said the appointment would ""only further fuel rumours of a deliberate cover-up and erode public trust."" KPMG said its role on the inquiry as project management advisor was ""purely operational"" and that it had no role advising ""on the substance of the inquiry"". ""Whilst we are confident that no conflicts exist between our role advising the inquiry and our work for other clients, we recognise that strength of opinion about our role risks undermining confidence in the Inquiry,"" a spokesperson added. The firm said it would waive its fees for the work undertaken to date. The blaze on 14 June last year killed 71 people Last month, survivors and bereaved families warned the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry could become a whitewash unless a diverse panel was appointed to oversee proceedings. Sir Martin Moore-Bick's appointment as the inquiry chairman has already been criticised by residents, who say he is an establishment figure. Victims groups were further angered when the retired Court of Appeal judge said he would not appoint a member of the Grenfell community to the panel, arguing it would ""risk undermining impartiality"".

"This video can not be played Severn Bridge tolls are coming down Tolls on the two Severn crossings have been reduced but calls are being made for them to be scrapped immediately rather than at the end of the year. The bridges went into public ownership at midnight, prompting the price cut as VAT was removed by the UK government. The tolls will be removed by the end of 2018 but First Minister Carwyn Jones said that should happen straight away. The UK government said fees would help phase out tolling and pay towards maintenance. Charges for private cars travelling into south Wales from England will drop to Â£5.60 from Â£6.70 as Highways England take charge of the M4 and M48 bridges - the first time the tolls have been reduced. Some politicians are concerned that ending the tolls could increase congestion Severn River Crossing PLC, whose tolling revenue in 2017 was between Â£8m and Â£10m a month, handed the running of both bridges to the Department for Transport. The Conservative-run UK government said it will abolish the Severn tolls altogether by the end of 2018 but Mr Jones called for the date to be moved forward.

Another Welsh Labour politician accused ministers of ""highway robbery"" by continuing the tolls now they were publicly owned. How the Severn Bridge Was Built Toll pledge boosts house prices 'Challenges' for Monmouthshire after tolls cut ""Wales has been subjected to highway robbery by tolling from when the first bridge opened in 1966,"" said Newport West MP Paul Flynn. ""We have been uniquely punished. This month we should be ending the tolls altogether - to continue them is a rip off. Maintenance of the two bridges costs on average Â£6m a year A worker inspects the tower on the M48 Severn Bridge ""It is entirely unjustified. The UK government are very reluctant to give up a cash cow."" Ken Skates, Wales' economy and transport secretary, said: ""We, like users on both sides of the bridge, would question why these tolls are not scrapped from the point of returning to public ownership."" Bridging the divide Test your Severn Bridge knowledge It has been estimated by the Welsh Government that the ultimate abolition of the charges - paid on entry to Wales - will benefit the Welsh economy by about Â£100m a year. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said removing the tolls would make journeys cheaper for commuters and tourists, as well as creating ""exciting opportunities for businesses and investors looking to make their mark in Wales"". ""This will boost Welsh employment and establish lasting relationships between the economies and communities of south Wales and south west England, creating the most natural growth corridor spanning from Cardiff through Newport to Bristol,"" he added. The Queen opened the Â£8m first bridge in 1966 while the second bridge, built three miles downstream across the Severn Estuary, was financed by a private consortium set up in 1992. The newest bridge, opened in 1996, cost Â£332m to construct but the eventual repayments including debt repayments, interest and tax are more than Â£1.3bn. ""The bridges are paid for, there is no debt and the Severn crossings are part of the road system - and should be free,"" added Mr Flynn. The Queen opened the first Severn bridge in September 1966 Annual maintenance and operational costs average Â£15m between both bridges and the UK government said the continuation of tolling will help pay for their upkeep. It said in a statement: ""Over the period between the transfer to public ownership on 8 January and the abolition of tolling, Highways England expect to collect sufficient revenue to operate the crossing, phase out tolling, and recover costs that taxpayers historically incurred in the maintenance of these bridges. ""Tolls will then be abolished by the end of 2018."" This video can not be played BBC archive: the day the Severn Bridge opened 50 years ago About 25 million journeys a year are made across the two bridges and daily users of the crossings could save about Â£1,400 a year once the toll has been removed. Severn River Crossing's 180 staff have been transferred to become Highways England employees overnight but with tolls set to be scrapped, 115 jobs are at risk. ""It is policy of all major political parties to remove tolls and if you don't have tolls you don't need toll collectors,"" said departing Severn River Crossing chief executive Phil Smith. Workers are completing a nine year paint job covering 70,000 sq m of the underside of the Second Severn Crossing Painters finish the weatherproof paint job 137m (449 ft) above the treacherous River Severn ""We've had programmes running to up-skill those individuals and it is up to Highways England to carry that forward and deal with them as sympathetically as possible."" Severn River Crossing PLC spent Â£228m on maintenance of the bridges over the past 25 years and the 60-strong team expected their work to continue. ""There is a lot of experience in our team and Highways England know we are the best people to maintain the crossings,"" said engineering operations manager Rick Shaw. ""Their first priority is the travelling public and these crossings have to be maintained and kept open. As far as we're concerned, it is business as usual.""

""They are usually making a substantial sum of money from the properties in Bristol."" But he added: ""We're finding that the traffic is increasing...

"Boots is the largest pharmacy company in Europe and the US Some Boots pharmacy staff say they are under too much pressure and fear mistakes will be made. One whistleblower, a former manager, said he resigned in 2015 after he took his concerns to the independent industry regulator. Several current Boots pharmacists told BBC Inside Out that understaffing could pose a risk to patients. But the chain said its pharmacies were not understaffed and it had an industry-leading patient safety record. Greg Lawton resigned from Boots in 2015 Greg Lawton, who worked for Boots between 2008 and 2015 and in his final role was part of the manpower planning team that assessed staffing levels in the company's pharmacies, said the things he knew about staffing levels kept him awake at night. In 2012 he worked on an investigation ordered by Boots into stores with the highest levels of dispensing errors. ""We spoke to pharmacists, to store managers and to area managers and what those people were saying [was that] absolutely staffing levels was flagged as an issue, poor staffing levels,"" he said. Boots said that after the investigation it implemented a detailed action plan. It then commissioned academic research which, it says, found that pharmacies with higher levels of dispensing staff were associated with higher error rates. Douglas Lamond, Arlene Devereux and Margaret Forrest died following dispensing errors In November 2012, a woman called Arlene Devereaux died on her 71st birthday after a Boots pharmacy in Chesterfield dispensed six times the strength of morphine tablets prescribed by her GP. While understaffing was not found to be a contributing factor in her death, Mr Lawton said: ""It was shocking and it kind of reminded you of the importance of the job that you were doing and strengthened your resolve to try and make a difference."" Mrs Devereaux was one of three people to die between May 2012 and November 2013 following dispensing errors by Boots.Douglas Lamond, 86,died in May 2012 whileMargaret Forrest, also aged 86, died in November 2013. Staff had not followed company safety procedures, and understaffing was not found to have contributed to any of these deaths. However, the inquest into Mr Lamond's death was told by a member of the pharmacy team that staff at the Boots branch in Felixstowe, Suffolk,had been under pressure as it was ""very busy"". The inquest in March 2017 heard that staff kept telling their area manager they did not have enough space to do their job. Boots said it found no record of staff raising concerns with the area manager. Douglas Lamond's death was investigated by police When police investigated Mr Lamond's death they asked to see the company's own internal investigations report, but Boots refused. Boots was entitled to do this under legal privilege. However, Det Supt Andy Smith, of Suffolk Police, said he felt the company had a moral responsibility. ""I do think particularly big corporate companies such as Boots who have a significant responsibility towards public safety have a moral duty to co-operate fully with any police investigation, and also they have an overriding duty to demonstrate transparency to the family."" Boots said it co-operated fully with the police and legal privilege allows staff to make full and frank reports. Det Supt Andy Smith said Boots had ""a moral duty to co-operate fully with any police investigation"" In 2014, Mr Lawton had been looking in detail at staffing and budgets and was concerned that pressure from understaffing could lead to serious mistakes. ""I was terrified that something bad might happen to a patient, so the patient might be seriously harmed or a patient might die because of the inadequate staffing levels and the pressure that was placed on pharmacists and pharmacy teams,"" he said. The first Boots store opened in Nottingham in 1849 and ibuprofen was invented at the company's site in Nottingham The BBC has spoken to several pharmacists who still work for Boots and have concerns about patient safety. ""Some days you would easily describe the team as being at breaking point,"" said one, who asked not to be identified. ""That's because, simply, the amount of work that has to be done can't physically get done safely and it can't physically get done without either working longer hours or working after the store has closed."" Another pharmacist, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: ""Mistakes may not be picked up on and that could ultimately lead to somebody possibly dying, somebody missing medication, harm coming to people. Small mix-ups really, just one tablet for another tablet."" Boots has almost 2,400 pharmacies across the UK Mr Lawton took his concerns to the regulator, the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), shortly before resigning in 2015. He presented the regulator with a 55-page witness statement based on his experiences and concerns, as well as dozens of supporting documents. In December 2016 it concluded there was not sufficient objective, independent evidence to suggest a risk to patient safety across the organisation. Boots told the BBC it dispensed more than 220 million prescription items in the year beginning April 2016. Reported incidents where patients were harmed in some way were very rare - 901, or 0.00041%. Boots says these figures include incidents where a patient was harmed after Boots supplied the correct product. For example, the patient may have suffered an allergic reaction to a medicine even though the medicine was dispensed fully in accordance with the prescription, or there may have been a delay in supplying the medication. Boots says that its analysis indicates it has one of the lowest percentages of errors in the community pharmacy sector where harm was reported. In the year beginning April 2016, 17,000 incidents involving medication were reported to the NHS in England and Wales. That reporting is voluntary so the real figure could be higher. The GPhC told the BBC it inspected more than 2,000 Boots pharmacies between November 2013 and August 2017 and 26 did not have enough qualified and skilled staff to provide a safe service.  However, it said they were now up to standard. That means only 1.2% of Boots pharmacies failed on the staffing standard, which compares favourably with all other pharmacies, where an average of 2.4% failed. Boots has almost 2,400 pharmacies and as of July 2017 employed 6,697 pharmacists. However, the firm has declined to explain to the BBC how it works out how many staff to put in each pharmacy, as it says such information is commercially sensitive. Boots UK's pharmacy director Richard Bradley is a qualified pharmacist who has worked for the company for 20 years Boots said there had been no further deaths directly linked to dispensing errors at its pharmacies since 2013. Its UK pharmacy director Richard Bradley said: ""One mistake like this is one mistake too many and my absolute assurance is, despite having our industry leading record, we will continue to focus on minimising the chance of it happening again."" The firm said since Mr Lawton left it had increased the number of pharmacists it employed by 430 and the number of pharmacy technicians by over 360.  Staff with pharmacy capability has risen by more than 2,400, with staff in those last two groups still in training. ""Greg, his opinions and his concerns, [he] left the business over two years ago and [his opinions] aren't relevant to Boots today,"" added Mr Bradley. ""We continue to invest in more people, more pharmacists than ever before, that's into our shops and it's into our processes, helping to make things more safe. ""Our pharmacies are busy places but they are safe places. ""I'm absolutely confident that the resource is there to deliver the patient care. I am confident that we have enough staff."" However, Mr Lawton believes the regulator does not have enough power. ""We need regulatory standards to specify what the staffing levels must be in pharmacies,"" he said. At the moment, the only legal requirement to enforce safe staffing levels is that a pharmacist in charge, or ""Responsible Pharmacist"", has to be there when the pharmacy is open. Joy Wingfield believes regulation around pharmacy is inadequate Joy Wingfield, a pharmacy law and ethics expert who has trained the last two Boots superintendents - the pharmacists in charge of patient safety - agrees that regulation around pharmacy is inadequate and minimum staffing levels need to be defined. ""I'd like to see the powers they [the GPhC] have against corporate employers re-examined,"" she said. ""I don't think that anybody could have envisaged that the employment of pharmacists would devolve on such enormous, large international companies."" The regulator said it was providing new patient safety guidance to pharmacy owners later this year which will include explaining what they should do to make sure they have enough qualified staff in each pharmacy.

"Shares in baby goods retailer Mothercare have fallen by more than a quarter after it warned of substantially lower annual profits. The firm saw a big fall in sales over the crucial Christmas trading period. Like-for-like sales fell 7.2% year-on-year, while online sales fell 6.9%. The retailer said,externalit had reduced its total number of stores and discounted heavily in its end-of-season sale. It said adjusted group profit was now likely to be between Â£1m and Â£5m. Analysts had previously forecast that profits would be about Â£10m. Chief executive Mark Newton-Jones said there had been a ""softening"" in the UK market, with fewer people visiting its stores and lower website traffic. ""In our UK business, we took a conscious decision to remain at full price to protect our brand positioning prior to Christmas, but to then discount more heavily in the end of season sale,"" he said. ""We have subsequently seen good progress with strong sell-through rates on autumn/winter clearance lines, albeit these carry lower margins and will lead to a further reduction in full-year margin as a result."" Mothercare said it had reduced its total UK retail space to 1.4m sq ft in its store closure programme and that total sales were lower as a result. It now has 143 stores in the UK, of which four are Early Learning Centres. The retailer said online sales now represented about 42% of its total UK sales. Like-for-like sales are those from stores that have been open at least a year. Mothercare said international sales were down 3% year-on-year when the impact of currency movements were stripped out and 6.8% lower in actual currency. However, key markets were showing ""signs of improvement"", with a return to moderate growth in the Middle East and Russia. ""Whilst the performance of the business has been challenging in the last few months, we remain singularly focused on transforming Mothercare to be the leading global retailer for parents and young children,"" Mr Newton-Jones said. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""We should look to management's decision not to discount in the peak trading season as a significant contributing factor. ""Admirable, perhaps, but with competitors slashing prices ahead of Christmas amid (justified) fears of a slowdown in consumer spending, it looks as if the 'conscious decision' to remain at full price prior to Christmas but to then discount more heavily in the end of season sale was a mistake. ""Clearly Mothercare et al are up against it and the update does not bode especially well for the retail sector ahead of an important week of releases."" Other major retailers have already indicated that they are feeling the strain. Last week, department store chainDebenhams issued a profit warningafter reporting disappointing Christmas trading. It subsequently emerged that rival chainHouse of Fraser was seeking to reduce rentson some of its stores, suggesting that it too was struggling. However,sales at Next unexpectedly roseover the Christmas period, prompting the fashion retailer to raise its profit forecast. At the same time, data from credit card firm Visa has indicated that annual consumer spending fell by 0.3% year-on-year during 2017, marking the first annual decline since 2012.

"Commuters packed onto a South Western Railway train on the Portsmouth to London Waterloo line. Commuters are facing up to three days of disruption, as staff at five train firms begin a fresh wave of strikes in separate disputes over ""rail safety"". Rail, Maritime and Transport union members at Northern, Merseyrail, South Western Railway and Greater Anglia are striking today, Wednesday and Friday. RMT members at Southern are also staging a 24-hour walkout. A Department for Transport spokesman said the five franchises would ""keep passengers moving"" during the strikes. The 24-hour walkouts were called over separate disputes, all concerning rail safety, the RMT said. It said the disputes were over issues including the role of train guards and the extension of driver-only services. Strikes on each of the affected days will run from 00.01 until 23.59 GMT. Northern rail workers were picketing outside Carlisle train station All of the affected firms have said they will be running services during the strikes: Northern,external, which runs trains in north west and north east England, said it will run around 1,350 trains on strike days - about 60% of its normal service South Western Railway (SWR),external, which operates out of stations including London Waterloo, Reading, Exeter and Southampton, plans to run about 70% of its normal service Merseyrail,externalsaid it will run a reduced service on its lines in and around Liverpool, mostly between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT, but with a break during the middle of the day Southern,externalsaid it planned to run a normal service on most of its routes across south England, but advised passengers to check for any last-minute changes Greater Anglia,externalsaid it planned to run a normal service with no alterations. The Isle of Wight's Island Line - run by SWR - will also operate hourly on Monday and Friday, with buses replacing services on Wednesday.

The South Western Railway strike has led to delays and cancellations at Basingstoke train station TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady urged the government to respond ""positively"" to the proposal. The Department for Transport said the row was not about safety, adding that ""no one is losing their job"". ""Employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries for several years,"" the spokesman said. ""The independent rail regulator has stated unequivocally that driver-controlled trains, which have been used in this country for more than 30 years, are safe.""

"For more than 50 years, Lale Sokolov lived with a secret - one born in the horrors of wartime Europe, in a place that witnessed some of the worst of man's inhumanity to man. It would not be shared until he was in his 80s, thousands of miles from that place. Lale had been the Tattooist of Auschwitz. Living out his life in a suburb of Melbourne, the man who had been born Ludwig ""Lale"" Eisenberg to Jewish parents in Slovakia in 1916 decided to share his story. ""This man, the tattooist from the most infamous concentration camp, kept his secret safe in the mistaken belief that he had something to hide,"" says Heather Morris, who spent three years recording Lale's story before he died in 2006. She has now written a book - The Tattooist of Auschwitz - based on how he tattooed a serial number on the arms of those at the camp who weren't sent to the gas chambers. ""The horrors of surviving nearly three years in a concentration camp left him with a lifetime of fear and paranoia,"" she says. ""The story took three years to untangle. I had to earn his trust and it took time before he was willing to embark on the deep self-scrutiny that parts of his story required."" He feared that he would be viewed as a Nazi collaborator. Keeping the secret, or what he described as a burden of guilt, would protect his family, he thought. It was only after his wife Gita died that he ""unburdened"" himself, revealing a tale not only of survival but of deep love. In April 1942, aged 26, Lale was taken to Auschwitz, the Nazis' biggest death camp. When the Nazis came to his hometown, Lale had offered himself as a strong, able-bodied young man in the hope that it would save the rest of his family from being split up. Unlike his siblings, he was unemployed and unmarried. At that time, he did not know of the horrors that went on at the camp in occupied south-west Poland. On arrival, the Nazis exchanged his name for a number: 32407. Prisoner number 32407 was set to work like many others, constructing new housing blocks as the camp expanded.

The twins of Auschwitz He spent hours working on the rooftops, keeping a low profile from the SS guards and their unpredictable tempers. But shortly after he arrived at Auschwitz, Lale contracted typhoid. He was cared for by the man who had given him his identification tattoo, a French academic named Pepan. Pepan took Lale under his wing and set him to work as his assistant. He taught him not only the trade, but how to keep his head down and his mouth shut. Tattooed arms of Auschwitz prisoners Then one day Pepan disappeared, shipped out. Lale would never find out what happened to him. Partly because of his skills with languages - he knew Slovakian, German, Russian, French, Hungarian and a bit of Polish - Lale was made the main tattooist, the tetovierer, of the death camp. He was given a bag full of tattooing supplies and a paper bearing the words: Politische Abteilung. Lale now worked for the Political Wing of the SS. An officer was assigned to monitor him, which gave him a semblance of protection. Aerial view of Auschwitz in World War Two As the tetovierer, Lale lived a step further away from death than the other prisoners. He ate in an administration building. He was given extra rations. He slept in a single room. When his work was done, or when there were no new prisoners to tattoo, he was allowed free time. ""He never, ever saw himself as being a collaborator,"" Morris says. It was a real concern after the war - many saw the prisoners who worked for the SS at the camps as having taken part in their brutality. ""He did what he did to survive. He said he wasn't told he could have this job or that job,'' says Morris. ""He said you took whatever was being offered. You took it and you were grateful because it meant that you might wake up the next morning."" Despite his privileges, the threat of not waking up the next day was ever present. Josef Mengele (left) with other senior Nazi officers ""[Josef] Mengele, in particular, was a common sight as he chose his 'patients' from the new arrivals, sending them Lale's way,"" Morris wrote. ""On many occasions while whistling an operatic tune, he would sidle up to Lale and loudly terrorise him: 'One day, tetovierer, I will take you - one day.'"" Child prisoners at Auschwitz - photographed on orders of Josef Mengele For the next two years, Lale would tattoo hundreds of thousands of prisoners, with the help of assistants. These forced tattoos, the numbers shaky and stark against pale forearms, have become one of the most recognisable symbols of the Holocaust and its deadliest camp. Only prisoners at Auschwitz and its sub-camps, Birkenau and Monowitz, were tattooed. The practice began in autumn 1941 and by the spring of 1943, all prisoners were tattooed. Children of Auschwitz show their tattooed arms At first, a metal stamp was used to imprint the entire number into the skin. Ink was rubbed into the wound. When this method proved inefficient, the SS introduced a twin-needle device. This is the tool Lale used during his time as tattooist. When prisoners arrived at Auschwitz, they were selected either for forced labour or immediate execution. Their heads were shaved, their belongings taken. Arrival of prisoners at Auschwitz Women prisoners at Auschwitz deemed ""fit for work"", 1944 They exchanged their clothes for rags, and then lined up to receive their mark from the tetovierer. The only exceptions to this branding were the ""re-education"" prisoners of German ethnic origin and those sent directly to the gas chambers. It was the final peg in the brutal ""registration"" process, says Dr Piotr Setkiewicz, head of the research centre at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum. ""It was one thing in a series of humiliating, dehumanising things that happened on arrival to the camp. ""First it was painful, and second they understood at this moment they were losing their names. From this time on, the prisoners did not use officially their names. They had to use their numbers."" It's July 1942 and Lale is handed another piece of paper. In front of him are five digits: 3 4 9 0 2. Tattooing men is one thing, but when he holds the thin arm of a young girl in his hands, he feels horrified. He has not yet been made the tetovierer. Pepan urges him to do as he's told. If he doesn't, he will condemn himself to death. There is something about this girl and her bright eyes. Years later, Lale will tell Morris how in that moment, as he tattooed her number on her left arm, she tattooed her number in his heart. He learned that her name was Gita - she was in the women's camp, Birkenau. With the help of Lale's personal SS guard, he would smuggle letters to her. Letters led to secretive visits outside her block. He tried to take care of her, sneaking her his extra rations, even getting her moved to a better work station. He tried to give her hope. ""Gita, she had her doubts, very strong doubts,"" Morris says. ""She didn't see a future. He always, deep down, knew that he was going to survive. He didn't know how, but it comes back to that whole notion of being a survivor. He's a survivor because of luck, being in the right place at the right time, and being able to manipulate opportunities that he saw."" Knowing he was one of the lucky ones, Lale tried to help as many fellow prisoners as he could in his capacity as tetovierer. Food was the currency of Auschwitz, and he used his privileged rations to feed his former blockmates, Gita's friends, and the Roma families that arrived later on. He began trading jewels and money - given to him by other prisoners - with the villagers who worked near the camp to obtain more food and provisions for the most needy. Women at Auschwitz shortly after liberation by Soviet forces, 1945 In 1945, the Nazis began shipping prisoners out of the death camp before the Russians arrived. Gita was one of the women selected to leave Auschwitz. The woman he had fallen in love with was gone. Lale knew only her name - Gita Fuhrmannova - but not where she had come from. Lale eventually also left the camp and made his way back to his hometown of Krompachy in Czechoslovakia. He paid his way with the jewels he'd managed to steal from the Nazis. His sister Goldie had survived and so his childhood house still belonged to his family. The only thing left was to find out what happened to Gita. Could he dare to hope that he would ever find her again? Jewish families heading from Czechoslovakia towards US-controlled zones in Austria in 1946 In a horse and cart, he set off for Bratislava, the entry point for many survivors returning home to Czechoslovakia. Lale waited at the railway station for weeks, until the stationmaster advised him to go to the Red Cross instead. On his way there, a young woman stepped into the street in front of his horse. It was a familiar face. A pair of bright eyes. Gita had found him. Lale and Gita Sokolov, 1940s The couple married in October 1945 and changed their last name to Sokolov to better fit into Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. Lale set up a textile shop that was successful for a time. But they had been collecting and sending money out of the country to support the movement for an Israeli state. When the government discovered this, Lale was imprisoned and his business nationalised. It was while on weekend leave that he and Gita made their escape from Czechoslovakia. They went first to Vienna, then Paris, and finally, in an effort to get as far away from Europe as they could, set sail for Sydney. During the journey, they met a couple from Melbourne and were convinced to start a new life there. Lale started a textile business again, and Gita began designing dresses. In 1961, they had a son, Gary. Family snaps of Lale and Gita Sokolov - including their young son, Gary Melbourne in 1955 Lale and Gita lived out the rest of their lives in Melbourne. Gita visited Europe a few times before she died in 2003. Lale, on the other hand, never returned. Only close friends knew of the couple's love story. Photo of Gita and Lale Sokolov before Gita's death in 2003 ""I met several of his friends who all would immediately want to tell me, 'You know he and Gita met in Auschwitz? Who falls in love in a concentration camp?'"" Morris says. Even Gary would not know the full extent of the horrors his parents endured until years later. In fact, the full truth came to light only after Gita's death, when Morris came into the picture. ""I didn't find the idea - the idea found me,"" Morris says. Gary was searching for someone to tell his father's story and found Morris through a network of friends. Morris is not Jewish and that, she says, is why Lale - who was then 87 - chose to share his story with her. ""I questioned him about that straight up,"" Morris says. ""To him it was important that I had no baggage. He needed somebody who was perhaps naive, and who would hear his story and accept his story for how he was going to tell it. ""To him, it was all about looking into those eyes of that 18-year-old girl,"" Morris says. Lale Sokolov with writer Heather Morris Over the next three years, Morris would visit Lale several times a week. Most of what he remembered matched her own research. In addition to Lale and Gita's love story, the Tattooist of Auschwitz, the book Morris has written, brings to light a new piece of Holocaust history. The process of corroborating the anecdotes Morris gathered from Lale was key. Initially the novel was meant to be a screenplay. As a result, Film Victoria, the Australian government's film body, agreed to fund international research for the project. ""We had researchers out of the country, professional researchers who then went and examined and found the documents - found amazing documents to verify what he said,"" Morris says. Those documents led to the discovery that Lale's parents had been killed at Auschwitz a month before he arrived. Lale died in 2006, before he learned what happened to his parents. Regarding other documents, one was discovered with Lale's name and number in a list with other prisoners. ""The top of the document says Politische Abt - Aufnhmershreiber, Pramienauszahlung vom 26.7.44, which translates to - Political Wing Admittance Writer,"" Morris says. The document did not list specific jobs, but Morris and the research team ""considered it enough proof he was working for the Political Wing."" Cedric Geffen, president of Holocaust-memorial organisation March of the Living Australia, says he was ""fascinated"" by Lale's story. ""I had not given much thought to the question of the identity of the tattooist and whether or not they had been prisoners whom the Nazis forced into doing this unthinkable task,"" he says. ""I personally had not really reflected at length or in depth about the many questions around this role and the ramifications for the tattooist."" For Geffen, telling this story helps younger generations, those who never lived through these horrors, forge connections with history. ""It breaks it down into tangible emotions and experiences that undoubtedly accompanied each and every person that went through this period, most of whom did not live to tell their story,"" Geffen says. ""It is important to tell this story as it humanises a role that very few people think about when thinking about this horrific period,"" he adds. ""Who was the person tasked with inflicting this horrendous physical degradation? Why did he do it? What was his life like? Whatever happened to him?""

She said she had refused a Â£45,000 rise as it still left a ""big gap"" between her and her male counterparts when all she wanted was to be ""made equal"".

Neither Ms Gracie, nor Ms Adler appeared on a list issued by the BBC last July, listing the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year. The US editor, Jon Sopel, earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999 - in Ms Gracie's words, ""at least 50% more"" than herself and Ms Adler.

Gender pay gap: More than 500 firms reveal their figures Ms Gracie told Radio 4's Woman's Hour the BBC had offered to raise her annual salary to Â£180,000, but she did not see that as a solution and there would still have been ""a big gap between myself and my male peers"". Asked whether those male workers should receive a pay cut, Ms Gracie said: ""I believe in public service broadcasting and I do think salaries at the top are unacceptably high... but I don't have the information to say this needs to happen or that should happen."" She added: ""I could not go back to China and collude knowingly in what I consider to be unlawful pay discrimination. I could not do it, nor could I stay silent and watch the BBC perpetuate a failing pay structure by discriminating against women."" This video can not be played Journalist Mariella Frostrup tells Today the gender pay situation hasn't improved in her lifetime Due to the BBC's impartiality rules, presenter Jane Garvey - who had tweeted support for Ms Gracie - said she was unable to conduct the interview. Instead, despite Ms Gracie being in the Woman's Hour studio, the interview was carried out by freelance journalistJane Martinson, from a radio car. BBC guidelines dictate that reporters should should not be ""exposed to conflicts of interest"", and there must be ""editorial separation"" of those reporting the story. Earlier, co-presenting the Today programme with John Humphrys, Ms Gracie said: ""The support I have had in the last few hours over this, I think it does speak to the depth of hunger for an equal, fair and transparent pay system."" Influential media in China have given prominent attention to Carrie Gracie's resignation as China editor, but have made no comment on her work. Global Times and China Daily highlighted her statement that women at the BBC are generally paid significantly less than men, and broadcaster CCTV shares a picture of Ms Gracie from her Twitter page holding an #equalpayday sign. Some social media users on the popular Sina Weibo praise her for speaking out and say they ""support"" her. ""We need to be treated equally!"" says one user, receiving hundreds of likes. Some say that men and women are paid the same in China, and one blames ""capitalism"" on her pay. Other users give damning comments on articles she has written that they perceive to be anti-China. Source: BBC Monitoring In an open letter issued on Sunday, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom in London ""where I expect to be paid equally"".

""Despite the BBC's public insistence that my appointment demonstrated its commitment to gender equality, and despite my own insistence that equality was a condition of taking up the post, my managers had yet again judged that women's work was worth much less than men's."" She said ""patience and goodwill"" among female staff was running out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, who forced the corporation to disclose salaries above Â£150,000, criticised the director general Tony Hall for not resolving the ""substantial difference"" in men and women's pay ""at the top level"". He added: ""It's now quite a long time since those figures came out. And nothing, as far as we're aware, has really happened since."" In a statement, a BBC spokeswoman said ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" and the corporation would improve transparency on how pay is set. The BBC has said it hopes to close the gender pay gap by 2020, but this is different to the issue of equal pay. The gender pay gap is a measure of the difference between men's and women's average earnings in an organisation. Equal pay, as defined in the Equality Act 2010, means that men and women doing the same job should receive the same salary. There have been three investigations into gender pay: A report was published in October, in line with a requirement on all large organisations. It found the gender pay gap at the BBC was 9.3%, against a national average of 18.1% A judge-led audit of equal pay among rank-and-file staff found there was ""no question of any systemic gender discrimination"" A review into the BBC's approach to the pay of on-air presenters, editors and correspondents is still being carried out and will be published ""in the not too distant future"" Arriving at the Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles, actress Emma Watson said the BBC's commitment to equal pay was ""great... but we need to see them fulfil it"".

In case you missed any, you can find a complete list of this year's Golden Globe winnershere. And the final award of the evening goes to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which beats Call Me by Your Name, Dunkirk, The Post and The Shape of Water to be named best film drama. Its victory brings the ceremony to a slightly muted ending, enlivened slightly by Sam Rockwell stepping up to the microphone (after producer Graham Broadbent) to thank his agent. One of the tightest races of the night is won by Frances McDormand for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Some had expected Britain's Sally Hawkins to nick it for The Shape of Water, but in the end it was the Fargo Oscar winner who swung the votes of the HFPA membership. McDormand - who gets a thumbs up from Meryl Streep for promising to buy drinks for her fellow nominees - thanks the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, not least ""for electing a female president"" in Meher Tatna. She also has this to say in a speech whose occasionally fruity language tests the reflexes of the NBC censors. It was really great to be in this room tonight and be part of a tectonic shift in the power structure.  Trust me, the women in this room are not here for the food. They're in it for the work.  British actor Gary Oldman scoops the award for his portrayal as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. And he made sure to thank the wartime prime minister himself in his acceptance speech. He told the audience:  I'm very proud of Darkest Hour. It illustrates that words and actions can change the world - and boy, oh boy, does it need some changing.  He also thanked the make up artists who transformed him 63 times, and gave a special thanks to his wife Gisele Schmidt. She would say to friends, 'I go to bed with Winston Churchill and wake up with Gary Oldman.' Which I suppose is better than the other way around.  And the award goes to... Lady Bird! Nice to see a film written and directed by a woman get this prize in this year of all years, especially as Greta Gerwig was rather questionably denied a best director nod. In a breathless speech, the 34-year-old thanks her female leads Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf - ""the goddesses"" - before paying tribute to her home town.  I want to thank the people of Sacramento who gave me roots and wings and helped me get where I am today.  Lady Bird is her directorial debut. Ireland's Saoirse Ronan beats Emma Stone, Margot Robbie and a pair of Dames - Judi Dench and Helen Mirren - to be named best actress in a comedy or musical for the charming coming-of-age tale Lady Bird. The 23-year-old gives a shout-out to her mother Monica, who she says is watching on FaceTime. (Other videotelephony services are available.) She also says ""how inspirational it is to be in this room tonight"". Here's just a taste of some of the reaction. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Hard to be too surprised at Big Little Lies beating Fargo, Feud, The Sinner and Top of the Lake to the best miniseries award. It's the show's fourth award of the night, after Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard's acting accolades earlier. Here's what star and executive producer Reese Witherspoon had to say about the evening's dominant theme.  I want to thank everyone who broke their silence this year and spoke out against abuse and harassment. You are so brave.  We see you. We hear you. And we will tell your stories.  The award goes to Mexico's Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water, a beguiling fable about a mute janitor who falls for an amphibian fish creature. (Yes, really.) Before he wins, though, presenter Natalie Portman makes the point that all of the directors up for the award this year are male. It's the director's first Golden Globe - a point he makes when he is nearly played off stage. Luckily, he's given a bit more time to finish his speech. Actress and chat show legend Oprah Winfrey, winner of this year's Cecil B DeMille award for ""outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment"", brings the audience to their feet with a rousing speech. As the first black woman to get the award, she says it is ""an honor and a privilege"". But she also has powerful words to say about the importance of a free press - and the importance of speaking out against intolerance and abuse.   We know the press is under siege these days. We also know it's the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice. To tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies.  What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. And I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories.  I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they, like my mother, had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They're the women whose names we'll never know.  For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of brutally powerful men. But their time is up. Their time is up!  I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon. And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say 'Me too' again.  This one goes to Aziz Ansari, for Master of None - which he created, as well as being its star. It's his first Golden Globe - though he's been nominated before.   I genuinely didn't think I was going to win, because all the websites said I was going to lose.  I'm glad we won this one, because it would have really sucked to lose two of these in a row.  He also thanks Italy, ""for all the amazing food we ate in season two"". Ansari, 34, is the
first Asian American actor to win a Golden Globe for best leading performance
in a TV comedy. This one goes to Amazon's The Marvelous Mrs Maisel - its second award of the night. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino should also win the awards for best headgear, as she's sporting a truly fantastic hat, and for this on-stage comment: I'm going backstage. Is there cheese backstage?  Another British winner! Ewan McGregor thanks his Fargo co-star Mary Elizabeth Winstead (also believed to be his partner) - as well as his estranged wife Eve Mavrakis, ""who always stood by me for 22 years"" - in his acceptance speech. The Scotsman also gives thanks to his four children and says he has ""always loved being an actor"". Hugh Grant reunites with Sarah Jessica Parker - his co-star in 2009's Did You Hear About the Morgans? - to present this year's best foreign film award to Germany's In the Fade. Director Fatih Akin is joined on stage by actress Diane Kruger, who stars in the film as a mother whose husband and son are killed in a neo-Nazi bomb attack. The film's win comes at the expense of both Palme d'Or winner The Square and Angelina Jolie's Cambodia-set Netflix title First They Killed My Father.  A standing ovation for Kirk Douglas, who turned 101 last month yet is here regardless, in a wheelchair, to soak up the plaudits of the Golden Globe audience. He's here with daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones to present the award for best movie screenplay to dark comedy drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Britain's Martin McDonagh, who also directed the film, collects the prize and says hello to his mother, ""who likes this kind of thing"".  Alison Janney wins for her role as Tonya Harding's tough-as-nails mother LaVona in I, Tonya. The former West Wing star says the former figure skater is in the audience and thanks her for ""sharing her story"". This is a story about truth and the perception of truth... It's an extraordinary movie. I'm so proud of it.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons. This year's Golden Globes ceremony was expected to be the most political in recent memory - and so it proved. Host Seth Meyers referenced the Hollywood harassment scandal with the caustic opener, ""Welcome, ladies and remaining gentlemen."" Star after A-list star walked the red carpet in black to show support for Time's Up, an initiative launched to fight sexual harassment in film and other industries. And on social media, little escaped the gaze of viewers who settled in to watch the drama unfold. Here are eight moments to raise a smile - or an eyebrow - from the Golden Globes 2018... Late-night TV host Meyers came out swinging with a series of near-the-mark jokes, including the following: ""It's 2018, marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn't. It's going to be a good year!"" ""There's a new era under way and I can tell, because it's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood."" Seth Meyers' savage humour included a joke about the death of Harvey Weinstein Addressing the elephant that ""isn't in the room"", he said: ""Harvey Weinstein isn't here tonight because I've heard rumours he's crazy and difficult to work with, but don't worry, he will be back in 20 years when he becomes the first person booed during the In Memoriam."" (Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.) ""For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won't be terrifying to hear your name read out loud. 'Did you hear about Willem Dafoe?' - 'Oh god no!' - 'He was nominated!' - 'Don't do that!'"" Reacting from the audience, Hollywood legend Dafoe produced a face that combined glee and terror in a single glorious grimace - and became an instant meme. Allow Twitter content?

Winfrey said we have lived for too long ""in a culture broken by brutally powerful men"".

The film is about the making of the legendary 2003 movie The Room, a cult classic once lauded as ""the best worst movie ever made"". Tommy Wiseau, who wrote, directed and acted in the original film, accompanied Franco to the stage to claim the prize - and had to be hustled off the mic when he tried to take over. Fans of The Room were ecstatic, and the man himself downright chuffed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro won the Globe for fantasy romance The Shape Of Water, the story of a lonely janitor who falls in love with an amphibious creature.

Actress Elisabeth Moss and producer Bruce Miller pose with their awards for The Handmaid's Tale Its star Elisabeth Moss, who plays Offred, also won the best actress in a drama prize - and credited author Margaret Atwood for writing the dystopian novel behind the show. She read out a quote from Atwood, which runs: ""We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories."" Thanking the legion of women who have fought for equality, Moss concluded: ""We no longer live in the gaps between the stories.

"Justine Greening has resigned from the government after refusing a job as work and pensions secretary in Theresa May's cabinet reshuffle. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM was ""disappointed"" the ex-education secretary had quit. She has been replaced by Damian Hinds, while Esther McVey has been promoted to be the new work and pensions secretary. Brandon Lewis is Tory chairman, Matt Hancock is culture secretary and Karen Bradley is Northern Ireland secretary. She replaces James Brokenshire, who resigned for health reasons. The reshuffle continues with junior ministerial roles on Tuesday. Laura Kuenssberg: Was May foiled in reshuffle aims? Who's in the cabinet and who's out? Ms Greening's resignation comes less than a month after she launched the government's social mobility strategy. In her resignation statement she said: ""Social mobility matters to me and our country more than a ministerial career. ""I'll continue to work outside of government to do everything I can to create a country for the first time that has equality of opportunity for young people wherever they are growing up."" In Mrs May's reshuffle, Mr Lewis, the immigration minister, replaces Sir Patrick McLoughlin as Conservative Party chairman, with James Cleverly as his deputy. Justice Secretary David Lidington has been moved to the Cabinet Office. Mr Lidington, who will deputise for Mrs May at PMQs, is succeeded by David Gauke - who is switching from work and pensions, where his responsibilities included the roll-out of universal credit. Damian Hinds is new education secretary Karen Bradley named new NI secretary NI Secretary James Brokenshire resigns Mr Lewis, the Great Yarmouth MP, has been a minister since 2012 and is a qualified barrister and former local councillor. In his role as chairman he will be tasked with broadening the Conservatives' appeal after they lost their Commons majority in June's general election. He will be assisted by Mr Cleverly, the pro-Brexit backbench MP for Braintree, and a new line-up of vice chairs with responsibility for different areas has also been announced. The replacement for Mr Brokenshire, who is awaiting surgery for a lung condition, will be at the heart of attempts to end the political deadlock at Stormont. Theresa May posed with the new CCHQ team outside No 10 James Brokenshire had been Northern Ireland secretary since July 2016 Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson are staying in their jobs. Jeremy Hunt, who had been touted for a possible move, remains in his job, which has been renamed secretary of state for health and social care. Also not moving is Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, but the word ""housing"" has been added to the title of his department. Labour said Mrs May should focus on the pressures in the NHS rather than what it said was a ""desperate PR exercise"".

Grant Shapps, Conservative party chairman between 2012 and 2015, said the reshuffle had not been ""brilliantly executed"" but praised plans for housing and health. ""There was some good stuff, strangely buried in a reshuffle that didn't quite go to plan,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. He said the addition of housing to the title of the communities department would give ""a lot more focus"" to government plans to build more homes - adding that plans to bring health and social care together were ""quite smart"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The government's big plan for the new year is to dodge the real issues and reshuffle the pack in a pointless and lacklustre PR exercise. ""It's simply not good enough. You can't make up for nearly eight years of failure by changing the name of a department."" Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Theresa May had mulled over her reshuffle for months. On Monday she felt daring enough to do it, after ending the tumult of 2017 with the government in better shape than for quite some time, despite the embarrassing departures of some of her colleagues. The task was not to make radical changes, the most senior jobs were never in question, but the plan was to get the right reformers into the right jobs in her view, and to plan for the future. The question of the long term will still be dealt with on Tuesday, when junior ministers are expected to be appointed, with far greater numbers of women and ethnic minority MPs, part of the Tories' effort to look more like the country they govern. Read the rest of Laura's blog The changes, which will be Mrs May's third reshuffle since becoming PM in July 2016, were triggered by her sacking of Damian Green last month as first secretary of state. Mr Green was fired from his position, a role in which he was effectively Mrs May's deputy, after making ""misleading statements"" to the press about pornography found on his office computer in 2008. Mr Lidington has replaced Mr Green in the Cabinet Office but has not been made first secretary. Downing Street confirmed he would stand in at Prime Minister's Questions and take over a ""significant"" number of the committees that Mr Green chaired. Andrea Leadsom remains as Leader of the Commons, and Liz Truss will continue her role as chief secretary to the Treasury. Social care and health - by Hugh Pym, BBC health editor There have been increasing calls for an integration of health and social care in England - the two areas are already combined in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Cuts in social care funding in England have been blamed by some as a factor in the pressures on the NHS - with delays discharging medically fit patients from hospital caused by problems finding social care provision. The Department of Health already has responsibility for social care - but it is run by local authorities, partly paid for by council tax, and the central Whitehall grant comes through the Department for Communities and Local Government. It is not clear whether that grant will now move across to the rebranded Department of Health and Social Care. A Government policy paper on social care, known as a Green Paper, is due next summer - and it seems likely that Jeremy Hunt will now play a central role in preparing that document, rather than it staying with the cabinet office.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons. Powerful speeches about Hollywood's sexual abuse scandal have dominated the 75th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first major Hollywood awards ceremony since the film industry was hit by sexual harassment scandals, with stars wearing black to honour victims. Oprah Winfrey summed up the mood, saying ""a new day is on the horizon"" as she collected an honorary award. The big film winner of the night was Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which took home four awards. In pictures: Stars wear black on red carpet Eight highlights from the Golden Globes Oprah's speech in full Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won four awards It won the best film drama award, with its star Frances McDormand also picking up a trophy for best actress. The Oscar-winning actress stars as a grieving mother who challenges police over the fact her daughter's killer has not been found. Big Little Lies won the most awards in the television categories, including honours for its stars Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard. It was also named best limited TV series. Kidman won the first award of the night for her role as a victim of domestic violence. She dedicated her win to her castmates, daughters and mother, saying: ""Wow, the power of women."" The Golden Globes are organised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and are seen as an indicator of which films are likely to do well at the Oscars, which take place on 4 March. The ceremony and red carpet as it happened Golden Globes 2018: Full list of winners Funniest moments of the Globes The main focus on the night was on the current atmosphere in Hollywood and campaigns like Me Too andTime's Up, which are focused on bringing about change for women not only in the entertainment industry but also around the world. Many winners and presenters at the Beverly Hills ceremony addressed the ongoing scandal - with host Seth Meyers setting the tone with his opening monologue. Seth Meyers hosted the event for the first time ""Welcome ladies and remaining gentlemen,"" he told the gathered stars of film and TV, before saying: ""It's 2018 and marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn't. ""For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won't be terrifying to hear your name read out loud."" 17 of Seth Meyers's best jokes from the Globes Who could be taking home an Oscar? Meyers also jokingly encouraged Oprah Winfrey to run for president against Donald Trump. He referred to the 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner when he and Barack Obama mocked the idea of Trump becoming US president. ""Some have said that night convinced him to run,"" he continued. ""So, if that's true, I just want to say, Oprah, you will never be president. You do not have what it takes."" This video can not be played Actors including The Crown's Claire Foy and Matt Smith wore black on the 75th Golden Globes's red carpet It was Oprah whose speech had the biggest reaction, with stars applauding and rising to their feet. Speaking as she was awarded the honorary Cecil B DeMille trophy - the first black woman to get the honour - she said: ""Speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. ""For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up!"" Laura Dern (left) with other Big Little Lies stars The theme was echoed by Laura Dern, winner of a best supporting actress for Big Little Lies, who said: ""Many of us were taught not to tattle. ""It was a culture of silencing, and that was normalised... May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture's new North Star."" Barbra Streisand used her presenting slot to express outrage that she remains the only woman to win the best director award at the ceremony - and that was back in 1984. ""Folks, time's up,"" she said. ""We need more women directors and more women to be nominated for best director."" Greta Gerwig, whose directorial debut Lady Bird was named best musical or comedy film, could be seen being hugged by her film's star, Saoirse Ronan, as Streisand made her comments. Gerwig was not nominated in the directing category - an award won by The Shape of Water's Guillermo del Toro - but neither was any woman. It was a fact that did not escape Natalie Portman's notice as she presented the best director award, pointedly referring to the ""all male nominees"". Portman presented the best director award with Ron Howard While many Britons had been nominated for honours, only three won. Gary Oldman was named best actor for portraying Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour - a feat he revealed took 63 applications of make-up. Ewan McGregor won the award for best actor in a television series for Fargo Martin McDonagh picked up the best screenplay trophy for Three Billboards. Irish actress Ronan was named best actress in a film comedy for Lady Bird, while James Franco won the equivalent award for best actor for The Disaster Artist. In the TV categories, The Handmaid's Tale and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel did well, with two awards each. Elisabeth Moss, named best actress in a TV drama for The Handmaid's Tale, dedicated her win to author Margaret Atwood, whose book is the source material for the series. After reading a quote from Atwood, she told the audience: ""We no longer live in the gaps... we are the story in print and we are writing the story ourselves."" They were apt words for a night when Hollywood seemed determined to turn a new page. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon played the title roles in 1991's Thelma and Louise At the same time, the ceremony did allow itself a few nostalgic nods back to its glittering past. Kirk Douglas was given a rapturous reception, at the age of 101, as he came on stage to present an award with daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones. And there was an on-stage reunion for Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, 27 years on from their on-screen partnership in Thelma and Louise. Even here, though, pointed commentary was no more than a breath away. Announcing the nominees for best actor in a drama, Davis joked they had all ""agreed to give half of their salary back, so the women can make more than them"". HFPA President Meher Tatna Prior to the ceremony, most stars wore black on the red carpet, as a mark of solidarity with victims of sexual assault and harassment. Actresses wore black gowns while many men wore Time's Up pin badges or black shirts with their suits. Some stars, such as German model Barbara Meier and actress Bianca Blanco chose not to wear black. Meier explained her choice on Instagram, saying that women should be able to wear something ""a little more sexy"" and that it wasn't their fault that ""men cannot control themselves"". Hollywood Foreign Press Association President Meher Tatna also wore red, witha source telling The Wrap,external, ""she wore the dress that she chose with her mother.

"Who will take the seats at the cabinet table after the reshuffle? Prime ministers do not, as Theresa May well knows, have as much power to shape their fortunes as the trappings of the grand office suggests. However, one of the things they can control is the timing of reshuffles, and at least the initial set of decisions. They are the moment when the boss does the hiring and firing of their team - to punish or reward and to position supporters or enemies into the most politically convenient spots. Whether reshuffles are forced upon leaders by political accidents, such as scandals or resignations, or a desire to refresh the look and direction of the government - it is both in this case - as with many other big set piece moments in politics, they are times of huge potential reward, but huge risk too. Because of that, there are a few conventions, if not rules, to bear in mind: Prime ministers need to avoid creating a bigger problem than the one they sought to solve by getting rid of an awkward colleague. Disgruntled at being sacked, annoyed at being ignored, some fired ministers will go on to become bigger irritants on the backbenches - where they can arguably cause more trouble than they did around the cabinet table. There, at least publicly, their loyalty was more or less guaranteed. Ministers sometimes refuse to budge when they are told they are being moved, and conversely, others being offered jobs inside government sometimes turn them down. The responses of individuals can disrupt the best laid plans. There is not necessarily a direct relationship between successful reshuffles and prime ministerial authority. Strong leaders have botched them sometimes. But clever reshuffles can embolden weak prime ministers. Unless a reshuffle is epic - don't expect that this time - the public probably doesn't notice very much, as, quite rightly, the majority of people have got more to worry about than who the new parliamentary under secretary for paper clips is. But they do matter to political parties very much. Reshuffles can erase old grudges and create new ones in the space of a few short hours. And, of course, they matter hugely to government departments and people whose lives are affected by the decisions in one sector or another. Reshuffle days in Westminster are like bingo for political observers, but the decisions made have much bigger ramifications after that frenzied 24 hours. Even limited ministerial moves mean that different decisions and different priorities can be set in Whitehall that have real consequences for the country. Who is in charge of the government's existing plans does make a difference. Despite that, new faces alone don't mean a new direction. Changing the personnel doesn't necessarily reset the government. This time, with the posteriors on the biggest seats in government expected to stay the same, don't expect Theresa May to change tack substantially.

"Damian Green, one of Theresa May's closest allies, has been sacked from the cabinet after an inquiry found he had breached the ministerial code. He was ""asked to quit"" after he was found to have made ""inaccurate and misleading"" statements over what he knew about claims pornography was found on his office computer in 2008. He also apologised for making writer Kate Maltby feel uncomfortable in 2015. Laura Kuenssberg said the PM ""had little choice but to ask him to go"". The BBC's political editor said the departure of a close friend left Mrs May a ""lonelier figure"". Mr Green, 61, who as first secretary of state was effectively the PM's deputy, is the third cabinet minister to resign in the space of two months - Sir Michael Fallon and Priti Patel both quit in November. This video can not be played Theresa May ""will miss his advice, will miss his support"" - Laura Kuenssberg on Damian Green sacking In her written response, Mrs May expressed ""deep regret"" at Mr Green's departure but said his actions ""fell short"" of the conduct expected of a cabinet minister. Like Mrs May, Mr Green campaigned for Remain in last year's EU referendum and had been a leading voice in Cabinet for a ""softer"" Brexit. He had been under investigation regarding allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards journalist and Tory activist Ms Maltby. He denied suggestions that he made unwanted advances towards her in 2015. He also denied that he had either downloaded or viewed pornography on a computer removed from his Commons office in 2008 andsaid police had ""never suggested to me that improper material was found"".,external In his resignation letter, Mr Green said statements he made about what he knew about the pornography could have been ""clearer"", conceding that his lawyers had been informed by Met Police lawyers about their initial discovery in 2008 and the police had also raised the matter with him in a phone call in 2013. ""I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point,"" he said. Laura Kuenssberg: Theresa May loses one of the few who understood her Profile: Who is Damian Green? May: I asked you to resign Damian Green: Timeline of his downfall Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Green had ""lied"" about ""a particular incident"" and that was why he had to go but it was a ""sad moment"". Asked if his departure left Theresa May more isolated, he said ""leadership is lonely"" but she had shown ""extraordinary resilience in very challenging circumstances"" and was someone ""who is capable of taking very difficult decisions"". This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC An official report by the Cabinet Office found that public statements he made relating to what he knew about the claims were ""inaccurate and misleading"" and constituted a breach of the ministerial code. The report also found that although there were ""competing and contradictory accounts of what were private meetings"" between himself and Ms Maltby, the investigation found her account ""to be plausible"". Her parents, Colin and Victoria Maltby, said in a statement they were not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been ""untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness"". They praised their 31-year-old daughter for her courage in speaking out about the ""abuse of authority"". Ms Maltby is not commenting on Mr Green's resignation until she receives more details from the Cabinet Office. Damian Green was a confidant of the prime minister for many years Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Damian Green has never been a politician with a huge public persona, or even a hugely well-known character. But he was an extremely important ally of Theresa May. Not just a political friend but a genuine one, close to her for decades. The government, so the joke in Westminster goes, has become ""weak and stable"", with number 10 taking back some control of the agenda in recent weeks. So it is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil. But the prime minister clearly took this decision very seriously. She is a politician who guards her views, her own persona very closely. To lose one of the few who understood her, who she trusts, leaves her a lonelier figure. Read Laura's full blog In her reply, the PM said while the report had found his conduct to have been ""professional and proper"" in general, it was right that he had apologised for making Ms Maltby ""feel uncomfortable"". Addressing breaches of the ministerial code, she added: ""While I can understand the considerable distress caused to you by some of the allegations made in the past few weeks, I know that you share my commitment to maintaining the high standards that the public demands of ministers of the crown. ""It is therefore with deep regret that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Green's political future has been in question since Ms Maltby claimed in an article in the Times that the minister ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015 and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message which left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"". Mr Green, an acquaintance of the journalist's parents, said the claims were ""hurtful"" and ""completely false"". Kate Maltby's account was found to be plausible, the report says But they were referred for investigation by top civil servant Sue Gray - who is examining other claims that emerged during a swirl of allegations about harassment and other misconduct at Westminster. The inquiry was subsequently expanded to consider claims that legal pornography was found on a computer removed from Mr Green's office in the House of Commons in 2008. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today Damian Green clearly breached ministerial code but calls sacking a ""sad moment"" It was one of a number of possessions seized by the police during a controversial inquiry into the leaking of official documents by a civil servant to Mr Green, at the time a shadow Home Office minister under David Cameron. Mrs May, who has known Mr Green since they were contemporaries at Oxford, brought him into the cabinet after she became PM in 2016 and promoted him to first secretary of state in July. Since then, he has played a substantial role behind the scenes chairing key cabinet committees and has also deputised for Mrs May at Prime Minister's Questions. It is not clear who will replace him in those roles but unconfirmed reports have suggested there will be no announcement until the New Year, with Parliament due to go on recess on Thursday.

"Fewer women who suffer a heart attack would die if they were given the same treatments as men, according to researchers. They analysed the outcomes of 180,368 Swedish patients who suffered a heart attack over a 10-year period. Women were two times more likely to die from the most serious type of heart attack than men in the year after having one. Researcher believe it is due to differences in the care given. The team from the University of Leeds and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden analysed data from Sweden's online cardiac registry. They found women were on average less likely than men to receive the recommended treatments after a potentially fatal type of heart attack called a STEMI. This is the most serious type of heart attack where the coronary artery is completely blocked by a blood clot and it requires urgent treatment. In the study, women who had a STEMI were 34% less likely to receive procedures which clear blocked arteries, such as bypass surgery and stents. They were also 24% less likely to be prescribed statin medication, which helps to prevent a second heart attack, and 16% less likely to be given aspirin, which helps to prevent blood clots. This is despite guidelines suggesting all three treatments should be given to both genders. The study found that when women did receive all the recommended treatments, the gap in mortality between the sexes decreased in almost all circumstances. Sex unlikely to cause cardiac arrest, study finds Early baldness higher heart disease risk factor than obesity, says study 'Instant' blood test for heart attacks Can you have a heart attack and not realise it? Roughly 124,000 men and 70,000 women are hospitalised for heart attacks in the UK per year. Co-author of the study Prof Chris Gale, from the University of Leeds, said gender biases for heart disease occur in the UK too. ""There's misconception amongst the general public and healthcare professionals about what heart attack patients are like. ""Typically, when we think of a heart attack patient, we see a middle-aged man who is overweight, has diabetes and smokes. ""This is not always the case; heart attacks affect the wider spectrum of the population - including women."" Prof Gale said that from their very first point of contact with healthcare professionals,women are less likely to receive the same diagnostic tests,,externalleading them to be50% more likely to be initially misdiagnosed.,external ""That then feeds the whole pathway of care,"" he said. ""If you missed the first, earliest opportunity for care - you're much more likely to miss the next point of contact - and it all adds up cumulatively and leads to a greater mortality."" The study also found that women were more likely to suffer from other illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, but these did not fully account for the difference in mortality. While this analysis uses Swedish data, the researchers argue that the situation for women in the UK is likely to be worse asmore die from heart attacks,externaland there isgreater variation in how care is delivered.,external ""Sweden is a leader in healthcare, with one of the lowest mortality rates from heart attacks, yet we still see this disparity in treatment and outcomes between men and women,""  added Prof Gale. Prof Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the work, said: ""The findings from this research are concerning. ""We urgently need to raise awareness of this issue as it's something that can be easily changed. By simply ensuring more women receive the recommended treatments, we'll be able to help more families avoid the heartbreak of losing a loved one to heart disease.""

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for right reasons. Powerful speeches about Hollywood's sexual abuse scandal have dominated the 75th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first major Hollywood awards ceremony since the film industry was hit by sexual harassment scandals, with stars wearing black to honour victims. Oprah Winfrey summed up the mood, saying ""a new day is on the horizon"" as she collected an honorary award. The big film winner of the night was Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which took home four awards. In pictures: Stars wear black on red carpet Eight highlights from the Golden Globes Oprah's speech in full Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won four awards It won the best film drama award, with its star Frances McDormand also picking up a trophy for best actress. The Oscar-winning actress stars as a grieving mother who challenges police over the fact her daughter's killer has not been found. Big Little Lies won the most awards in the television categories, including honours for its stars Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard. It was also named best limited TV series. Kidman won the first award of the night for her role as a victim of domestic violence. She dedicated her win to her castmates, daughters and mother, saying: ""Wow, the power of women."" The Golden Globes are organised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and are seen as an indicator of which films are likely to do well at the Oscars, which take place on 4 March. The ceremony and red carpet as it happened Golden Globes 2018: Full list of winners Funniest moments of the Globes The main focus on the night was on the current atmosphere in Hollywood and campaigns like Me Too andTime's Up, which are focused on bringing about change for women not only in the entertainment industry but also around the world. Many winners and presenters at the Beverly Hills ceremony addressed the ongoing scandal - with host Seth Meyers setting the tone with his opening monologue. Seth Meyers hosted the event for the first time ""Welcome ladies and remaining gentlemen,"" he told the gathered stars of film and TV, before saying: ""It's 2018 and marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn't. ""For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won't be terrifying to hear your name read out loud."" 17 of Seth Meyers's best jokes from the Globes Who could be taking home an Oscar? Meyers also jokingly encouraged Oprah Winfrey to run for president against Donald Trump. He referred to the 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner when he and Barack Obama mocked the idea of Trump becoming US president. ""Some have said that night convinced him to run,"" he continued. ""So, if that's true, I just want to say, Oprah, you will never be president. You do not have what it takes."" This video can not be played Actors including The Crown's Claire Foy and Matt Smith wore black on the 75th Golden Globes's red carpet It was Oprah whose speech had the biggest reaction, with stars applauding and rising to their feet. Speaking as she was awarded the honorary Cecil B DeMille trophy - the first black woman to get the honour - she said: ""Speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. ""For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up!"" Laura Dern (left) with other Big Little Lies stars The theme was echoed by Laura Dern, winner of a best supporting actress for Big Little Lies, who said: ""Many of us were taught not to tattle. ""It was a culture of silencing, and that was normalised... May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture's new North Star."" Barbra Streisand used her presenting slot to express outrage that she remains the only woman to win the best director award at the ceremony - and that was back in 1984. ""Folks, time's up,"" she said. ""We need more women directors and more women to be nominated for best director."" Greta Gerwig, whose directorial debut Lady Bird was named best musical or comedy film, could be seen being hugged by her film's star, Saoirse Ronan, as Streisand made her comments. Gerwig was not nominated in the directing category - an award won by The Shape of Water's Guillermo del Toro - but neither was any woman. It was a fact that did not escape Natalie Portman's notice as she presented the best director award, pointedly referring to the ""all male nominees"". Portman presented the best director award with Ron Howard While many Britons had been nominated for honours, only three won. Gary Oldman was named best actor for portraying Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour - a feat he revealed took 63 applications of make-up. Ewan McGregor won the award for best actor in a television series for Fargo Martin McDonagh picked up the best screenplay trophy for Three Billboards. Irish actress Ronan was named best actress in a film comedy for Lady Bird, while James Franco won the equivalent award for best actor for The Disaster Artist. In the TV categories, The Handmaid's Tale and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel did well, with two awards each. Elisabeth Moss, named best actress in a TV drama for The Handmaid's Tale, dedicated her win to author Margaret Atwood, whose book is the source material for the series. After reading a quote from Atwood, she told the audience: ""We no longer live in the gaps... we are the story in print and we are writing the story ourselves."" They were apt words for a night when Hollywood seemed determined to turn a new page. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon played the title roles in 1991's Thelma and Louise At the same time, the ceremony did allow itself a few nostalgic nods back to its glittering past. Kirk Douglas was given a rapturous reception, at the age of 101, as he came on stage to present an award with daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones. And there was an on-stage reunion for Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, 27 years on from their on-screen partnership in Thelma and Louise. Even here, though, pointed commentary was no more than a breath away. Announcing the nominees for best actor in a drama, Davis joked they had all ""agreed to give half of their salary back, so the women can make more than them"". HFPA President Meher Tatna Prior to the ceremony, most stars wore black on the red carpet, as a mark of solidarity with victims of sexual assault and harassment. Actresses wore black gowns while many men wore Time's Up pin badges or black shirts with their suits. Some stars, such as German model Barbara Meier and actress Bianca Blanco chose not to wear black. Meier explained her choice on Instagram, saying that women should be able to wear something ""a little more sexy"" and that it wasn't their fault that ""men cannot control themselves"". Hollywood Foreign Press Association President Meher Tatna also wore red, witha source telling The Wrap,external, ""she wore the dress that she chose with her mother.

"Steve Bannon created a rift with his former boss, the president, with remarks to author Michael Wolff Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former chief strategist, has tried to reverse remarks in which he called the president's son Donald Jr ""treasonous"". The accusation appears in Michael Wolff's new book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. He was referring to a meeting in June 2016 between Mr Trump's son and a group of Russians. But on Sunday Mr Bannon said the barb was directed at former aide Paul Manafort, who was also present. The Senate, House of Representatives and a special counsel are all investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, allegations denied by both the Kremlin and Donald Trump. In a statement first reported by news site Axios, Steve Bannon called Donald Jr ""both a patriot and a good man"". ""My comments were aimed at Paul Manafort, a seasoned campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the Russians operate,"" he said. ""He should have known they are duplicitous, cunning and not our friends. To reiterate, those comments were not aimed at Don Jr."" The debate over Trump's mental health Trump's fear of poisoning and other extraordinary claims Winners and losers from Bannon feud The original remark, published in Mr Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, and not disputed by Mr Bannon, appeared to take aim at all three Trump campaign officials in the room, including Donald Jr. It read: ""The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. ""Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."" This video can not be played President Trump: ""I consider it [the book] a work of fiction"" Mr Bannon's attempt to clarify follows repeated denunciations by Mr Trump, who dubbed him ""Sloppy Steve"" and said his former aide ""cried when he got fired"". It also follows the loss of the main financial backer of his conservative Breitbart website, heiress Rebekah Mercer, who said in a rare public statement that she had cut off Mr Bannon from funding following his remarks to Mr Wolff. Mr Bannon went on in his statement to say he regretted waiting five days to say something, and called Mr Wolff's reporting ""inaccurate"". Fire and Fury rocketed to the top of the Amazon bestseller list upon publication last week and became the talk of Washington DC and beyond. Based on first-hand reporting at the White House and, according to the author, more than 200 interviews with top administration figures and others, it portrays the president as impatient, unable to focus and with no interest in reading or attempting to understand policy. It also raised doubts over his mental fitness for office, quoting senior officials who allegedly called the president ""mentally unfit"", and ""idiot"", and ""like a child"". Mr Trump responded by tweeting that he was a ""very stable genius"" who was ""like, very smart"". Who is author Michael Wolff? More revelations from the book Senior Trump administration officials rallied around the president over the weekend, attempting to mitigate the fallout from the book. CIA chief Mike Pompeo told Fox News Sunday the portrayal was ""pure fantasy"". He said: ""The president is engaged, he understands the complexity, he asks really difficult questions of our team at the CIA."" Policy adviser Stephen Miller told CNN Mr Trump was a ""political genius"" and branded Mr Wolff ""a garbage author of a garbage book"". The controversy has sent the book to the top of bestseller lists Defending himself on NBC, the author said he had no anti-Trump agenda when he began the project. ""I would have been delighted to have written a contrarian account here,"" he said. ""'Donald Trump, this unexpected president, is actually going to succeed.' Okay, that's not the story. He is not going to succeed. This is worse than everybody thought.""

"This video can not be played Huge plumes of smoke were seen rising from the tanker There are fears of an environmental disaster in the East China Sea as a tanker continues leaking oil two days after colliding with a cargo ship. Chinese officials have told state media the Sanchi is in danger of exploding and sinking. Rescuers trying to reach the burning tanker were beaten back by toxic clouds, the transport ministry says. The body of one crewman, among the 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis on board, has been found. The rest are missing. The spill Shetland survived,external Torrey Canyon: The day the sea turned black Is crude oil killing Nigeria's children? Exposure to oil sends birds off course The Panama-flagged Sanchi was bringing its cargo of oil from Iran to South Korea when it collided with the Hong Kong-registered freighter CF Crystal, carrying grain from the US, in the East China Sea. The incident occurred about 260km (160 miles) off the coast of Shanghai. The collision, in the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta, occurred on Saturday evening. The exact cause of the collision is not yet known. The tanker, run by Iran's leading oil shipping operator, has on board 136,000 tonnes of condensate, which is an ultra-light version of crude oil. That is about one million barrels and at current prices is worth roughly $60m (Â£44m). The Sanchi will also be carrying a certain amount of heavy - and toxic - shipping fuel. Condensate is very different from the black crude that is often seen in oil spills. It exists in gas form within high-pressure oil reservoirs and liquefies once extracted. It is highly toxic, low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude oil. Condensate, which does not need the heavy refining process of denser crude, creates products such as jet fuel, petrol, diesel and heating fuel. Condensate is certainly toxic. It is much lighter in colour and odour than heavy crudes, potentially making it a lot harder to detect and contain. Simon Boxall, of the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton, told the BBC there was another difference: ""It's not like crude, which does break down under natural microbial action; this stuff actually kills the microbes that break the oil down."" It cannot be picked off the surface like heavy crude. Dr Boxall said the best hope was to put out the fire and stop the ship from sinking. ""If she sinks with a lot of cargo intact, then you have a time bomb on the sea bed which will slowly release the condensate."" He added: ""There could be a long-term exclusion of fishing for many hundreds of kilometres in this area."" The Sanchi was still ablaze on Monday morning. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said weather conditions were ""not that favourable for search and rescue work"". A Chinese fire-fighting vessel tackles the blaze on the Sanchi There are no signs of survivors among the 32-strong crew, although the 21 Chinese nationals on the grain freighter were rescued. China has sent several ships to carry out search-and-rescue operations, while South Korea helped with a coast guard ship and a helicopter. The US Navy also sent a military aircraft to help with the rescue efforts. It is impossible to say at this point because it is unknown how much oil has been, or will be, spilled. The Sanchi's one million barrels is about 35 million gallons. Even if all of it spilled, it would be less than the major ship disasters listed below, but more than three times the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, which is considered one of the world's worst environmental disasters. So, how much the spill affects the environment depends on the location where it occurred. The Atlantic Empress incident listed below - the record spill from ships - saw little oil reach coastlines. Cleaning up after the Torrey Canyon disaster in 1967 There are also a lot of different types of spill. Arguably the worst was the deliberate release of up to 500 million gallons by the Iraqis in January 1991 during the Gulf War. The resultant slick covered some 10,300 sq km (4,000 sq miles). As far as ships are concerned: The Atlantic Empress and Aegean Captain collided off Trinidad and Tobago in 1979. The Atlantic Empress exploded and 26 crew members died. The 90 million gallon oil spill is a record from ships The ABT Summer exploded off Angola in 1991, spilling about 80 million gallons over 200 sq km The Castillo de Bellver caught fire and broke apart off Cape Town, spilling 78 million gallons The Amoco Cadiz spilled almost 69 million gallons after running aground off Brittany in France in 1978 The Torrey Canyon hit a reef off Cornwall, England, in 1967, spilling 36 million gallons of crude and affecting almost 200 miles of coastline The Exxon Valdez only spilled 11 million gallons in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989 but was a major environmental disaster Dozens missing as ships collide off China Women on mission to 'clean up oceans' Oil spill threatens popular Athens beaches At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

One of the tightest races of the night is won by Frances McDormand for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Some had expected Britain's Sally Hawkins to nick it for The Shape of Water, but in the end it was the Fargo Oscar winner who swung the votes of the HFPA membership. McDormand - who gets a thumbs up from Meryl Streep for promising to buy drinks for her fellow nominees - thanks the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, not least ""for electing a female president"" in Meher Tatna. She also has this to say in a speech whose occasionally fruity language tests the reflexes of the NBC censors. It was really great to be in this room tonight and be part of a tectonic shift in the power structure.  Trust me, the women in this room are not here for the food. They're in it for the work.  British actor Gary Oldman scoops the award for his portrayal as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. And he made sure to thank the wartime prime minister himself in his acceptance speech. He told the audience:  I'm very proud of Darkest Hour. It illustrates that words and actions can change the world - and boy, oh boy, does it need some changing.  He also thanked the make up artists who transformed him 63 times, and gave a special thanks to his wife Gisele Schmidt. She would say to friends, 'I go to bed with Winston Churchill and wake up with Gary Oldman.' Which I suppose is better than the other way around.  And the award goes to... Lady Bird! Nice to see a film written and directed by a woman get this prize in this year of all years, especially as Greta Gerwig was rather questionably denied a best director nod. In a breathless speech, the 34-year-old thanks her female leads Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf - ""the goddesses"" - before paying tribute to her home town.  I want to thank the people of Sacramento who gave me roots and wings and helped me get where I am today.  Lady Bird is her directorial debut. Ireland's Saoirse Ronan beats Emma Stone, Margot Robbie and a pair of Dames - Judi Dench and Helen Mirren - to be named best actress in a comedy or musical for the charming coming-of-age tale Lady Bird. The 23-year-old gives a shout-out to her mother Monica, who she says is watching on FaceTime. (Other videotelephony services are available.) She also says ""how inspirational it is to be in this room tonight"". Here's just a taste of some of the reaction. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Hard to be too surprised at Big Little Lies beating Fargo, Feud, The Sinner and Top of the Lake to the best miniseries award. It's the show's fourth award of the night, after Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard's acting accolades earlier. Here's what star and executive producer Reese Witherspoon had to say about the evening's dominant theme.  I want to thank everyone who broke their silence this year and spoke out against abuse and harassment. You are so brave.  We see you. We hear you. And we will tell your stories.  The award goes to Mexico's Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water, a beguiling fable about a mute janitor who falls for an amphibian fish creature. (Yes, really.) Before he wins, though, presenter Natalie Portman makes the point that all of the directors up for the award this year are male. It's the director's first Golden Globe - a point he makes when he is nearly played off stage. Luckily, he's given a bit more time to finish his speech. Actress and chat show legend Oprah Winfrey, winner of this year's Cecil B DeMille award for ""outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment"", brings the audience to their feet with a rousing speech. As the first black woman to get the award, she says it is ""an honor and a privilege"". But she also has powerful words to say about the importance of a free press - and the importance of speaking out against intolerance and abuse.   We know the press is under siege these days. We also know it's the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice. To tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies.  What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. And I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories.  I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they, like my mother, had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They're the women whose names we'll never know.  For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of brutally powerful men. But their time is up. Their time is up!  I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon. And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say 'Me too' again.  This one goes to Aziz Ansari, for Master of None - which he created, as well as being its star. It's his first Golden Globe - though he's been nominated before.   I genuinely didn't think I was going to win, because all the websites said I was going to lose.  I'm glad we won this one, because it would have really sucked to lose two of these in a row.  He also thanks Italy, ""for all the amazing food we ate in season two"". Ansari, 34, is the
first Asian American actor to win a Golden Globe for best leading performance
in a TV comedy. This one goes to Amazon's The Marvelous Mrs Maisel - its second award of the night. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino should also win the awards for best headgear, as she's sporting a truly fantastic hat, and for this on-stage comment: I'm going backstage. Is there cheese backstage?  Another British winner! Ewan McGregor thanks his Fargo co-star Mary Elizabeth Winstead (also believed to be his partner) - as well as his estranged wife Eve Mavrakis, ""who always stood by me for 22 years"" - in his acceptance speech. The Scotsman also gives thanks to his four children and says he has ""always loved being an actor"". Hugh Grant reunites with Sarah Jessica Parker - his co-star in 2009's Did You Hear About the Morgans? - to present this year's best foreign film award to Germany's In the Fade. Director Fatih Akin is joined on stage by actress Diane Kruger, who stars in the film as a mother whose husband and son are killed in a neo-Nazi bomb attack. The film's win comes at the expense of both Palme d'Or winner The Square and Angelina Jolie's Cambodia-set Netflix title First They Killed My Father.  A standing ovation for Kirk Douglas, who turned 101 last month yet is here regardless, in a wheelchair, to soak up the plaudits of the Golden Globe audience. He's here with daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones to present the award for best movie screenplay to dark comedy drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Britain's Martin McDonagh, who also directed the film, collects the prize and says hello to his mother, ""who likes this kind of thing"".  Alison Janney wins for her role as Tonya Harding's tough-as-nails mother LaVona in I, Tonya. The former West Wing star says the former figure skater is in the audience and thanks her for ""sharing her story"". This is a story about truth and the perception of truth... It's an extraordinary movie. I'm so proud of it.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Boots is the largest pharmacy company in Europe and the US Some Boots pharmacy staff say they are under too much pressure and fear mistakes will be made. One whistleblower, a former manager, said he resigned in 2015 after he took his concerns to the independent industry regulator. Several current Boots pharmacists told BBC Inside Out that understaffing could pose a risk to patients. But the chain said its pharmacies were not understaffed and it had an industry-leading patient safety record. Greg Lawton resigned from Boots in 2015 Greg Lawton, who worked for Boots between 2008 and 2015 and in his final role was part of the manpower planning team that assessed staffing levels in the company's pharmacies, said the things he knew about staffing levels kept him awake at night. In 2012 he worked on an investigation ordered by Boots into stores with the highest levels of dispensing errors. ""We spoke to pharmacists, to store managers and to area managers and what those people were saying [was that] absolutely staffing levels was flagged as an issue, poor staffing levels,"" he said. Boots said that after the investigation it implemented a detailed action plan. It then commissioned academic research which, it says, found that pharmacies with higher levels of dispensing staff were associated with higher error rates. Douglas Lamond, Arlene Devereux and Margaret Forrest died following dispensing errors In November 2012, a woman called Arlene Devereaux died on her 71st birthday after a Boots pharmacy in Chesterfield dispensed six times the strength of morphine tablets prescribed by her GP. While understaffing was not found to be a contributing factor in her death, Mr Lawton said: ""It was shocking and it kind of reminded you of the importance of the job that you were doing and strengthened your resolve to try and make a difference."" Mrs Devereaux was one of three people to die between May 2012 and November 2013 following dispensing errors by Boots.Douglas Lamond, 86,died in May 2012 whileMargaret Forrest, also aged 86, died in November 2013. Staff had not followed company safety procedures, and understaffing was not found to have contributed to any of these deaths. However, the inquest into Mr Lamond's death was told by a member of the pharmacy team that staff at the Boots branch in Felixstowe, Suffolk,had been under pressure as it was ""very busy"". The inquest in March 2017 heard that staff kept telling their area manager they did not have enough space to do their job. Boots said it found no record of staff raising concerns with the area manager. Douglas Lamond's death was investigated by police When police investigated Mr Lamond's death they asked to see the company's own internal investigations report, but Boots refused. Boots was entitled to do this under legal privilege. However, Det Supt Andy Smith, of Suffolk Police, said he felt the company had a moral responsibility. ""I do think particularly big corporate companies such as Boots who have a significant responsibility towards public safety have a moral duty to co-operate fully with any police investigation, and also they have an overriding duty to demonstrate transparency to the family."" Boots said it co-operated fully with the police and legal privilege allows staff to make full and frank reports. Det Supt Andy Smith said Boots had ""a moral duty to co-operate fully with any police investigation"" In 2014, Mr Lawton had been looking in detail at staffing and budgets and was concerned that pressure from understaffing could lead to serious mistakes. ""I was terrified that something bad might happen to a patient, so the patient might be seriously harmed or a patient might die because of the inadequate staffing levels and the pressure that was placed on pharmacists and pharmacy teams,"" he said. The first Boots store opened in Nottingham in 1849 and ibuprofen was invented at the company's site in Nottingham The BBC has spoken to several pharmacists who still work for Boots and have concerns about patient safety. ""Some days you would easily describe the team as being at breaking point,"" said one, who asked not to be identified. ""That's because, simply, the amount of work that has to be done can't physically get done safely and it can't physically get done without either working longer hours or working after the store has closed."" Another pharmacist, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: ""Mistakes may not be picked up on and that could ultimately lead to somebody possibly dying, somebody missing medication, harm coming to people. Small mix-ups really, just one tablet for another tablet."" Boots has almost 2,400 pharmacies across the UK Mr Lawton took his concerns to the regulator, the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), shortly before resigning in 2015. He presented the regulator with a 55-page witness statement based on his experiences and concerns, as well as dozens of supporting documents. In December 2016 it concluded there was not sufficient objective, independent evidence to suggest a risk to patient safety across the organisation. Boots told the BBC it dispensed more than 220 million prescription items in the year beginning April 2016. Reported incidents where patients were harmed in some way were very rare - 901, or 0.00041%. Boots says these figures include incidents where a patient was harmed after Boots supplied the correct product. For example, the patient may have suffered an allergic reaction to a medicine even though the medicine was dispensed fully in accordance with the prescription, or there may have been a delay in supplying the medication. Boots says that its analysis indicates it has one of the lowest percentages of errors in the community pharmacy sector where harm was reported. In the year beginning April 2016, 17,000 incidents involving medication were reported to the NHS in England and Wales. That reporting is voluntary so the real figure could be higher. The GPhC told the BBC it inspected more than 2,000 Boots pharmacies between November 2013 and August 2017 and 26 did not have enough qualified and skilled staff to provide a safe service.  However, it said they were now up to standard. That means only 1.2% of Boots pharmacies failed on the staffing standard, which compares favourably with all other pharmacies, where an average of 2.4% failed. Boots has almost 2,400 pharmacies and as of July 2017 employed 6,697 pharmacists. However, the firm has declined to explain to the BBC how it works out how many staff to put in each pharmacy, as it says such information is commercially sensitive. Boots UK's pharmacy director Richard Bradley is a qualified pharmacist who has worked for the company for 20 years Boots said there had been no further deaths directly linked to dispensing errors at its pharmacies since 2013. Its UK pharmacy director Richard Bradley said: ""One mistake like this is one mistake too many and my absolute assurance is, despite having our industry leading record, we will continue to focus on minimising the chance of it happening again."" The firm said since Mr Lawton left it had increased the number of pharmacists it employed by 430 and the number of pharmacy technicians by over 360.  Staff with pharmacy capability has risen by more than 2,400, with staff in those last two groups still in training. ""Greg, his opinions and his concerns, [he] left the business over two years ago and [his opinions] aren't relevant to Boots today,"" added Mr Bradley. ""We continue to invest in more people, more pharmacists than ever before, that's into our shops and it's into our processes, helping to make things more safe. ""Our pharmacies are busy places but they are safe places. ""I'm absolutely confident that the resource is there to deliver the patient care. I am confident that we have enough staff."" However, Mr Lawton believes the regulator does not have enough power. ""We need regulatory standards to specify what the staffing levels must be in pharmacies,"" he said. At the moment, the only legal requirement to enforce safe staffing levels is that a pharmacist in charge, or ""Responsible Pharmacist"", has to be there when the pharmacy is open. Joy Wingfield believes regulation around pharmacy is inadequate Joy Wingfield, a pharmacy law and ethics expert who has trained the last two Boots superintendents - the pharmacists in charge of patient safety - agrees that regulation around pharmacy is inadequate and minimum staffing levels need to be defined. ""I'd like to see the powers they [the GPhC] have against corporate employers re-examined,"" she said. ""I don't think that anybody could have envisaged that the employment of pharmacists would devolve on such enormous, large international companies."" The regulator said it was providing new patient safety guidance to pharmacy owners later this year which will include explaining what they should do to make sure they have enough qualified staff in each pharmacy.

It will be on BBC Two in Scotland at 19:00 BST on Thursday 11 January, on the BBC News channel at 20:30 on Friday 12 January and Saturday 13 January, and at 10:30 on Sunday 14 January.

"Vieira is believed to be the Red Command leader in the state of Goias Police in Brazil have arrested a drug lord accused of ordering a deadly prison riot on New Year's Day. Nine inmates were killed and 14 injured during the unrest at a prison in the central state of Goias. Stephan de Souza Vieira, 34, was seized at a luxury flat in the state of Rio de Janeiro. He had been on the run from the jail since November. He is a leader of the Red Command criminal gang with drug interests across Brazil, police say. Vieira, also known as BH, had been serving a 26-year sentence for drug trafficking when he escaped from the Aparecida de Goiania jail. Police say that he controlled gang inmates from outside the prison and gave orders for armed members to start the riot. They attacked a rival gang in a separate wing of the prison and set mattresses on fire. Several prisoners were re-arrested a few hours after the riot More than 100 inmates escaped during the riot. Dozens remain at large. Vieira was arrested in a flat in the seaside resort of Cabo Frio. He was found with a substantial amount of cash, jewellery, several mobile phones and notebooks with details of drug trafficking transactions. Brazil prison riots: What's the cause? Riots are common in Brazilian prisons, which are notoriously overcrowded. Brazil has one of the largest prison populations in the world. The country's jails are largely controlled by powerful criminal factions with access to drugs, mobile phones and weapons. A report by judicial authorities in 2016 described security at the rural penitentiary on the outskirts of the state capital, Goiania, as bad. According to the report, the prison - part of a larger complex - was built to house 122 inmates, but at one point it held 423.

"Craig McLachlan has been accused of sexual misconduct during a Rocky Horror Show production Australian actor Craig McLachlan has denied allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by three women. The accusations against McLachlan, 52, concern his time performing in a 2014 production of the Rocky Horror Show. Three cast members accused the former Neighbours actor of inappropriate touching and harassment. McLachlan stepped down from the Rocky Horror Show's current Australian run on Monday, but rejected the allegations as ""entirely false"". ""Frankly, they seem to be simple inventions, perhaps made for financial reasons, perhaps to gain notoriety,""he wrote in response to allegations published by the Australian Broadcasting Corp,external. The actresses, Christie Whelan Browne, Erika Heynatz and Angela Scundi, said they had come forward to protect other cast members. McLachlan had been reprising his role as Dr Frank N. Furter in Adelaide. The allegations, also published by Fairfax Media on Monday,external, include that McLachlan pulled aside Whelan Browne's underwear during a performance and kissed her buttock. ""I think people who know him know that he's very generous, warm, funny... I saw a very different side come out in him which was terrifying,"" she told the ABC. Christie Whelan Brown (L) says she wants to help create a safer working culture Heynatz, who played Magenta, said she was forcibly kissed by the actor, while Scundi, a chorus member, said she was the subject of unwanted sexual advances. Two actresses raised concerns with the show's senior producers but no action was taken, the reports said. Police told the BBC they were ""investigating allegations of sexual offences dating back to 2014"", but would not give further details. In a statement on Monday, the musical's production company said it was ""shocked"" to learn of the accusations. ""In response, we have spoken to Craig and have mutually agreed that it is not appropriate for him to continue in the current production of the show,"" Gordon Frost Organisation said in a statement. It said it would co-operate with authorities and conduct and internal investigation. McLachlan is a veteran of the Australian entertainment industry, having won Australia's top television award - the Gold Logie - and starred in programmes including Home and Away and the Doctor Blake Mysteries.

"French singer France Gall, who rose to pop fame in the 1960s, has died at the age of 70 after suffering from cancer for two years. She was taken to hospital near Paris last month for a severe infection. Gall won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965 representing Luxembourg with the song Wax Doll, Rag Doll (PoupÃ©e de cire, PoupÃ©e de son). She enjoyed more international success in 1987 with her tribute to jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald,Ella, Elle l'a. Gall was born in October 1947 into a musical family - her father was singer and songwriter Robert Gall, who penned songs for music legends Edith Piaf and Charles Aznavour, among others. She was known for her childish smile and sweet voice and, in the words of Le Figaro website, ""embodied the emancipation of French girls in the post-war era"". Her career spanned 50 years and Culture Minister FranÃ§oise Nyssen described her as ""a timeless icon of French song"". France Gall captured the spirit of the French pop scene of the 1960s She was just 16 when her first single, Don't Be So Stupid (Ne Sois Pas Si BÃªte), sold some 200,000 copies. But it was Gall's Eurovision victory withPoupÃ©e de cire- written by Serge Gainsbourg, one of the biggest figures in French popular music - that helped catapult her to fame and make her a star on France'sYÃ©-yÃ©(yeah yeah) pop scene, so-called because of its nod to English music at the time. Her death comes a month after the loss of another giant of French music, Johnny Hallyday - widely seen as the leader of theYÃ©-yÃ©singers. How France saw itself in Johnny Hallyday The story of a French rock phenomenon Gall's collaboration with Gainsbourg later came under scrutiny, however, after she admitted she had been too young to fully understand the double meanings of some of his songs. Gall said she did not fully understand the erotic nature of some of Gainsbourg's songs One of her biggest hits wasLes Sucettes (Lollipops), which tells the story of a girl who is ""in paradise"" every time ""that little stick is on her tongue"". Once she realised its full meaning, Gall refused to perform the song and vowed never to work with Gainsbourg again. Her 1987 album Babacar, which included her tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, saw her shoot to international fame. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

There has been an outpouring of tributes to the singer on social media.

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: ""She leaves behind songs that everyone in France knows and set an example of a life devoted to others."" Gall had previously been diagnosed with breast cancer in the mid-1990s, not long after the death of her husband and fellow singer Michel Berger at the age of 44 in 1992. He had written the music and lyrics for her Babacar album. She retired from her music career following the death of the eldest of her two children, Pauline, from cystic fibrosis in 1997.

"The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie has resigned from her post, citing pay inequality with male colleagues. In an open letter, Ms Gracie - who has been at the BBC for more than 30 years - accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She said the BBC was facing a ""crisis of trust"", after it was revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 were male. The BBC said there was ""no systemic discrimination against women"". Ms Gracie said she left her role as editor of the corporation's Beijing bureau last week, but would remain with the BBC. She said she would return to her former post in the TV newsroom ""where I expect to be paid equally"". Ms Gracie is co-presenting BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday.

"Steve Bannon created a rift with his former boss, the president, with remarks to author Michael Wolff Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former chief strategist, has tried to reverse remarks in which he called the president's son Donald Jr ""treasonous"". The accusation appears in Michael Wolff's new book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. He was referring to a meeting in June 2016 between Mr Trump's son and a group of Russians. But on Sunday Mr Bannon said the barb was directed at former aide Paul Manafort, who was also present. The Senate, House of Representatives and a special counsel are all investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, allegations denied by both the Kremlin and Donald Trump. In a statement first reported by news site Axios, Steve Bannon called Donald Jr ""both a patriot and a good man"".

"Vieira is believed to be the Red Command leader in the state of Goias Police in Brazil have arrested a drug lord accused of ordering a deadly prison riot on New Year's Day. Nine inmates were killed and 14 injured during the unrest at a prison in the central state of Goias. Stephan de Souza Vieira, 34, was seized at a luxury flat in the state of Rio de Janeiro. He had been on the run from the jail since November. He is a leader of the Red Command criminal gang with drug interests across Brazil, police say. Vieira, also known as BH, had been serving a 26-year sentence for drug trafficking when he escaped from the Aparecida de Goiania jail. Police say that he controlled gang inmates from outside the prison and gave orders for armed members to start the riot. They attacked a rival gang in a separate wing of the prison and set mattresses on fire. Several prisoners were re-arrested a few hours after the riot More than 100 inmates escaped during the riot. Dozens remain at large. Vieira was arrested in a flat in the seaside resort of Cabo Frio. He was found with a substantial amount of cash, jewellery, several mobile phones and notebooks with details of drug trafficking transactions. Brazil prison riots: What's the cause? Riots are common in Brazilian prisons, which are notoriously overcrowded. Brazil has one of the largest prison populations in the world. The country's jails are largely controlled by powerful criminal factions with access to drugs, mobile phones and weapons. A report by judicial authorities in 2016 described security at the rural penitentiary on the outskirts of the state capital, Goiania, as bad. According to the report, the prison - part of a larger complex - was built to house 122 inmates, but at one point it held 423.

"Survivors are calling for a more central role in the inquiry Accountancy firm KPMG has quit its advisor role on the Grenfell inquiry amid concerns over its appointment. Campaigners had called for KPMG to be removed, saying it failed to disclose a conflict of interest. KPMG is the auditor of three of the firms under scrutiny by the inquiry into the tower block blaze, in which 71 people died on 14 June last year. The firm said it had ""mutually agreed with the inquiry that we will step down from our role with immediate effect"". Grenfell inquiry 'whitewash' upsets families Grenfell inquiry 'could bring closure' The accountancy firm audits the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where the tower is located. It also audits Rydon Construction, which refurbished the tower in 2015, and Celotex, which manufactured insulation material used in the tower. Pop star Lily Allen, two Labour MPs - Clive Lewis and Emma Dent-Coad - and a host of academics and campaigners had earlier signedan open letter to Theresa May,externalurging the prime minster to reverse KPMG's appointment. They said the appointment would ""only further fuel rumours of a deliberate cover-up and erode public trust."" KPMG said its role on the inquiry as project management advisor was ""purely operational"" and that it had no role advising ""on the substance of the inquiry"". ""Whilst we are confident that no conflicts exist between our role advising the inquiry and our work for other clients, we recognise that strength of opinion about our role risks undermining confidence in the Inquiry,"" a spokesperson added. The firm said it would waive its fees for the work undertaken to date. The blaze on 14 June last year killed 71 people Last month, survivors and bereaved families warned the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry could become a whitewash unless a diverse panel was appointed to oversee proceedings. Sir Martin Moore-Bick's appointment as the inquiry chairman has already been criticised by residents, who say he is an establishment figure. Victims groups were further angered when the retired Court of Appeal judge said he would not appoint a member of the Grenfell community to the panel, arguing it would ""risk undermining impartiality"".

"Plans to create a new Northern Forest stretching from Liverpool to Hull have been kick-started by the government. It is providing Â£5.7m to increase tree cover along a belt spanning Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The project will cost Â£500m over 25 years. The balance of the funds will need to be raised by charity. Environmentalists have welcomed the planned 50 million new trees, but say ministers must stop allowing ancient woodland to be felled. The UK has one of the lowest rates of woodland in Europe and the area to be covered by the Northern Forest is one of the most denuded in England, with tree cover less than 8%. The emphasis of the project will be to increase tree cover around major conurbations to 20%. There will also be a focus on river valleys, where there are benefits for flood prevention and soil loss - as well as wildlife. But these areas will soak up funding, leaving many of the northern hills just as bleak and treeless in the coming 25 years. Will Europe's last primeval forest survive? The forests that are falling silent But the Woodland Trust, which is leading the scheme with local Community Forests, says the new wooded areas shouldn't be under-estimated, as they will greatly enhance the environment for people in northern cities. Its conservation director, Austin Brady, said the benefits would be strongest in areas where there's been industrial activity, over-grazing and neglectful farming. He told BBC News: ""We're delighted the prime minister's supporting our project - it's great to get the idea of the Northern Forest on the map. ""Admittedly the government's cash contribution isn't huge, but it will help us to unlock other funding."" There should be more government cash available for landowners to improve the environment by tree planting if farm subsidies are reformed after Brexit, as planned by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The government will also review incentives to plant trees, as part of its plan to combat climate change by storing more carbon in soils. Mr Brady also said the Trust hoped to benefit from funds allocated for mitigating the environmental impact of major transport projects expected in the north, such as road-building and HS2. But Paul de Zylva from Friends of Earth told BBC News: ""It is a supreme irony that tree planters will have to get funding from HS2, which threatens 35 ancient woodlands north of Birmingham. ""You simply can't compare the biodiversity value of new sticks in the ground with ancient forest. ""If the government really cared about woodlands it wouldn't be routing a high speed train through them. And it wouldn't be allowing this weight of this project to be carried by charity."" The government has been slipping behind schedule on a promise it made to plant 11 million trees. The Woodland Trust say last year saw the lowest level of planting in England for many years - just 1,000 hectares. The forest announcement forms part of the government's long-delayed 25 Year Environment Plan, which will set out how ministers aim to leave the environment in a better state than they inherited it. The report is due this week and environmentalists say it should be judged not on its ambitious sentiments but on concrete policies backed by cash. Commenting on the forest announcement, Mr Gove said: ""Trees are some of our most cherished natural assets and living evidence of our investment for future generations. ""Not only are they a source of beauty and wonder, but a way to manage flood risk, protect precious species, and create healthier places for us to work and live. ""This new Northern Forest is an exciting project that will create a vast ribbon of woodland cover in northern England, providing a rich habitat for wildlife to thrive, and a natural environment for millions of people to enjoy."" The description of the project from the Woodland Trust suggests that the forest will be less of a green ribbon and more of a sparsely-threaded doily.

"Aspall, the cider brand founded in Suffolk in 1728, has been sold to the US beer giant that owns brands including Carling and Miller. Molson Coors said it wanted to make Aspall the UK's top-selling premium cider and build on the potential of its vinegars. The UK is the world's biggest market for cider, accounting for 45% of sales. Barry Chevallier Guild, chairman of Aspall, said the firm had been in talks with Molson Coors for more than a year. The US company had the scale and expertise to accelerate the growth of Aspall cider in the UK and beyond, he added. The volume of cider sold by Aspall in 2016 rose by a tenth. The rise of the craft brewer Tax hit for white cider Financial terms have not been disclosed, but the deal is thought to value Aspall at about Â£40m including debt. The company operates from a single site in the parish of Aspall, Suffolk, where the Chevallier family first planted the orchards at Aspall Hall. Henry and Barry Chevallier Guild are related to the family who founded Aspall cider Members of the family will continue to play a role in the business. Henry Chevallier Guild added: ""There is a real opportunity to elevate and grow the status of English cider in the UK and abroad both as a beverage and as an excellent partner for food. We believe that Molson Coors investment will provide the catalyst to grow Aspall and build the recognition for quality cider worldwide."" The value of the cider market rose by a quarter between 2010 and 2015 and is expected to continue expanding in the coming years. More than half of all apples grown in the UK are used to make cider and the industry supports almost 11,000 jobs, according to the National Association of Cider Makers. It is not the first time Molson Coors has snapped up a small UK drinks maker -in 2011 it bought Cornwall-based Sharp's Breweryfor Â£20m. The company also runs breweries at Burton-upon-Trent, Tadcaster, Burtonwood and Cork, Ireland and accounts for about 20% of the UK beer market, with Carling the country's top-selling beer.
