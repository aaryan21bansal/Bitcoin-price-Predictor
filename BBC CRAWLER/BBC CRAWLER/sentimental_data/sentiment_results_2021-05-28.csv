"Boris Johnson's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds reportedly oversaw the flat refurbishment Boris Johnson acted ""unwisely"" by not being more ""rigorous"" in finding out who had funded refurbishment work on the Downing Street flat, a report says. Lord Geidt, the PM's adviser on standards, said a Tory donor had paid an invoice for some of the costs. But he cleared Mr Johnson - who was seemingly unaware of the arrangement - of breaking ministerial conduct rules. The works on the flat, overseen by the PM's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds, are thought to have cost around Â£90,000. The report did not say how much former Conservative vice-chairman Lord Brownlow had put up to fund the refurbishment, but a figure of Â£58,000 has been widely reported. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Johnson appoints new standards adviser What investigations is the government facing? Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had funded the ""wider refurbishment"", suggesting Lord Brownlow had been repaid. But Labour said it was ""staggering"" that Mr Johnson could ""rack up"" a bill ""yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid"". Separately, the Electoral Commission iscarrying out an investigationinto whether the Conservative Party broke the law on political donations regarding the funding of the flat. And Health SecretaryMatt Hancock has been found guiltyof a ""minor breach"" of the ministerial code, which sets the rules for behaviour in public office, over shares in an NHS supplier. Prime ministers receive an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their Downing Street living quarters, which are publicly-owned. Mr Johnson has faced repeated questions over how refurbishments to the flat above 11 Downing Street, where he lives with Ms Symonds, were financed. The renovation work began in spring last year when Mr Johnson was in hospital with Covid. The prime minister has previously said he paid the difference between the taxpayer-funded contribution and the full costs. But he did not specify whether this involved paying the bills up-front or repaying money loaned to him or the government for the project. In his report, Lord Geidt found ""no evidence"" that Lord Brownlow had told Mr Johnson ""he had personally settled"" costs. And, when Lord Brownlow informed government officials about the money, they had not ""acted on this information to the extent of informing the prime minister"", it said. But Lord Geidt - who was appointed by Mr Johnson last month as standards adviser following the resignation of Sir Alex Allen - did criticise the prime minister's conduct. He had, said the peer, ""unwisely... allowed the refurbishment of the apartment... to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded"". Lord Geidt also said that ""in the middle of a pandemic"", Mr Johnson ""simply accepted"" that a trust he was hoping to set up to handle the Downing Street work ""would be capable of satisfactorily resolving the situation without further interrogation"". Although this report clears Boris Johnson of breaking the ministerial code, parts of it will be awkward reading in Downing Street. Lord Geidt questions why Boris Johnson didn't pay more attention to who was paying for the work in his flat. Why wasn't the prime minister more curious, he wonders? It is also critical of officials - saying the prime minister was ""ill-served"" by those around him when it came to this project. But, crucially, there is no sense from this report that the arrangement led to a conflict of interest. Downing Street is also keen to point out the costs - beyond an annual allowance - have not been met by the taxpayer. But Lord Geidt concluded that ""no conflict (or reasonably perceived conflict) arises"" from the involvement of Lord Brownlow or the Conservative Party in the refurbishment. He said of Lord Brownlow that ""there is no evidence that he acted with anything other than altruistic and philanthropic motives"". Speaking in Swindon, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said no public money was used in an improper way. He said because the arrangement involved private money, the ""facts speak for themselves in favour of"" the prime minister. And responding to the report, Downing Street said it showed the prime minister had ""acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times"". Lord Geidt was appointed last month as the PM's standards adviser A spokesperson added: ""Cabinet Office officials were engaged and informed throughout and official advice was followed. ""Other than works funded through the annual allowance, the costs of the wider refurbishment of the flat are not being financed by taxpayers and have been settled by the prime minister personally."" If a politician or party accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether this rule was followed by the Conservative Party in relation to the Downing Street refurbishment. If the commission finds it was not, it has the power to issue a fine of up to Â£20,000. Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, is also looking into the refurbishment, including whether donations were properly declared.

"This video can not be played Nancy Kelley: ""Iâm comfortable with our direction as an organisation"" Stonewall head Nancy Kelley has defended the organisation's position amid a freedom of speech row and criticism from a founder. Matthew Parrissaid in the Times,externalthat Stonewall had become ""tangled up in the trans issue"" and ""cornered into an extremist stance"". But Ms Kelley told the BBC she was ""really comfortable""with the direction the charity was going in. She likened so-called ""gender critical"" beliefs to anti-Semitism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said its defence of the right to hold ""gender critical beliefs"" - that sex cannot be changed - ""does not have an impact on our commitment to uphold the rights of transgender people"". The new EHRC chair, Lady Falkner,has said women have the right to question transgender identity,externalwithout being abused, stigmatised or risking losing their job. Ms Kelley said while Stonewall believed in freedom of speech, it was ""not without limit"". ""With all beliefs including controversial beliefs there is a right to express those beliefs publicly and where they're harmful or damaging - whether it's anti-Semitic beliefs, gender critical beliefs, beliefs about disability - we have legal systems that are put in place for people who are harmed by that."" Challenged as to whether it might be considered offensive to compare anti-Semitic beliefs to gender-critical views, she insisted it was appropriate. ""We're talking about protected groups. We're talking about people that are protected on the basis of their sexuality, people that are protected on the basis of gender identity, people who are protected on the basis of race and that's why I think the analogy is apt."" Journalist and former Tory MP Matthew Parris, one of Stonewall's 14 founders, recently suggested the charity had ""lost its way"". In an article for the Times, he said: ""The organisation is tangled up in the trans issue, cornered into an extremist stance on a debate that a charity formed to help gay men, lesbian women and bisexual people should never have got itself into."" Ms Kelley said while Mr Parris was entitled to his views, being trans-inclusive was the ""absolute norm"" for LGBT organisations. She also denied Stonewall had approved incorrect advice on transgender issues for the University of Essex, which is part of its Diversity Champions workplace inclusion scheme. Arecent report,externalfound the university had unlawfully blacklisted a speaker after some protesters labelled her a ""transphobe"". Ms Kelley said Stonewall had ""nothing to do"" with the university's process for deciding external speakers and was ""really confident"" in its legal advice. Stonewall's been criticised for using the term ""gender identity"" when referring to the Equality Act's protected characteristic of ""gender reassignment"". But Ms Kelley described that as ""the difference between natural language and statutory language"". She also expressed frustration that the volume of media coverage and debate around trans rights meant ""it can be difficult to get across all the work we do... focusing on the experiences of LGB [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people."" She said the organisation's work could still benefit people, whether or not they agreed with its position, such as improving access to IVF. That aim is part ofthe organisation's new ""free to be"" strategy,external, which includes campaigning for ""hate crime and hate speech laws in the UK that protect LGBTQ+ communities"" and a pledge to champion inclusion across schools. Human rights body quits Stonewall diversity scheme Groups criticise conversion therapy 'Groundhog Day' Liz Truss is Equalities Minister as well as Secretary of State for International Trade The strategy also prioritises a ""legally enforceable ban on conversion therapy"". Ms Kelley said the consultation process, planned for September, was an ""unnecessary delay"" but promised to work closely with the government on the ban. Conversion therapyis defined by health groups, including NHS England, as attempts to change someone's sexuality or gender identity. It is understood part of the consultation will look at how to ensure certain medical or other accredited professionals will not be criminalised. Ms Kelley said a therapist, helping someone explore their gender identity or sexual orientation, wouldn't be caught by a ban, ""because that's not seeking to suppress or change something. That's exploring with you."" A government Equality Hub spokeswoman said: ""The consultation will seek further views from the public and key stakeholders to ensure that the ban can address the practice while protecting the medical profession; defending freedom of speech; and upholding religious freedom."" Ms Kelly has also called for an ""individual cabinet level post"" to focus on the equalities brief. Liz Truss holds the role as well as being international trade secretary.

"Restaurants say plans to display the calorie content of food on menus in England should be delayed while the sector recovers from the pandemic. There are fears that the move will add extra costs to businesses at a time when they are least able to afford it. The new rules will affect restaurants, cafes and takeaways employing more than 250 people and are due to come in from April 2022. The change is part of a drive by the UK government to tackle obesity. With 11 restaurants, Mowgli Street Food's founder Nisha Katona says making the changes by next spring will mean a significant investment. ""It's thousands of pounds and weeks of work,"" she says. ""It's a shame for anyone to have to take on another cost right now."" However, she supports the idea that people should take a greater interest in how many calories they consume when they eat out, and says her restaurant has already looked into displaying calories on its menus. Despite this, she believes it's crucial that ministers stick to the idea of only applying the new rules to larger businesses such as hers. ""Personally, I can see the value in it, and it's something my business will manage to do -  but it'll see the end of small restaurants if they're ever compelled to do it,"" she says. Restaurants offer perks to beat staffing crisis Over a million hospital admissions for obesity Announcing the plans, Public Health Minister Jo Churchill said they were intended ""to make it as easy as possible for people to make healthier food choices for themselves and their families, both in restaurants and at home"". The government said that it would not affect small, independent businesses, which may find it harder to implement the changes. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, says that while the industry shares the government's objectives in improving public health, the timing could prove difficult. ""The majority of operators are in survival mode,"" she says. ""We urge the government to consider delaying the implementation of any legislation rather than layering on new costs for businesses in a sector that has been hardest hit by the pandemic and risks prolonging their recovery and business' ability to invest and create jobs."" Nick Collins is wary of red tape That's a view echoed by Nick Collins, chief executive of Loungers, who run the Lounge and Cosy Club chain of more than 140 cafÃ©-bars. ""The timing really is dreadful,"" he says. Having only just been able to fully reopen, he says businesses like his are focused on their recovery and their staff - and a change like this will take time to implement. ""I support the objective of helping our customers eat more healthily,"" he says, ""but I'd like to see it put back. It's red tape we could really do without."" A spokesperson from the Department for Health acknowledged the impact of Covid-19 on the hospitality sector, and pledged to ""work with businesses and local authorities to ensure the out of home calorie labelling regulations are implemented as smoothly as possible"". Some High Street chains already publish information about the calorie content of their food on their menus, including Wetherspoons pubs and The Real Greek restaurants. But others argue that the nature of their restaurants will make a change like this even more costly. Robin Hutson, chairman of The Pig hotels and restaurants, says his business cooks with fresh produce that changes on a daily basis - and thinks the plans show ""a crass lack of understanding from the government"". He has eight venues across the South of England, with about 950 staff. Robin Hutson says it's just more financial pressure on the restaurant sector ""High Street chains may never change their menus - but ours can change between lunch and dinner,"" he explains. ""Are we supposed to employ someone to update our menus all the time? It's just more financial pressure on an already embattled sector."" Furthermore, he doesn't believe it's fundamentally a role restaurants should be talking on. ""What people eat and drink is down to them,"" he says. ""We should all be taking responsibility for ourselves."" The government estimates that overweight and obesity related conditions cost the NHS Â£6.1bn each year, and data shows that almost two-thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese. A spokesperson for the Department of Health also pointed out the disproportionate effect Covid-19 has on people who are overweight, saying, ""it is more important than ever to help people across the country achieve a healthy weight"".

"There are just three properties to stay in on the island A remote and uninhabited Scottish island is looking for a resident caretaker. Isle Martin, near Ullapool, has no full-time residents but needs someone to keep the island in shape for visitors this summer. If months of lockdown didn't faze you, living without a soul for miles around might be the job for you. The island's community trust is inviting solo applicants and couples to register their interest. Isle Martin has just enough to keep visitors busy for a few hours. Two beaches, a micro museum (in a hut) and a hill which affords fantastic birdwatching. The island hosts Scotland's first seaweed festival (6-12 September) and, if you are lucky, one of the volunteers may be running a pop-up cafe when you visit. The island was gifted to the community by the RSPB andIsle Martin Trust,externalbecame a charity in 1999. The new caretaker will make sure Covid rules are adhered to. The volunteer caretaker will be the first full-time resident to live on the island in 30 years and the move signals the start of plans for the trust to generate interest in the island. The island also aims to be plastic-free and sustainable. Trust director Becky Thomson told the BBC what the position entails. She said: ""It is a bit of housekeeping. They need to keep the three houses on the island prepared for guests, clean the public toilets, welcome the visitors and make sure they are sticking to Covid safety measures."" The work will amount to about three hours per day. In return, the caretaker gets to live on a little piece of island heaven in provided accommodation, earn Â£150 expenses per week and enjoy all the island has to offer. Isle Martin has two beaches Isle Martin is located at the mouth of Loch Broom, about three miles north-west of Ullapool in Wester Ross. The nearest mainland is less than a mile away at Ardmair. At just 400 acres in size, it lies below the towering cliffs of Beinn Mhor Coigach and opposite the ancient Viking Fort of Dun Canna. Beyond the island are the Summer Isles - a group of islands which lie off Achiltibuie on the beautiful Coigach Peninsula. It is only five minutes by boat from the mainland. Over the years it has held a monastery, a herring curing station and a flour mill. It is now recognised as a bird sanctuary. The trust does warn that it is a post for someone who likes the outdoors and is not reliant on creature comforts. There is no running hot water and only a small solar electrical charger that may power a phone or a laptop or even some lights. The candidate will have to be resourceful and resilient and probably very practical. And they will have to be able to drive a power boat - their only way on and off the island. In particular, the trust would welcome volunteers who bring specific skills they may wish to share for the benefit of the community during their time on the island. In the summer, a pop-up cafe is sometimes operated by volunteers Becky Thomson said: ""If someone enjoyed the land, they could revive our vegetable garden if they wanted."" She also explained why she thinks people fall in love with the place. ""The sense of escape and peace and quiet,"" she said. ""It is so near the mainland but as soon as you land on the island it's lovely and peaceful. There are no cars, no roads. Just quiet. That's what people like - the feeling of restfulness."" The trust has extended the application deadline until 22:00 on 1 June and more details on how to apply are at the island trust's Facebook page.

"A combination of malnutrition and a deep-seated pressure sore on Mr Sootheran's back led to a fatal lung infection A woman has been found guilty of murdering her millionaire landlord in order to inherit part of his Â£3.5m estate. Anthony Sootheran, 59, relied on care from Lynda Rickard who forged his will before killing him by depriving him of food and medical help. The ""recluse"" died at his farm near South Newington, Oxfordshire, in 2014. Rickard's husband Wayne, 66, was cleared of murder but found guilty of allowing or causing the death. The ""brazen"" plot to steal millionaire's fortune Three of Mrs Rickard's friends were also found guilty of fraudulently signing forged wills. Sentencing will take place at Reading Crown Court on Tuesday. The Rickards, from Banbury, were Mr Sootheran's live-in tenants. During the trial, the jury heard Mrs Rickard, 62, ""ruthlessly exploited"" Mr Sootheran and his mother, Joy Sootheran, who died in 2012. Lynda and Wayne Rickard bought a Mitsubishi Shogun car with some of the money they obtained She forged their wills and used tens of thousands of pounds of their money to satisfy her ""brazen greed"". But half of Ms Sootheran's Â£1.5m fortune was stopped from going to Mrs Rickard after people ""smelt a rat"". Mrs Rickard then ""isolated and controlled"" her landlord while her husband failed to intervene. During the trial, consultant geriatrician Dr Peter Kroker said the millionaire lost a third of his body weight - 26kg (four stone) - in the last 15 months of his life. He said he would have been reliant on other people after a fall in February 2014, but he had not eaten for at least 34 hours before his death. He was found dead by a visiting doctor on 18 March 2014 at High Havens Farm, where he lived with the Rickards. Joy Sootheran's will was also forged by Mrs Rickard A combination of malnutrition and a deep-seated pressure sore on Mr Sootheran's back led to a fatal lung infection, the court was told. Mr Sootheran was described as a ""popular"" but ""complex"" man who suffered from episodes of poor mental health. Unable to cope with the birth of his daughter in 1988, he left the farm - where he lived with his family - for two weeks. Soon afterwards he moved out when the marriage broke down. In 2008, he moved back into the farm along with his mother Joy to live with the Rickards, who had been there as tenants since 2006. His forged will gave Mrs Rickard a third of the estate, which included the farm. (Left to right) Denise Neal, Shanda Robinson and Michael Dunkley were all found guilty of fraudulently signing forged wills Robbie Weber, senior crown prosecutor, said: ""Lynda Rickard is an inherently dishonest person. Cruel and ruthless to the extent which I've barely seen in my professional career. ""Had Anthony received medical attention in the week before his death, he would have survived. ""However, getting Anthony help was the last thing on Lynda Rickard's mind. She needed him to die in order to benefit from his fortune. ""This is a landmark case. This is the first time in 100 years that the Crown Prosecution Service has authorised an offence of murder by deliberate starvation, and in this case for financial gain, and therefore we hope that will set a precedent for future consideration of such cases."" Mr Sootheran bought High Havens Farm, where the Rickards lived from 2006 The Rickards were also found guilty of fraudulently using Ms Sootheran's money to buy a Mitsubishi Shogun car. Three of Mrs Rickard's friends - Michael Dunkley, 49, from Banbury, Denise Neal, 41, of Lower Tysoe, Warwickshire, and Shanda Robinson, 51, from Banbury - were all found guilty of fraudulently signing forged wills. Mr Rickard was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice by attempting to pass off a will as genuine, while Robinson was convicted of conspiring to do the same.

"Arlene Foster has said she will resign as NI first minister on Tuesday,instead of the end of June, if Edwin Poots changes his ministerial team. She said she worked closely with her team and ""if Edwin decides to change that then I have to go as well"". ""I can't stay with a new ministerial team over which I have no authority - that would be wrong,"" she said. However, the new Democratic Unionist Party leader insisted he was not ""pushing Arlene out"" of the party. ""That's my position and that remains my position,"" said Mr Poots. ""I'm not going to be rushed into doing anything or pushed into doing anything. Nor am I going to be denied doing something that I'm ready to do. ""So we will look at all of these issues and take a decision at a time that's appropriate for us."" Edwin Poots insisted he was not ""pushing Arlene out"" of the party On Thursday, Mr Poots denied the party is divided after tensions flared at a meeting to ratify his leadership. The party endorsed anearlier vote by MLAs and MPs to make Mr Poots leader, but it came amid anger from some quarters about how Arlene Foster was ousted as leader last month. DUP hangs out its dirty laundry in public Mr Poots' rival for the leadership, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said that one of his team had been threatened by someone from loyalist paramilitary group the UDA. It is believed the threat was made online during the leadership campaign. Police said they had ""received a complaint that a number of members of a political party had been threatened during a recent leadership campaign"". ""The full circumstances of the incident are still being established and enquiries are continuing at this time."" Mr Poots said that ""no member of my team engaged in any activities of intimidation or bullying"". On a visit to Banbridge Academy on Friday, Mrs Foster,who had been due to resign as first minister at the end of June, also confirmed she intends to leave the DUP after she steps down as first minister. She added that the new DUP leadership had shown its ""direction of travel"" and it was time for her to ""move on"". She told reporters on Friday that while she wished Mr Poots well as the new DUP leader, he must realise there is ""work to do in terms of healing the divisions in the party"". On Thursday, Mrs Foster toldBBC Newscasther departure was ""even by DUP standards, pretty brutal"". In his speech to members after the party endorsed his leadership on Thursday night, Mr Poots paid tribute to Mrs Foster as ""one of the foremost women in unionist and British politics"". Edwin Poots: Who is the new leader of the DUP? Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who ran against Mr Poots for the leadership - Lord Dodds, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson did not wait to hear Mr Poots' speech - they left the building. A very well-known figure in the DUP told BBC News NI it was the ""worst meeting he had attended in over 40 years as a DUP member"". After the ratification, Paul Bell, the former chairman of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP, resigned from the party. Speaking on the BBC's Evening Extra programme on Friday, Strangford MP Jim Shannon said he had not attended the meeting but had spoken to party colleagues who were there. He said there had been ""firm and robust exchanges"" of views. He denied party members left in protest before Mr Poots' speech. ""They have told me clearly that there was no walk-out last night, that the meeting ended at about 10:15,"" he said. ""They had been sitting on their backsides for two and a half hours and we (they) were going home. ""People got up to leave to go home and that was the fact of the matter."" This video can not be played 'The election to the next assembly has started' Mrs Foster has already changed her Twitter handle from @DUPLeader to @ArleneFosterUK, taking all 96,000 followers with her. The twitter handle @DUPLeader was quickly taken by someone else on the social media platform and is now being used as a parody account. This video can not be played 'I saw what happened to my dad - it killed my father' - Ian Paisley In his speech to members, Mr Poots said history will ""ultimately be kind"" to Mrs Foster and he wished her well. He said the party had a leadership contest and will now ""move forward in a united way"". The new DUP leader said preparations for the next election to the Northern Ireland Assembly - due in May 2022 - have now begun. He announced that he will be appointing a director of elections ""quickly"". He said all strands of the party needed to come together. Arlene Foster told the BBC that the move to remove her had been ""pretty brutal"" Speaking of his relationship with the Irish government, Mr Poots said it was ""really, really bad"" as a consequence of how issues were dealt with relating to the Irish border during the Brexit talks. He accused it of attempting to ""starve Northern Ireland people of medicines no less, cancer drugs and other materials, such as the food that's on our table"" and took particular aim at Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, the Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) and foreign affairs minister. The new DUP leader said it was ""quite frankly disgraceful"" that the pair ""took photographs of blown up border posts to impose upon Northern Ireland people the harshest form of customs and an internal market that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world"". However, Mr Poots said he had ""respect"" for Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Also speaking outside the meeting, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said ""leadership transfer hurts"". ""If anyone in this party can talk about difficulty, it's me. I saw what happened to my dad, it killed my father,"" he told BBC's The View. Mr Paisley's late father, Ian, the party founder, had accused his successor, Peter Robinson, and Nigel Doddsof giving him an ultimatum to leave his post. In a statement, theFermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP,externalsaid the removal of Mrs Foster was ""not done in our name"" and it would support her if she remained as an MLA. It said its members ""met this week to voice their disgust at the manner"" in which Mrs Foster had ""been treated over recent weeks"". After Mr Poots was ratified, Paul Bell, former chairman of the association and member for 20 years, resigned from the party. He said it will shed tens of thousands of votes under Edwin Poots and he was ""disgusted"" by the treatment of Mrs Foster. This video can not be played Paul Bell said he was leaving the party over its treatment of Arlene Foster Mr Bell told the BBC's The View programme on Thursday night that Mrs Foster had been ""stabbed in the back"". ""If the DUP cannot have respect for their own people, I don't know how they're going to have respect for people who don't agree with them,"" he said. Red Lines: Is the political landscape in for a shake-up? The party that went from firebrands to government Doug Beattie: Who is the new leader of the UUP? In an interview with BBC Newscast earlier on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the move against her and the manner in which it was carried out was ""not particularly pleasant"". ""I think that I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards it was pretty brutal, in terms of what happened,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Glasgow will continue to be the only part of Scotland under level three restrictions for at least another week. There had been speculation that the city would be able to join the rest of the Scottish mainland in level two. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was still concern about an outbreak of the Indian variant of the virus in the city. She said the variant was now accounting for at least half of the new Covid cases in Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped the city would be able to move to level two on Saturday of next week - with a final decision being taken on Tuesday. And she said there were signs that the situation in Glasgow was beginning to stabilise, with the number of new cases falling in recent days in the postcode areas in the southside of the city which had been at the centre of the outbreak of the Indian variant. The city that has been locked down for nine months What level is your area in? What Covid rules are changing, and when? The level three restrictions mean people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors. Many Glasgow business owners say they are struggling to survive after spending 270 days under tough restrictions, and have criticised the Scottish government for not giving them more financial support. And opposition parties had demanded urgent action to get the city back on a level footing with the rest of the country - where restrictions have eased in recent weeks - as quickly as possible. The rest of mainland Scotland is currently due to join most of the country's island communities in level one on 7 June, before the country moves to level zero - meaning something close to normality - on 28 June. Mobile testing and vaccination centres have been set up in many parts of Glasgow over the past few weeks. And there has been no significant increase in the number of people being hospitalised with the virus - which public health experts say suggests that it is mainly younger, unvaccinated people who are contracting it. However, case numbers have risen by about 30% - from 112 cases per 100,000 to about 136 per 100,000 - over the past week, while the rate of positive tests  has also crept up from about 4% to 4.4%. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus spreads - for Scotland is now estimated to stand at about 1.3, largely driven by the number of cases in Glasgow. Latest figures released shortly after the briefing revealed the Glasgow weekly case rate had dropped to 135.5 per 100,000 people, the first fall in almost a month. Meanwhile, drop-in vaccination centres for people aged 40 and over are being opened across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board. The centres have aset number of appointments,externalon a first-come, first-served basis and will be operational from Saturday. As well as in Glasgow, drop-in vaccinations will also be offered in Paisley, Bearsden, Alexandria, Renfrew, Johnstone, Greenock, Dumbarton, Eastwood, Kirkintilloch, Clydebank and Port Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said the decision to keep Scotland's largest city in level three for a further week had been ""very difficult"". But she said the number of new cases continued to be ""uncomfortably high"" despite the signs of progress. The first minister added: ""The view of the National Incident Management Team is that it would be premature to move Glasgow out of level three immediately, while the situation remains so fragile."" However, if the situation continues to stabilise, Ms Sturgeon said the management team would support a move to level two at the end of next week. Figures released on Friday revealed the first fall in Glasgow's case rate in almost a month Responding to the announcement, the Federation of Small Business said its members in Glasgow had become ""used to these weekly Friday disappointments"" - with this one ""even more galling"" because of the sunny weather that is forecast for the Bank Holiday on Monday. Its chairman, Andrew McRae, said: ""The businesses and employees hardest hit by these ongoing restrictions need proper support now. ""The Glasgow hospitality industry was given two days to scrap their re-opening plans (earlier this month)  -  but even now, after two weeks, we still don't have adequate financial support measures in place."" The Scottish government says further funding has been made available to Glasgow City Council to provide additional support for businesses in hospitality and leisure in Glasgow, with grants ranging from Â£250 to Â£750 per week. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Glasgow has now been under Covid restrictions for 270 days and people were looking to the first minister to give them some hope. ""Instead, we saw Nicola Sturgeon keep the whole city under tougher restrictions for another week, despite outbreaks being largely confined to one area."" He said the government must immediately ramp up the vaccination rollout and testing capacity in the virus hotspots, rather than ""continuing to treat the city as one entity"". Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the government had to be able to tackle future local outbreaks without ""draconian lockdown measures"" being put in place. The first minister will also give an update next Tuesday on whether, and to what extent, the proposed move to level one for mainland council areas will proceed as planned. She said: ""If we see a significant reduction in the health harms of Covid, even as case numbers rise, then hopefully that will allow us to change our approach. ""Because we will be able to rely then on other public health measures, rather than blanket restrictions, to keep the outbreaks under control."" The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased from 68 three weeks ago to 90 today - but there were more than 2,000 people in hospital at the peak of the second wave in January, and the number of Covid patients in intensive care is currently very low. The first minister said she had considered whether additional restrictions needed to be introduced in three other council areas - Clackmannanshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - where there are relatively high levels of the virus. But all three areas have relatively low populations and the number of cases is low in absolute terms - with public health teams confident that the outbreaks are able to be controlled using existing measures. There have been 641 new positive cases of the virus recorded across Scotland in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 25 March. The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for the virus have also been recorded, while the number of people in hospital has risen to 90 - with six patients in intensive care.

"This video can not be played Viktor Orban in London in May 2021: I'm anti-immigration but not anti-Semitic Hungary's Viktor Orban has ended a controversial visit to Boris Johnson by acknowledging he is anti-immigration and standing by an earlier condemnation of Muslim migrants as ""invaders"". He said they had destroyed the border and marched through the country. Downing Street said the UK prime minister had raised ""significant concerns"" about media freedom and human rights. The visit prompted broad criticism from politicians and anti-racism groups. Mr Johnson's opponents condemned the talks even before they took place, citing Mr Orban's treatment of press freedom and democratic values as well as his ""Islamophobic"" views on Muslim migrants. But No 10 said Mr Johnson had brought up those issues, including LGBT rights and gender equality. Russia, Belarus and China were also discussed, it said, adding that Mr Orban had been urged to ""promote democracy and stability"". ""I said it's a Western democracy, so it's the same system as here,"" The Hungarian leader told reporters. The right-wing Hungarian leader has courted China and is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, choosing to allow Covid-19 vaccinations with Russia's Sputnik V before it is given approval by the EU's medicines agency. Last year he pushed the EU to lift sanctions on Belarus, although he backed this week's response by EU leaders to the Belarus leader's decision to force a Ryanair plane to divert and land so that a dissident journalist and his girlfriend could be arrested. He has praised the UK's decision to leave the EU, and pulled his ruling Fidesz party out of the the EU's main centre-right grouping this year, after it was suspended over its human rights record. Viktor Orban's visit to Downing Street has prompted much scratching of heads. Why on Earth would Boris Johnson decide that he should be the second EU leader since Brexit to get a warm welcome at Downing Street? There are several reasons. The first, I am told, is that the Hungarian leader asked for the visit. It's been in the diary for a couple of months. And as one No 10 source said, you have to have a pretty good reason to say no to an EU head of government if they ask to see you. Second, Mr Orban is also taking over the presidency of a group of central European countries known as the Visegrad 4. And third, so the argument goes, the UK can't just talk to countries it agrees with. But the visit may be seen by some in Europe as provocative, and it may sit uneasily with the government's agenda for its big G7 summit next month. Britain wants the G7 and its allies to do more to defend Western liberal democracy and its values. Mr Orban is seen by some as the antithesis of that. Hungary is currently ranked 92nd out of 180 countries on the Reporters without Borders World Press Freedom Index. Pro-Orban supporters have taken control of Hungarian media in recent years and last year journalists walked out of the biggest remaining independent website, Index, accusing the government of trying to tame or destroy it. The Orban government has also transferred a number of state universities to private control, while the Central European University (CEU), founded by liberal Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros, has moved from Budapest to Vienna citing a ""serious violation of academic freedom"". A poster campaign against Mr Soros was condemned for whipping up anti-Semitism. But Mr Orban on Friday denied allegations of anti-Semitism as ridiculous. ""George Soros is a talented Hungarian businessman... he is very much in favour of migration, financing and helping the NGOs who are doing that. We don't like it but it has nothing to do with ethnic identity,"" he said. UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng argued that the UK had to speak to all sorts of world leaders, even those whose values it might not share. ""I think Viktor Orban's views on migrants are things that I would not endorse in any way,"" he told Sky News. But Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman Lisa Nandy was damning of the decision to invite him. ""Turns out when you have no moral anchor, you end up adrift,"" she said, after Downing Street had condemned Mr Orban's comments on migrants as ""divisive and wrong"". Journalists resign at Hungary's top news site Hungary vilifies financier with posters Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey wrote to Mr Johnson ahead of the meeting with a list of challenges he wanted put to the Hungarian leader. ""Orban's rule has been marked by a sustained assault on Hungarian democracy, on press freedom and on human rights,"" he said. Protesters from the Stand Up To Racism group stood outside Downing Street condemning the Hungarian leader. Orban: I'm anti-immigration but not anti-Semitic.

"Matt Hancock was guilty of a ""minor technical breach of the ministerial code"" after initially failing to declare his stake in an NHS supplier. Lord Geidt - the PM's adviser on ministerial interests - also said the health secretary had acted promptly to correct the record. Although there had been no conflict of interest, he said there was a ""danger"" it could have looked like one. The PM said Mr Hancock's good name had not been damaged by the incident. And he would not be taking ""any further action"" in relation to the matter, he added. PM cleared of misconduct over Downing Street flat Hancock 'had drink' with Cameron and Greensill Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority At the same time, Lord Geidt cleared Boris Johnson of misconduct over the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat, although he said the PM had ""acted unwisely"" over funding arrangements. Lord Geidt - who was appointed by Mr Johnson in April - investigated a potential conflict of interest over Mr Hancock's shares in Topwood Ltd, a company approved as a potential supplier for NHS trusts in England. It was run by Mr Hancock's sister and brother-in-law. In March this year, Mr Hancock declaredhe had acquired shares in the company, which was granted the approved supplier status in 2019. The firm, which specialises in the secure storage, shredding and scanning of documents, also won Â£300,000 of business from NHS Wales this year.

He said Mr Hancock had ""acted properly and honestly in promptly"" declaring his financial interest. In an exchange of letters with the prime minister, Mr Hancock said his goal ""has always been to act properly and honestly in these matters"". He said he had taken the advice of his permanent secretary and had ""always sought to act within the ministerial code"".

In a reply to Mr Hancock, the prime minister said he agreed the incident should in no way ""impugn"" Mr Hancock's  good character and he would not be taking ""any further action"".

"Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. Waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease, UK Hospitality said. It called on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government said it was ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body said. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Restaurants struggle to find staff ahead of reopening UK Hospitality said there was currently a shortfall of about 188,000 workers, with the shortage of front-of-house staff and chefs being ""particularly acute"". Under the government's roadmap out of lockdown, all coronavirus restrictions in England could be lifted on 21 June. But in recent days ministers, including Boris Johnson,have warned that could be delayedby an increase in the number of cases of the Indian variant. UK Hospitality said that uncertainty was one factor in people not going for restaurant jobs. ""The government must restore confidence in the hospitality sector so that it is again seen as a stable employer and provider of fulfilling careers,"" said Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality. ""To facilitate this, it must stick to the re-opening roadmap, lifting all restrictions from 21 June. This will restore consumer confidence and give a strong signal to workers that hospitality will bounce back strongly."" Many hospitality businesses have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, including rates holidays and the furlough scheme. Many hospitality staff have been laid off during the pandemic. Brexit has also contributed to staff shortages, especially in city centre venues, as EU workers returned to their home countries, a UK Hospitality spokesperson said. Overseas workers also returned home at the beginning of the pandemic, and many have not returned due to travel restrictions. UK Hospitality urged the government to encourage UK-based workers to join the sector. It also asked for the government to renew its list of shortage occupations and consider a visa scheme for workers who would not qualify under the points-based system. The government is working with the sector to understand the impact on job shortages due to Brexit and the Covid pandemic, a government spokesperson said. Employers should focus on training the domestic workforce, the spokesperson said, rather than relying on labour from abroad. The immigration system attracts the ""best and brightest talent"", the government added. ""We are doing everything we can to support hospitality to recover following the reopening of indoor venues in England earlier this month. ""Our dedicated work coaches are supporting people into work, including in hospitality, and through the Kickstart Scheme we're offering generous incentives to employers to recruit, with hundreds of young people starting work every day.""

"The HS2 high speed rail network's eastern leg, linking Birmingham to Leeds, will go ahead and could even be delivered earlier than planned, the transport secretary has said. But further work was needed on how to integrate it with plans for northern powerhouse rail, said Grant Shapps. The HS2 network is due to be built in stages, with the final leg to Leeds completed by 2040. But critics say its Â£106bn price tag cannot be justified. In December, the National Infrastructure Commission said that the government should focus on improving rail links between cities in the North and Midlands over new projects such as HS2. As a result, transport groups in the North and Midlands had feared the eastern leg of the project could be scrapped. HS2 dishonest over compensation claim, says report Is high-speed rail travel on a track to nowhere? However, speaking at an online event run by the Policy Exchange think tank this week Mr Shapps said HS2 would be built in full and might be delivered earlier than previously planned. ""We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,"" he said. ""The only question that we have is how to better integrate that with plans which have developed a very long way since HS2 was first dreamt up all those decades ago. That particularly pertains to the northern powerhouse rail."" Mr Shapps suggested the eastern leg to Leeds originally scheduled for completion between 2035 and 2040 could be brought forward ""quite dramatically"" by building it ""in a smarter way"". He said the government would provide further information on that ""soon"". Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a lobby group, said the government was doing the right thing. ""It's critical to ensuring levelling up is a reality not just rhetoric,"" said Mr Murison, referring to election promises to boost the economy in the north of England. Maria Machancoses, chief executive of Midlands Connect, a government-funded regional transport body, said: ""While these verbal commitments are encouraging, we need definitive action, namely the publication of the government's Integrated Rail Plan, to give businesses and investors the confidence they need to make decisions. ""The quicker we know government's intentions, the faster we can act, and the sooner we can deliver the benefits local communities,"" she added.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Glasgow will continue to be the only part of Scotland under level three restrictions for at least another week. There had been speculation that the city would be able to join the rest of the Scottish mainland in level two. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was still concern about an outbreak of the Indian variant of the virus in the city. She said the variant was now accounting for at least half of the new Covid cases in Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped the city would be able to move to level two on Saturday of next week - with a final decision being taken on Tuesday. And she said there were signs that the situation in Glasgow was beginning to stabilise, with the number of new cases falling in recent days in the postcode areas in the southside of the city which had been at the centre of the outbreak of the Indian variant. The city that has been locked down for nine months What level is your area in? What Covid rules are changing, and when? The level three restrictions mean people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors. Many Glasgow business owners say they are struggling to survive after spending 270 days under tough restrictions, and have criticised the Scottish government for not giving them more financial support. And opposition parties had demanded urgent action to get the city back on a level footing with the rest of the country - where restrictions have eased in recent weeks - as quickly as possible. The rest of mainland Scotland is currently due to join most of the country's island communities in level one on 7 June, before the country moves to level zero - meaning something close to normality - on 28 June. Mobile testing and vaccination centres have been set up in many parts of Glasgow over the past few weeks. And there has been no significant increase in the number of people being hospitalised with the virus - which public health experts say suggests that it is mainly younger, unvaccinated people who are contracting it. However, case numbers have risen by about 30% - from 112 cases per 100,000 to about 136 per 100,000 - over the past week, while the rate of positive tests  has also crept up from about 4% to 4.4%. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus spreads - for Scotland is now estimated to stand at about 1.3, largely driven by the number of cases in Glasgow. Latest figures released shortly after the briefing revealed the Glasgow weekly case rate had dropped to 135.5 per 100,000 people, the first fall in almost a month. Meanwhile, drop-in vaccination centres for people aged 40 and over are being opened across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board. The centres have aset number of appointments,externalon a first-come, first-served basis and will be operational from Saturday. As well as in Glasgow, drop-in vaccinations will also be offered in Paisley, Bearsden, Alexandria, Renfrew, Johnstone, Greenock, Dumbarton, Eastwood, Kirkintilloch, Clydebank and Port Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said the decision to keep Scotland's largest city in level three for a further week had been ""very difficult"". But she said the number of new cases continued to be ""uncomfortably high"" despite the signs of progress. The first minister added: ""The view of the National Incident Management Team is that it would be premature to move Glasgow out of level three immediately, while the situation remains so fragile."" However, if the situation continues to stabilise, Ms Sturgeon said the management team would support a move to level two at the end of next week. Figures released on Friday revealed the first fall in Glasgow's case rate in almost a month Responding to the announcement, the Federation of Small Business said its members in Glasgow had become ""used to these weekly Friday disappointments"" - with this one ""even more galling"" because of the sunny weather that is forecast for the Bank Holiday on Monday. Its chairman, Andrew McRae, said: ""The businesses and employees hardest hit by these ongoing restrictions need proper support now. ""The Glasgow hospitality industry was given two days to scrap their re-opening plans (earlier this month)  -  but even now, after two weeks, we still don't have adequate financial support measures in place."" The Scottish government says further funding has been made available to Glasgow City Council to provide additional support for businesses in hospitality and leisure in Glasgow, with grants ranging from Â£250 to Â£750 per week. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Glasgow has now been under Covid restrictions for 270 days and people were looking to the first minister to give them some hope. ""Instead, we saw Nicola Sturgeon keep the whole city under tougher restrictions for another week, despite outbreaks being largely confined to one area."" He said the government must immediately ramp up the vaccination rollout and testing capacity in the virus hotspots, rather than ""continuing to treat the city as one entity"". Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the government had to be able to tackle future local outbreaks without ""draconian lockdown measures"" being put in place. The first minister will also give an update next Tuesday on whether, and to what extent, the proposed move to level one for mainland council areas will proceed as planned. She said: ""If we see a significant reduction in the health harms of Covid, even as case numbers rise, then hopefully that will allow us to change our approach. ""Because we will be able to rely then on other public health measures, rather than blanket restrictions, to keep the outbreaks under control."" The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased from 68 three weeks ago to 90 today - but there were more than 2,000 people in hospital at the peak of the second wave in January, and the number of Covid patients in intensive care is currently very low. The first minister said she had considered whether additional restrictions needed to be introduced in three other council areas - Clackmannanshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - where there are relatively high levels of the virus. But all three areas have relatively low populations and the number of cases is low in absolute terms - with public health teams confident that the outbreaks are able to be controlled using existing measures. There have been 641 new positive cases of the virus recorded across Scotland in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 25 March. The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for the virus have also been recorded, while the number of people in hospital has risen to 90 - with six patients in intensive care.

"British exports worth billions of pounds have faced tariffs on trade with the EU since Brexit, according to an analysis of official EU statistics. Despite the tariff-free deal agreed with the EU, a study by the University of Sussex found up to Â£3.5bn of British exports had taxes applied. That accounts for about 10% of British goods exports to the EU. Some firms paid due to the complexity of claiming zero tariffs, or said they planned to reclaim the fees later. For exporters, maintaining zero tariffs under the post-Brexit deal is not automatic: it needs to be claimed on customs declarations that from January have had to accompany every export to the European Union. An analysis for the BBC, by the University of Sussex's Trade Policy Observatory, used European customs data from these declarations. The figures indicated that between Â£2.5bn and Â£3.5bn of British exports faced a tariff in the first three months of 2021. Post-Brexit trade: Three firms, three problems Cheese maker upset at Â£180 post-Brexit Stilton fee The European Commission confirmed that according to data collected by its customs authorities, â¬2.5bn of eligible UK exports did not use the zero-tariff agreement. ""Tariff-free trade is only tariff-free if firms not only meet the rules of origin criteria, but also can deal with the necessary bureaucracy and paperwork,"" said Prof Michael Gasiorek, trade expert at the University of Sussex. ""What this analysis shows is that in the first quarter, around 27% of trade that could have entered tariff-free did not do so. ""In some sectors and for some firms, this will no doubt improve, but it reflects the reality that leaving the EU has imposed real costs on firms, with long-term implications for trade and production."" The data covers all British exports to the EU in January and February, and some reporting nations in March. Individual businesses and groups told the BBC of instances where millions of pounds in tariffs had been paid. Most put this down to complex arrangements for claiming zero tariffs, difficulties over the re-export to the EU of goods processed in Britain, and an expectation that some of these fees could eventually be recovered. Some of the world's biggest multinationals have paid seven-figure tariff bills. A classic car repairer, The Classic Car Mechanic, showed tariff bills of hundreds of pounds for car parts for rare vehicles sent to Hungary, which could not be valued, and so were hit with a tariff by French customs. ""We've had to pay a tariff, even though we've got a zero tariff,"" said the boss of the business, Simon Spurrell. ""It's the same with all the other shipments, all UK origin parts, but they dispute it and they hold it up. ""We feel that we have no fight left in us, we have to then, as a small organisation just say, well, we'll cut our losses, and just pay the duty."" The Trade Policy Observatory has tried to quantify the effect of extra trade barriers with the EU on different sectors. Although exports began to recover from a massive drop in January, over the quarter, the Observatory calculated that, of the worst affected sectors, textiles saw exports fall 63%, food suffered a 36% drop, and the automotive industry saw exports down 20%. Other advanced manufacturing industries have not been affected, according to the analysis, which seeks to isolate the impact of post-Brexit barriers from the impact of the pandemic. A government spokesperson said: ""The vast majority of traders have adjusted well to our new trading relationship with the EU. ""HMRC continues to work closely with exporters to ensure they correctly apply rules of origin requirements and are aware of their right to refunds. ""The unprecedented zero-tariff zero-quota deal we secured with the EU allows businesses to trade smoothly, while we can now regulate in a way that suits the UK economy and our businesses - doing things in a more innovative and effective way, without being bound by EU rules."" The analysis also showed that in the early months of the deal, there were some marked differences between EU nations in the extent of use of the free-trade deal for imports of British goods. Data for what is known as ""preference utilisation"" of British exports to Germany shows rates well below half in January and February at 42% and 44% respectively. The trade deal has been used more, according to the data, for exports to France, reaching 77% in March. Preference utilisation rates (PURs) measure the extent to which tariff preferences provided by a particular trade agreement are being used by imports and exports of either side. European Commission sources stressed that overall use of the deal was in line with the first months of other free-trade deals and that it would take some time to assess the impact. UK government ministers told Parliament last month that they would be releasing their equivalent data for EU exports into Great Britain shortly.

"Boris Johnson's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds reportedly oversaw the flat refurbishment Boris Johnson acted ""unwisely"" by not being more ""rigorous"" in finding out who had funded refurbishment work on the Downing Street flat, a report says. Lord Geidt, the PM's adviser on standards, said a Tory donor had paid an invoice for some of the costs. But he cleared Mr Johnson - who was seemingly unaware of the arrangement - of breaking ministerial conduct rules. The works on the flat, overseen by the PM's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds, are thought to have cost around Â£90,000. The report did not say how much former Conservative vice-chairman Lord Brownlow had put up to fund the refurbishment, but a figure of Â£58,000 has been widely reported. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Johnson appoints new standards adviser What investigations is the government facing? Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had funded the ""wider refurbishment"", suggesting Lord Brownlow had been repaid. But Labour said it was ""staggering"" that Mr Johnson could ""rack up"" a bill ""yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid"". Separately, the Electoral Commission iscarrying out an investigationinto whether the Conservative Party broke the law on political donations regarding the funding of the flat. And Health SecretaryMatt Hancock has been found guiltyof a ""minor breach"" of the ministerial code, which sets the rules for behaviour in public office, over shares in an NHS supplier. Prime ministers receive an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their Downing Street living quarters, which are publicly-owned. Mr Johnson has faced repeated questions over how refurbishments to the flat above 11 Downing Street, where he lives with Ms Symonds, were financed. The renovation work began in spring last year when Mr Johnson was in hospital with Covid. The prime minister has previously said he paid the difference between the taxpayer-funded contribution and the full costs. But he did not specify whether this involved paying the bills up-front or repaying money loaned to him or the government for the project. In his report, Lord Geidt found ""no evidence"" that Lord Brownlow had told Mr Johnson ""he had personally settled"" costs. And, when Lord Brownlow informed government officials about the money, they had not ""acted on this information to the extent of informing the prime minister"", it said. But Lord Geidt - who was appointed by Mr Johnson last month as standards adviser following the resignation of Sir Alex Allen - did criticise the prime minister's conduct. He had, said the peer, ""unwisely... allowed the refurbishment of the apartment... to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded"". Lord Geidt also said that ""in the middle of a pandemic"", Mr Johnson ""simply accepted"" that a trust he was hoping to set up to handle the Downing Street work ""would be capable of satisfactorily resolving the situation without further interrogation"". Although this report clears Boris Johnson of breaking the ministerial code, parts of it will be awkward reading in Downing Street. Lord Geidt questions why Boris Johnson didn't pay more attention to who was paying for the work in his flat. Why wasn't the prime minister more curious, he wonders? It is also critical of officials - saying the prime minister was ""ill-served"" by those around him when it came to this project. But, crucially, there is no sense from this report that the arrangement led to a conflict of interest. Downing Street is also keen to point out the costs - beyond an annual allowance - have not been met by the taxpayer. But Lord Geidt concluded that ""no conflict (or reasonably perceived conflict) arises"" from the involvement of Lord Brownlow or the Conservative Party in the refurbishment. He said of Lord Brownlow that ""there is no evidence that he acted with anything other than altruistic and philanthropic motives"". Speaking in Swindon, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said no public money was used in an improper way. He said because the arrangement involved private money, the ""facts speak for themselves in favour of"" the prime minister. And responding to the report, Downing Street said it showed the prime minister had ""acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times"". Lord Geidt was appointed last month as the PM's standards adviser A spokesperson added: ""Cabinet Office officials were engaged and informed throughout and official advice was followed. ""Other than works funded through the annual allowance, the costs of the wider refurbishment of the flat are not being financed by taxpayers and have been settled by the prime minister personally."" If a politician or party accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether this rule was followed by the Conservative Party in relation to the Downing Street refurbishment. If the commission finds it was not, it has the power to issue a fine of up to Â£20,000.

We're about to bring things to a close for the day. Here are the latest headlines: Stephanie MiskinBBC News Jackie and Jason have run Bromyard Travel Services in Hereford for the past 12 years Months of no bookings, holidays being cancelled or rearranged and no idea what the future holds - one independent travel agent explains how the past 18 months have been a ""living nightmare"". Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds.

National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June. It runs seven attractions including the International Slavery Museum, Merseyside Maritime Museum and the Walker Art Gallery. The venues reopened last summer but were closed again when further restrictions kicked in. Read more here. BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said. Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults. Ubiquitous Chip co-owner Colin Clydesdale tells the BBC the news came as no surprise Businesses and politicians have expressed frustration overGlasgow remaining in Level 3 restrictions. The area is the only Scottish council under the harsher measures despite speculation it could have moved to Level 2. Before the news emerged,residents in the city told the BBCthey felt ""broken by Covid"" and while they were continuing to make lifestyle adjustments, the length of the lockdown had left them feeling ""institutionalised"". Following the announcement, Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, says the city is becoming used to ""weekly Friday disappointments"". But Colin Clydesdale, co-owner of west end restaurant Ubiquitous Chip, says the news has come as no surprise after ""so many false starts"". He tells the BBC: ""What I've been saying is for this industry to come out of this in any semblance of reality it's got to get open as quickly as possible. It's got to start paying for itself again."" You can read more reaction here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures. Read more:The vaccines that work - and the others on the way As we reported earlier, restrictions in Glasgow will not be easeduntil next week at the earliest. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Covid cases are still high in the city, but public health measures are helping to ""stabilise"" the situation and there are ""signs of progress"". If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions. The Mouth of the Tyne Festival had been scheduled to take place in Tynemouth from 8-11 July, having already been scrapped last year. Keane were due to perform as one of the event's headliners. The festival is now expected to return in July 2022. Organisers say the decision was made with ""a heavy heart"". Read more More than 42,000 passengers flew between India and the UK in April, figures from the Civil Aviation Authority show. The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

"An Austrian Airlines plane (not the one pictured) left Vienna for Moscow on Friday morning Russia's foreign ministry has condemned the EU's call for Europe-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace, calling it completely irresponsible. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, commenting after Russia had denied entry to two airlines that planned to avoid Belarus, said passenger safety was at risk. EU leaders had acted after Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to divert and land in the capital, Minsk. A Belarusian dissident journalist and his girlfriend were then arrested. Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who is a Russian citizen, are both in jail. A court on Friday rejected her appeal against a two-month detention. The EU's 27 leaders met this week,externaland demanded their immediate release, as has the G7 group of nations. The UN's civil aviation agency has said it will launch a ""fact-finding"" investigation into Belarus's actions, and whether there had been any breach of international aviation law. No reason was given for Moscow's decision to refuse access to flights from Air France and Austrian Airlines, but an Air France spokesperson said Russia's requirement of a ""new authorisation"" was linked to the airline bypassing Belarusian airspace. On Friday, Russia's aviation authority allowed entry to several European airlines bypassing Belarus, including Austrian Airlines, although Air France did cancel another Paris-Moscow flight. The aviation agency warned that airlines that changed routes might have to await longer clearance times. This was the arrivals board in Minsk on Friday. Under EU measures, all Belarusian flights are banned from EU airspace Russia is Belarus's biggest ally and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Friday for talks with President Vladimir Putin. It is their third meeting this year. Up till now Alexander Lukashenko has been masterful at playing on the Kremlin's fears and phobias of the West, presenting himself as Russia's first line of defence against alleged external threats. Claiming - without proof - that Nato, the US, Europe are plotting to gobble up Belarus, and then move on to Russia. So, in the face of Western sanctions, in Sochi he will expect President Putin to back him politically and, crucially, financially. Especially since Russia and Belarus are, on paper at least, part of a union state. The two leaders met in Sochi in February and then two months later at the Kremlin But although the two men are political allies, close friends they are not. There have been plenty of squabbles in the past. For years Moscow has been irritated by Mr Lukashenko's attempts to play Russia off against the West. The Kremlin views him as something of a loose cannon. After the Ryanair jet drama and the arrest of two passengers, it's unclear what message the leader of Russia will be sending to the leader of Belarus. The foreign ministry spokeswoman denounced EU leaders for deciding to ""redraw the routes of hundreds of flights in a single day, creating colossal problems for its citizens"". Austria's foreign ministry said Russia's actions against the airline on Thursday had been ""absolutely incomprehensible"". On Friday, the rules were relaxed as Austrian Airlines flight OS601 from Vienna was given permission to land in Moscow,. Among the EU's immediate measures is a ban on Belarusian airlines over the airspace of its 27 member states. Ukraine is also banning Belarus-registered planes from its airspace from Saturday, having halted flights to and from Belarus. Further sanctions are still being assessed on officials in Mr Lukashenko's government and Belarusian economic sectors in particular. The Belarusian opposition leader told reporters in The Hague that a nationwide strike was being planned to protest against the arrests After meeting exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in The Hague, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was time to target sectors ""connected to the regime - and that is crucial because we have to hit these people in the wallet"". Belarus will lose out on millions of dollars a year in over-flight fees as a result of European airlines avoiding its airspace. The EU measures have also hit Belarus carrier Belavia, which has now cancelled 16 European routes. This Belavia flight to Barcelona on Wednesday was kept in a holding pattern as it tried to fly over Poland, before it returned to Minsk The BBC's Sarah Rainsford described lengthy queues outside Belavia offices in Minsk on Thursday as Belarusians scrambled to get ticket refunds. Is plane interception a first? What happens with a military jet interception? What impact could tougher action against Belarus have? In a separate move, the European Broadcasting Union said it was suspending Belarus state TV and radio, blaming suppression of media freedom. The company has two weeks to respond.Belarus was disqualified from this month's Eurovisionsong contest, organised by the EBU, for lyrics seen as targeting anti-government protesters. On Sunday, Ryanair Flight 4978 was travelling from Athens to Vilnius, when it was forcibly diverted to Minsk. A fighter jet was scrambled to ensure it changed course. Belarus authorities said they had received a bomb threat, but according to Swiss secure email provider Proton Mailthe emailed message was sent after the plane was diverted,external. Aboard were Mr Protasevich, 26, who lives in exile in Lithuania, and his girlfriend, Ms Sapega, 23, an international law student. They were arrested as passengers disembarked the plane. Mr Protasevich was put on the Belarus terrorist list last year, and faces serious charges. Who is Roman Protasevich? Who is Sofia Sapega? On Thursday, Mr Protasevich was able to see his lawyer, Inesa Alenskaya, for the first time. ""All is well, he is vigorous, positive and cheerful, there is nothing to worry about,"" she was quoted as saying. This video can not be played Inside Nexta: The journalists taking on Belarusâ regime Russia's foreign ministry says Ms Sapega is accused of breaking Belarusian law in August and September of 2020. Her lawyer said he had promised the court not to give details of the criminal case against her. Videos were released showing the pair confessing to crimes, but it is likely they were speaking under duress. Their arrests and the forced landing of the plane have prompted international outrage. ""We must have measures to ensure that can't happen again,"" the head of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh, told Reuters. The head of Lithuania's criminal police bureau, Rolandas Kiskis, told reporters that the Ryanair crew and 90% of the passengers who had arrived in Vilnius had been questioned about their ordeal. His team were working with other European investigators, he said. Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile.

"Jeanette Shields had been in hospital for routine treatment A woman has died after being ""dropped"" on the floor during surgery on her hip, which she had broken while in hospital. Jeannette Shields, 70, had been receiving treatment for gall stones in Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle. North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Trust said an investigation was under way ""in relation to an incident involving a patient in one of our theatres"". Mrs Shields' husband, John, said he told the hospital he would not be ""pushing this thing under the carpet"". His wife left her bed to go to the toilet by herself after getting no response to her buzzer, Mr Shields said. She felt dizzy, fell and broke her hip, he told the BBC. John Shields, 78, said he was shocked Two days later she had surgery to repair it, after which the hospital called Mr Shields to say the operation had been successful but that ""unfortunately they dropped her off the operating [table] after the surgery"", he said. ""Then they had to use the sliding board to pick her up and rush her in and do scans on her,"" he said. ""She had a great big bump on the back of her head and she just deteriorated and then she just passed away, just died. ""I'm shocked, I'm really shocked."" It is not clear what happened or how Mrs Shields ended up falling from the operating table. Her daughter, Vikki, said the family later alerted nurses to a large bump on her head. ""You've never seen a bump like it on the bottom of her head,"" she said. Jeanette Shields' family said she had a large bump on her head Mrs Shields, from Carlisle, died six weeks later on 21 May. Her husband said he was initially told there would not be a post-mortem examination. ""I demanded a post-mortem because they wouldn't do it in Carlisle, they didn't want to do it, but I've got it,"" he said. The trust said it had informed its regulators but was ""unable to comment on ongoing investigations"". ""Once it is complete, the findings will be shared with the family and with our regulators in line with normal procedure,"" a spokesperson said. ""The outcome of the investigation will also determine any further action that we will need to take."" Mr Shields said the way the hospital had dealt with the situation was ""disgusting"".

Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds.

National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June.

BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said. Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults.

Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Covid cases are still high in the city, but public health measures are helping to ""stabilise"" the situation and there are ""signs of progress"". If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions. The Mouth of the Tyne Festival had been scheduled to take place in Tynemouth from 8-11 July, having already been scrapped last year. Keane were due to perform as one of the event's headliners. The festival is now expected to return in July 2022. Organisers say the decision was made with ""a heavy heart"". Read more More than 42,000 passengers flew between India and the UK in April, figures from the Civil Aviation Authority show. The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

"People renewing their home or motor insurance will pay no more than they would as a new customer from January. The new rules have been confirmed by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), following years of complaints. The FCA says the move will save loyal customers an estimated Â£4.2bn over 10 years. But it admitted it could spell the end of the cheapest deals for new customers. The regulator has been trying to change the rules to prevent ""price walking"" - when insurance prices rise at each renewal even though the level of risk has not changed. ""These measures will put an end to the very high prices paid by many loyal customers,"" said Sheldon Mills, from the FCA. 'Shopping around is impossible when you don't have a computer' Insurer 'made money from my loyalty' ""Consumers can still benefit from shopping around or negotiating with their current provider, but won't be charged more at renewal just for being an existing customer."" It follows complaints from consumer groups that loyal customers pay more unnecessarily. So-called price walking is when a customer is charged more, year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater. The FCA has pointed to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically pays Â£130 for a year's cover. But for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rises to Â£238. For motor insurance, new customers pay Â£285 while people who have been with their provider for more than five years pay Â£370, according to the FCA's example. Following a super-complaint from Citizens Advice, the FCA has been looking to tackle the loyalty penalty - a result of the growth, and encouragement, of shopping around for better deals for insurance, overdrafts and utilities. Those who switch get the best deals as new customers. Those who stay loyal get charged more. Ten million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more. Mike Noone says the cost of his car insurance rose sharply Among those facing the loyalty penalty was Mike Noone, from Manchester, who retired after running a fruit and vegetable stall with his wife for 16 years. ""Looking back, running a small business like ours was all consuming and you do tend to let things slide at home,"" he said. He received a car insurance renewal quote in which the price had gone up by 20%. ""One of our daughters said: 'Dad, you've really got to get on the internet and find yourself a better quote than that'.  So I did,"" he said. He challenged his insurer which did not budge on the price, so he switched provider. Charities said other people might not be able to switch so easily. They said the problems were worse for people on very low incomes who might not have the technology to search for the cheapest deals, or those who find the calculations difficult. ""We're pleased to see the FCA setting the bar so high in stamping out this systematic scam, and we now need to see similar action in the other markets,"" said Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice. The FCA will also bring in new rules to make it easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals and require insurers to look more closely at how they offer fair value for consumers. It will also require home and motor insurance firms to report more data to the regulator. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers, which represents the sector, said: ""As the FCA has said previously, insurers do not make excessive profits and, as they now point out, it is likely that firms will no longer be able to offer unsustainably low-priced deals to some customers."" He added that it was vital that customers still had incentives to shop around, and that people should look for the deal that suited their needs instead of just choosing the cheapest one.

"Boris Johnson's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds reportedly oversaw the flat refurbishment Boris Johnson acted ""unwisely"" by not being more ""rigorous"" in finding out who had funded refurbishment work on the Downing Street flat, a report says. Lord Geidt, the PM's adviser on standards, said a Tory donor had paid an invoice for some of the costs. But he cleared Mr Johnson - who was seemingly unaware of the arrangement - of breaking ministerial conduct rules. The works on the flat, overseen by the PM's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds, are thought to have cost around Â£90,000. The report did not say how much former Conservative vice-chairman Lord Brownlow had put up to fund the refurbishment, but a figure of Â£58,000 has been widely reported. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Johnson appoints new standards adviser What investigations is the government facing? Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had funded the ""wider refurbishment"", suggesting Lord Brownlow had been repaid. But Labour said it was ""staggering"" that Mr Johnson could ""rack up"" a bill ""yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid"". Separately, the Electoral Commission iscarrying out an investigationinto whether the Conservative Party broke the law on political donations regarding the funding of the flat. And Health SecretaryMatt Hancock has been found guiltyof a ""minor breach"" of the ministerial code, which sets the rules for behaviour in public office, over shares in an NHS supplier. Prime ministers receive an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their Downing Street living quarters, which are publicly-owned. Mr Johnson has faced repeated questions over how refurbishments to the flat above 11 Downing Street, where he lives with Ms Symonds, were financed. The renovation work began in spring last year when Mr Johnson was in hospital with Covid. The prime minister has previously said he paid the difference between the taxpayer-funded contribution and the full costs. But he did not specify whether this involved paying the bills up-front or repaying money loaned to him or the government for the project. In his report, Lord Geidt found ""no evidence"" that Lord Brownlow had told Mr Johnson ""he had personally settled"" costs. And, when Lord Brownlow informed government officials about the money, they had not ""acted on this information to the extent of informing the prime minister"", it said. But Lord Geidt - who was appointed by Mr Johnson last month as standards adviser following the resignation of Sir Alex Allen - did criticise the prime minister's conduct. He had, said the peer, ""unwisely... allowed the refurbishment of the apartment... to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded"". Lord Geidt also said that ""in the middle of a pandemic"", Mr Johnson ""simply accepted"" that a trust he was hoping to set up to handle the Downing Street work ""would be capable of satisfactorily resolving the situation without further interrogation"". Although this report clears Boris Johnson of breaking the ministerial code, parts of it will be awkward reading in Downing Street. Lord Geidt questions why Boris Johnson didn't pay more attention to who was paying for the work in his flat. Why wasn't the prime minister more curious, he wonders? It is also critical of officials - saying the prime minister was ""ill-served"" by those around him when it came to this project. But, crucially, there is no sense from this report that the arrangement led to a conflict of interest. Downing Street is also keen to point out the costs - beyond an annual allowance - have not been met by the taxpayer. But Lord Geidt concluded that ""no conflict (or reasonably perceived conflict) arises"" from the involvement of Lord Brownlow or the Conservative Party in the refurbishment. He said of Lord Brownlow that ""there is no evidence that he acted with anything other than altruistic and philanthropic motives"". Speaking in Swindon, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said no public money was used in an improper way. He said because the arrangement involved private money, the ""facts speak for themselves in favour of"" the prime minister. And responding to the report, Downing Street said it showed the prime minister had ""acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times"". Lord Geidt was appointed last month as the PM's standards adviser A spokesperson added: ""Cabinet Office officials were engaged and informed throughout and official advice was followed. ""Other than works funded through the annual allowance, the costs of the wider refurbishment of the flat are not being financed by taxpayers and have been settled by the prime minister personally."" If a politician or party accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether this rule was followed by the Conservative Party in relation to the Downing Street refurbishment. If the commission finds it was not, it has the power to issue a fine of up to Â£20,000. Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, is also looking into the refurbishment, including whether donations were properly declared.

"An Austrian Airlines plane (not the one pictured) left Vienna for Moscow on Friday morning Russia's foreign ministry has condemned the EU's call for Europe-based airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace, calling it completely irresponsible. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, commenting after Russia had denied entry to two airlines that planned to avoid Belarus, said passenger safety was at risk. EU leaders had acted after Belarus forced a Ryanair plane to divert and land in the capital, Minsk. A Belarusian dissident journalist and his girlfriend were then arrested. Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, who is a Russian citizen, are both in jail. A court on Friday rejected her appeal against a two-month detention. The EU's 27 leaders met this week,externaland demanded their immediate release, as has the G7 group of nations. The UN's civil aviation agency has said it will launch a ""fact-finding"" investigation into Belarus's actions, and whether there had been any breach of international aviation law. No reason was given for Moscow's decision to refuse access to flights from Air France and Austrian Airlines, but an Air France spokesperson said Russia's requirement of a ""new authorisation"" was linked to the airline bypassing Belarusian airspace. On Friday, Russia's aviation authority allowed entry to several European airlines bypassing Belarus, including Austrian Airlines, although Air France did cancel another Paris-Moscow flight. The aviation agency warned that airlines that changed routes might have to await longer clearance times. This was the arrivals board in Minsk on Friday. Under EU measures, all Belarusian flights are banned from EU airspace Russia is Belarus's biggest ally and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Friday for talks with President Vladimir Putin. It is their third meeting this year. Up till now Alexander Lukashenko has been masterful at playing on the Kremlin's fears and phobias of the West, presenting himself as Russia's first line of defence against alleged external threats. Claiming - without proof - that Nato, the US, Europe are plotting to gobble up Belarus, and then move on to Russia. So, in the face of Western sanctions, in Sochi he will expect President Putin to back him politically and, crucially, financially. Especially since Russia and Belarus are, on paper at least, part of a union state. The two leaders met in Sochi in February and then two months later at the Kremlin But although the two men are political allies, close friends they are not. There have been plenty of squabbles in the past. For years Moscow has been irritated by Mr Lukashenko's attempts to play Russia off against the West. The Kremlin views him as something of a loose cannon. After the Ryanair jet drama and the arrest of two passengers, it's unclear what message the leader of Russia will be sending to the leader of Belarus. The foreign ministry spokeswoman denounced EU leaders for deciding to ""redraw the routes of hundreds of flights in a single day, creating colossal problems for its citizens"". Austria's foreign ministry said Russia's actions against the airline on Thursday had been ""absolutely incomprehensible"". On Friday, the rules were relaxed as Austrian Airlines flight OS601 from Vienna was given permission to land in Moscow,. Among the EU's immediate measures is a ban on Belarusian airlines over the airspace of its 27 member states. Ukraine is also banning Belarus-registered planes from its airspace from Saturday, having halted flights to and from Belarus. Further sanctions are still being assessed on officials in Mr Lukashenko's government and Belarusian economic sectors in particular. The Belarusian opposition leader told reporters in The Hague that a nationwide strike was being planned to protest against the arrests After meeting exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in The Hague, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was time to target sectors ""connected to the regime - and that is crucial because we have to hit these people in the wallet"". Belarus will lose out on millions of dollars a year in over-flight fees as a result of European airlines avoiding its airspace. The EU measures have also hit Belarus carrier Belavia, which has now cancelled 16 European routes. This Belavia flight to Barcelona on Wednesday was kept in a holding pattern as it tried to fly over Poland, before it returned to Minsk The BBC's Sarah Rainsford described lengthy queues outside Belavia offices in Minsk on Thursday as Belarusians scrambled to get ticket refunds. Is plane interception a first? What happens with a military jet interception? What impact could tougher action against Belarus have? In a separate move, the European Broadcasting Union said it was suspending Belarus state TV and radio, blaming suppression of media freedom. The company has two weeks to respond.Belarus was disqualified from this month's Eurovisionsong contest, organised by the EBU, for lyrics seen as targeting anti-government protesters. On Sunday, Ryanair Flight 4978 was travelling from Athens to Vilnius, when it was forcibly diverted to Minsk. A fighter jet was scrambled to ensure it changed course. Belarus authorities said they had received a bomb threat, but according to Swiss secure email provider Proton Mailthe emailed message was sent after the plane was diverted,external. Aboard were Mr Protasevich, 26, who lives in exile in Lithuania, and his girlfriend, Ms Sapega, 23, an international law student. They were arrested as passengers disembarked the plane. Mr Protasevich was put on the Belarus terrorist list last year, and faces serious charges. Who is Roman Protasevich? Who is Sofia Sapega? On Thursday, Mr Protasevich was able to see his lawyer, Inesa Alenskaya, for the first time. ""All is well, he is vigorous, positive and cheerful, there is nothing to worry about,"" she was quoted as saying. This video can not be played Inside Nexta: The journalists taking on Belarusâ regime Russia's foreign ministry says Ms Sapega is accused of breaking Belarusian law in August and September of 2020. Her lawyer said he had promised the court not to give details of the criminal case against her. Videos were released showing the pair confessing to crimes, but it is likely they were speaking under duress. Their arrests and the forced landing of the plane have prompted international outrage. ""We must have measures to ensure that can't happen again,"" the head of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh, told Reuters. The head of Lithuania's criminal police bureau, Rolandas Kiskis, told reporters that the Ryanair crew and 90% of the passengers who had arrived in Vilnius had been questioned about their ordeal. His team were working with other European investigators, he said. Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile.

"The deal follows years of efforts toward reconciliation, including repatriation of remains Germany has officially acknowledged committing genocide during its colonial occupation of Namibia, and announced financial aid worth more than â¬1.1bn (Â£940m; $1.34bn). German colonisers killed tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people there in early 20th Century massacres. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his country was asking Namibia and victims' descendants for forgiveness. But activists say the aid is not enough to address the suffering inflicted. Africa Live: More on this and other stories What's the right price to pay for genocide? Germany returns skulls of Namibian victims The money will apparently be paid out over 30 years through spending on infrastructure, healthcare and training programmes benefiting the impacted communities. ""We will now officially refer to these events as what they are from today's perspective: genocide,"" Mr Maas said, adding that colonial-era actions should be discussed ""without sparing or glossing over"". A spokesman for the Namibian government told AFP news agency Germany's recognition was ""a first step in the right direction"". Friday's statement came after five years of negotiations with Namibia - which was under German occupation from 1884 to 1915. The atrocities committed have been described by historians as ""the forgotten genocide"" of the early 20th Century, in what was then known as German South West Africa. The UN defines genocide as a number of acts, including killing, committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. This video can not be played Skulls of victims were sent back to Germany for eugenics research The genocide began in 1904 after a Herero and Nama rebellion over German seizures of their land and cattle. The head of the military administration there, Lothar von Trotha, called for the extermination of the population in response. How do you define genocide? Namibia: Country profile A search in Germany for lost tribal chief's skull Survivors from the Herero and Nama population were forced into the desert and later placed in concentration camps where they were exploited for labour. Many died of disease, exhaustion and starvation with some subject to sexual exploitation and medical experimentation. It is thought up to 80% of the indigenous populations died during the genocide - with a death toll in the tens of thousands. Captives taken after the Herero rebellion were either killed or subjected to appalling brutality Germany has previously acknowledged the atrocities but ruled out paying reparations. In 2018 theyrepatriated some human remains to Namibia which had been used as part of now-discredited researchattempting to prove the racial superiority of white Europeans. The latest deal was reportedly agreed during a round of negotiations held by special envoys in mid-May. A declaration is expected to be signed by the German foreign minister in the Namibian capital, Windhoek, next month before being ratified by each country's parliament, German media reports say. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is then expected to travel to the country to officially apologise. Laidlaw Peringanda, a Herero activist and chairman of the Namibian Genocide Association, said the offer of development aid was not enough. ""We're actually not accepting that offer because our people have lost lands, they have lost their culture and a lot of them have fled to Botswana, South Africa and some of them were taken to Togo and Cameroon,"" he told BBC World Service. He insisted that Germany should buy back ancestral lands now in the hands of the German-speaking community, which reportedly makes up less than 1% of the population. ""People are getting impatient, especially the minority black people who [don't] have a piece of land,"" he said. ""And from what I'm hearing from some of the people, there will be a land revolution. People will grab the land by force. So we must actually try to avoid these things."" Mr Maas said the negotiations had aimed to find ""a common path to genuine reconciliation in memory of the victims"" with members of the Herero and Nama communities closely involved in talks. Another point of contention is around language. The agreed deal focuses on the idea of reconciliation over formalised compensation, with Mr Maas describing the aid package as a ""gesture"" rather than reparation. Mr Rukuro (pictured) told local media the deal was ""not enough for the blood of our ancestors"" JÃ¼rgen Zimmerer, professor of global history of University of Hamburg, told the BBC World Service a great number of descendants of the victims of the genocide felt excluded. ""This is quite a problem if reconciliation is the aim,"" he said. ""How do you reconcile with the victims if the victims feel left out of the entire process?"" Tim Whewell, writing for the BBC earlier this year about the negotiations, said the discussions were the first of their kind by a former colonial power. He wrote that many Herero and Nama living in overcrowded areas or informal settlements had hoped the deal would go some way to restoring land access and some of the prosperity their ancestors enjoyed before the genocide.

"Boris Johnson's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds reportedly oversaw the flat refurbishment Boris Johnson acted ""unwisely"" by not being more ""rigorous"" in finding out who had funded refurbishment work on the Downing Street flat, a report says. Lord Geidt, the PM's adviser on standards, said a Tory donor had paid an invoice for some of the costs. But he cleared Mr Johnson - who was seemingly unaware of the arrangement - of breaking ministerial conduct rules. The works on the flat, overseen by the PM's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds, are thought to have cost around Â£90,000. The report did not say how much former Conservative vice-chairman Lord Brownlow had put up to fund the refurbishment, but a figure of Â£58,000 has been widely reported.

The Welsh government confirmed performances could begin again but the change did not apply to nightclubs. Venues will need risk assessments in line with hospitality andperforming guidance,external. They will need to limit groups to a maximum of six people from six households, use one-way systems and follow ventilation guidelines. The change brings music performances in line with restaurants and theatres, which were able to open earlier in May. What are the lockdown rules in Wales? What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown around the UK? The announcement applies to music venues, bars, pubs, cafes, restaurants and licensed premises. Further activities, such as events and festivals, will be considered in the next review. Tickets for the Green Man festival sold out in 18 minutes when they went on sale earlier this month, despite organisers making it clear it may not go ahead. ""The demand is definitely there,"" director Fiona Stewart told BBC Radio Wales. She added: ""I have 5,000 people who rely on the festival [for work] who want it to go ahead. ""It will be an amazing moment if Green Man goes ahead in Wales - a fist in the air triumph for when we have had to give things up [over the past 14 months]."" Green Man is due to take place in the Brecon Beacons in August However, Ms Stewart said her ""nervousness"" was that Covid insurance was not available for big events and social distancing rules would not work at a festival. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nichols said venues that could have a seated audience would be able to socially distance people. ""However, for many small venues it will simply be impossible for them to manage this with social distancing in place,"" she added. ""And for our nightclubs, it's just impossible to operate. We do need to see the rest of the roadmap for our Welsh businesses too. ""Until we get that final bit of the jigsaw - the social distancing lifted - to be able to allow these businesses to return to profitability, then we're not at the end of the road yet for the sector."" Katie Hall is looking forward to performing for the first time since early 2020 Katie Hall, the lead singer of Chroma, said she was ""elated"" and it was a ""step in the right direction"" with the band unable to play any gigs since before the pandemic. The south Wales act has festival bookings for October, and she added: ""Everyone needs to be paid, and something like 36% of people in the sector have lost their jobs. ""It's had a massive hit on the music industry as a whole."" Trial events have taken place in Liverpool But Daniel Minty, who produces a Cardiff gig guide said he believed conversations were ""much needed"" over live events. ""The Welsh government has not discussed it over the last 16 months,"" he said. ""The train is leaving the station and that's the most important thing."" Mr Minty said he believed there would be a need for trial events while venues would need to decide if they can break even with gigs, adding: ""It's a difficult process, but a process that is now able to start."" In England, socially distanced gigs have been taking place since 17 May. All areas of mainland Scotland are at level two apart from Glasgow, which is at level three. At level two outdoor and indoor events such as concerts can go ahead with limited capacity. Northern Ireland has no date yet set for when live music can resume there. Cardiff Castle is due to stage a Foals concert this summer A Welsh government spokesman said the suspension of gigs and other live performances had been one of ""the biggest shocks to our sense of well-being and the arts economy"". He added: ""We will continue to support our music and arts sectors in Wales through our cultural recovery, freelancer and economic resilience funds."" Welsh music tourism attracts 440,000 people annually, according to industry group UK Music. It said the industry generates about Â£143m for the Welsh economy and supports more than 1,800 jobs. Welsh rockers Feeder, whose UK top 20 hits include Buck Rogers and Just A Day, are due to play an outdoor homecoming concert at Tredegar Park in Newport on 9 July. One of the first big gigs in Wales this summer is Feeder's open air concert in Newport While renowned live band Foals, winners of the best album award at the 2020 Brits, are scheduled to play one of the open-air concerts at Cardiff Castle this summer. Some of Wales' most popular gig venues - like Venue Cymru in Llandudno and Newport Centre - are still Covid vaccination centres. ""It's been a long road, but I think we're finally getting to the end of it,"" said Sam Dabb, the Wales coordinator for the Music Venue Trust. Tell us when we can reopen, nightclubs say Many music venues 'could never reopen' ""I'm really, really happy. ""The gigs are subject to risk assessments and the guidance, and we have to wait for the guidance to come out from Welsh government and then the Music Venue Trust are going to help their members build the risk assessments, to make sure we do everything safely and properly. Sam Dabb of the Music Venue Trust says the best route back is ""safely and slowly"" ""I think the best route back is to do it safely and slowly,"" added Ms Dabb, manager of Newport gig venue Le Pub. ""Whatever the scientific advisers are saying we should do, we're going to make sure our members are doing,"" she said.

"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by Usman Khan at the conference on offender rehabilitation The UK's top intelligence agency did not consider a convicted terrorist a risk, an inquest court has heard. Usman Khan was jailed for a terror offence in 2012 before being released on licence six years later. He went on to kill Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt in a knife attack at London's Fishmongers' Hall. MI5 told the hearing it had been considering whether to close an ongoing investigation into Khan. A courtroom sketch of the MI5 officer Witness A giving evidence behind a screen A deputy director of MI5, known as Witness A, was giving evidence at the inquests in London's Guildhall from within a closed pod, meaning that no-one in court could see her. The court heard that Khan spent more than four years under active MI5 investigation while he was in prison and that the security service had re-opened the case in the months before his release. Witness A said MI5's prison intelligence on Khan was shared with counter terror police and that in November 2018, MI5 received intelligence that Khan might return to his ""old ways"" and re-engage in terrorist-related activity including ""carrying out an attack"". But the inquests were told that a document before the multi-agency panel responsible for managing Khan after release, only referred to the ""old ways"" intelligence, which it stated was ""low grade"" - and not the material about planning an attack. When asked in court whether she was aware the information had not been passed on, Witness A said: ""We did not know that"". MI5 continued its investigation into Khan, however, and upped its level of priority due to the prison intelligence, the inquests heard. After Khan's release from prison, it carried out two assessments to ascertain whether he might become a lone attacker, but both failed to assess him as posing such a risk, the inquests were told. Khan, from Stafford in the West Midlands, had armed himself with knives and a fake suicide belt for the attack The inquests heard that MI5 and the police held a joint meeting about Khan on 18 November 2019. Witness A said at that point the MI5 investigation into Khan was ""heading towards closure"" as it had not detected any conduct of national security concern. Eleven days after that meeting, Khan killed Ms Jones and Mr Merritt and injured three others during a conference on offender rehabilitation, which Khan had been allowed to attend unaccompanied. He had been invited to attend the Fishmongers' Hall event as he was perceived a ""success story"" of the Learning Together programmes he enrolled in while in custody. The deputy director told the court that MI5 had ""no intelligence of concern"" at the time that could have fed in to a decision on whether Khan could attend the event. She told the jury: ""We had not seen anything to suggest it was a potential source of risk"". Police 'daunted' by taking on terror offenders Fishmongers' Hall victim reluctant to go to event Killer seen as education project 'success story' The inquestspreviously heard from Khan's probation officer Ken Skeltonwho authorised his attendance at the conference. Mr Skelton told the inquests that he was unaware MI5 had been investigating Khan and that if he had known of MI5's concerns ""the whole management process would have altered"". Psychologist Ieva Cechaviciute,previously told the inqueststhat she had assessed Khan's risk of engaging in extremist activity would increase upon his release in December 2018. The inquests continue.

"Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25, were killed by Usman Khan during a conference on rehabilitating offenders Three simple facts became crystal clear over the course of the inquests into the Fishmongers' Hall terrorism attack, in which Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones died at the hand of Usman Khan. Firstly, Khan, had entered and left prison as one of the most dangerous terrorism offenders of his generation. Secondly, while counter-terrorism experts and investigators fully understood the threat he posed, some of the people directly interacting with Khan did not know all of those fears. And thirdly, by the time Khan had decided to kill, nobody knew whether he was plotting or not - and so his trip went ahead without anyone being sure what risk he posed when he was allowed to travel to London alone. Graduates were unlawfully killed by terrorist Information that terrorist might attack not shared Police should have raised risk posed by terrorist Khan posed 'high risk' after jail release Fishmongers' Hall, beside London Bridge, was the venue for the event Usman Khan came to London on 29 November 2019 to take part in a special event organised by Learning Together, a Cambridge University programme in which its graduates help offenders with their rehabilitation. The scheme began at Grendon Prison, a specialist jail in Buckinghamshire that puts inmates through intensive psychological and behavioural therapy. Khan joined when the scheme was later introduced at the maximum security Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire. Prior to that, Learning Together had no experience of working with terrorism offenders - who typically think and behave completely differently to other violent criminals. In time, Khan came to be regarded as a success story - and Learning Together's chiefs invited him to the London reunion. From when he was a teenager, Khan, from Stoke, had been part of Al-Muhajiroun (ALM), the terror recruitment network linked to almost all major plots. From around 2008, he was under police and MI5 investigation into the intentions of a cell of men from London, Cardiff and Stoke. All of them were arrested in 2010 and later convicted and jailed. Some of the group had an amateurish plan to bomb the London Stock Exchange. Khan was more dangerous still. He wanted to create a terror training camp in Pakistan - and his original jail sentence reflected the fact that the judge could not be sure whether he would ever be safe to be released. That sentence was later changed, following an appeal, to a fixed term. This meant that he would be out of jail on a special licence by the end of 2018. Khan was a top-tier high-risk offender - one of only 70 prisoners in England and Wales to have this status Right up until he was released on Christmas Eve 2018, Khan had been regarded in prison as a serious threat. He remained at all times a top-tier high-risk offender because of his behaviour and lack of progress towards rehabilitation - one of only 70 prisoners to have this status in England and Wales. And so most of his adult life was spent alongside some of the UK's most dangerous men, including ringleaders of previous plots whom he sought out and admired. Security chiefs recorded that he bullied, attacked and tried to radicalise other inmates. On one occasion, he entered a prohibited area of his wing and recited a poem about decapitating unbelievers. And as his release date approached, two pieces of information fell into the hands of prison authorities and MI5. The intelligence suggested Khan would return to his ""old ways"" and, secondly, that he wanted to carry out an attack. Killer called education project a 'kind of family' Prison chaplain 'conned' by 'remorseful' terrorist Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you up' Prison psychologists in the UK use tools and programmes to try to challenge the mindset of terrorism prisoners. Khan went through the main prison scheme - but there were no clear signs that it had changed him. Eight months before his release, an expert brought in to analyse Khan's thinking concluded that the risk that he would return to terrorism could increase after he left jail. Dr Ieva Cechaviciute warned that Khan sought ""status"" and did not accept he had done anything wrong. She told the inquests she had been very worried about how he could be safely managed. When Khan was released to live in a monitored bail hostel, he did not know that he was already under MI5 investigation. It had launched a new probe into his intentions, given the intelligence concerns. But in the absence of clear information that he was actively taking steps to carry out an attack, the probe never became one of the security service's highest priorities. Khan's new life was overseen by police and probation officers under the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) system. This is the body that meets to discuss whether serious offenders are sticking to their release licence or presenting danger that would trigger their return to jail. Mappa held three meetings before Khan was released - and Staffordshire Police officers with no counter-terrorism expertise were put in charge of the day-to-day meetings once he was out. Khan was also assigned a senior probation officer overseeing the management of his probation - an officer who, in time, would be expected to draw up deeper reports into his behaviour and prospects. Both the probation and police teams knew of Khan's very troubling prison record - but did not know about the continuing secret MI5 investigation, or its continuing concerns. Over the year he was out, Khan failed to find work. He asked for permission to train to operate dumper trucks - but the panel blocked this after police advised that the vehicles could be used as weapons. He began isolating himself - spending more and more time playing computer games alone. He got angry when the police officers looking after him took photographs of the violent games he had bought - and he lied to them and others about his previous offending. Unescorted and carrying weapons: Khan on the train to London So, two months before the attack, the situation was simple: there was no intelligence that Khan was plotting an attack - but neither was there any reassurance that he had changed for the better. The one aspect of his life that seemed to make a difference was his continuing interest in working with the Learning Together programme. So when the programme's directors at Cambridge asked Khan to come to London for the major reunion, he jumped at the chance. Khan passing through London Underground He asked his probation officer for permission to go, and the Mappa panel said he could leave his home in Staffordshire - but without knowing the full facts of the unresolved risk he may have posed. And so he travelled to London unescorted and was not met by police when he arrived. He was never searched. Had he been, his weapons would have been found. There was a ""secure corridor"" between MI5 and the police and probation officers who dealt directly with Khan. That corridor exists to make sure that a suspect does not accidentally learn anything about what the security service is doing. But it also allows the spies to provide critical information in a way that does not reveal their secret techniques. The inquests heard that MI5 told the counter-terrorism detectives in West Midlands Police that there were unresolved fears that Khan would return to his ""old ways"" and that he might plan an attack. Those detectives shared it in turn with Staffordshire Police's Special Branch, the team actively assisting the Mappa panel. But that second piece of information - the possibility of an attack  - never reached any Mappa document or officer. The reason why remains a mystery. The most junior officer in Special Branch did not believe they had the power to pass it on to Mappa without express permission. It seems that no officer higher up the police chain realised the information had not been shared. Critically, despite MI5 secretly having officers in some Mappa meetings, nobody from the service flagged to their police colleagues that the intelligence had not yet been shared with that panel. MI5's witness told the inquests they had shared everything they had - but it was not clear from the evidence whether the security service's officers even realised the important, albeit unvalidated, intelligence had not got through to the panel.

"Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25, were killed by Usman Khan at a conference on offender rehabilitation Failings by the police, probation service and MI5 contributed to the deaths of two graduates killed by a convicted terrorist, a jury has found.

"This video can not be played Post Office scandal: ""I'm a little person in a little village"" A former Post Office worker says her life was ruined and her health suffered after she was falsely accused of stealing. Lorraine Williams said she kept quiet for 10 years as people in her community on Anglesey turned their backs on her. She suffered with depression and lost her home and her job, and said the only way she kept going was by hiding away. Judgesquashed the convictions of former postmastersafter the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. After the Court of Appeal case in London last month, Mrs Williams now feels strong enough to tell her story for the first time, and wants the world to know she is innocent. ""Since the appeal I've had about three people come to the door to say congratulations and I think I need to tell everyone I'm not guilty,"" she said. ""It's been a very, very difficult 10 years."" Lorraine Williams with others who had been accused in front of the Court of Appeal Mrs Williams lives in the village of Llanddaniel Fab and for years had been a central part of the community. She fostered children, worked with after-school and youth clubs and was a warden on an estate for the elderly, living on the site with her husband Gareth and daughter Cameron. When the future of the village shop and post office were under threat, she was a member of the committee which raised money to buy the building and she donated to the appeal fund. Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Post Office used suspect evidence in prosecutions 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Then, in 2009, facing more uncertainty about the service, she agreed to work as a sub-postmistress alongside her work as a warden. ""The shop was closing and the post office was closing and a lot of people in the village were asking 'why don't you take over? You could do it',"" Mrs Williams told BBC Cymru Fyw. ""I was a warden at the time for elderly people in the village, so we decided to take over - to help the village more than anything else."" Lorraine Williams in the shop at Christmas time with her husband and daughter Mrs Williams' nightmare began over Christmas in 2010. She said electrical problems affected the Post Office's computer system - Horizon - and she contacted the support line. Within weeks the computer showed money and stock was missing, and the situation became worse and worse, but Mrs Williams had no idea what was happening. ""You think 'I'm in trouble here and I can't fix it'. I didn't even tell my husband for about three months, I was panicking so much. It was a strain. ""I couldn't sleep at all. I eventually slept in my daughter's room because I didn't want to disturb my husband so I just pretended my daughter wanted company."" In June 2011, Post Office lawyers arrived to tell Mrs Williams Â£14,600 was missing. ""They were asking me 'where is it?',"" she said. ""I told them I didn't know, I didn't have it and I hadn't taken it. They locked me out of the post office that day, took the keys away from me and suspended me. It was a massive shock."" The shop and post office now The Post Office insisted Mrs Williams was the only one having problems with the computer system and she was accused of theft. But it is now known she was not the only one, by a long shot. And someone else who had similar problems lived just two miles down the road. Former councillor Noel Thomas was wrongly jailed in 2006 for keeping false accounts after the Horizon system showed Â£48,000 was missing from his post office in Gaerwen. From the beginning, he had said the computer was at fault - as others across the UK had also said. This video can not be played In 2006, Noel Thomas was wrongly jailed for nine months for false accounting But in a case at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012, on legal advice, Mrs Williams pleaded guilty to keeping false accounts in order to avoid going to jail, fearing the effect that would have on her young daughter. ""We told her before the court case what was happening and that maybe mam wouldn't be coming home, and that I hadn't done it, 'but someone will look after you, please don't worry, you will be with your dad',"" she recalled. ""She was 10 years old. This has gone on for half of her life - she is now 20."" Lorraine Williams and her daughter Cameron before the court case Mrs Williams was handed a 52-week suspended sentence, on the condition she would ""pay back"" the Â£14,600 and perform 200 hours of community service. She lost her income - the shop, the post office and her job with the elderly - and she had to leave her home of 10 years due to it being tied to the warden job. She moved to a house she and her husband owned in the village, and took out a second mortgage to pay the compensation to the Post Office. ""I don't remember moving,"" Mrs Williams said. ""The only thing I remember is carrying a table in the middle of the night because we didn't have money to get a van or anything. ""We carried stuff in the middle of the night or early in the morning to hide the fact we were moving, not because we were ashamed of going but because we were ashamed we couldn't afford to pay anyone to help us."" Mrs Williams said the effect on her mental health was the worst part, and while family, some friends and community members supported her, others turned their backs and ignored her or were rude to her in front of her child. ""When my daughter was in school I didn't leave the house, I just took her to school and stayed in the house. It was depression, and fear... fear of how people would act towards me,"" she said. ""Nobody wanted to hear my side, I couldn't tell people what had happened, they had decided and that was that."" But Mrs Williams heard a knock on the door one day, and it was Noel Thomas. ""He had heard I was stuck in the house and said 'come out with your head up, you have nothing to be ashamed of, let's fight this together'."" Every fortnight she had to meet with the probation service to discuss her fraud, and she was struggling with not being able to tell the truth - having been warned by her solicitor not to say she was innocent or she could end up in jail. ""They were trying to teach me how to manage money and budget, it was awful. One woman said 'you won't be able to work in charity shops, not after what you've done',"" she said. ""I wanted to kill myself. I remember going to see a lawyer and him saying 'you'll go through a dark time but you'll come out of it'."" Mrs Williams said thinking of her daughter got her through. ""This sounds selfish but I thought 'my husband would cope but she won't'."" Lorraine Williams and her daughter now Mrs Williams also developed diabetes and alopecia in 2013 because of the shock, but gradually she gained the confidence to fight back. She started volunteering and found work, and joined a group of other sub-postmasters, including Mr Thomas, who had been through the same thing. ""There was a time when I thought 'I'm taking on the crown, I've got no hope,"" she said. ""But Noel said 'no, carry on',"" and in 2019, the Post Office admitted there had been errors in its computer system in the past and apologised. Mrs Williams had to wait more than a year again to clear her name, but last month she was successful. More appeals are expected in the future, and questions will need to be answered over how so much money was lost. The computer company, Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon system, said it takes the judgment very seriously and will thoroughly investigate the matter. Mrs Williams has received an apology from the Post Office Mrs Williams received an apology this week from the chairman of the Post Office, Tim Parker, saying it accepted the Court of Appeal's decision and that she had not had a fair hearing. He promised the Post Office would learn from its mistakes. ""Someone has to be accountable for this, someone knew,"" Mrs Williams said. ""Someone has to take the blame and be punished. I wouldn't want to go so far as calling for someone to go to jail, although they deserve it, because I am sick of thinking about jail. ""But they can't get away with this. ""I shouldn't cry, but sometimes I can't stop. It still affects me and I just think about my family and how they've suffered and how they've supported me. ""I know I'm supposed to be happy now but things are still in the back of my mind. I'm not so happy go lucky as I was before. I'm not the same person."" Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Why were hundreds of Post Office workers wrongly prosecuted?

"Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25, were killed by Usman Khan at a conference on offender rehabilitation Failings by the police, probation service and MI5 contributed to the deaths of two graduates killed by a convicted terrorist, a jury has found. University of Cambridge alumni Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were stabbed by Usman Khan at a rehabilitation event at Fishmongers' Hall on 29 November 2019. Khan, 28, had been released from prison 11 months previously, the inquests at London's Guildhall heard. The jury concluded that both victims were unlawfully killed. Khan, who had spent eight years in jail for planning to set up a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, was chased on to London Bridge by people at the event who were armed with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk plucked from a wall. The terrorist, who wounded three others in the attack, was shot dead on the bridge by police. Could Fishmongers' Hall attacker have been stopped? 'They clearly touched the lives of so many' Jurors found there had been unacceptable management and a lack of accountability in the oversight of Khan, who had been allowed to travel on his own to London from his hometown of Stafford. They concluded there had been failures in the sharing of information between state agencies responsible for monitoring him. Deficiencies in the organisation of the event at Fishmongers' Hall, including inadequate security measures, were also found to have been a factor in the deaths. One man pursued Khan on to London Bridge armed with a narwhal tusk he had removed from a wall at Fishmongers' Hall After the conclusions were delivered, the jury forewoman said the jurors wanted to send ""heartfelt condolences to the families of Saskia and Jack"" who ""clearly touched the lives of so many, ours included"". ""We are so incredibly sorry. The world lost two bright stars that dreadful day,"" she said. The forewoman added the jury wanted to ""thank the astonishing individuals who put themselves in real danger to help and our incredible emergency services for their response, both that day and every day"". This video can not be played Jack Merritt was killed by Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist still considered dangerous by MI5 At the conclusion of the inquests, Ms Jones's family, from Stratford-upon-Avon, said there were still ""unanswered questions relating to failures of a number of organisations and individuals"". ""It is beyond understanding and astonishing that not one of the state agencies sufficiently considered the associated risk and therefore questioned the wisdom of sending Usman Khan unaccompanied to London,"" the family said in a statement. The Guildhall heard Khan had been wearing a fake suicide vest They also criticised Learning Together, which ran the prisoner rehabilitation programme, and the Fishmongers' Company over failures to keep those at the event safe. Mr Merritt's father David, from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, said it was ""clear... that the arrangements put in place for managing Usman Khan after his release from prison in 2019 were not fit for purpose, despite the authorities having had six years to plan for this"". ""We hope that all other agencies and organisations involved with Khan will learn the lessons highlighted by the inquest and will make changes to their systems and working practices,"" he added. Fishmongers' Hall, beside London Bridge, was the venue for the event where Khan struck By Dominic Casciani, home and legal correspondent These verdicts are so clear and damning that they have far wider implications than this terrible tragedy. They raise questions about the competence and ability of state agencies to properly manage the risk of men as dangerous as Usman Khan. If they wanted to, the families could now try to sue the agencies involved for a finding they breached their duty to take reasonable steps to protect life. The mistakes and omissions were clear to the jury - from the inexperience of the officers managing Khan in the community, through to a dreadful muddle over who should have passed them critical MI5 intelligence. All of it, in the jury's view, was ""unacceptable"". There are questions too for Cambridge University, where the chiefs of a rehabilitation scheme believed Khan was such a success he could come to their reunion in London, despite the city being such an obvious target for a convicted, deviant and unrepentant terrorist. Read more from Dominichere. A Court of Appeal ruling meant Khan had to be automatically released on licence from prison, with the Parole Board having no say as to whether he was safe to be freed. Throughout his time in jail, he was classed among the 70 highest-risk inmates in the country, was frequently involved in violence and radicalisation and spent a significant period under investigation by MI5. Upon his release, Khan was assessed as being more dangerous than when he went into prison, and there was seen to be an imminent risk of him causing serious harm to the public. While he was still an inmate, the security services launched a new covert investigation, which became a priority inquiry after intelligence was received that Khan would carry out an attack once he was freed. But the intelligence was never shared with Khan's probation officer nor the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel that managed him in the community. MAPPA did not even know that Khan was being investigated by MI5 - one of whose officers often secretly attended the panel's meetings. This video can not be played Saskia Jones' uncle says the conclusion of  the inquest ""does not in any way ease the pain"" While in HMP Whitemoor, Khan was allowed to attend a prisoner education project run by Cambridge University called Learning Together. After his release, he remained in touch with Learning Together staff, even appearing as a case study of successful change in a project video and publication. He was consequently invited to the anniversary celebration at Fishmongers' Hall.

She added that the new DUP leadership had shown its ""direction of travel"" and it was time for her to ""move on"".

Arlene Foster told the BBC that the move to remove her had been ""pretty brutal"" Speaking of his relationship with the Irish government, Mr Poots said it was ""really, really bad"" as a consequence of how issues were dealt with relating to the Irish border during the Brexit talks. He accused it of attempting to ""starve Northern Ireland people of medicines no less, cancer drugs and other materials, such as the food that's on our table"" and took particular aim at Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, the Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) and foreign affairs minister. The new DUP leader said it was ""quite frankly disgraceful"" that the pair ""took photographs of blown up border posts to impose upon Northern Ireland people the harshest form of customs and an internal market that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world"". However, Mr Poots said he had ""respect"" for Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Also speaking outside the meeting, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said ""leadership transfer hurts"".

"The Royal College of Surgeons says there should be around 40 centres based in existing NHS buildings to carry out non-urgent surgery. Surgeons are calling for specialist hubs in England to help tackle what they call a ""colossal backlog"" of non-urgent operations because of Covid-19. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) wants a network of hospital sites focused on routine surgery, such as hip and knee replacements. The government says it is working ""to accelerate the recovery of services"". In March, around five million patients were waiting for surgery - the highest number since modern records began. More than 436,000 were waiting more than a year, NHS England figures show - compared with just 1,600 before the Covid crisis. A similar proportion of the population is on waiting lists in Scotland and a higher percentage in Wales and Northern Ireland. The NHS Covid legacy - long waits and lives at risk 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' Life on a hospital list 'makes you feel forgotten' Prof Neil Mortensen, president of the RCS, said the pandemic has had a devastating impact on surgical services  - and that it must not be allowed to happen again. ""Surgery must be available on the NHS all year round, not stop and start,"" he said, adding that a ""New Deal for Surgery"" was required to help weather future pandemics. ""If a dangerous new variant of COVID-19 takes hold, or another bad flu arrives in the autumn, we cannot allow surgery to grind to a halt again or waiting lists will become insurmountable."" Prof Mortensen said patients and staff had already adapted to changes required because of the pandemic, such as flexible working and outpatient consultations by phone or video link. He added that politicians needed to be open to change and accept that services available at their nearest hospital might not be the same as before. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The RCS says there should be around 40 centres based in existing NHS buildings to carry out non-urgent surgery. The idea is to reduce the risk of infections spreading from other parts of hospitals. It is hoped that by bringing specialist teams together under one roof, there would be greater efficiency and better use of operating theatres. Patients might need to travel further from their local hospitals, but the RCS says its own polling suggests most would support the idea if it reduced waiting times. It wants to see an extra Â£1bn a year of government funding and a longer-term commitment to train more staff. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We have backed the NHS at every point in the pandemic, safeguarding urgent treatment such as cancer and emergency care, while protecting the NHS to ensure it was not overwhelmed."" He said the government was providing ""an extra Â£7bn for health and care services"" this year, and Â£1bn to tackle backlogs. ""We face an unprecedented challenge and will continue to work closely with the NHS to accelerate the recovery of services so everyone gets the care they need, including Â£160m to support hospitals to find innovative ways to carry out even more operations and cut waiting lists,"" he added. It comes amid growing concern about the Covid-19 variant first identified in India. Public Health England data shows cases of the variant have risen by 3,535 to 6,959 since last week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidup to three quarters of new UK Covid cases could be of the Indian variant, and that it was ""critical"" to monitor the link between cases and hospitalisations. The prime minister said it was important to understandthe extent to which the vaccine programme ""interrupts the link"" between infection, hospitalisation, serious illness and death.

"British exports worth billions of pounds have faced tariffs on trade with the EU since Brexit, according to an analysis of official EU statistics. Despite the tariff-free deal agreed with the EU, a study by the University of Sussex found up to Â£3.5bn of British exports had taxes applied. That accounts for about 10% of British goods exports to the EU. Some firms paid due to the complexity of claiming zero tariffs, or said they planned to reclaim the fees later. For exporters, maintaining zero tariffs under the post-Brexit deal is not automatic: it needs to be claimed on customs declarations that from January have had to accompany every export to the European Union. An analysis for the BBC, by the University of Sussex's Trade Policy Observatory, used European customs data from these declarations. The figures indicated that between Â£2.5bn and Â£3.5bn of British exports faced a tariff in the first three months of 2021. Post-Brexit trade: Three firms, three problems Cheese maker upset at Â£180 post-Brexit Stilton fee The European Commission confirmed that according to data collected by its customs authorities, â¬2.5bn of eligible UK exports did not use the zero-tariff agreement. ""Tariff-free trade is only tariff-free if firms not only meet the rules of origin criteria, but also can deal with the necessary bureaucracy and paperwork,"" said Prof Michael Gasiorek, trade expert at the University of Sussex. ""What this analysis shows is that in the first quarter, around 27% of trade that could have entered tariff-free did not do so. ""In some sectors and for some firms, this will no doubt improve, but it reflects the reality that leaving the EU has imposed real costs on firms, with long-term implications for trade and production."" The data covers all British exports to the EU in January and February, and some reporting nations in March. Individual businesses and groups told the BBC of instances where millions of pounds in tariffs had been paid. Most put this down to complex arrangements for claiming zero tariffs, difficulties over the re-export to the EU of goods processed in Britain, and an expectation that some of these fees could eventually be recovered. Some of the world's biggest multinationals have paid seven-figure tariff bills. A classic car repairer, The Classic Car Mechanic, showed tariff bills of hundreds of pounds for car parts for rare vehicles sent to Hungary, which could not be valued, and so were hit with a tariff by French customs. ""We've had to pay a tariff, even though we've got a zero tariff,"" said the boss of the business, Simon Spurrell. ""It's the same with all the other shipments, all UK origin parts, but they dispute it and they hold it up. ""We feel that we have no fight left in us, we have to then, as a small organisation just say, well, we'll cut our losses, and just pay the duty."" The Trade Policy Observatory has tried to quantify the effect of extra trade barriers with the EU on different sectors. Although exports began to recover from a massive drop in January, over the quarter, the Observatory calculated that, of the worst affected sectors, textiles saw exports fall 63%, food suffered a 36% drop, and the automotive industry saw exports down 20%. Other advanced manufacturing industries have not been affected, according to the analysis, which seeks to isolate the impact of post-Brexit barriers from the impact of the pandemic. A government spokesperson said: ""The vast majority of traders have adjusted well to our new trading relationship with the EU. ""HMRC continues to work closely with exporters to ensure they correctly apply rules of origin requirements and are aware of their right to refunds. ""The unprecedented zero-tariff zero-quota deal we secured with the EU allows businesses to trade smoothly, while we can now regulate in a way that suits the UK economy and our businesses - doing things in a more innovative and effective way, without being bound by EU rules."" The analysis also showed that in the early months of the deal, there were some marked differences between EU nations in the extent of use of the free-trade deal for imports of British goods. Data for what is known as ""preference utilisation"" of British exports to Germany shows rates well below half in January and February at 42% and 44% respectively. The trade deal has been used more, according to the data, for exports to France, reaching 77% in March. Preference utilisation rates (PURs) measure the extent to which tariff preferences provided by a particular trade agreement are being used by imports and exports of either side. European Commission sources stressed that overall use of the deal was in line with the first months of other free-trade deals and that it would take some time to assess the impact. UK government ministers told Parliament last month that they would be releasing their equivalent data for EU exports into Great Britain shortly.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Glasgow will continue to be the only part of Scotland under level three restrictions for at least another week. There had been speculation that the city would be able to join the rest of the Scottish mainland in level two. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was still concern about an outbreak of the Indian variant of the virus in the city. She said the variant was now accounting for at least half of the new Covid cases in Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped the city would be able to move to level two on Saturday of next week - with a final decision being taken on Tuesday. And she said there were signs that the situation in Glasgow was beginning to stabilise, with the number of new cases falling in recent days in the postcode areas in the southside of the city which had been at the centre of the outbreak of the Indian variant. The city that has been locked down for nine months What level is your area in? What Covid rules are changing, and when? The level three restrictions mean people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors. Many Glasgow business owners say they are struggling to survive after spending 270 days under tough restrictions, and have criticised the Scottish government for not giving them more financial support. And opposition parties had demanded urgent action to get the city back on a level footing with the rest of the country - where restrictions have eased in recent weeks - as quickly as possible. The rest of mainland Scotland is currently due to join most of the country's island communities in level one on 7 June, before the country moves to level zero - meaning something close to normality - on 28 June. Mobile testing and vaccination centres have been set up in many parts of Glasgow over the past few weeks. And there has been no significant increase in the number of people being hospitalised with the virus - which public health experts say suggests that it is mainly younger, unvaccinated people who are contracting it. However, case numbers have risen by about 30% - from 112 cases per 100,000 to about 136 per 100,000 - over the past week, while the rate of positive tests  has also crept up from about 4% to 4.4%. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus spreads - for Scotland is now estimated to stand at about 1.3, largely driven by the number of cases in Glasgow. Latest figures released shortly after the briefing revealed the Glasgow weekly case rate had dropped to 135.5 per 100,000 people, the first fall in almost a month. Meanwhile, drop-in vaccination centres for people aged 40 and over are being opened across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board. The centres have aset number of appointments,externalon a first-come, first-served basis and will be operational from Saturday. As well as in Glasgow, drop-in vaccinations will also be offered in Paisley, Bearsden, Alexandria, Renfrew, Johnstone, Greenock, Dumbarton, Eastwood, Kirkintilloch, Clydebank and Port Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said the decision to keep Scotland's largest city in level three for a further week had been ""very difficult"". But she said the number of new cases continued to be ""uncomfortably high"" despite the signs of progress. The first minister added: ""The view of the National Incident Management Team is that it would be premature to move Glasgow out of level three immediately, while the situation remains so fragile."" However, if the situation continues to stabilise, Ms Sturgeon said the management team would support a move to level two at the end of next week. Figures released on Friday revealed the first fall in Glasgow's case rate in almost a month Responding to the announcement, the Federation of Small Business said its members in Glasgow had become ""used to these weekly Friday disappointments"" - with this one ""even more galling"" because of the sunny weather that is forecast for the Bank Holiday on Monday. Its chairman, Andrew McRae, said: ""The businesses and employees hardest hit by these ongoing restrictions need proper support now. ""The Glasgow hospitality industry was given two days to scrap their re-opening plans (earlier this month)  -  but even now, after two weeks, we still don't have adequate financial support measures in place."" The Scottish government says further funding has been made available to Glasgow City Council to provide additional support for businesses in hospitality and leisure in Glasgow, with grants ranging from Â£250 to Â£750 per week. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Glasgow has now been under Covid restrictions for 270 days and people were looking to the first minister to give them some hope. ""Instead, we saw Nicola Sturgeon keep the whole city under tougher restrictions for another week, despite outbreaks being largely confined to one area."" He said the government must immediately ramp up the vaccination rollout and testing capacity in the virus hotspots, rather than ""continuing to treat the city as one entity"". Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the government had to be able to tackle future local outbreaks without ""draconian lockdown measures"" being put in place. The first minister will also give an update next Tuesday on whether, and to what extent, the proposed move to level one for mainland council areas will proceed as planned. She said: ""If we see a significant reduction in the health harms of Covid, even as case numbers rise, then hopefully that will allow us to change our approach. ""Because we will be able to rely then on other public health measures, rather than blanket restrictions, to keep the outbreaks under control."" The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased from 68 three weeks ago to 90 today - but there were more than 2,000 people in hospital at the peak of the second wave in January, and the number of Covid patients in intensive care is currently very low. The first minister said she had considered whether additional restrictions needed to be introduced in three other council areas - Clackmannanshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - where there are relatively high levels of the virus. But all three areas have relatively low populations and the number of cases is low in absolute terms - with public health teams confident that the outbreaks are able to be controlled using existing measures. There have been 641 new positive cases of the virus recorded across Scotland in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 25 March. The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for the virus have also been recorded, while the number of people in hospital has risen to 90 - with six patients in intensive care.

Arlene Foster told the BBC that the move to remove her had been ""pretty brutal"" Speaking of his relationship with the Irish government, Mr Poots said it was ""really, really bad"" as a consequence of how issues were dealt with relating to the Irish border during the Brexit talks. He accused it of attempting to ""starve Northern Ireland people of medicines no less, cancer drugs and other materials, such as the food that's on our table"" and took particular aim at Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, the Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) and foreign affairs minister. The new DUP leader said it was ""quite frankly disgraceful"" that the pair ""took photographs of blown up border posts to impose upon Northern Ireland people the harshest form of customs and an internal market that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world"". However, Mr Poots said he had ""respect"" for Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Also speaking outside the meeting, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said ""leadership transfer hurts"". ""If anyone in this party can talk about difficulty, it's me. I saw what happened to my dad, it killed my father,"" he told BBC's The View. Mr Paisley's late father, Ian, the party founder, had accused his successor, Peter Robinson, and Nigel Doddsof giving him an ultimatum to leave his post. In a statement, theFermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP,externalsaid the removal of Mrs Foster was ""not done in our name"" and it would support her if she remained as an MLA. It said its members ""met this week to voice their disgust at the manner"" in which Mrs Foster had ""been treated over recent weeks"". After Mr Poots was ratified, Paul Bell, former chairman of the association and member for 20 years, resigned from the party. He said it will shed tens of thousands of votes under Edwin Poots and he was ""disgusted"" by the treatment of Mrs Foster. This video can not be played Paul Bell said he was leaving the party over its treatment of Arlene Foster Mr Bell told the BBC's The View programme on Thursday night that Mrs Foster had been ""stabbed in the back"". ""If the DUP cannot have respect for their own people, I don't know how they're going to have respect for people who don't agree with them,"" he said. Red Lines: Is the political landscape in for a shake-up? The party that went from firebrands to government Doug Beattie: Who is the new leader of the UUP? In an interview with BBC Newscast earlier on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the move against her and the manner in which it was carried out was ""not particularly pleasant"". ""I think that I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards it was pretty brutal, in terms of what happened,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Glasgow will continue to be the only part of Scotland under level three restrictions for at least another week. There had been speculation that the city would be able to join the rest of the Scottish mainland in level two. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was still concern about an outbreak of the Indian variant of the virus in the city. She said the variant was now accounting for at least half of the new Covid cases in Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped the city would be able to move to level two on Saturday of next week - with a final decision being taken on Tuesday. And she said there were signs that the situation in Glasgow was beginning to stabilise, with the number of new cases falling in recent days in the postcode areas in the southside of the city which had been at the centre of the outbreak of the Indian variant. The city that has been locked down for nine months What level is your area in? What Covid rules are changing, and when? The level three restrictions mean people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors. Many Glasgow business owners say they are struggling to survive after spending 270 days under tough restrictions, and have criticised the Scottish government for not giving them more financial support. And opposition parties had demanded urgent action to get the city back on a level footing with the rest of the country - where restrictions have eased in recent weeks - as quickly as possible. The rest of mainland Scotland is currently due to join most of the country's island communities in level one on 7 June, before the country moves to level zero - meaning something close to normality - on 28 June. Mobile testing and vaccination centres have been set up in many parts of Glasgow over the past few weeks. And there has been no significant increase in the number of people being hospitalised with the virus - which public health experts say suggests that it is mainly younger, unvaccinated people who are contracting it. However, case numbers have risen by about 30% - from 112 cases per 100,000 to about 136 per 100,000 - over the past week, while the rate of positive tests  has also crept up from about 4% to 4.4%. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus spreads - for Scotland is now estimated to stand at about 1.3, largely driven by the number of cases in Glasgow. Latest figures released shortly after the briefing revealed the Glasgow weekly case rate had dropped to 135.5 per 100,000 people, the first fall in almost a month. Meanwhile, drop-in vaccination centres for people aged 40 and over are being opened across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board. The centres have aset number of appointments,externalon a first-come, first-served basis and will be operational from Saturday. As well as in Glasgow, drop-in vaccinations will also be offered in Paisley, Bearsden, Alexandria, Renfrew, Johnstone, Greenock, Dumbarton, Eastwood, Kirkintilloch, Clydebank and Port Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said the decision to keep Scotland's largest city in level three for a further week had been ""very difficult"". But she said the number of new cases continued to be ""uncomfortably high"" despite the signs of progress. The first minister added: ""The view of the National Incident Management Team is that it would be premature to move Glasgow out of level three immediately, while the situation remains so fragile."" However, if the situation continues to stabilise, Ms Sturgeon said the management team would support a move to level two at the end of next week. Figures released on Friday revealed the first fall in Glasgow's case rate in almost a month Responding to the announcement, the Federation of Small Business said its members in Glasgow had become ""used to these weekly Friday disappointments"" - with this one ""even more galling"" because of the sunny weather that is forecast for the Bank Holiday on Monday. Its chairman, Andrew McRae, said: ""The businesses and employees hardest hit by these ongoing restrictions need proper support now. ""The Glasgow hospitality industry was given two days to scrap their re-opening plans (earlier this month)  -  but even now, after two weeks, we still don't have adequate financial support measures in place."" The Scottish government says further funding has been made available to Glasgow City Council to provide additional support for businesses in hospitality and leisure in Glasgow, with grants ranging from Â£250 to Â£750 per week. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Glasgow has now been under Covid restrictions for 270 days and people were looking to the first minister to give them some hope. ""Instead, we saw Nicola Sturgeon keep the whole city under tougher restrictions for another week, despite outbreaks being largely confined to one area."" He said the government must immediately ramp up the vaccination rollout and testing capacity in the virus hotspots, rather than ""continuing to treat the city as one entity"". Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the government had to be able to tackle future local outbreaks without ""draconian lockdown measures"" being put in place. The first minister will also give an update next Tuesday on whether, and to what extent, the proposed move to level one for mainland council areas will proceed as planned. She said: ""If we see a significant reduction in the health harms of Covid, even as case numbers rise, then hopefully that will allow us to change our approach. ""Because we will be able to rely then on other public health measures, rather than blanket restrictions, to keep the outbreaks under control."" The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased from 68 three weeks ago to 90 today - but there were more than 2,000 people in hospital at the peak of the second wave in January, and the number of Covid patients in intensive care is currently very low. The first minister said she had considered whether additional restrictions needed to be introduced in three other council areas - Clackmannanshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - where there are relatively high levels of the virus. But all three areas have relatively low populations and the number of cases is low in absolute terms - with public health teams confident that the outbreaks are able to be controlled using existing measures. There have been 641 new positive cases of the virus recorded across Scotland in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 25 March. The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for the virus have also been recorded, while the number of people in hospital has risen to 90 - with six patients in intensive care.

Here are the latest headlines: Stephanie MiskinBBC News Jackie and Jason have run Bromyard Travel Services in Hereford for the past 12 years Months of no bookings, holidays being cancelled or rearranged and no idea what the future holds - one independent travel agent explains how the past 18 months have been a ""living nightmare"". Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds. Read more Liverpool's World Museum is currently hosting the AI More Than Human exhibition A museums group whose donations dropped by 95% during the coronavirus pandemic has set up a fundraising appeal in a bid to avoid making cuts. National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June. It runs seven attractions including the International Slavery Museum, Merseyside Maritime Museum and the Walker Art Gallery. The venues reopened last summer but were closed again when further restrictions kicked in. Read more here. BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said. Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults. Ubiquitous Chip co-owner Colin Clydesdale tells the BBC the news came as no surprise Businesses and politicians have expressed frustration overGlasgow remaining in Level 3 restrictions. The area is the only Scottish council under the harsher measures despite speculation it could have moved to Level 2. Before the news emerged,residents in the city told the BBCthey felt ""broken by Covid"" and while they were continuing to make lifestyle adjustments, the length of the lockdown had left them feeling ""institutionalised"". Following the announcement, Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, says the city is becoming used to ""weekly Friday disappointments"". But Colin Clydesdale, co-owner of west end restaurant Ubiquitous Chip, says the news has come as no surprise after ""so many false starts"". He tells the BBC: ""What I've been saying is for this industry to come out of this in any semblance of reality it's got to get open as quickly as possible. It's got to start paying for itself again."" You can read more reaction here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures. Read more:The vaccines that work - and the others on the way As we reported earlier, restrictions in Glasgow will not be easeduntil next week at the earliest. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Covid cases are still high in the city, but public health measures are helping to ""stabilise"" the situation and there are ""signs of progress"". If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions. The Mouth of the Tyne Festival had been scheduled to take place in Tynemouth from 8-11 July, having already been scrapped last year. Keane were due to perform as one of the event's headliners. The festival is now expected to return in July 2022. Organisers say the decision was made with ""a heavy heart"". Read more More than 42,000 passengers flew between India and the UK in April, figures from the Civil Aviation Authority show. The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

But all three areas have relatively low populations and the number of cases is low in absolute terms - with public health teams confident that the outbreaks are able to be controlled using existing measures. There have been 641 new positive cases of the virus recorded across Scotland in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 25 March. The deaths of a further two people who had previously tested positive for the virus have also been recorded, while the number of people in hospital has risen to 90 - with six patients in intensive care.

Here are the latest headlines: Stephanie MiskinBBC News Jackie and Jason have run Bromyard Travel Services in Hereford for the past 12 years Months of no bookings, holidays being cancelled or rearranged and no idea what the future holds - one independent travel agent explains how the past 18 months have been a ""living nightmare"". Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds.

National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June. It runs seven attractions including the International Slavery Museum, Merseyside Maritime Museum and the Walker Art Gallery. The venues reopened last summer but were closed again when further restrictions kicked in. Read more here. BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week.

propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said. Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults. Ubiquitous Chip co-owner Colin Clydesdale tells the BBC the news came as no surprise Businesses and politicians have expressed frustration overGlasgow remaining in Level 3 restrictions.

Following the announcement, Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, says the city is becoming used to ""weekly Friday disappointments"". But Colin Clydesdale, co-owner of west end restaurant Ubiquitous Chip, says the news has come as no surprise after ""so many false starts"". He tells the BBC: ""What I've been saying is for this industry to come out of this in any semblance of reality it's got to get open as quickly as possible. It's got to start paying for itself again."" You can read more reaction here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures. Read more:The vaccines that work - and the others on the way As we reported earlier, restrictions in Glasgow will not be easeduntil next week at the earliest. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Covid cases are still high in the city, but public health measures are helping to ""stabilise"" the situation and there are ""signs of progress"". If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions. The Mouth of the Tyne Festival had been scheduled to take place in Tynemouth from 8-11 July, having already been scrapped last year. Keane were due to perform as one of the event's headliners.

Read more More than 42,000 passengers flew between India and the UK in April, figures from the Civil Aviation Authority show. The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

"Jeanette Shields had been in hospital for routine treatment A woman has died after being ""dropped"" on the floor during surgery on her hip, which she had broken while in hospital. Jeannette Shields, 70, had been receiving treatment for gall stones in Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle. North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Trust said an investigation was under way ""in relation to an incident involving a patient in one of our theatres"". Mrs Shields' husband, John, said he told the hospital he would not be ""pushing this thing under the carpet"". His wife left her bed to go to the toilet by herself after getting no response to her buzzer, Mr Shields said. She felt dizzy, fell and broke her hip, he told the BBC. John Shields, 78, said he was shocked Two days later she had surgery to repair it, after which the hospital called Mr Shields to say the operation had been successful but that ""unfortunately they dropped her off the operating [table] after the surgery"", he said. ""Then they had to use the sliding board to pick her up and rush her in and do scans on her,"" he said. ""She had a great big bump on the back of her head and she just deteriorated and then she just passed away, just died. ""I'm shocked, I'm really shocked."" It is not clear what happened or how Mrs Shields ended up falling from the operating table. Her daughter, Vikki, said the family later alerted nurses to a large bump on her head. ""You've never seen a bump like it on the bottom of her head,"" she said. Jeanette Shields' family said she had a large bump on her head Mrs Shields, from Carlisle, died six weeks later on 21 May. Her husband said he was initially told there would not be a post-mortem examination. ""I demanded a post-mortem because they wouldn't do it in Carlisle, they didn't want to do it, but I've got it,"" he said. The trust said it had informed its regulators but was ""unable to comment on ongoing investigations"". ""Once it is complete, the findings will be shared with the family and with our regulators in line with normal procedure,"" a spokesperson said. ""The outcome of the investigation will also determine any further action that we will need to take."" Mr Shields said the way the hospital had dealt with the situation was ""disgusting"".

Here are the latest headlines: Stephanie MiskinBBC News Jackie and Jason have run Bromyard Travel Services in Hereford for the past 12 years Months of no bookings, holidays being cancelled or rearranged and no idea what the future holds - one independent travel agent explains how the past 18 months have been a ""living nightmare"". Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds. Read more Liverpool's World Museum is currently hosting the AI More Than Human exhibition A museums group whose donations dropped by 95% during the coronavirus pandemic has set up a fundraising appeal in a bid to avoid making cuts. National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June. It runs seven attractions including the International Slavery Museum, Merseyside Maritime Museum and the Walker Art Gallery. The venues reopened last summer but were closed again when further restrictions kicked in. Read more here. BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the

Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults. Ubiquitous Chip co-owner Colin Clydesdale tells the BBC the news came as no surprise Businesses and politicians have expressed frustration overGlasgow remaining in Level 3 restrictions. The area is the only Scottish council under the harsher measures despite speculation it could have moved to Level 2. Before the news emerged,residents in the city told the BBCthey felt ""broken by Covid"" and while they were continuing to make lifestyle adjustments, the length of the lockdown had left them feeling ""institutionalised"". Following the announcement, Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, says the city is becoming used to ""weekly Friday disappointments"". But Colin Clydesdale, co-owner of west end restaurant Ubiquitous Chip, says the news has come as no surprise after ""so many false starts"". He tells the BBC: ""What I've been saying is for this industry to come out of this in any semblance of reality it's got to get open as quickly as possible. It's got to start paying for itself again."" You can read more reaction here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures. Read more:The vaccines that work - and the others on the way As we reported earlier, restrictions in Glasgow will not be easeduntil next week at the earliest. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Covid cases are still high in the city, but public health measures are helping to ""stabilise"" the situation and there are ""signs of progress"". If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions. The Mouth of the Tyne Festival had been scheduled to take place in Tynemouth from 8-11 July, having already been scrapped last year. Keane were due to perform as one of the event's headliners. The festival is now expected to return in July 2022. Organisers say the decision was made with ""a heavy heart"".

Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time.

"Black Lives Matter's co-founder says she is resigning from its foundation, but not because of what she called right-wing attempts to discredit her. Patrisse Cullors said Friday would be her last day at the foundation, which she has led for nearly six years. The 37-year-old activist's finances came under scrutiny last month after it was reported she owned four homes. Black Lives Matter started as a hashtag in 2013 and has since become a global movement. Ms Cullors said she would step down from the Black Lives Matter Global Network to focus on her forthcoming second book, An Abolitionist's Handbook, and a TV development deal with Warner Bros highlighting black stories. BLM founders: We fought to change history and won In a statement,external, she said: ""With smart, experienced and committed people supporting the organization during this transition, I know that BLMGNF is in good hands. ""The foundation's agenda remains the same - eradicate white supremacy and build life-affirming institutions."" Ms Cullorstold the AP news agency,externalher resignation had been planned for more than a year and was not related to claims that she had misused donations to acquire her property portfolio. There is no evidence to suggest that she had done so. ""Those were right-wing attacks that tried to discredit my character, and I don't operate off of what the right thinks about me,"" she said. The BLM Foundation told AP in February that it had raised $90m (Â£63m) amid last year's racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This video can not be played Black Lives Matter: The three women who founded a global movement The foundation said it ended 2020 with a balance of more than $60m, after operating expenses, grants to black-led organisations and other expenses. Last month the New York Post reported that Ms Cullors - a self-described Marxist - had bought a $1.4m luxury home in Topanga Canyon, near Malibu, and owned three other homes, including a custom ranch in Georgia. Facebook banned users from sharing the story, citing privacy concerns, and a black journalist said he was locked out of his Twitter account after he posted the article. Black Lives Matter has become a global rallying cry Conservative critics - but also some black activists - called for an investigation into whether Ms Cullors had used the organisation's funds to enrich herself. In April the foundation said that Ms Cullors had received $120,000 between 2013 and 2019 for her work. The Black Lives Matter Foundation said in a statement: ""As a registered 501c3 non-profit organization, [the foundation] cannot and did not commit any organizational resources toward the purchase of personal property by any employee or volunteer. ""Any insinuation or assertion to the contrary is categorically false."" Ms Cullors appeared to hold back tears as she told the Black News Channel last month that suggestions of financial impropriety against her were ""categorically untrue and incredibly dangerous"". The grieving parents of Michael Brown and Breonna Taylor - two African Americans whose deaths at the hands of white police officers were often cited by Black Lives Matter - last month reportedly complained the organisation had done nothing to help them.

"Rising numbers of patients needing care and a shortage of GPs is threatening to overwhelm the system, doctors and patient groups are warning. It comes after the pandemic has caused severe disruption to GP practices for more than a year. Analysis of NHS England data by the Health Foundation found more than 28 million appointments were booked in March, among the highest recorded. Doctors' leaders say what they are being asked to achieve is ""undoable"". The analysis of NHS Digital data in England carried out by the Health Foundation for the BBC also found that that between 2019-20 and 2020-21: The total number of appointments dropped by 10% - meaning 31 million fewer consultations with GPs and practice nurses Major shift from face-to-face to remote consultation, with the proportion seen in practices dropping from 79% to 54% The number of patients referred by GPs for urgent cancer check-ups dropped by 15%, putting lives at risk The escalating situation has prompted patient groups to call for an urgent review of access to services, amid reports that patients are struggling to get through. This video can not be played Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster, opened his doors to the BBC to show the pressures facing practices Doncaster-based GP Dr Dean Eggitt has never seen anything like this: ""We have almost a tsunami of patients coming to us - it feels like the river has flooded the banks. ""It just keeps coming and coming and coming in this one massive, endless wave of patients who all are ill and need help and input. ""They're sick, they're complex and we've got very few places to send them. I wouldn't want to be my patient right now."" Dr Eggitt's experience is not unique. There were 28.4 million appointments in March, once you include those made with practice nurses as well as GPs - that is one of the highest on record. But he says he worries most about the ""hidden wave of patients who don't get through"". One of those is Sharron, who ended up in hospital after she struggled on at home for weeks getting more and more sick. She was eventually diagnosed with colitis and had lost so much blood, she needed four emergency blood transfusions. She says a combination of busy phone lines and not wanting to bother the practice meant she deteriorated at home. ""When I finally got through I knew I was really poorly, I had never felt so ill in my life."" She was immediately invited in for a consultation and sent to hospital. There could be millions of people in a similar position. There were 279 million appointments made with GP practices in England from April 2020 to March 2021, compared with 310 million the year before. The biggest drops were seen in the Midlands, North East, Yorkshire and East of England, according to the Health Foundation analysis. The data is not collected elsewhere in the UK, but the reports surfacing suggest the problems are similar. That has, the Health Foundation warns, created a huge amount of unmet need. This much can be seen from the drop in urgent referrals where GPs suspect someone has cancer. The numbers sent to hospital for check-ups have dropped by 15% since the pandemic started - that's potentially 367,000 people with symptoms who have not been sent for further investigations. Sara Bainbridge, from Macmillan Cancer Support, says the disruption to services has had a ""devastating impact"", saying it is leading to fewer diagnoses, and reducing survival chances. And it's not just cancer patients. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP in Oxford and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, says there are people with other serious conditions, such as heart failure and non-Covid respiratory problems, who have stayed away too. ""Their health will have deteriorated as they have not been getting the help they need. The people we are seeing now are coming in with really complex problems. And it is those in deprived areas who have been affected the most."" She says this is being compounded by a significant rise in people seeking help with mental health problems, as well as those ""ricocheting"" back from hospital because their health has worsened while waiting for treatment. Latest figures show there are more than 400,000 people who have been waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements - up from 1,600 when the pandemic began. ""I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at the moment - this is going to get a lot worse in the coming months"" added Dr Fisher. One of the key barriers, some say, is the lack of face-to-face care that is available. Social distancing restrictions and infection control procedures mean GPs have had to rely heavily on remote consultations. The number of face-to-face consultations has dropped significantly - down from 79% of total appointments in 2019-20 to 54% in 2020-21. And even now with restrictions easing, the numbers being brought in are still well short of what they were. One of those who has fallen foul of this is Helen Cowley, 55, from Swindon. She had a telephone consultation for ear pain and was advised to seek private treatment for the build-up of ear wax. When she got to the clinic, they diagnosed an ear infection and she had to phone her practice back. ""It was nearly two months before I got the proper treatment - and to be fair I thought it was ear wax too. It was obviously not the most serious problem in the world, but not being able to be seen face-to-face is not ideal. You can see how things can be missed and for some patients that may have huge consequences."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England is particularly concerned about the lack of face-to-face appointments, and is calling for an urgent review into the situation. National Director Imelda Redmond said while remote consultations suit some patients, there are many who have struggled with the arrangements that have been put in place. ""Those affected are often the most vulnerable in our society - older people, disabled people, those affected by homelessness and on low incomes."" The issue has already prompted action at the highest level. NHS England wrote to GPs in mid-May saying patients must be offered face-to-face appointments if that is their preference, unless there was good reason not to, such as the patient displaying Covid symptoms. Extra funding has been provided too. But the move has been met with some opposition from GP leaders who have raised concerns about the lack of space in GP practice buildings, with the British Medical Association's GPs committee even passing a motion of no confidence in NHS England. BMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey says doctors were left ""angry, frustrated and disappointed"" by the letter, especially given the ""incredible contribution"" GPs have made to the vaccination programme - around three-quarters of jabs have been given in GP-led settings. In many ways, this is a problem that has been building for a while. There has been a big push in recent years by the government to increase the number of GPs to keep up with rising demand, but once you exclude locums and trainees the number of permanent GPs has actually fallen by nearly 2,000 in the past few years to just under 27,000 full-time GPs. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it means what is being asked of the profession now is simply ""undoable"". ""General practice was already facing intense workforce and workload pressures - the pandemic has only exacerbated these. We urgently need more GPs and other members of the practice team.""

"Covid has left a toxic legacy for the NHS, with hospitals facing a huge backlog, putting lives at risk, patient groups and staff are warning. And in-depth analysis by BBC News has found: nearly a third of hospitals have seen long waits balloon with over 10% of patients going a year without treatment major disruption to cancer services, with some hospitals struggling to treat half of their patients within the target time of two months concern growing for 45,000 ""missing cancer patients"", after drops in GP referrals and screening services across the UK It comes as NHS England has launched a Â£160m initiative to tackle the growing waiting lists. A network of ""accelerator"" areas is being established to pilot new initiatives, including extra clinics at weekends, virtual assessments at home and new clinics that can complete high numbers of cataract operations NHS England chief operating officer Amanda Pritchard says: ""With Covid cases in hospitals now significantly reducing, our focus is on rapidly recovering routine services."" Elaine Walsh was diagnosed with womb cancer in January. The 61-year-old, from Essex, was immediately classed as an urgent case - and should have been operated on within weeks. But her operation was cancelled - because of the pandemic and the backlog it had caused. It was ""the most horrendous day"", she says. ""Every day that I'm not on a surgical operating table, it is more of a risk."" This video can not be played 'I might die because of surgery delays due to Covid' Elaine is now due to have surgery on Friday - but the wait has taken its toll. She has been seeing a psychologist to help her emotionally, while physically she has started to deteriorate. ""I have got weaker,"" she says. ""I'm in more pain. Things I could do then, I can't now."" Elaine's story is not unique. Analysis by BBC News shows the numbers starting treatment within the target time have fallen during the pandemic. And some trusts are struggling to start treatment for even half of patients in the recommended timeframe - two months following an urgent referral from their GP. For University Hospitals Birmingham, that proportion is well under a half. It has seen performance deteriorate despite sending patients to be treated in local private hospitals. The trust has treated more Covid patients than any other in the country - more than 14,000 have been admitted since the start of the pandemic, leading to the redeployment of 1,500 staff locally. Like others, it says the disruption has been unavoidable - and it is now ""working hard"" to have patients diagnosed and treated. But it has found not all the delays are caused by the disruption to services. About one in every four of the patients waiting the longest has postponed treatment themselves - and nurses at the trust have been phoning and pleading with them to have treatment. This reluctance to come forward coupled with problems accessing GP and screening services at points in the pandemic is the reason why the number of patients coming forward for checks and being diagnosed has dropped - although there are now signs the numbers are rising. Nonetheless, analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support suggests across the UK there are 45,000 ""missing"" cancer patients. And the charity fears this will lead to more later-stage diagnoses, which reduce the chances of survival. ""The knock-on impact of the pandemic on cancer care cannot be overstated,"" Steven McIntosh says. ""We're likely to be dealing with Covid's long shadow for many years to come."" Attempts are being made to get people to come forward. An NHS advertising campaign, Help Us, Help You, is urging people with cancer symptoms to come forward. But cancer doctor and Catch Up With Cancer Campaign founder Prof Pat Price says a ""monumental political effort"" is needed, with significant investment in equipment and the workforce to ""super-boost"" services. ""Services have suffered years of underinvestment - so we were already at a disadvantage,"" she adds. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the legacy of Covid. Cancer was actually one of the areas of the health service prioritised from the very start to try to keep disruption to a minimum. An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Imperial College London has been looking at how all hospital services have been affected. It has focussed on England - although problems have been reported across the UK nations. Its report breaks the impact of the pandemic down by emergency admissions, planned care and outpatient work. Cancer falls in all three categories and the data shows it has actually seen one of the smallest drops in activity with services such as knee and hip replacements affected much more. Overall planned care fell by a third in 2020 - with the north of England and Midlands hardest hit. Outpatient appointments fell by a fifth - with the amount of physiotherapy provided almost halving - as did non-Covid emergency admissions The report says this will have a considerable impact on the quality of life and health of many people. The consequence of this has been longer waiting times for many non-emergency treatments. In England, nearly 5 million people are now on a hospital waiting list - 9% of the population - the highest number since records began, in 2007. A similar proportion are waiting in Scotland, while in Wales it is 17% and Northern Ireland 23%. Most worrying, the numbers waiting over a year have rocketed - in England, from 1,600 before the pandemic to 436,000 at the end of March 2021. Nearly a third of hospitals now have more than one in every 10 of their patients in this position. A handful have one in every five. One of those is Hull University Teaching Hospitals, which before the pandemic had none, chief operating officer Ellen Ryabov says. It is now running extra weekend clinics, as well as using the private sector, she says, adding: ""Our aim is to get down to 14.5% of patients waiting over 52 weeks by the end of September and then look to clear that entirely."" But in the meantime, Tracey Loftis, of the charity Versus Arthritis says, the wait for ""life-transforming"" surgery can be devastating. Brenda Pugh has been waiting for a double hip replacement since June, after developing severe osteoarthritis at the end of 2019. The 61-year-old, from Hampshire, used to enjoy swimming, running and walking her dog but became immobile and housebound within six months. ""The hip pain is unbearable,"" she says. ""I can just about walk from the sofa to the bathroom, in my house. ""Otherwise, I can't move. It's like standing on jagged glass. I get so depressed about the pain I'm living with."" But the long waits did not come out of the blue. The NHS was routinely missing its targets before March 2020. ""The problems predate the pandemic,"" Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, says.  ""We already had too few beds and not enough staff."" And without investment on the scale last seen in the 2000s, when the Tony Blair government increased the budget by 7% in real terms, hospitals will struggle to get ""back on track"". The concern now is the situation could become even worse before improving. Six million fewer patients were referred on to hospital treatment in 2020 than in 2019, an analysis by the Health Foundation has found, a drop of nearly a third. As with cancer, people seem to have been deterred from seeking help either because they were worried about catching Covid or did not want to burden the NHS. And if just a fraction of these return, it could create serious problems for the recovery of services, particularly given what staff have gone through in the pandemic. Surveys by both the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association in recent weeks have suggested high levels of exhaustion, fatigue and low morale, with many reporting they feel under pressure to work extra hours without pay, which, the unions warn, is unsustainable. Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, a think tank that monitors NHS performance, has sympathy for staff. She says workforce shortages are now at ""critical"" levels and if this is not solved the backlog will not be addressed any time soon. ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS has been immense.""

We're about to bring things to a close for the day. Here are the latest headlines: Stephanie MiskinBBC News Jackie and Jason have run Bromyard Travel Services in Hereford for the past 12 years Months of no bookings, holidays being cancelled or rearranged and no idea what the future holds - one independent travel agent explains how the past 18 months have been a ""living nightmare"". Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds.

National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June. It runs seven attractions including the International Slavery Museum, Merseyside Maritime Museum and the Walker Art Gallery. The venues reopened last summer but were closed again when further restrictions kicked in. Read more here. BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said. Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults. Ubiquitous Chip co-owner Colin Clydesdale tells the BBC the news came as no surprise Businesses and politicians have expressed frustration overGlasgow remaining in Level 3 restrictions. The area is the only Scottish council under the harsher measures despite speculation it could have moved to Level 2. Before the news emerged,residents in the city told the BBCthey felt ""broken by Covid"" and while they were continuing to make lifestyle adjustments, the length of the lockdown had left them feeling ""institutionalised"". Following the announcement, Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, says the city is becoming used to ""weekly Friday disappointments"". But Colin Clydesdale, co-owner of west end restaurant Ubiquitous Chip, says the news has come as no surprise after ""so many false starts"". He tells the BBC: ""What I've been saying is for this industry to come out of this in any semblance of reality it's got to get open as quickly as possible. It's got to start paying for itself again."" You can read more reaction here. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures. Read more:The vaccines that work - and the others on the way As we reported earlier, restrictions in Glasgow will not be easeduntil next week at the earliest. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Covid cases are still high in the city, but public health measures are helping to ""stabilise"" the situation and there are ""signs of progress"". If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions. The Mouth of the Tyne Festival had been scheduled to take place in Tynemouth from 8-11 July, having already been scrapped last year. Keane were due to perform as one of the event's headliners. The festival is now expected to return in July 2022. Organisers say the decision was made with ""a heavy heart"". Read more More than 42,000 passengers flew between India and the UK in April, figures from the Civil Aviation Authority show. The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

"This video can not be played Obama: ""Marcus is way ahead of where I was at 23"" Barack Obama has praised the anti-poverty campaigning of England footballer Marcus Rashford. In a Zoom meeting, the former United States president told Mr Rashford he was ""way ahead of where I was"" at that age. The 23-year-old footballer said it was ""surreal"" to be talking to Mr Obama from his kitchen in Manchester. Mr Obama backed young people such as Mr Rashford who are ""positive forces in their communities"". The men, in a meeting set up by the publishers Penguin, discussed the former president's memoir and shared experiences, such as being raised by single mothers and their involvement in community projects. ""Even if you do something positive on a small scale, that's making a difference, and it's the accumulation of people doing positive things over time that makes us a little bit better with each successive generation,"" said Mr Obama. The Manchester United footballer has been campaigning against food poverty He also said that when he was younger he had no expectation of becoming president: ""If I had had more talent I would have probably preferred to be a professional athlete, like Marcus."" The former president told Mr Rashford that social movements often started with young people - but the footballer said they often ""don't understand how powerful their voice is"". The Manchester United footballer, who has run high-profile campaigns to prevent child hunger, said: ""When President Obama speaks, all you want to do is listen."" Rashford faces racial abuse on social media Food voucher u-turn after Rashford campaign Rashford recipe plan includes fish finger sandwiches Marcus Rashford launches children's book club ""I mean, it's quite surreal isn't it? I'm sitting in my kitchen in Manchester, speaking to President Obama. But immediately he made me feel at ease. ""It wasn't long before I realised just how aligned our experiences as children were in shaping the men you see today - adversity, obstacles and all."" This week Mr Rashford highlighted the""racial slurs"" he faced on social mediaafter his team's defeat in the Europa League final, with the attacks described by Manchester United as ""disgraceful racist abuse"". In their Zoom call, the two men discussed the importance of books and reading. Mr Obama said his mother had ""planted this love of reading"" and Mr Rashford said books had given him a freedom to follow his own ideas. ""Rather than someone telling me to do this and do that - books allowed me to do it my own way,"" said Mr Rashford. The footballer last year launched his own children's book club, to improve reading skills among disadvantaged young people. With TV chef Tom Kerridge, he is also offering free recipes and cooking tips for affordable, healthy meals, as part of his campaign against food poverty. Mr Rashford has spoken about being hungry and relying on free school meals as a child - and successfully battled with the government over providing free meals over the school holidays during the pandemic. This was raised by former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings, who told a select committee of MPs that the prime minister had been advised: ""Do not pick a fight with Rashford"" but then had to ""surrender twice"".

"The deal follows years of efforts toward reconciliation, including repatriation of remains Germany has officially acknowledged committing genocide during its colonial occupation of Namibia, and announced financial aid worth more than â¬1.1bn (Â£940m; $1.34bn). German colonisers killed tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people there in early 20th Century massacres. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his country was asking Namibia and victims' descendants for forgiveness. But activists say the aid is not enough to address the suffering inflicted. Africa Live: More on this and other stories What's the right price to pay for genocide? Germany returns skulls of Namibian victims The money will apparently be paid out over 30 years through spending on infrastructure, healthcare and training programmes benefiting the impacted communities. ""We will now officially refer to these events as what they are from today's perspective: genocide,"" Mr Maas said, adding that colonial-era actions should be discussed ""without sparing or glossing over"". A spokesman for the Namibian government told AFP news agency Germany's recognition was ""a first step in the right direction"". Friday's statement came after five years of negotiations with Namibia - which was under German occupation from 1884 to 1915. The atrocities committed have been described by historians as ""the forgotten genocide"" of the early 20th Century, in what was then known as German South West Africa. The UN defines genocide as a number of acts, including killing, committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. This video can not be played Skulls of victims were sent back to Germany for eugenics research The genocide began in 1904 after a Herero and Nama rebellion over German seizures of their land and cattle. The head of the military administration there, Lothar von Trotha, called for the extermination of the population in response. How do you define genocide? Namibia: Country profile A search in Germany for lost tribal chief's skull Survivors from the Herero and Nama population were forced into the desert and later placed in concentration camps where they were exploited for labour. Many died of disease, exhaustion and starvation with some subject to sexual exploitation and medical experimentation. It is thought up to 80% of the indigenous populations died during the genocide - with a death toll in the tens of thousands. Captives taken after the Herero rebellion were either killed or subjected to appalling brutality Germany has previously acknowledged the atrocities but ruled out paying reparations. In 2018 theyrepatriated some human remains to Namibia which had been used as part of now-discredited researchattempting to prove the racial superiority of white Europeans. The latest deal was reportedly agreed during a round of negotiations held by special envoys in mid-May. A declaration is expected to be signed by the German foreign minister in the Namibian capital, Windhoek, next month before being ratified by each country's parliament, German media reports say. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is then expected to travel to the country to officially apologise. Laidlaw Peringanda, a Herero activist and chairman of the Namibian Genocide Association, said the offer of development aid was not enough. ""We're actually not accepting that offer because our people have lost lands, they have lost their culture and a lot of them have fled to Botswana, South Africa and some of them were taken to Togo and Cameroon,"" he told BBC World Service. He insisted that Germany should buy back ancestral lands now in the hands of the German-speaking community, which reportedly makes up less than 1% of the population. ""People are getting impatient, especially the minority black people who [don't] have a piece of land,"" he said. ""And from what I'm hearing from some of the people, there will be a land revolution. People will grab the land by force. So we must actually try to avoid these things."" Mr Maas said the negotiations had aimed to find ""a common path to genuine reconciliation in memory of the victims"" with members of the Herero and Nama communities closely involved in talks. Another point of contention is around language. The agreed deal focuses on the idea of reconciliation over formalised compensation, with Mr Maas describing the aid package as a ""gesture"" rather than reparation. Mr Rukuro (pictured) told local media the deal was ""not enough for the blood of our ancestors"" JÃ¼rgen Zimmerer, professor of global history of University of Hamburg, told the BBC World Service a great number of descendants of the victims of the genocide felt excluded. ""This is quite a problem if reconciliation is the aim,"" he said. ""How do you reconcile with the victims if the victims feel left out of the entire process?"" Tim Whewell, writing for the BBC earlier this year about the negotiations, said the discussions were the first of their kind by a former colonial power. He wrote that many Herero and Nama living in overcrowded areas or informal settlements had hoped the deal would go some way to restoring land access and some of the prosperity their ancestors enjoyed before the genocide.

"In the Friends reunion special, James Corden interviewed the cast in front of the famous fountain from the opening credits Something was amiss in China's version of the much-anticipated Friends reunion special: guest stars BTS, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber were nowhere to be seen. Eagle-eyed fans found the stars were cut on all three Chinese streamers with broadcast rights. LGBTQ references, among other things, were also gone. It is believed that footage of the stars were cut because they are deemed to have insulted China in the past. The US sitcom is hugely popular in China, and the censorship upset fans. ""Help! Are we never going to move on and change? This will just make me want to find out more about the cut scenes,"" one person commented on microblogging platform Weibo. Some fans have since sourced and shared the deleted clips on social media on their own, while others circulated links to the uncensored, full episode, hosted on piracy sites. Friends has a massive following in the country, with many Chinese millennials crediting the show with introducing them to American culture and also teaching them English. The reunion episode had brought all six principal cast members together to talk about their time on the beloved series, along with interviews with celebrities and fans. 10 of the best moments from the Friends reunion It is unclear whether the government had issued a censorship directive, or if streaming platforms iQiyi, Youku and Tencent Video had done it themselves to avoid letting ""politically sensitive"" content go through. Many fans noticed that the censorship was not consistent across the board- iQiyi's version had the shortest running time, at least six minutes less than the original runtime of 1hr 44min. Tencent Video's version had cut close to five minutes of footage, while Youku censored around four minutes. There were calls to boycott South Korean boy band BTS in China last yearover comments a member made about the Korean War. In a speech, band leader RM had mentioned South Korea's shared ""history of pain"" with the US over the 1950-53 conflict, in which the two countries fought together. His remarks angered Chinese social media users, as Beijing backed the North in the war. In the uncut Friends episode, the superstars were part of a 13-second clip speaking about their love for the show, with RM saying that the sitcom had taught him ""the things about life and true friendship."" There have been calls to boycott South Korean boy band BTS in China over comments a member made about the Korean War Meanwhile, American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga is banned from touring in China, following hermeeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016. By showing her support for the Tibetan spiritual leader, she had upset Chinese officials who feel he is a figurehead for Tibetan separatism. The cut meant that her appearance in the Friends special - where she sings the iconic Smelly Cat song with the sitcom's star Lisa Kudrow - would not have been seen on official Chinese channels. Lady Gaga met the Dalai Lama in 2016 Chinese audiences also did not see Justin Bieber's appearance in the episode dressed as Spudnik - the potato and satellite-combination suit that Friends character Ross once wore to a Halloween party. The Canadian pop star isbanned from performing in China for ""bad behaviour"". In 2014,he caused upset after posting a photoof himself visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The shrine, which honours fallen warriors and pays tribute to convicted war criminals, is seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan not being sorry for its empire's past. Justin Bieber is banned from performing in China for ""bad behaviour"" LGBTQ references, as well as seemingly random references to urine, were censored. For example, a testimony by gay German fan Ricardo, who described how the show gave him a sense of belonging, was dropped. ""I was a gay man who wanted to be like Jennifer Aniston, so you can imagine how lonely I was,"" he had said in the original clip. The Youku platform censored another scene in which a woman pulls her female partner on camera. ""Like every Chandler, I found my Monica,"" she had said. The streaming platform also censored shots from a scene where Friends star Matt LeBlanc's Joey revealed a picture of Ross stuck to the front of his underwear. Meanwhile, iQiyi and Tencent both cut out the iconic scene from the sitcom where Monica talks about how Chandler had helped her with a jellyfish sting by peeing on her leg. It is not uncommon for Chinese broadcasters to censor anything that may be deemed politically or culturally sensitive. In April, for example,Chinese TV stations blurred out Western brand logosin their programmes, in a show of support for China's Xinjiang cotton campaign. Hip-hop culture, tattoos and cleavage have also been censored in the past. In 2015, popular Chinese TV drama The Empress of China was re-edited to get rid of the plunging necklines featured in the show - provoking a large amount of public outrage.

Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health.

BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff.

Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults.

Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures.

If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions.

The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures.

North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation.

But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too.

The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time.

We're about to bring things to a close for the day. Here are the latest headlines: Stephanie MiskinBBC News Jackie and Jason have run Bromyard Travel Services in Hereford for the past 12 years Months of no bookings, holidays being cancelled or rearranged and no idea what the future holds - one independent travel agent explains how the past 18 months have been a ""living nightmare"". Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds.

National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June. It runs seven attractions including the International Slavery Museum, Merseyside Maritime Museum and the Walker Art Gallery. The venues reopened last summer but were closed again when further restrictions kicked in. Read more here. BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said.

"Black Lives Matter's co-founder says she is resigning from its foundation, but not because of what she called right-wing attempts to discredit her. Patrisse Cullors said Friday would be her last day at the foundation, which she has led for nearly six years. The 37-year-old activist's finances came under scrutiny last month after it was reported she owned four homes. Black Lives Matter started as a hashtag in 2013 and has since become a global movement. Ms Cullors said she would step down from the Black Lives Matter Global Network to focus on her forthcoming second book, An Abolitionist's Handbook, and a TV development deal with Warner Bros highlighting black stories. BLM founders: We fought to change history and won In a statement,external, she said: ""With smart, experienced and committed people supporting the organization during this transition, I know that BLMGNF is in good hands. ""The foundation's agenda remains the same - eradicate white supremacy and build life-affirming institutions."" Ms Cullorstold the AP news agency,externalher resignation had been planned for more than a year and was not related to claims that she had misused donations to acquire her property portfolio. There is no evidence to suggest that she had done so. ""Those were right-wing attacks that tried to discredit my character, and I don't operate off of what the right thinks about me,"" she said. The BLM Foundation told AP in February that it had raised $90m (Â£63m) amid last year's racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This video can not be played Black Lives Matter: The three women who founded a global movement The foundation said it ended 2020 with a balance of more than $60m, after operating expenses, grants to black-led organisations and other expenses. Last month the New York Post reported that Ms Cullors - a self-described Marxist - had bought a $1.4m luxury home in Topanga Canyon, near Malibu, and owned three other homes, including a custom ranch in Georgia. Facebook banned users from sharing the story, citing privacy concerns, and a black journalist said he was locked out of his Twitter account after he posted the article. Black Lives Matter has become a global rallying cry Conservative critics - but also some black activists - called for an investigation into whether Ms Cullors had used the organisation's funds to enrich herself. In April the foundation said that Ms Cullors had received $120,000 between 2013 and 2019 for her work. The Black Lives Matter Foundation said in a statement: ""As a registered 501c3 non-profit organization, [the foundation] cannot and did not commit any organizational resources toward the purchase of personal property by any employee or volunteer. ""Any insinuation or assertion to the contrary is categorically false."" Ms Cullors appeared to hold back tears as she told the Black News Channel last month that suggestions of financial impropriety against her were ""categorically untrue and incredibly dangerous"". The grieving parents of Michael Brown and Breonna Taylor - two African Americans whose deaths at the hands of white police officers were often cited by Black Lives Matter - last month reportedly complained the organisation had done nothing to help them.

Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health.

BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said. Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults. Ubiquitous Chip co-owner Colin Clydesdale tells the BBC the news came as no surprise Businesses and politicians have expressed frustration overGlasgow remaining in Level 3 restrictions. The area is the only Scottish council under the harsher measures despite speculation it could have moved to Level 2.

Following the announcement, Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, says the city is becoming used to ""weekly Friday disappointments"". But Colin Clydesdale, co-owner of west end restaurant Ubiquitous Chip, says the news has come as no surprise after ""so many false starts"". He tells the BBC: ""What I've been saying is for this industry to come out of this in any semblance of reality it's got to get open as quickly as possible.

Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures.

If you missed her midday press conference, you can watch a clip from it here: This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow cases high but 'signs of progress' Mobile testing units will stay in place in North Tyneside until Wednesday after a spike in cases of the so-called Indian variant of the virus. So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions.

The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

"Black Lives Matter's co-founder says she is resigning from its foundation, but not because of what she called right-wing attempts to discredit her. Patrisse Cullors said Friday would be her last day at the foundation, which she has led for nearly six years. The 37-year-old activist's finances came under scrutiny last month after it was reported she owned four homes. Black Lives Matter started as a hashtag in 2013 and has since become a global movement. Ms Cullors said she would step down from the Black Lives Matter Global Network to focus on her forthcoming second book, An Abolitionist's Handbook, and a TV development deal with Warner Bros highlighting black stories. BLM founders: We fought to change history and won In a statement,external, she said: ""With smart, experienced and committed people supporting the organization during this transition, I know that BLMGNF is in good hands. ""The foundation's agenda remains the same - eradicate white supremacy and build life-affirming institutions."" Ms Cullorstold the AP news agency,externalher resignation had been planned for more than a year and was not related to claims that she had misused donations to acquire her property portfolio. There is no evidence to suggest that she had done so. ""Those were right-wing attacks that tried to discredit my character, and I don't operate off of what the right thinks about me,"" she said. The BLM Foundation told AP in February that it had raised $90m (Â£63m) amid last year's racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This video can not be played Black Lives Matter: The three women who founded a global movement The foundation said it ended 2020 with a balance of more than $60m, after operating expenses, grants to black-led organisations and other expenses. Last month the New York Post reported that Ms Cullors - a self-described Marxist - had bought a $1.4m luxury home in Topanga Canyon, near Malibu, and owned three other homes, including a custom ranch in Georgia. Facebook banned users from sharing the story, citing privacy concerns, and a black journalist said he was locked out of his Twitter account after he posted the article. Black Lives Matter has become a global rallying cry Conservative critics - but also some black activists - called for an investigation into whether Ms Cullors had used the organisation's funds to enrich herself. In April the foundation said that Ms Cullors had received $120,000 between 2013 and 2019 for her work. The Black Lives Matter Foundation said in a statement: ""As a registered 501c3 non-profit organization, [the foundation] cannot and did not commit any organizational resources toward the purchase of personal property by any employee or volunteer. ""Any insinuation or assertion to the contrary is categorically false."" Ms Cullors appeared to hold back tears as she told the Black News Channel last month that suggestions of financial impropriety against her were ""categorically untrue and incredibly dangerous"". The grieving parents of Michael Brown and Breonna Taylor - two African Americans whose deaths at the hands of white police officers were often cited by Black Lives Matter - last month reportedly complained the organisation had done nothing to help them.

Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds.

""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"".

Here are the latest headlines: Stephanie MiskinBBC News Jackie and Jason have run Bromyard Travel Services in Hereford for the past 12 years Months of no bookings, holidays being cancelled or rearranged and no idea what the future holds - one independent travel agent explains how the past 18 months have been a ""living nightmare"". Jason Young has wrestled both financially and mentally as he's tried to keep the family business afloat. Bromyard Travel Services was a thriving business in the centre of the market town of Hereford for the past 12 years. Today, it is at a crossroads after ""being in a state of limbo"" since early 2020. Repeated lockdowns have left customers cancelling or changing their holidays to a later date, leaving Jason and his wife Jackie out of pocket despite being busier than ever adjusting customers' holiday plans. He has taken a second job as a supermarket delivery driver, which he says has helped his mental health. With question marks hanging over travel restrictions throughout 2021, and fears consumer confidence will take a long time to be restored, Jason is not sure what the future holds. Read more Liverpool's World Museum is currently hosting the AI More Than Human exhibition A museums group whose donations dropped by 95% during the coronavirus pandemic has set up a fundraising appeal in a bid to avoid making cuts. National Museums Liverpool welcomed 200,000 visitors in 2020 compared to the usual three million per year. Head of development Rowena Dean says: ""We usually get Â£400,000 a year through donation boxes so you can see how devastating that is."" The group aims to raise Â£5,000 by mid-June. It runs seven attractions including the International Slavery Museum, Merseyside Maritime Museum and the Walker Art Gallery. The venues reopened last summer but were closed again when further restrictions kicked in. Read more here. BBC Monitoring Russia's current rate of vaccination is ""insufficient"", with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated, the country's Academy of Sciences says. In a statement on its website, the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences says despite jabs being available to the public for months ""the rate of vaccination remains low"". ""So far, only 11% of residents have received the first dose of the vaccine, 8% have completed vaccination,"" it says. The academy is calling on people ""not to postpone their vaccination"" - an appeal that has also been made recently by most senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Polls have shown muted enthusiasm for jabs among Russians. Only 30% said in February they were willing to receive the country's Sputnik V vaccine, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey this month by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a Covid-19 jab ""under any circumstance"". Vaccination is voluntary in Russia and the Kremlin denies it would seek to make it compulsory. However, some officials have spoken publicly about the idea, and earlier this week Russia's far-eastern Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) was forced to walk back suggestions it would make jabs obligatory after announcing 200,000 rouble fines for employers who fail to provide a jab for their staff. Ian YoungsEntertainment and Arts Reporter, BBC News As arts venues attempt to get back on an even keel, Bolton's Octagon theatre has had more unfortunate timing than most. It first announced its reopening after a two-year redevelopment as Covid loomed last February, only to face closure soon after. Then it finally opened its doors this week - but the town is now a Covid hotspot once again. ""We had such an amazing feeling when we announced the new season [in early 2020],"" says chief executive Roddy Gauld. ""Covid was this thing that was happening in the news elsewhere. Hundreds of us sat in a cinema as we revealed what the shows were going to be. Sales were instantly buoyant. The reaction was great. ""And then a couple of weeks later, we were sending everyone home, saying: 'We don't know when we're going to see you again.'"" You can read the full story of the theatre's fight for survival here. Hospitality venues are struggling to fill thousands of job vacancies, according to an industry body. UK Hospitality says waiting staff and chefs are in particular demand as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease. It is calling on the government to stick to its plan to lift all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. The government says it is ""doing everything we can to support hospitality"". The sector has been has been hit hard by the pandemic, and is also facing shortages due to Brexit, the trade body says. From last weekpubs, restaurants and cafes were able to serve customers indoorsin England, Scotland and Wales, whilerestrictions in Northern Ireland were relaxed this week. But even before those restrictions lifted, hospitality venues were struggling to find staff. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will
propose his 2022 budget later today - a $6tn (Â£4.24tn) plan that would add more
than $1tn annually to the federal deficit. The sweeping plan, which tops
Donald Trump's $4.8tn proposal last year, promises infrastructure upgrades and
an expanded social safety net after spikes in unemployment seen during the
Covid crisis. The proposal will be given to
Congress and needs approval to be implemented. If passed, it will bring the US
to spending levels not seen since World War Two. The budget provides a picture of
a president's priorities â as well as how this administration thinks the
economy will recover from Covid. Read more here. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for children aged between 12 and 15 in the European Union, its medicines regulator has said. Up to now, it has only allowed its use in those aged 16 and over. The decision will need to be formally approved by the European Commission, and then individual EU member states can decide whether to let those aged 12 and over get the jab. Germany has already indicated it will allow this from early June. The European Medicines Agency says the results of a clinical trial involving 2,000 12 to 15-year-olds showed they had similar or better immune responses than those seen in young adults. Ubiquitous Chip co-owner Colin Clydesdale tells the BBC the news came as no surprise Businesses and politicians have expressed frustration overGlasgow remaining in Level 3 restrictions.

Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As we reported earlier, Office for National Statistics figures suggest Covid cases in the UK remain low, but there are signs of a small increase. The ONS regularly swabs a random sample of the population to estimate levels of the virus, even in people who don't have symptoms or don't get tested. Almost half of the infections picked up look like they are probably caused by the variant first identified in India. But national data suggests it is still confined to a handful of areas. An estimated 60,000 people in the UK were infected with coronavirus in the week leading up to 22 May, an increase of roughly 10% from 54,000 people the previous week. That equates to 0.09% of the population - or one in 1,080 people. So there is still not a lot of Covid around compared with the winter peak. But there have been signs of increases in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the previous fortnight. In Wales, cases remain stable. So far, this rise across the UK is small - but data suggests there are larger rises concentrated in just a few local authorities. Read more on this story here. Another 10 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and there are 4,182 more cases,the latest figures show,external. Some 38,871,200 people have now had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 24,478,052 people have had a second. The approval of the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine means there are now four different vaccines approved for use in the UK. The three other vaccines, already in use, are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. The Janssen vaccine can be given to people aged 18 and over and is likely to be used as a booster jab for care home residents ahead of winter because it can be easily stored and transported at fridge temperatures.

So far, 58 cases of the variant have been discovered in the borough in north-east England, which prompted the introduction of surge testing and extra vaccination sessions. North Tyneside saw a total of 56 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 May, up from 36 the week before. The council says it will continue to monitor the situation. Read more As we've been reporting, a single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has been approved for use in the UK. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the decision, saying: ""It's really good news, any new vaccine, if it's approved, manufactured and then we get supplies of it, is great."" But she adds: ""We're focused right now on the supplies we actually have and getting them into people's arms as quickly as possible."" Sturgeon also says Scots should do their ""civic public duty"" and get vaccinated. At a Covid briefing she says: ""Getting vaccinated is in all of our best interests, whatever age we are."" Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi The jabs will be for the more than 950,000 Kenyans who have had their first vaccine Kenyaâs health
ministry has advised hospitals to stop giving first doses of the AstraZeneca
Covid-19 vaccines. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe says a shipment arriving on Friday from global-sharing scheme Covax is meant for those due for
their second shots. More than 950,000
Kenyans who received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine in mid-March
will  receive  the booster shots from Friday. Kagwe says under the current circumstances it will be better to ensure that
these people are fully vaccinated. A single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gives about 70% protection for at least 12 weeks
and 81% after a full dose. The minister says those who are yet to be vaccinated will be given other vaccines such as Janssen, which is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. But it is still not clear when they will be
delivered. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Scientists are increasingly confident that the epidemic is growing in England. This shift is reflected in their estimate of R â the number of people each infected individual passes the virus to. Last week, it was somewhere between 0.9 and 1.1 (maybe shrinking, maybe growing) and now they think itâs between 1 and 1.1 (so almost certainly growing, albeit slowly). The figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland still allow some possibility that their pandemics might be shrinking and the Welsh estimate is lower still (0.8-1.0). They do warn about reading too much into precise figures for R. When case numbers are low a single outbreak in one part of the country can really skew the numbers. But a return to a growing epidemic wonât be a shock to most â society is opening up again and weâre dealing with a newer type of coronavirus that seems to be spreading faster than the one we were used to. Infections and cases have been rising slowly over the past two weeks, and the rises arenât just in the variant hotspots. Weâre also starting to see rises in the number of people going into hospital. But weâre still a long way from the picture we saw over the winter. Fewer than one-in-1,000 people have coronavirus, according to the latest estimates from the ONS. That is up by about a quarter in the past fortnight, but is still far below the levels we saw last winter and the growth is slower than we saw at that time too. Keane had been due to perform at the festival A festival in north-east England that was expected to attract more than 100,000 people has been cancelled amid uncertainty over the easing of coronavirus restrictions. The Mouth of the Tyne Festival had been scheduled to take place in Tynemouth from 8-11 July, having already been scrapped last year. Keane were due to perform as one of the event's headliners.

Read more More than 42,000 passengers flew between India and the UK in April, figures from the Civil Aviation Authority show. The authority has not provided a breakdown of which passengers were travelling from India to the UK and how many from the UK to India. During April non-essential travel was banned from the UK and those arriving were expected to quarantine. People were allowed to travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work. India was put on the red list from 23 April over concerns of the variant that was first found there. This means only UK residents would be allowed into the UK from India and they must pay for 11 days of quarantine at a hotel. Pakistan and Bangladesh were put on the red list on 9 April and the UK government has been criticised for not putting India on the list at the same time. The Indian government limited the number of flights between the UK and India to 30 a week in January over fears of the UK variant. These limitations were still in place in April.

"This video can not be played Obama: ""Marcus is way ahead of where I was at 23"" Barack Obama has praised the anti-poverty campaigning of England footballer Marcus Rashford. In a Zoom meeting, the former United States president told Mr Rashford he was ""way ahead of where I was"" at that age. The 23-year-old footballer said it was ""surreal"" to be talking to Mr Obama from his kitchen in Manchester. Mr Obama backed young people such as Mr Rashford who are ""positive forces in their communities"". The men, in a meeting set up by the publishers Penguin, discussed the former president's memoir and shared experiences, such as being raised by single mothers and their involvement in community projects. ""Even if you do something positive on a small scale, that's making a difference, and it's the accumulation of people doing positive things over time that makes us a little bit better with each successive generation,"" said Mr Obama. The Manchester United footballer has been campaigning against food poverty He also said that when he was younger he had no expectation of becoming president: ""If I had had more talent I would have probably preferred to be a professional athlete, like Marcus."" The former president told Mr Rashford that social movements often started with young people - but the footballer said they often ""don't understand how powerful their voice is"". The Manchester United footballer, who has run high-profile campaigns to prevent child hunger, said: ""When President Obama speaks, all you want to do is listen."" Rashford faces racial abuse on social media Food voucher u-turn after Rashford campaign Rashford recipe plan includes fish finger sandwiches Marcus Rashford launches children's book club ""I mean, it's quite surreal isn't it? I'm sitting in my kitchen in Manchester, speaking to President Obama. But immediately he made me feel at ease. ""It wasn't long before I realised just how aligned our experiences as children were in shaping the men you see today - adversity, obstacles and all."" This week Mr Rashford highlighted the""racial slurs"" he faced on social mediaafter his team's defeat in the Europa League final, with the attacks described by Manchester United as ""disgraceful racist abuse"". In their Zoom call, the two men discussed the importance of books and reading. Mr Obama said his mother had ""planted this love of reading"" and Mr Rashford said books had given him a freedom to follow his own ideas. ""Rather than someone telling me to do this and do that - books allowed me to do it my own way,"" said Mr Rashford. The footballer last year launched his own children's book club, to improve reading skills among disadvantaged young people.

"In the Friends reunion special, James Corden interviewed the cast in front of the famous fountain from the opening credits Something was amiss in China's version of the much-anticipated Friends reunion special: guest stars BTS, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber were nowhere to be seen. Eagle-eyed fans found the stars were cut on all three Chinese streamers with broadcast rights. LGBTQ references, among other things, were also gone. It is believed that footage of the stars were cut because they are deemed to have insulted China in the past. The US sitcom is hugely popular in China, and the censorship upset fans. ""Help! Are we never going to move on and change? This will just make me want to find out more about the cut scenes,"" one person commented on microblogging platform Weibo. Some fans have since sourced and shared the deleted clips on social media on their own, while others circulated links to the uncensored, full episode, hosted on piracy sites. Friends has a massive following in the country, with many Chinese millennials crediting the show with introducing them to American culture and also teaching them English. The reunion episode had brought all six principal cast members together to talk about their time on the beloved series, along with interviews with celebrities and fans. 10 of the best moments from the Friends reunion It is unclear whether the government had issued a censorship directive, or if streaming platforms iQiyi, Youku and Tencent Video had done it themselves to avoid letting ""politically sensitive"" content go through. Many fans noticed that the censorship was not consistent across the board- iQiyi's version had the shortest running time, at least six minutes less than the original runtime of 1hr 44min. Tencent Video's version had cut close to five minutes of footage, while Youku censored around four minutes. There were calls to boycott South Korean boy band BTS in China last yearover comments a member made about the Korean War. In a speech, band leader RM had mentioned South Korea's shared ""history of pain"" with the US over the 1950-53 conflict, in which the two countries fought together. His remarks angered Chinese social media users, as Beijing backed the North in the war. In the uncut Friends episode, the superstars were part of a 13-second clip speaking about their love for the show, with RM saying that the sitcom had taught him ""the things about life and true friendship."" There have been calls to boycott South Korean boy band BTS in China over comments a member made about the Korean War Meanwhile, American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga is banned from touring in China, following hermeeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016. By showing her support for the Tibetan spiritual leader, she had upset Chinese officials who feel he is a figurehead for Tibetan separatism. The cut meant that her appearance in the Friends special - where she sings the iconic Smelly Cat song with the sitcom's star Lisa Kudrow - would not have been seen on official Chinese channels. Lady Gaga met the Dalai Lama in 2016 Chinese audiences also did not see Justin Bieber's appearance in the episode dressed as Spudnik - the potato and satellite-combination suit that Friends character Ross once wore to a Halloween party. The Canadian pop star isbanned from performing in China for ""bad behaviour"". In 2014,he caused upset after posting a photoof himself visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.

Justin Bieber is banned from performing in China for ""bad behaviour"" LGBTQ references, as well as seemingly random references to urine, were censored. For example, a testimony by gay German fan Ricardo, who described how the show gave him a sense of belonging, was dropped. ""I was a gay man who wanted to be like Jennifer Aniston, so you can imagine how lonely I was,"" he had said in the original clip. The Youku platform censored another scene in which a woman pulls her female partner on camera. ""Like every Chandler, I found my Monica,"" she had said. The streaming platform also censored shots from a scene where Friends star Matt LeBlanc's Joey revealed a picture of Ross stuck to the front of his underwear. Meanwhile, iQiyi and Tencent both cut out the iconic scene from the sitcom where Monica talks about how Chandler had helped her with a jellyfish sting by peeing on her leg.

"This video can not be played Obama: ""Marcus is way ahead of where I was at 23"" Barack Obama has praised the anti-poverty campaigning of England footballer Marcus Rashford. In a Zoom meeting, the former United States president told Mr Rashford he was ""way ahead of where I was"" at that age. The 23-year-old footballer said it was ""surreal"" to be talking to Mr Obama from his kitchen in Manchester. Mr Obama backed young people such as Mr Rashford who are ""positive forces in their communities"". The men, in a meeting set up by the publishers Penguin, discussed the former president's memoir and shared experiences, such as being raised by single mothers and their involvement in community projects. ""Even if you do something positive on a small scale, that's making a difference, and it's the accumulation of people doing positive things over time that makes us a little bit better with each successive generation,"" said Mr Obama. The Manchester United footballer has been campaigning against food poverty He also said that when he was younger he had no expectation of becoming president: ""If I had had more talent I would have probably preferred to be a professional athlete, like Marcus."" The former president told Mr Rashford that social movements often started with young people - but the footballer said they often ""don't understand how powerful their voice is"". The Manchester United footballer, who has run high-profile campaigns to prevent child hunger, said: ""When President Obama speaks, all you want to do is listen."" Rashford faces racial abuse on social media Food voucher u-turn after Rashford campaign Rashford recipe plan includes fish finger sandwiches Marcus Rashford launches children's book club ""I mean, it's quite surreal isn't it? I'm sitting in my kitchen in Manchester, speaking to President Obama. But immediately he made me feel at ease. ""It wasn't long before I realised just how aligned our experiences as children were in shaping the men you see today - adversity, obstacles and all."" This week Mr Rashford highlighted the""racial slurs"" he faced on social mediaafter his team's defeat in the Europa League final, with the attacks described by Manchester United as ""disgraceful racist abuse"". In their Zoom call, the two men discussed the importance of books and reading. Mr Obama said his mother had ""planted this love of reading"" and Mr Rashford said books had given him a freedom to follow his own ideas. ""Rather than someone telling me to do this and do that - books allowed me to do it my own way,"" said Mr Rashford. The footballer last year launched his own children's book club, to improve reading skills among disadvantaged young people. With TV chef Tom Kerridge, he is also offering free recipes and cooking tips for affordable, healthy meals, as part of his campaign against food poverty.

"Pockit CEO Virraj Jatania co-founded the firm in 2014 The head of online pre-paid card firm Pockit has vowed to take action after admitting more than a thousand of its customers have had accounts frozen. Virraj Jatania told Radio 4's Money Box programme that new processes would be introduced to address the failings. Pockit provides accounts to more than half a million customers that it says are typically ""financially underserved, low income, often unbanked consumers"". The UK financial regulator has said it is aware of issues with the company. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told Money Box it was engaging with Pockit to ensure the problems were being addressed as quickly as possible. Pockit allows customers to load money on to a card and then, for a price, it offers many services that a bank would - such as faster payments and direct debits. However, one Money Box listener, Sian, told the programme that her Pockit account had been locked on 9 March. The company asked her to send identification documents so they could verify her account. She sent them on the same day but the account - containing Â£1,000 - is still locked. Sian says she desperately needs access to the money to pay for her car's service and MOT. Another listener, Rob, told the programme he'd had an account with Pockit for years but it was blocked ""out of the blue"" last month. Like Sian he was asked to provide identification documents, which he did, but the account - containing Â£1,700 - remains locked. Rob says he now has debt collectors chasing him for money. Both Sian and Rob told Money Box they had been frustrated with the poor customer service they had experienced, saying it was impossible to speak to someone on the phone and that emails would often go unanswered. Pockit says its mission is to help people ""left behind by banks"" The Financial Ombudsman received 97 complaints about Pockit between January and April 2021, compared with fewer than 10 in the same period the year before. Mr Jatania told Money Box that he could not comment on specific cases but that he ""recognised that temporary blocks on accounts could be very distressing"" and he took it very seriously. He added that as Pockit operated in a regulated environment there were laws the company had to follow, and that accounts were only frozen when suspicious activity was detected and most cases were resolved quickly. Regarding the customer service concerns, he said the firm would employ more staff and that a ""live chat"" system would help to deal with customers' problems more quickly and effectively. He added that additional processes would be introduced so that if a case was not resolved within a certain timeframe, accounts would be closed down and funds returned to source. Last week, the FCA wrote to Pockit and other e-money firms to remind them that they need to adequately disclose the differences in protections between e-money accounts and bank accounts. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme protects customers when financial firms fail. It can pay compensation of up to Â£85,000 for deposits, but Pockit and other e-money firms are not covered by the scheme.

"Arlene Foster has said she will resign as NI first minister on Tuesday,instead of the end of June, if Edwin Poots changes his ministerial team. She said she worked closely with her team and ""if Edwin decides to change that then I have to go as well"". ""I can't stay with a new ministerial team over which I have no authority - that would be wrong,"" she said. However, the new Democratic Unionist Party leader insisted he was not ""pushing Arlene out"" of the party. ""That's my position and that remains my position,"" said Mr Poots. ""I'm not going to be rushed into doing anything or pushed into doing anything. Nor am I going to be denied doing something that I'm ready to do. ""So we will look at all of these issues and take a decision at a time that's appropriate for us."" Edwin Poots insisted he was not ""pushing Arlene out"" of the party On Thursday, Mr Poots denied the party is divided after tensions flared at a meeting to ratify his leadership. The party endorsed anearlier vote by MLAs and MPs to make Mr Poots leader, but it came amid anger from some quarters about how Arlene Foster was ousted as leader last month. DUP hangs out its dirty laundry in public Mr Poots' rival for the leadership, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said that one of his team had been threatened by someone from loyalist paramilitary group the UDA. It is believed the threat was made online during the leadership campaign. Police said they had ""received a complaint that a number of members of a political party had been threatened during a recent leadership campaign"". ""The full circumstances of the incident are still being established and enquiries are continuing at this time."" Mr Poots said that ""no member of my team engaged in any activities of intimidation or bullying"". On a visit to Banbridge Academy on Friday, Mrs Foster,who had been due to resign as first minister at the end of June, also confirmed she intends to leave the DUP after she steps down as first minister. She added that the new DUP leadership had shown its ""direction of travel"" and it was time for her to ""move on"". She told reporters on Friday that while she wished Mr Poots well as the new DUP leader, he must realise there is ""work to do in terms of healing the divisions in the party"". On Thursday, Mrs Foster toldBBC Newscasther departure was ""even by DUP standards, pretty brutal"". In his speech to members after the party endorsed his leadership on Thursday night, Mr Poots paid tribute to Mrs Foster as ""one of the foremost women in unionist and British politics"". Edwin Poots: Who is the new leader of the DUP? Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson - who ran against Mr Poots for the leadership - Lord Dodds, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson did not wait to hear Mr Poots' speech - they left the building. A very well-known figure in the DUP told BBC News NI it was the ""worst meeting he had attended in over 40 years as a DUP member"". After the ratification, Paul Bell, the former chairman of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP, resigned from the party. Speaking on the BBC's Evening Extra programme on Friday, Strangford MP Jim Shannon said he had not attended the meeting but had spoken to party colleagues who were there. He said there had been ""firm and robust exchanges"" of views. He denied party members left in protest before Mr Poots' speech. ""They have told me clearly that there was no walk-out last night, that the meeting ended at about 10:15,"" he said. ""They had been sitting on their backsides for two and a half hours and we (they) were going home. ""People got up to leave to go home and that was the fact of the matter.""

The new DUP leader said preparations for the next election to the Northern Ireland Assembly - due in May 2022 - have now begun. He announced that he will be appointing a director of elections ""quickly"". He said all strands of the party needed to come together. Arlene Foster told the BBC that the move to remove her had been ""pretty brutal"" Speaking of his relationship with the Irish government, Mr Poots said it was ""really, really bad"" as a consequence of how issues were dealt with relating to the Irish border during the Brexit talks. He accused it of attempting to ""starve Northern Ireland people of medicines no less, cancer drugs and other materials, such as the food that's on our table"" and took particular aim at Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, the Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) and foreign affairs minister. The new DUP leader said it was ""quite frankly disgraceful"" that the pair ""took photographs of blown up border posts to impose upon Northern Ireland people the harshest form of customs and an internal market that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world"". However, Mr Poots said he had ""respect"" for Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Also speaking outside the meeting, North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said ""leadership transfer hurts"". ""If anyone in this party can talk about difficulty, it's me. I saw what happened to my dad, it killed my father,"" he told BBC's The View. Mr Paisley's late father, Ian, the party founder, had accused his successor, Peter Robinson, and Nigel Doddsof giving him an ultimatum to leave his post. In a statement, theFermanagh and South Tyrone association of the DUP,externalsaid the removal of Mrs Foster was ""not done in our name"" and it would support her if she remained as an MLA. It said its members ""met this week to voice their disgust at the manner"" in which Mrs Foster had ""been treated over recent weeks"". After Mr Poots was ratified, Paul Bell, former chairman of the association and member for 20 years, resigned from the party. He said it will shed tens of thousands of votes under Edwin Poots and he was ""disgusted"" by the treatment of Mrs Foster. This video can not be played Paul Bell said he was leaving the party over its treatment of Arlene Foster Mr Bell told the BBC's The View programme on Thursday night that Mrs Foster had been ""stabbed in the back"". ""If the DUP cannot have respect for their own people, I don't know how they're going to have respect for people who don't agree with them,"" he said. Red Lines: Is the political landscape in for a shake-up? The party that went from firebrands to government Doug Beattie: Who is the new leader of the UUP? In an interview with BBC Newscast earlier on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the move against her and the manner in which it was carried out was ""not particularly pleasant"".
