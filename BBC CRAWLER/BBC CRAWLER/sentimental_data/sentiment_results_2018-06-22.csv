"This video can not be played How British is a Mini? The car giant BMW has followed plane-maker Airbus in warning about the consequences of Brexit uncertainty. BMW UK boss Ian Robertson says clarity is needed by the end of the summer. BMW makes the Mini and Rolls Royce and employs about 8,000 people in the UK. Earlier,Airbus, which employs 14,000 people in the UK, warned it could leaveif the UK exits the single market and customs union with no transition deal. The UK government says it is confident of getting a good deal for industry. The customs union brings together the EU's 28 members in a duty-free area, in which they pay the same rate of duty on non-EU goods. Brexit: All you need to know Stay in customs union, says Siemens boss CBI chief: Industry sectors face extinction Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out staying in the customs union. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. By Simon Jack, BBC business editor It has been a source of exasperation for some cabinet members that although many companies have privately expressed concern - even alarm - at the progress of the Brexit negotiations, they have been reluctant to make their fears public, and have even dialled down the shrillness of their warnings when meeting the prime minister in person. Airbus's decision to warn that future investment in their operations in the UK is under review, while not exactly welcome, is therefore considered by some in government as an honest and helpful declaration of what's at stake for UK workers and the wider economy. Prominent Brexit supporter Sir Bernard Jenkin described Airbus's comments as the kind of ""speculation"" seen before, during and after the referendum from large companies. But Airbus's UK boss, Katherine Bennett, told the BBC: ""This is not project fear, this is dawning reality."" Mr Robertson said he needed to know what the government's preferred position was on customs and trade within months or his company - and the UK's - competitive position could be harmed. ""If we don't get clarity in the next couple of months we have to start making those contingency plans...  which means making the UK less competitive than it is in a very competitive world right now,"" he said. ""That is a decisive issue that ultimately could damage this industry."" BMW has previously warned about the damage of Brexit uncertainty, and in May chief executive Harald Krueger said the company had to remain ""flexible"" about production facilities. Airbus,in its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday,external, said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". Airbus makes wings for the A380 and other models in the UK The European plane-maker said the warning was not part of ""project fear"", but was a ""dawning reality"". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said any warning from any major company was taken seriously, but stressed that ""we genuinely expect to have a sensible partnership"" with the EU that was mutually beneficial. He said there had been a large number of investment announcements in the UK over the last 18 months. Security minister Ben Wallace stressed in a tweet the importance of UK military contracts to the plane-maker. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The A400m Atlas transport plane is in service with the RAF. Former director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce John Longworth, who co-chairs Leave Means Leave, said Airbus had given similar warnings years ago. ""They've also said that they're quite prepared to move production to places like China, which is not even in the European Union,"" he told the BBC. ""So how can that possibly be anything to do with Brexit?"" Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said ministers needed to listen to the concerns of businesses and ""get a grip"" on the Brexit negotiations. ""The government's reckless decision to keep no deal on the table and to rule out a customs union or strong single market deal after Brexit is putting jobs and the economy at risk,"" he said.

The company, which makes wings for the A320, A330, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK, also said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result, it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK. Between 2012 and 2015, BMW Group invested Â£750m to upgrade manufacturing sites in Oxford, Hams Hall and Swindon. The company also has its Goodwood manufacturing plant in West Sussex, a UK sales and marketing subsidiary in Farnborough and a vehicle distribution centre in Thorne. The government said it was confident of securing a good deal with the EU that was ""mutually beneficial"". ""We've always been clear that we want free and frictionless trade with our European neighbours,"" a statement said. ""The UK automotive industry remains one of our great success stories and a whole host of companies have recently committed to invest billions of pounds in the sector.""

"Anti-Brexit campaigners are preparing to march to Parliament Square Senior Cabinet ministers have insisted the UK is prepared to walk away from Brexit talks without a deal, on the second anniversary of the referendum. Liam Fox said Theresa May was ""not bluffing"" over her threat to quit negotiations, while Boris Johnson called for a ""full British Brexit"". It comes as anti-Brexit campaigners, who want the public to have the final say on the UK's departure, prepare to march in London later. They say Brexit is ""not a done deal"". Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: Will there be a Brexit dividend? Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? People's Vote - which wants a referendum on any exit deal - said people must make their ""voices heard"" about the ""damage"" of leaving next year without agreement. Speakers at the demo will include actor Sir Tony Robinson and campaigner Gina Miller, who fought a successful legal battle last year to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament. The UK voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1% in a referendum held on 23 June 2016. This video can not be played Liam Fox says Theresa May is not bluffing over no-deal Brexit The UK is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU. But the People's Vote campaign says this should happen only if the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mrs May and the other 27 EU members is approved in another public vote. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC it was in the interests of both sides to have a deal - but it was ""essential"" the EU understood that the UK could walk away if the terms offered were not good enough. ""The prime minister has always said no deal is better than a bad deal,"" Mr Fox said in an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, which was recorded on Wednesday - beforeFriday's warning from Airbusthat it might cease manufacturing in the UK in such a scenario. ""It is essential as we enter the next phase of the negotiations that the EU understands that and believes it... I think our negotiating partners would not be wise if they thought our PM was bluffing."" Meanwhile,Brexit Secretary David Davis told the Daily Express,externalthe prime minister was going to get a ""good deal"" from Brussels and Brexit was going to be ""fantastic"". ""The best option is leaving with a good deal but you've got to be able to walk away from the table,"" he said. Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Why is Brexit taking so long? Andwriting in the Sun, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson,externalwarned the prime minister not to allow ""bog roll Brexit"" that is ""soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long"" - calling for a ""full British Brexit"" instead. Mr Johnson said people ""just want us to get on with it"". By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Two years on from the referendum, there are two very different messages today. One is that Brexit is not a ""done deal"". That's the argument from the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable who will take part in a march in central London today. On the other side, there is optimism and defiance from key Brexiteers like Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson says the UK is confident and open. The government firmly opposes a vote on the final deal - Mr Johnson believes people want the government to just get on with it. Nine months before the UK is due to officially leave the EU, there are still very different visions. Labour said Mr Fox's comments about a no-deal Brexit were the ""height of irresponsibility"". ""The next time Liam Fox parrots the slogan no deal is better than a bad deal he should give some thought to the 14,000 people who work for Airbus, and the thousands of other people who have jobs dependent on trade with Europe,"" said shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman. Both the prime minister and Labour leader have rejected calls for another public vote, saying the will of the people expressed in the 2016 ballot was clear, although many Labour MPs now want another referendum. Organisers of Saturday's demo say people ""from all walks of life"" will be present, demonstrating the ""growing popular demand"" for another vote. Beginning in Pall Mall and ending outside the Houses of Parliament, the protest is part of a ""summer of action"" by campaign groups designed to increase pressure on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. This video can not be played Anti-Brexit campaigner Femi Oluwole wants the Labour leader to back calls for a referendum on the final deal By taking the UK out of the EU's single market and customs union, they say the Conservative government ""remains intent"" on a so-called hard Brexit that will - they say - destroy jobs and damage public services. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, who will be at the march, told BBC Breakfast: ""I think the public in general... do see there is a mess."" He added: ""We've only got a year to go. And I think for the big companies that employ hundreds of thousands of workers in the UK... they want some clarity about what the trading relationships will be and there is absolutely none whatever."" But Conservative MP Peter Bone - who supports Brexit - said if there were a second vote, the leave campaign would win again. ""The vast, vast majority of people, whether they are Leavers or Remainers, just want us to get on and come out this dreadful European Union super-state,"" he said. ""There were 17.4 million people that voted for leave and if there are a few thousand in London complaining about it - that doesn't seem to really make much difference."" The government is giving Parliament a vote on the final deal, if one is reached, in the autumn - but it remains unclear what will happen if they reject it.

"It's been more than two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and the negotiations, pronouncements and progress reports seem never-ending. So while there's just over six months until Brexit day, with a 21-month transition period after that, we ask why does it seem to be taking sooo long?  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

"This video can not be played Adam Fleming's Brexit HQ quiz I call it ""Green Day"". At a press conference in March the Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier unveiled a slideshow of the Brexit Treaty, with the sections agreed by both sides highlighted green. It amounted to roughly 75-80% of the129-page document,externalthat will seal the terms of the UK's departure from the EU and which is officially called the ""Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom"". The UK says the deadline for settling the outstanding issues is October, when the agreement will be submitted to the European Parliament. Mr Barnier wants progress on these issues in time for an EU summit on 28 June. Here is what's left to discuss: Both sides have committed to avoid infrastructure on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Brussels has proposed a protocol - nicknamed ""the backstop"" - which would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. It's described as an insurance policy in case no other solutions are found. How many Brexit deals will there be? The customs options Britain agrees to the need for a backstop but says this version risks barriers being created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and so wants an alternative. This video can not be played Technology can streamline EU borders but they are not frictionless. Known in the trade as ""governance"" this is an item that sounds boring but which Michel Barnier says could bring the whole deal down: how to solve disputes between the UK and the EU arising as a result of the treaty? The EU has proposed a Joint Committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice. The UK government likes the idea of ""J-Com"" but not of judges in Luxembourg having the final say. A complicated compromise to oversee the governance of the citizens' rights part of the deal hasD been agreed, though. Then there is a swathe of subjects known as Other Separation Issues (OSI's). Kuenssberg: Is there another Brexit way for May? The EU is proud of its rules that protect regional products so that champagne can only come from Champagne, Manchego cheese can only come from La Mancha, Cornish pasties from Cornwall. Brussels wants this system written into British domestic law. The Brits agree with the concept but aren't sure about the method and want to ensure it applies to British products in the EU too. Some in the food and drink industry suspect some ministers view this as a measure to protect European industries that would limit the UK's room for manoeuvre in future trade talks with other countries. There are still disagreements about how both sides will work together on on-going police and judicial matters. For example, the EU says that the European Court of Justice should be able to pass judgements that have an effect in the UK after the end of the transition period in cases where events occurred before the end of the transition period. On security, the UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away. Brexit: All you need to know The EU wants the European laws that are mentioned in the Brexit Treaty to continue to apply in the UK in the way they do now. This is the legal concept of ""direct effect"" which is at the heart of the argument over the supremacy of EU law. The UK government has agreed to write the Withdrawal Agreement into domestic legislation but is still working on the details of how to do this, before it's voted on by MPs. Remember the huge political row in Summer 2016 over the UK's departure from the EU's nuclear energy watchdog Euratom? Most issues related to it have been settled, apart from who will own certain radioactive material that remains in the UK - Britain or the EU countries where it originated? The signals are that a deal is close on this highly technical matter. UK and EU agree terms for Brexit transition period British companies hold all sorts of personal data belonging to EU citizens, and the European Commission thinks that European data protection law should continue to apply to it after Brexit. The UK would like a comprehensive deal on data sharing with the EU as part of the discussions about the future relationship, and is wary of agreeing divorce-related measures that could tie its hands. There's a section about how to handle government tenders for goods and services which will be underway during the Brexit process - so called ""public procurement"". Think new British passports being made by a Franco-Dutch firm. Most of it has been agreed, but one jargon-filled paragraph stands out as unresolved. It concerns the rule which says new contracts should be open to companies across the EU. Public procurement lawyers suspect the UK is waiting for a guarantee that British firms will be able to bid for European government business if British contracts remain open to their continental competitors. The EU wants the UK to share customs data for three years after the end of the transition period, and information about certain taxes for five years after the end of the transition period. And there are some other unresolved technical issues scattered throughout the document that test the knowledge of even the most seasoned Brexit geek. But small details could have a big effect because the whole lot has to be agreed for the deal to be signed off. What happens now that a deal's been done?

"The case against John Leslie was found not proven at Edinburgh Sheriff Court Former television presenter John Leslie has been cleared of sexually assaulting a woman who was celebrating her hen night in Edinburgh. Mr Leslie had been accused of putting his hand down the back of the woman's trousers while the pair were dancing in the Attik nightclub last June. The 53-year-old denied the allegation and after a two-day trial a sheriff found the case against him not proven. Mr Leslie told Edinburgh Sheriff Court he had acted like a perfect gentlemen. Giving evidence at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott, he had described dancing with the woman. He said he then made his excuses and wished her well when the song finished. Mr Leslie, who used to present children's TV show Blue Peter in the late 1980s, told the court that half an hour later a nightclub steward told him an allegation had been made against him. The incident was alleged to have happened at the Atik nightclub in Edinburgh Asked by the prosecution if he thought he was untouchable that night Mr Leslie replied ""I did not put my hands down her trousers. It's something I would never do. It's something I would never have done. I'm upset at the allegation."" Earlier, a nightclub DJ and friend of Mr Leslie, Nicholas Mowat, gave evidence. Mr Mowat, 50, who said he had been friends with Mr Leslie since high school, said he saw Mr Leslie dancing ballroom-style with the woman in the club. He said: ""John was just pirouetting. John had his hands on the back of the bride and he was a perfect gentleman, dancing around the dance floor as normal. ""I didn't see any signs of her being distressed with him or being anxious to get away from him in any way."" Former television presenter John Leslie appeared under his real name of John Stott The witness insisted he had a good view of the dancefloor from his elevated DJ booth and said that when the song ended, Mr Leslie kissed the woman on the cheek and walked off. He added: ""I wasn't 100% on them, but I would have noticed if there was some problem or if I needed to call a door steward over, which I never saw at all."" The court also heard from the bride-to-be's friend, who said that the way that Mr Leslie was touching her friend was ""inappropriate"" and that she had looked ""scared"". She said: ""They were dancing and I could see he had his hand on her lower back, which I felt was inappropriate. ""I would have felt uncomfortable if it was me. ""The next time I looked up, I couldn't see his hand any more. I could only see the top of his wrist. It was at the top of her tutu. ""At this point she looked scared."" The woman said she cut in between the pair and danced with her friend, who initially said that she was fine, but then started crying and later reported the incident to police. Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, the witness denied having any prejudices against Mr Leslie, and said she did not know who he was. Questioned about whether or not the position of his hand was appropriate for a ballroom dance-style hold, the witness said: ""I don't think it is appropriate for hands to be placed on lower backs. ""I knew that my friend was about to get married and I didn't think that dancing with this person - the way he had his hand on her - I didn't think it was appropriate."" On Monday,the court heard from the bride-to-be, who said Mr Leslie had put his hand down her trousers at the back while they were dancing and that she had nothing to gain from making up the allegations.

"The newly-weds travelled to Wardhill Castle in an old Land Rover Defender Game of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie have married at a ceremony in Aberdeenshire. The couple - who played on-screen lovers Jon Snow and Ygritte - met on the fantasy show in 2012. Guests lined the path outside Rayne Church, near Inverurie, showering the newly-weds with flower petal confetti. The couple then got into an old Land Rover decorated with paper hearts and tin cans as they drove to the reception at nearby Wardhill Castle. The guests included fellow Game of Thrones stars Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and Emilia Clarke. Rose Leslie arrived at the church with her father Earlier the bride and groom, Harington dressed in a morning suit and the bride in a flowing ivory dress and veil, had greeted dozens of fans and other wellwishers. The reception was held in the grounds of Wardhill Castle, which is owned by the actress's father, Seb Leslie. The couple are holding their reception at Wardhill Castle in Aberdeenshire Theengagementwas announced last September. The actress grew up in Aberdeenshire before moving to London to pursue her career. Meet Game of Thrones' woman of weapons The couple have often been seen together in the north east of Scotland.

"The building on fire is the Somers Town Coffee House A large fire has broken out at a pub near three major railway stations in central London. The London Fire Brigade said it was called to a blaze in Chalton Street, a few hundred metres from Euston, King's Cross and St Pancras, at 20:06 BST. Witnesses reported seeing flames and plumes of smoke coming from the pub called the Somers Town Coffee House. There were at least 72 firefighters tackling the blaze at one stage, the brigade said. This video can not be played Video credit: Thomas Looney Half of the roof and part of the first floor was alight, it added. The fire was under control by 21:28.

"Blue Planet, presented by Sir David Attenborough, first aired in 2001 with sequel Blue Planet II becoming the most-watched television programme of 2017 Viewers captivated by wildlife documentaries like Blue Planet II are increasingly disturbing coastal wildlife, conservationists claim.

"Meliha Kaya was speeding in a 30mph zone when she crashed her Mini A young woman who caused the death of her 16-year-old sister in a car crash has been spared jail after a court heard she had been tortured by guilt. Student Meliha Kaya, 22, smashed into a tree while speeding as she drove her sister Elif and a friend back from a pub in Wanstead, east London. Kaya, of Woodford, east London,had admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving. She has been given suspended sentences and is banned from driving. Judge Wendy Joseph QC told the court: ""This defendant killed her sister and nothing she can ever do will repair that loss to herself and her family. ""I hope that she will do what she can to lead the sort of life her sister will have wished she would have been able to achieve, for both of them. ""I accept the grief she has been suffering is incalculable. No sentence I can impose can punish her as much as this."" The death has left Kaya ""wracked with guilt and blame over and above any criminal responsibility she may bear"", according to her lawyer Gudrun Young. Ms Young added: ""They were best friends as well as sisters. ""[Kaya] has felt fully responsible for her sister's death from the beginning. She has spent the last two years tortured by knowing that she has caused her own sister's death.""

"Almost two-thirds of drivers are unaware of the punishment for using mobile phones at the wheel, more than 12 months after the introduction of tougher laws, a poll has found. The RAC found only 36% of the 2,000 UK motorists quizzed knew offenders face six penalty points and a Â£200 fine. Some 41% believed more visible law enforcement is needed, and 22% advocated stronger penalties. The punishment was doubled from three penalty points and Â£100 last year. This made it enough to ban those with less than two years' experience. To get back behind the wheel, these offenders have to retake both the theory and practical parts of the driving test. The new rules apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Hundreds of new drivers banned for phone use New drivers found texting to lose licence Some readers who contacted the BBC said there needed to be more publicity about the tougher laws, while others said they weren't enforced strongly enough. Martin Tillbrook, from Bracknell, said: ""Firstly, the penalties are not widely enough publicised. Why not put roadside signs up to remind people? ""Secondly, it just isn't enforced at all."" David Lee, from Carmarthenshire, said: ""Around here it is common to see drivers chatting on their phones as they pass - everyday I see at least one. ""People do not judge the risks of an accident, they judge the risk of being caught."" Jeff, from Nottingham, said: ""The awareness and advertising of these penalties is poor and there should be a better TV/radio advertising campaign."" 'Epidemic' of drivers using mobiles What you can and can't do when you're driving When the new penalties were introduced, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said they would ""act as a strong deterrent"" to mobile phone users. Department for Transport figures showed 780 people were injured in accidents in 2016 when a driver was distracted or impaired by their phone - up 10% on the previous year. In the poll, 18% of drivers backed the blocking of mobile signals within cars. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said the law around hand-held phone use by drivers ""could not be clearer"". ""Yet every year there are dozens of fatal crashes caused by motorists who have allowed themselves to be distracted by their phone,"" he said. ""There remains a hard core of drivers who continue to ignore the law and all the risks associated with hand-held phone use."" Figures obtained by BBC Radio 5 Live last year revealed that290 new UK drivers were disqualifiedin the first six months since the change. In Northern Ireland, motorists caught using a hand-held phone while driving face a Â£60 fine and three penalty points. A public consultation ona government proposal to increase this penaltyclosed last month.

"Baron Empain led one of France's top industrial groups in the 1970s A French-Belgian industrialist who was the victim of one of France's most notorious kidnappings has died aged 80. In 1978 Baron Edouard-Jean Empain, then head of the Schneider Group, was seized at gunpoint from his chauffeur-driven car near his home in Paris. He was held for 63 days, chained in darkness, starved, and beaten. The case grabbed attention when the kidnappers cut off his fingertip and threatened further mutilation unless his family paid a huge ransom. Baron Empain was 40 at the time, and one of France's leading captains of industry. His Schneider group comprised some 300 companies and employed 150,000 people worldwide. He was the grandson of Edouard Empain, who had been ennobled by the King of the Belgians after building an industrial empire in the late 19th Century. In January 1978 armed men stopped his car on Avenue Foch, in Paris' wealthy 16th arrondissement. The chauffeur was bundled into a van - and quickly released- while kidnappers took the baron away in his car. There was initial speculation that he had been targeted by one of the left-wing militant groups that were seizing prominent industrialists across Europe at the time. But it quickly emerged that the abductors' motive was old-fashioned extortion. They contacted the family demanding 80m francs - the equivalent of about 50m euros (Â£45m) in today's money. The ransom note came with a packet containing the baron's left little finger. As kidnappings - both criminal and political - were becoming increasingly frequent, police decided to set an example, and vetoed plans by the family to pay up. Instead, they lured the kidnappers to a rendezvous point. But the ambush was botched and the ensuing shootout left two officers wounded. One the abductors was killed and another was captured, but the baron was still chained up in a hideaway in a Paris suburb. The baron's Peugeot 604 was found in an underground car park in western Paris The detained kidnapper, Alain Caillol, convinced his accomplices to release their captive. Two days later the baron was found wandering the streets south of Paris, disorientated and emaciated - with a 10-franc note his captors had given him to get home. Caillol later said they had experienced ""Stockholm syndrome in reverse"" - where the kidnappers end up sympathising with their victim. ""He dominated us morally. Everyone saw in him the dream of what he wanted to be: handsome, rich, powerful, intelligent,"" Caillol told APF news agency in 2012. After serving his jail sentence, Caillol sought out Empain to ask for forgiveness. He was not the only one to feel sorry over the baron's ordeal. During the investigation, police had to delve into his private life to look for possible clues. As a result, his infidelities and gambling sprees became widely known. Public sympathy for him was limited and his wife divorced him shortly after his release. Empain was left bitter, feeling people had turned against him. He eventually withdrew from business life. ""He was a completely broken man,"" one of the investigators recently told France Info radio. ""It was terrible that he suffered so much for a few peccadilloes, while he himself showed impeccable virtue. He forgave his kidnappers... Even though he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, I felt he was hard-done by.""

"The two ships work for the German NGO Mission Lifeline Italy has attacked Malta  for refusing to take in a ship of migrants. Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli shared a photo of an email by the Maltese Armed Forces saying  the vessel ""has not manifested any distress"". Mr Toninelli called the decision (in Italian) ""inhumane"" and ""absurd"".,external The Lifeline, carrying 226 migrants rescued from the sea near the Libyan coast, is one of two ships operated by German NGO Mission Lifeline that the Italians have vowed to impound. They are accused of ""illegally"" flying the Dutch flag. Italy's new right-wing government has taken a harder stance on rescue ships bringing large numbers of migrants to Italy, which is often the nearest port for those rescued off coast of Libya. Mr Toninelli said earlier the ship had broken the law by taking the migrants, even though the Libyan coastguard had already intervened to rescue them. He said Italy would seize both the Lifeline and the Seefuchs to determine their legal status, and added that Italy would ""once again save the migrants"". Who is responsible for migrants at sea? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? Italy's new far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini initially said in a post on Facebook that the two NGO ships should ""go to Holland"", as it was said to be flying under a Dutch flag, and should not dock in Italy. Whether or not the ship is Dutch is the subject of some debate. The Dutch delegation to the EU said in a tweet that the ships were not registered in the Netherlands, and not flying under its flag. Mission Lifeline, however, later posted an image on Twitter of a registration document,externalit says proves the ships sail under the Dutch flag. The group also tweeted that it had carried out another rescue overnight, though it is not clear how many additional migrants, if any, boarded their ship. Allow Twitter content?

The NGO's co-founder, Axel Steier, denied breaking any laws and defended his organisation's actions. ""In this situation you can't wait,"" he said. ""If you have a rescue you prevent people from dying, from drowning and then you have to make the decisions. You can't wait until someone has a port for you - you have to act immediately."" The planned seizure of the Lifeline and Seefuchs comes amid a deepening row over migrant rescues after Italy's new populist government refused earlier this month to take in a stranded rescue ship carrying 630 migrants. The Aquarius eventually sailed to Spainafter it was also turned away by Malta. It has now resumed its operations at sea. This video can not be played After a week of being in the political spotlight, the rescue ship Aquarius is back at sea French President Emmanuel Macron has accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the Aquarius dock. Then on Thursday, without referring directly to Italy, Mr Macron attacked the ""leprosy"" of anti-EU feeling among ""friends and neighbours"". Mr Salvini hit back at the French president.

"The two ships work for the German NGO Mission Lifeline Italy has attacked Malta  for refusing to take in a ship of migrants. Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli shared a photo of an email by the Maltese Armed Forces saying  the vessel ""has not manifested any distress"". Mr Toninelli called the decision (in Italian) ""inhumane"" and ""absurd"".,external The Lifeline, carrying 226 migrants rescued from the sea near the Libyan coast, is one of two ships operated by German NGO Mission Lifeline that the Italians have vowed to impound. They are accused of ""illegally"" flying the Dutch flag. Italy's new right-wing government has taken a harder stance on rescue ships bringing large numbers of migrants to Italy, which is often the nearest port for those rescued off coast of Libya. Mr Toninelli said earlier the ship had broken the law by taking the migrants, even though the Libyan coastguard had already intervened to rescue them. He said Italy would seize both the Lifeline and the Seefuchs to determine their legal status, and added that Italy would ""once again save the migrants"". Who is responsible for migrants at sea? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? Italy's new far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini initially said in a post on Facebook that the two NGO ships should ""go to Holland"", as it was said to be flying under a Dutch flag, and should not dock in Italy. Whether or not the ship is Dutch is the subject of some debate. The Dutch delegation to the EU said in a tweet that the ships were not registered in the Netherlands, and not flying under its flag. Mission Lifeline, however, later posted an image on Twitter of a registration document,externalit says proves the ships sail under the Dutch flag. The group also tweeted that it had carried out another rescue overnight, though it is not clear how many additional migrants, if any, boarded their ship. Allow Twitter content?

""If you have a rescue you prevent people from dying, from drowning and then you have to make the decisions. You can't wait until someone has a port for you - you have to act immediately."" The planned seizure of the Lifeline and Seefuchs comes amid a deepening row over migrant rescues after Italy's new populist government refused earlier this month to take in a stranded rescue ship carrying 630 migrants. The Aquarius eventually sailed to Spainafter it was also turned away by Malta. It has now resumed its operations at sea. This video can not be played After a week of being in the political spotlight, the rescue ship Aquarius is back at sea French President Emmanuel Macron has accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the Aquarius dock.

"A typical menu for students at St Paul's Girls' School includes herb-crusted salmon and duck leg confit A private girls' school in west London has been criticised for holding an ""Austerity Day"" where pupils ate potatoes and fruit for lunch. St Paul's Girls' School, which has fees of Â£7,978 per term, said serving pupils ""simple"" food helps them learn about ""less fortunate"" people. Henna Shah, who attended the school on a bursary, said the event made her ""uncomfortable"". Campaigners said it showed a ""complete lack of understanding"" of poverty. The school, where a typical menu for students includes herb-crusted salmon and duck leg confit, posted about the event on Twitter on Wednesday. Ms Shahtook a screenshot of the post before it was deleted,external. It said said: ""Today was the final Austerity Day of the year. Students and staff had baked potatoes with beans and coleslaw for lunch, with fruit for dessert. The money saved will be donated to the school's charities."" Photos accompanying the post included a poster for Austerity Day, showing a waiter lifting a silver cloche with three peas underneath it. The school posted on Twitter about an Austerity Day held on Wednesday Ms Shah, 24, attended St Paul's from the ages of 11 to 18. She was the first of her family to go to university when she left the school for Oxford University in 2012. ""Austerity lunch is what we ate at home. It's having to eat a jacket potatoes every day, not having one once a term,"" she said. Ms Shah, from Hounslow, said raising awareness for people living in poverty was ""great"", but that the problem was using the word ""austerity"". Food blogger Jack Monroe said the school's event was flawed because austerity is ""not a hunger game"" A spokeswoman for St Paul's told the BBC: ""For many years, St Paul's has arranged regular lunches when simple food is served and the money saved given to local charities. ""The aim is also to raise the awareness of our students to those less fortunate than themselves. ""The choice of the word 'austerity' is to draw attention to the fact that others around them are facing significant economic difficulties."" The school refused to explain why the post had been deleted. Jack Monroe, a campaigner and author renowned for blogging about cooking for a family on a shoestring budget, told the BBC the stunt was ""enormously patronising"". ""I'm not outraged, I'm more saddened. They probably feel they are doing something good by playing at being poor,"" Monroe said. ""An austerity lunch is really no lunch at all. ""I do not know anyone who lives in poverty who can afford to turn their oven on for two hours to cook a jacket potato."" Jane Middleton, a mature student researching food poverty as part of her MA dissertation, said the school's ""austerity lunch"" was inaccurate. ""People who go to food banks cannot afford fresh food, they get given cans,"" she said. ""It's shades of Marie Antoinette really - just a complete lack of understanding as to what it means to be in poverty.""

"Campaigner Christie Elan-Cane lost their High Court challenge A campaigner has lost a High Court challenge calling on the government to provide gender-neutral passports. Christie Elan-Cane wants passports to have an ""X"" category, which could be used by those who consider themselves neither fully male nor female. The campaigner claimed the UK's passport process was ""inherently discriminatory"". High Court judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker refused to rule the government policy as unlawful. 'Why I want gender-neutral UK passports' How do you legally change gender? UK should 'degender' passports - MP Currently, all UK passport holders have to specify whether they are male or female. Speaking after the ruling, Christie Elan-Cane, who has fought on the issue since 1995, said they were ""bitterly disappointed"" and that non-gendered people are ""socially invisible"" and being ""denied civil rights"". ""I was not seeking special treatment. I was seeking to be treated as a human being."" Christie Elan-Canepreviously said it is a ""basic human right to have your identity"". The campaignertold the Women and Equalities Committee,externalthat being non-gendered was ""not a lifestyle choice"" and ""incredibly frustrating"". In the High Court hearing in April,  Christie Elan-Cane's lawyer, Kate Gallafent, claimed the policy breaches two articles of the European Convention on Human Rights: the right to respect for private life and the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of gender or sex. But the Home Office made submissions to the court that the case should be dismissed. James Eadie, acting for the home secretary, said the policy maintains an ""administratively coherent system for the recognition of gender"" and ensures security at national borders. The ""X"" stands for unspecified for people who do not identify as male or female. Last year, Canada became the latest country to offer citizens gender-neutral travel documents. Australia,Denmark, Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, India and Nepal already have a third category. The International Civil Aviation Organisation - the UN agency in charge of air travel - also recognises the ""X"" option. And, in what could be the first case in the world, in 2017a Canadian baby was issued a health cardwithout a gender marker. In his comments, the judge stressed his conclusion was reached on current evidence, adding: ""It will be necessary for the government to consider to what extent if any, in an age of increasing social and legal awareness and acceptance of the importance of issues relating to diversity and equality, the recording of an individual's sex and/or gender in official and other documentation is justified."" LGBT charity Stonewall said the decision was ""disappointing"", saying that ""many trans people are afraid to travel abroad for fear of intrusive questioning or difficulties at passport control"". ""Non-binary people are also not recognised under law, and it's unclear whether they are protected by anti-discrimination legislation,"" said Laura Russell, Stonewall's head of policy. MP Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee,has previously said a person's gender was ""not relevant""on passports and driving licences and does not assist with identification. The High Court ruling comes as the UK governmentprepares to launch a consultation,externalon the Gender Recognition Act 2004, to consider plans to make the process of changing legal gender easier. Currently, to change gender people must have lived for two years in their preferred gender and must be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a condition where a person's biological sex and identity do not match. They can then apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate. People can change their gender on documentation including passports and driving licences - but there is no option to identify as non-binary. Christie Elan-Cane said they cannot comment on whether they will lodge an appeal to the High Court decision.

"Khawla Barghouthi admitted failing to alert the authorities to her friend's terrorist plan A woman who witnessed her friend preparing to carry out the first female-led terrorist attack in the UK has been jailed for 28 months. Khawla Barghouthi also faces deportation to Tunisia after admitting failing to alert the authorities to Rizlaine Boular's plan. An Old Bailey judge told Barghouthi, 21, there was no doubt her friend would have gone ahead with the attack. Boular,her motherandher sisterhave all been convicted. In April 2017, specialist counter-terrorism armed officers raided Barghouthi's north-west London home, hours after a bugged conversation revealed that her friend Rizlaine Boular was inside and practising wielding a knife for an attack. The radicalisation of Safaa Boular What the sisters said to each other Mother and daughter jailed for terror plot The recordings revealed that Boular was preparing to attack people in the Westminster area, apparently egged on by her younger sister and mother. She told Barghouthi that she preferred to attack women or a single man because of the risk she would be overpowered by a group of men - and then the pair laughed at the possibility of the attack being a ""flop"". Barghouthi said: ""That would be the worst thing that could ever happen - like you start a terrorist thing and then you stall."" Mina Dich (left) and her daughter Rizlaine Boular, have both been jailed for terror offences Videos from the Isis terrorism group, celebrating other attacks, were also downloaded onto Barghouthi's phone during the hours the two women were together. In a statement to the court, Barghouthi said she never believed her friend was actually going to do anything. ""When I read the transcript I was horrified how it sounds,"" she said. ""What I can say, at the time it was extravagant talk and very stupid fooling around."" But Judge Mark Dennis QC said: ""There was a growing awareness over a number of days of the nature of the attack by Rizlaine Boular. ""There is no reason, in my view, to doubt that Rizlaine Boular intended to carry out her violent action, even at the cost of her own life."" Safaa Boular, 18, is the youngest woman in the UK to be convicted of preparing a terrorist attack Barghouthi was initially charged with preparing an act of terrorism - but her later plea of guilty to the lesser charge of failing to notify the authorities was accepted by prosecutors. Rizlaine Boular and her mother Mina Dich have already been jailed for preparing an act of terrorism. Rizlaine Boular's younger sister, Safaa Boular, 18, also convicted, is yet to be sentenced. Safaa Boular became the youngest woman in the UK to be convicted of preparing a terrorism attack which had been encouraged by a fighter in Syria.

"Donald Trump and Angela Merkel in 2017 Shares in European carmakers took a hit on Friday, after US President Donald Trump redoubled his threats of tariffs against their cars. Mr Trump tweeted that the US would place a 20% import tax on European cars, if the EU's ""tariffs and barriers are not broken down soon and removed"". Shares in BMW, Daimler, Porsche and Volkswagen each dropped more than 1%, before regaining ground. Mr Trump's comment came amid a US national security probe of car imports. Mr Trump launched the investigation last month, ordering the Commerce Department to determine if car imports are a risk to national security. The US followed a similar process for the steel and aluminium industry, which led it to impose tariffs on the foreign metals this spring. The EU, China, Mexico, Canada and India are among the places that have plans to retaliate or have already done so. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The decision to expand the Trump administration's trade disputes to foreign car manufacturers has come under fire from some in the US Congress, as well as many business lobby groups. At a hearing this week, Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, said he was ""stunned"" that the Trump administration was investigating the national security risk of vehicle imports, which is estimated to affect about $200bn worth of imports. He said the probe alienates allies and tariffs would lead to job losses and increased costs in the US. This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us? US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross assured the congressional panel that there has been ""no decision"" made about whether to recommend tariffs. ""We're in the early stages of the process,"" he said. He said Thursday that the Commerce Department hopes to complete the investigation by the end of July or August. The EU sent almost $50bn in vehicles and auto parts to the US last year, with roughly half coming from Germany. Cars from the UK accounted for about $9bn, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. The organisation estimates that a 25% tariff on foreign vehicles and parts for them,  assuming the US does not grant exemptions to some countries, would lead to the loss of about 195,000 jobs in the US. Shares in major European car companies were already on edge due to trade tensions. Daimler earlier this week warned that it expects lower sales of Mercedes-Benz cars due to a tax on the import of US vehicles into China.

The Ford Focus driver was stopped on a section of the A421 near Bedford at about 21:10 BST on Thursday. Police posted an image of the speed gun display on Twitter after the man was arrested. Officers said it was a ""miracle"" the motorist, who was initially found to be over the legal alcohol limit, ""didn't kill himself or someone else"". Once in custody, officers said, he was found to be under the limit, but will face action for a speeding offence.

"Creditors have backed department store chain House of Fraser's plans to close more than half its stores. High Street landlords were unhappy with the plan as they will have to shoulder the burden of financial losses, but they were outvoted. The retailer will now go ahead and shut 31 of its 59 shops nationwide, and also impose huge rent cuts on 10 others that it intends to keep. Up to 6,000 jobs are set to go as a result of the store closures. The vote was seen as a make-or-break moment for the 169-year-old business. If the rescue plan had failed, administration was likely. Why is House of Fraser failing? Why we no longer love department stores In all, 2,000 House of Fraser jobs are set to go, along with 4,000 brand and concession roles. The stores scheduled for closure, which include its flagship London Oxford Street store, will stay open until early 2019, House of Fraser has said. In May, House of Fraser's Chinese owners, Nanjing Cenbest, reached a conditional agreement to sell a 51% stake to the Chinese owner of Hamley's, C.banner. The sale was conditional on the restructuring plan being approved. ""Following the restructuring, House of Fraser will have a more sustainable cost base and a platform for future growth to deliver an improved customer proposition,"" the company said in a statement.

CVAs are being increasingly used by struggling retailers as a way to close stores, but House of Fraser's has been the most contentious restructuring deal to date. Landlords argue that CVAs are being abused as a quick way to cut rents and want the government to launch an urgent review into them. In order to be enacted, CVAs have to be approved by 75% of unsecured creditors, but landlords' voting power is reduced because of the way in which insolvency rules are applied. House of Fraser chief executive Alex Williamson said: ""The CVA proposals have been approved by our creditors and we are grateful for their ongoing support and belief in the future of House of Fraser. ""This was clearly a difficult decision to take but is, ultimately, the only one to secure our future. ""Our focus is on supporting all of our affected colleagues and we are exploring every opportunity available to them, working alongside the Retail Trust and the wider retail community."" Mark Fry of Begbies Traynor and Charlotte Coates of JLL, who had been advising a group of the affected landlords, said: ""It is disappointing that the CVA has been agreed without proper engagement with the landlords, many of whom manage the pensions and investments of the man in the street, despite them having so much at stake through the process. ""However, with landlords' voting power reduced by an arbitrary 75% of the value of their already discounted claims, the odds were always stacked against them. ""The landlords now have a 28-day window to consider whether to make a legal challenge against the process and will be looking at their options closely."" High Street retailers have been facing a harsh climate this year amid falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping.

"Airbus has warned it could leave the UK if it exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal. The European planemaker said the warning was not part of ""project fear"", but was a ""dawning reality"". Airbus employs 14,000 people at 25 sites in the UK - around half in Wales. The UK government said it was confident of getting a good deal for all industries, but the Welsh government said it was ""extremely worrying"". In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday,external, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added. The company, which makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK, also said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result, it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK. Please upgrade your browser The customs union brings together the EU's 28 members in a duty-free area, in which they pay the same rate of duty on non-EU goods Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out staying in the customs union. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The UK government is considering two other options: a customs partnership that would remove the need for new customs checks at the border; and a ""highly streamlined"" customs arrangement that would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether. Michel Barnier, the EU's Brexit negotiator, has said that both options are unrealistic. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We are confident that we are going to get a good deal, one that ensures that trade is as free and frictionless as possible, including for the aerospace sector,"" A Welsh government spokespersonsaid: ""We have repeatedly warned that the UK cannot take the huge economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift from the single market and customs union. Particularly in the case of manufacturing sectors, which in Wales are so important in providing high-paid, high-skilled jobs."" Simon Jack, business editor It has been a source of exasperation for some cabinet members that although many companies have privately expressed concern - even alarm - at the progress of the Brexit negotiations, they have been reluctant to make their fears public, and have even dialled down the shrillness of their warnings when meeting the prime minister in person. Airbus' decision to warn that future investment in their operations in the UK are under review, while not exactly welcome, is therefore considered by some in government as an honest and helpful declaration of what's at stake for UK workers and the wider economy. Prominent Brexit supporter Sir Bernard Jenkin described Airbus' comments as the kind of ""speculation"" seen before, during and after the referendum from large companies. But Airbus' UK boss, Katherine Bennett, told the BBC, ""this is not project fear, this is dawning reality"". Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said in ""any scenario"", Brexit had ""severe negative consequences"" for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular. Without a deal, he said Airbus believed the impact on its UK operations could be ""significant"". ""Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus' future in the UK."" Brexit: All you need to know Industry sectors face Brexit extinction 'Treasury not the enemy of Brexit' Airbus's main civil aircraft business is based in a suburb of the French city of Toulouse. Apart from France and the UK, it has production and manufacturing facilities in Germany, Spain, China and the US. Mr Williams told the BBC's Today programmethat Airbus was currently working on developing the ""next generation"" of aircraft wings in the UK. ""We are seriously considering whether we should continue that development or whether we should find alternative solutions,"" he added. Airbus makes wings for the A380 and other models in the UK Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said the warning from Airbus should be a ""wake-up call"". Mr Crabb tweeted: ""The enormous Airbus factory in North Wales is one of the jewels in the crown of UK manufacturing. This is a wake-up call. A pragmatic, sensible Brexit that protects trade & jobs is vital."" And shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""If proof was needed that the PM's Brexit red lines need to be abandoned (and fast), this is it."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable described the Airbus warning as ""the 'Oh my God' moment where something real is happening"". He added: ""Airbus are making absolutely clear that if there is a risk of a hard Brexit, they will have to stockpile parts. They can't take the risk. ""A hundred and ten thousand jobs depend on this company.  About one-and-a-half billion in tax revenue that will not go into the NHS. ""We're now beginning to get serious about what Brexit means.""

"This video can not be played Airbus loss 'would be an absolute disaster for Broughton' Thousands of Welsh jobs are at risk as Airbus has warned it could leave the UK if it exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal after Brexit. The European planemaker employs more than 6,000 people at its wing factory at Broughton in Flintshire and about 400 people at its base in Newport. The Welsh Government saidAirbus' warningwas ""extremely worrying"". ""The UK cannot take the economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift,"" it said. Airbus said the warning was not part of ""project fear, but it was a ""dawning reality"". Meanwhile Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has sparked a row within his party after a statement from the Brexiteeraccused the firm of making threats and doing a disservice to workers. Many employees of the firm have ""grave concerns"" about the future, according to union Unite's convener for Broughton Darren Reynolds. Meet the gargantuan air freighter that looks like a whale Plane flies Airbus wings from Broughton to France Brexit delays 'would damage' aerospace industry Speaking outside the factory, he said: ""I have just been speaking with the members locally in the plant and they are really concerned now regarding what the future looks like for Airbus."" Mr Reynolds said he had visited Downing Street twice this year to discuss the impact of Brexit with government ministers but was not sure they understood the concerns. He said: ""This site here employs 6,500 people, it's key to this area and the north west to have the jobs that we do."" This video can not be played Economy Secretary Ken Skates says the Airbus warning is ""deeply worrying"" Many people from Wales also travel to Airbus' Filton plant in Bristol, which employs a further 3,000 people, where wings are assembled. A further 2,500 work at sites in Portsmouth and in Stevenage. It is estimated that the aviation giant supports about 11,600 jobs in Wales alone in the supply chain. First Minister Carwyn Jones is holding talks with UK ministers and political counterparts at a meeting of the British Irish Council in Guernsey on Friday, where the issue is expected to be raised.

He has already issued a joint statement with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonurging the prime minister to pledge to stay in the EU's single market and customs union. They have warned that Theresa May's plan for the UK's departure from the EU was not ""consistent with the national interest"". Wings for all the Airbus commercial planes are made in Wales In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". Brexit: All you need to know Airbus warns over Brexit free movement Airbus stresses need for Brexit deal ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added. The company, which makes all the wings for its passenger planes at its Deeside plant, also said the current planned transition period which is due to end in December 2020 was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK. Analysis from Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This is not a shock in that Airbus has been warning for years that it might be less likely to invest in Wales and the rest of the UK in future if it doesn't have easy access to the EU. It is a sign of its increasing frustration with the lack of clarity over the future trading relationship that it is now saying its long-term commitments, including to its Flintshire plant, could be in doubt. Airbus currently has workers and products moving quickly and seamlessly across EU countries and it is planning for what happens if that stops after Brexit. There are also a number of companies in Flintshire whose business in a large part revolves around supplying Airbus so there would be a ripple effect on the local economy if it invests less or begins to withdraw completely. Some have argued that the company wouldn't really do this but many said the same about Tata's warnings over a number of years that it was at risk due to high energy costs and cheap Chinese steel. Politicians only made moves to tackle its problems after it put its entire UK operations up for sale. ""Workers urgently require reassurance,"" said local assembly member Jack Sargeant, who has also called for an emergency statement in the Senedd. The union Unite, which is the main union representing Airbus workers, said a 'cliff-edge' Brexit was becoming a ""cold hard reality"". ""It would be a betrayal of Airbus workers, their families and the tens of thousands workers in the wider supply chain if the government failed to secure frictionless trade and access to the customs union and single market,"" said the union's Steve Turner. Wings from Broughton are airlifted to France to complete production of the planes Responding to the comments from Airbus, a UK government official said: ""We have made significant progress towards agreeing a deep and special partnership with the EU to ensure trade remains as free and frictionless as possible, including in the aerospace sector, and we're confident of getting a good deal that is mutually beneficial. ""Given the good progress that we are continuing to make in the negotiations we do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise.""

"UK-based Airbus staff made 18,000 visits to the company's French operations alone last year. In a speech at a business festival in Liverpool, Business Secretary Greg Clark today insisted that services must be part of any Brexit deal with the EU and issued a series of demands. UK employees servicing EU customers must be allowed to travel just as frictionlessly as the goods that have dominated the negotiations so far. Professional qualifications of UK workers must be recognised in the EU to allow companies to send qualified staff at short notice to perform business-critical functions including training or installing, servicing and repairing products sold to EU customers. UK firms must also be able to send any profits generated by services delivered in the EU back to the UK. Services account for 80% of the UK economy, and the UK sells more services to the EU than it buys. Mr Clark said: ""Over the years, we've become used to these arrangements. But they don't happen without agreement. ""So, as we leave the European Union, this is every bit as important as avoiding barriers in manufactured goods."" To date, negotiations have focused on the frictionless movement of goods between the UK and the EU. Services are every bit as important - if not more, according to Mr Clark. He said: ""Â£90bn of services exports went to the EU in 2016. That's more than to our next eight largest partners - the United States, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, Canada, China, Singapore and Norway - combined."" I put it to him that the UK government was in a weak position to start issuing demands when it couldn't make up its own mind on key issues like the kind of customs arrangement it wanted with the EU. May vows 'smooth' Brexit as bill passes Brexit: All you need to know EU deal 'must include financial services' Two years on from the referendum, two models are still being considered. First, the maximum facilitation (max fac) model which envisages using new (unspecified) technology to reduce friction at our ports, airports and, crucially, at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Second, a new ""customs partnership"" that would see the UK collecting EU tariffs on goods bound for European markets on the EU's behalf - and sending them on to Brussels - with the option of paying refunds on goods remaining in the UK. The first option will cost UK business up to Â£10bn per annum - and Â£20bn in total for both sides - according to HMRC. It's a calculation not disputed by the business secretary. The second has been dismissed as unworkable by the EU, which says it would essentially make the UK a border authority for a bloc of which it was no longer a member. Privately, Mr Clark acknowledges that either option would take many years to implement - certainly longer than the agreed transition period which ends in December 2020. What Mr Clark's intervention today does illustrate is the very grey line between goods and services. When Rolls Royce sells an engine to an airline it usually does so at a loss. The company makes its money on long term maintenance, inspection and repair contracts that can last decades. Selling the engine is the start - not the end of the deal. Getting skilled workers to customer sites at short notice is essential. UK-based Airbus employees made 18,000 visits to France alone last year. The company runs its own air shuttle between Broughton and Toulouse. According to Mr Clark: ""Restricting people's ability to travel at short notice would be as damaging to our economy as frictions and disruption in the transfer of goods at our borders."" The simple answer to these issues would be to remain a member of the single market and the customs union as many businesses have recommended. That option has been categorically ruled out by the Prime Minister as it would prevent the UK striking new trade deals with non-EU countries and it comes with accepting the free movement of people between the EU and the UK. An option Mr Clark accepts is politically impossible. May vows 'smooth' Brexit as bill passes What happens now that a deal's been done?

"This video can not be played Boris Becker: ""I believed the documents they were giving me must be right"" Former tennis champion Boris Becker has told the BBC he has a genuine diplomatic passport issued by the Central African Republic (CAR), despite CAR officials saying it is fake. Lawyers for Mr Becker say he is immune from bankruptcy proceedings in London because he holds diplomatic status. But the CAR's foreign minister says the passport is fake and he has asked the justice minister to investigate. Mr Becker said he was happy to go to the CAR to end the ""misunderstanding"". ""I don't know what is internally happening within the politics [of CAR] but I have received the passport from the ambassador,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. ""I have spoken to the president on many occasions. I believe the documents they have given me must be right."" Asked if he would be willing to go the CAR if requested, he said: ""I am very happy, any time soon, to visit Bangui, the capital, and to speak to the people personally about how we can move forward and how we can resolve this misunderstanding and this confusion."" A country with bigger problems than Boris Becker What is diplomatic protection? Should diplomats still have immunity? Mr Becker was declared bankrupt in 2017 over money owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham and is now being pursued for ""further assets"". Lawyers for the 50-year-old three-time Wimbledon champion told a court hearing in London that he was appointed a sport and culture attache to the EU by the CAR in April. In that month he tweeted a picture of himself shaking hands with CAR President Faustin-Archange Touadera in Brussels. Boris Becker was pictured shaking hands with the president of CAR in April In a statement issued on Friday by his lawyers, Mr Becker said the furore was a ""storm in a teacup"". ""Someone seems to have got their wires crossed in the Central African Republic, but my appointment was entirely official and above board, and was made by the president. Everyone's seen the photos published when my appointment was announced. This fuss about documents is pretty irrelevant."" Earlier this week, CAR foreign ministry chief of staff Cherubin Moroubama told AFP news agency the serial number on the document matched one of a batch of ""new passports that were stolen in 2014"". He added that the diplomatic passport, dated 19 March 2018, did not bear the signature or the stamp of the foreign minister. The tennis star became the first German to win Wimbledon in 1985, aged 17. He won it again in 1986 and 1989 among the 64 ATP Tour titles he claimed during a 15-year career. After retiring as a player he became a commentator with the BBC.

"This video can not be played Sir Roger Singleton carried out a review on how abuse allegations were reported A Church of England investigation into alleged child sexual abuse failed to identify at least 22 cases of possible abuse, an inquiry has found. Sir Roger Singleton, who examined the Church's ""flawed"" Past Case Review (PCR) held between 2007 and 2009, said it ""failed to give a complete picture"". The missed cases were from 16 out of a total of 44 dioceses. The CofE's lead on safeguarding, Bishop Peter Hancock, said the Church had taken the criticisms ""very seriously"". The police are ""engaged in a major operation"" in another diocese, according to the report. The review was due to be published next month, but was released earlier following an investigation by BBC News. CofE 'botched its abuse inquiry' Church 'faces years of abuse revelations' The report states that all cases identified ""have been closed or are currently being effectively managed."" It added: ""Whilst uncertainties remain, this provides some assurance that in most cases identified in 2007-09 the current risk to children either no longer exists or is subject to active management."" However, Sir Roger has said new inquiries should be held in seven of the dioceses investigated. The Church has outlined four steps for improvement. They include the creation of an independently-chaired panel featuring survivors which will look at options to redress past cases, an independent ombudsman to review how complaints are handled and a strengthening of the clergy recruitment process. The Right Reverend Bishop Hancock said the Church would offer ""full support"" to make sure the report's recommendations are implemented. He added: ""We are committed to making sure that any known individuals who have not been dealt with appropriately in the past are assessed and any current potential risks to children and others are rigorously managed, including by reporting these individuals to the statutory authorities for investigation."" There will also be ""closer working with the Catholic Church to support survivors of sexual abuse"". In his report, Sir Roger said there was ""inconsistency"" and ""confusion"" across the dioceses about which Church employees should be investigated by the PCR. Because of this, he said, there ""remains the possibility that parish workers who had engaged in inappropriate conduct were not included because they were considered outside the scope of the PCR"". Another flaw was the Church's decision to contact alleged victims ""only in the most exceptional cases"" to ""minimise the distress"" to them. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today shortly before the report was published, Sir Roger said it seems ""extraordinary"" now that the Church investigators did not meet with more victims but ""the importance of listening"" to them was ""less understood"" in 2010 than it is now. In his report, Sir Roger said: ""By not including them, their views were absent from the review and perhaps particularly from the lessons learned."" Writing on a blog,external, the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Dame Sarah Mullally, said the Church had ""not yet understood what it is or looks like to put victims and survivors at the heart of what we do."" But she insisted that leadership for safeguarding people remained within the CofE, adding: ""I do not believe that the Church should lose responsibility for ensuring that it is a safe place."" The PCR looked at some 40,000 files detailing accusations but Sir Roger was critical that some dioceses ""did not know where the files were"". Other records, he said, ""referred vaguely to an 'unfortunate saga' or 'past difficulties'"" which ""generates a risk"" they were not investigated properly as possible abuse. Sir Roger earlier told Today that the PCR had been ""well-intentioned"" but the Church needs to ""complete the incomplete job"", a message echoed in his report. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the Church's failures were ""deeply shaming"". Survivors have accused the Church of a ""wholly inadequate"" response.

"Windrush generation members and their families were invited to the Westminster Abbey service More than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Empire Windrush ship to the UK. Hymns including Amazing Grace were played on steel drums as guests, including families of the Windrush generation, entered Westminster Abbey. The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain. But there continues to be concern over a scandal which saw some of the generation wrongly face deportation. As the music played in the abbey, Baroness Floella Benjamin was applauded as she briefly danced in the nave. The Liberal Democrat peer and patron of the Windrush Foundation said that she felt ""joy"", adding: ""I was floating, like a bird, free."" Prime Minister Theresa May, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and London Mayor Sadiq Khan attended the service, along with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Among the guests was Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen. By Helena Lee, BBC News Under the warm June sun the guests, more than 2,000 of them, queued outside the abbey ahead of the service. They shared stories with each other. They wanted to celebrate. Many of them were families of the Windrush generation. Karen Gibson's mother came to Britain from Guyana in 1962. She said her mother heard stories of ""gold on the streets"" of the UK. There was a heart-warming moment too. A handshake between two men, in their nineties, who unknown to each other, had both been on the Empire Windrush ship 70 years ago. Andria Marsh, 63, held up photographs of her parents and her original British passport after the Windrush service At the service, a short drama telling the story of how Caribbean migrants were invited to ""The Motherland"" to help rebuild post-war Britain was performed by actors. Addressing the congregation, the Reverend Canon Joel Edwards said: ""Settling down hasn't been plain sailing. ""The children of Windrush have experienced over-representation in Britain's prisons and mental health institutions. Knife crimes. ""Underachievement in education and the job market. Settlement has meant racism, sometimes too much policing and not enough protection. And Stephen Lawrence."" But he added: ""Windrush resilience arises, supremely."" The Dean of Westminster (right) wore a robe decorated with a photo montage of aspects of black history in Britain He described the Windrush as having ""gifted"" Britain with leaders in the worlds of politics, business, education, music and sport and acknowledged the influence of the Caribbean on British cuisine, including ""rice and peas, jerk chicken and Levi Roots sauce in our supermarkets"". Mr Edwards also referenced the scandal that has seen some Windrush members wrongly face deportation. He said: ""In recent months the word 'Windrush' has evoked a great deal of emotion and even anger across our political landscape. In this service of thanksgiving, Windrush means more than migration."" The service included the first performance of a specially composed anthem entitled Psalm To Windrush: For The Brave And Ingenious. Windrush generation 'deserve medals' The Windrush spark that never died 'The British Empire is nothing to be proud of' The Very Rev John Hall, Dean of Westminster, wore a robe decorated with a photo montage of aspects of black history in Britain since the arrival of Windrush. John Richards, 92, who came to Britain on the Windrush aged 21, said the service was ""great"". ""It brings back memories, yes, but I'm too old for the emotion,"" he said. Alford Gardner, a member of the Windrush generation, has lived in Leeds most of his life, but said that was not his intention when he arrived. The 92-year-old said: ""The plan was to come to England, get a good job, work for about five years, go back... but it wasn't to be. ""Within five years I had started a family and married.

But Glenda Ceasar, who was born in Dominica in the 1960s, said she never got a British passport and lost her job recently because she could not prove her legal status. She said: ""So many years down the line... we're faced with this. ""The ship to me, the Windrush, it seems as if it was... we were just slaves being brought over here to be punished later on in life. That's the way that I feel."" Nearly 500 Caribbean migrants from countries including Jamaica, Bermuda and Trinidad exited the Windrush on 22 June 1948 when it docked at Tilbury in Essex. They had applied to job adverts after World War II with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948.

The Westminster Abbey service commemorates the contribution the migrants and their families have made to the UK. Meanwhile, a celebration of Caribbean culture marked the anniversary at Tilbury Docks. The government has also announced Baroness Benjamin is to lead a commemoration committee overseeing the creation of a ""fitting legacy"" to the Windrush generation. A statue celebrating their achievements is among the ideas for the permanent tribute. Nearly 500 Caribbean immigrants were on the Empire Windrush when it arrived 70 years ago Baroness Benjamin, a former children's television presenter and Lib Dem peer, was born in Trinidad but emigrated to the UK with her family in 1960. She said: ""This a significant step in recognising the contribution made to Britain by Caribbean people and this committee will make sure the work and sacrifices of the Windrush pioneers will live on in the hearts and minds of future generations."" This video can not be played Three Windrush generation migrants The right to remain in the UK for Commonwealth migrants who arrived before 1973 was supposed to be legally guaranteed. But it emerged this year that some migrants from the Windrush generation - many of them who arrived as children  - hadfaced deportation. They were being refused healthcare and access to jobs because they did not have the paperwork to prove their status following a tightening of immigration rules in 2014. The government has since apologised for the crisis and says a dedicated taskforce has now provided documentation to over 2,000 people demonstrating their right to live in the UK.

"Things took an emotional turn on Paul McCartney's Carpool Karaoke A special UK edition of Carpool Karaoke took an emotional turn as Sir Paul McCartney joined James Corden on a trip to Liverpool. The Late Late Show host was joined by the singer as they drove past famous Beatles landmarks. McCartney told how a dream, in which his mother told him to ""let it be"", inspired the song of the same name. Corden said it was the ""most beautiful story"" he had ever heard, before singing a teary rendition of the song. ""Oh man, it got me emotional there,"" Corden said. ""I didn't feel it coming."" McCartney recalled how,externalhe ""had a dream in the '60s where my mum, who died, came to me in the dream and was reassuring me, saying, 'it's going to be OK. Just let it be.'"" He added: ""She gave me the positive word. So I woke up and I went: 'What was that? What'd she say? Let it be? I've never heard that. That's kind of good.'"" Sir Paul McCartney: 'Retire from what?' Sir Paul's surprise pub gig Explaining why the story made him so emotional, Corden said: ""I can remember my grandad, who was a musician, and my dad, sitting me down and saying, 'we're going to play you the best song you've ever heard'. ""And I remember them playing me that. If my grandad was here right now, he'd get an absolute kick out of this."" McCartney made it even more poignant when he told Corden: ""He is."" During the drive, Corden told McCartney: ""Your music is so full of positivity and joy and a message of love and togetherness, I feel like it's more relevant now today maybe than it's ever been."" The episode ended with a surprise gig at a Liverpool pub He agreed, saying: ""We expected it to last 10 years, but it keeps going on, and on, and on. And it keeps being relevant."" McCartney also revealed how he wrote his first song at the age of 14. As part of the video, the pair embarked on a journey around McCartney's hometown, visiting Penny Lane and his family home, which he saw for the first time in 50 years.

"A typical menu for students at St Paul's Girls' School includes herb-crusted salmon and duck leg confit A private girls' school in west London has been criticised for holding an ""Austerity Day"" where pupils ate potatoes and fruit for lunch. St Paul's Girls' School, which has fees of Â£7,978 per term, said serving pupils ""simple"" food helps them learn about ""less fortunate"" people. Henna Shah, who attended the school on a bursary, said the event made her ""uncomfortable"". Campaigners said it showed a ""complete lack of understanding"" of poverty. The school, where a typical menu for students includes herb-crusted salmon and duck leg confit, posted about the event on Twitter on Wednesday. Ms Shahtook a screenshot of the post before it was deleted,external. It said said: ""Today was the final Austerity Day of the year. Students and staff had baked potatoes with beans and coleslaw for lunch, with fruit for dessert. The money saved will be donated to the school's charities."" Photos accompanying the post included a poster for Austerity Day, showing a waiter lifting a silver cloche with three peas underneath it. The school posted on Twitter about an Austerity Day held on Wednesday Ms Shah, 24, attended St Paul's from the ages of 11 to 18. She was the first of her family to go to university when she left the school for Oxford University in 2012. ""Austerity lunch is what we ate at home. It's having to eat a jacket potatoes every day, not having one once a term,"" she said. Ms Shah, from Hounslow, said raising awareness for people living in poverty was ""great"", but that the problem was using the word ""austerity"". Food blogger Jack Monroe said the school's event was flawed because austerity is ""not a hunger game"" A spokeswoman for St Paul's told the BBC: ""For many years, St Paul's has arranged regular lunches when simple food is served and the money saved given to local charities. ""The aim is also to raise the awareness of our students to those less fortunate than themselves. ""The choice of the word 'austerity' is to draw attention to the fact that others around them are facing significant economic difficulties."" The school refused to explain why the post had been deleted. Jack Monroe, a campaigner and author renowned for blogging about cooking for a family on a shoestring budget, told the BBC the stunt was ""enormously patronising"". ""I'm not outraged, I'm more saddened. They probably feel they are doing something good by playing at being poor,"" Monroe said. ""An austerity lunch is really no lunch at all. ""I do not know anyone who lives in poverty who can afford to turn their oven on for two hours to cook a jacket potato."" Jane Middleton, a mature student researching food poverty as part of her MA dissertation, said the school's ""austerity lunch"" was inaccurate. ""People who go to food banks cannot afford fresh food, they get given cans,"" she said. ""It's shades of Marie Antoinette really - just a complete lack of understanding as to what it means to be in poverty.""

On June 20, Mr GÃ³mez was identified as one of the people in the video and subsequently dismissed for accepting a drink, despite the fact that - according to him - he barely knew the people who had smuggled it in.

"This video can not be played Uber dashcam footage shows moment before fatal impact The ""safety operator"" of a self-driving Uber car was watching TV just before the vehicle was involved in a fatal collision, a police report reveals. The Uber car struck and killed pedestrian Elaine Herzberg, 49, of Tempe, Arizona in March.

"The image stoked outrage over the Trump administration's policy A little girl who became the public face of US migrant family separations was not taken away from her mother at the US border, says her father. A photograph of the Honduran toddler sobbing in a pink jacket was snapped at the scene of a border detention. Time magazine has used the image for its latest cover, depicting President Donald Trump looming over the girl with the caption: ""Welcome to America"". But thousands of other child migrants have been taken from parents in the US. The chaotic process of reuniting families Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Trump hosts victims of illegal migrants The image was taken by photographer John Moore for the news agency Getty Images on 12 June at McAllen, Texas. The Pulitzer prize-winner told the BBC that the mother had been breastfeeding her child after crossing the Rio Grande in a raft in the moments before they were detained. Denis Valera (L) said his wife (R) had left him and their three other children in Honduras Mr Moore said they were taken away together by border patrol. The photo stoked outrage over the Trump administration's child migrant separations policy, rolled out in April, of removing young undocumented people from their mothers and fathers as they are detained for crossing the US-Mexico border. The photo helped secure $17m (Â£13m) in donations from hundreds of thousands of people on a Facebook fundraiser for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a Texas-based non-profit organisation. This video can not be played A Guatemalan asylum seeker is reunited with her son at a Baltimore airport ""My daughter has become a symbol of the separation of children at the US border,"" Denis Valera told Reuters news agency. ""She may have even touched President Trump's heart."" ""Seeing what was happening to her in that moment breaks anyone's heart,"" he added. Sandra Sanchez (L) with her daughter Yanela Denise at the border Mr Valera said his daughter and her mother, Sandra Sanchez, have been detained together in the border town of McAllen as Ms Sanchez sought asylum. Honduran Deputy Foreign Minister Nelly Jerez verified Mr Valera's version of events to Reuters. Carlos Ruiz, the Border Patrol agent who stopped Ms Sanchez and her daughter, said the mother was asked to set the child down so she could be searched. ""The kid immediately started crying as she set her down,"" said Mr Ruiz. ""I personally went up to the mother and asked her, 'Are you doing OK? Is the kid OK?' ""And she said, 'Yes. She's tired and thirsty. It's 11 o'clock at night.'"" The little girl is two-year-old Yanela Denise, according to the Daily Mail newspaper. Mr Valera said Ms Sanchez and their daughter had left the Honduran city of Puerto Cortes without telling him or the couple's three other children. He said he believed she went to the US in search of better economic opportunities. Mr Valera told Reuters: ""If they are deported, that is OK as long as they do not leave the child without her mother. I am waiting to see what happens with them."" He told the Daily Mail he understands Ms Sanchez paid $6,000 to a smuggler,externalto get her across the border. According to the newspaper, the couple's three other children are aged 14, 11 and six. Mr Valera said: ""The kids see what's happening. They're a little worried but I don't try to bring it up that much. They know their mother and sister are safe now."" California congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (R) holds a photo of the little girl at an immigration protest on Capitol Hill on Tuesday Time magazine defended its cover on Friday, saying that the photograph of the girl ""became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason"". ""Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment,"" wrote the magazine's editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal. The magazine also corrected its story, which said the girl was ""carried away screaming by US Border Patrol agents"", to instead say the mother and daughter were ""taken away together"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Twitter claimed that Democrats and the media ""exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda"". ""She was not separated from her mom. The separation here is from the facts,"" she wrote. On Friday, Mr Trump accused Democrats of playing politics with ""phony stories of sadness and grief"". Approximately 2,300 children have been removed from their families since Mr Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" policy began in May, and housed in detention centres run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Some shelters, including three in Texas, house so-called ""tender age"" children, who are under five years old. About 500 children have been reunited with their families since May, a Homeland Security official said on Thursday.

"Auctioneers said the silverware was ""a big part of modern history"" Cutlery made for Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to celebrate his 50th birthday has been sold at auction for Â£12,500. The formal pattern silverware was discovered during a house clearance in Dorset, having belonged to a senior military officer. The two knives, three spoons and three forks, which were created for Hitler's use during formal occasions, had been expected to fetch up to Â£2,300. Sherborne's Charterhouse Auctioneers said they were ""a big part"" of history. It is not illegal to sell Nazi memorabilia in the UK, but such sales have led some toquestion whether it is tasteful. MPs have previously urged a ban on selling these types of goods, and more recentlyFacebook was urged to block Nazi relic sales. The two knives, three spoons and three forks bear the Nazi eagle, swastika and Adolf Hitler's initials The cutlery was produced for Hitler's 50th birthday Richard Bromell, of Charterhouse Auctioneers, said: ""About 3,000 pieces were produced for Hitler's 50th birthday. This is the first set I have seen in 33 years. ""Some will have been lost in the sands of time, others could be buried under rubble and some will have been discarded."" The cutlery bears the Nazi eagle, swastika and Hitler's initials. ""It's a niche market - some people will have interest, others will not - but it's a big part of modern history,"" he added.

"Creditors have backed department store chain House of Fraser's plans to close more than half its stores. High Street landlords were unhappy with the plan as they will have to shoulder the burden of financial losses, but they were outvoted. The retailer will now go ahead and shut 31 of its 59 shops nationwide, and also impose huge rent cuts on 10 others that it intends to keep. Up to 6,000 jobs are set to go as a result of the store closures. The vote was seen as a make-or-break moment for the 169-year-old business. If the rescue plan had failed, administration was likely. Why is House of Fraser failing? Why we no longer love department stores In all, 2,000 House of Fraser jobs are set to go, along with 4,000 brand and concession roles. The stores scheduled for closure, which include its flagship London Oxford Street store, will stay open until early 2019, House of Fraser has said. In May, House of Fraser's Chinese owners, Nanjing Cenbest, reached a conditional agreement to sell a 51% stake to the Chinese owner of Hamley's, C.banner. The sale was conditional on the restructuring plan being approved. ""Following the restructuring, House of Fraser will have a more sustainable cost base and a platform for future growth to deliver an improved customer proposition,"" the company said in a statement.

CVAs are being increasingly used by struggling retailers as a way to close stores, but House of Fraser's has been the most contentious restructuring deal to date. Landlords argue that CVAs are being abused as a quick way to cut rents and want the government to launch an urgent review into them. In order to be enacted, CVAs have to be approved by 75% of unsecured creditors, but landlords' voting power is reduced because of the way in which insolvency rules are applied. House of Fraser chief executive Alex Williamson said: ""The CVA proposals have been approved by our creditors and we are grateful for their ongoing support and belief in the future of House of Fraser. ""This was clearly a difficult decision to take but is, ultimately, the only one to secure our future. ""Our focus is on supporting all of our affected colleagues and we are exploring every opportunity available to them, working alongside the Retail Trust and the wider retail community."" Mark Fry of Begbies Traynor and Charlotte Coates of JLL, who had been advising a group of the affected landlords, said: ""It is disappointing that the CVA has been agreed without proper engagement with the landlords, many of whom manage the pensions and investments of the man in the street, despite them having so much at stake through the process. ""However, with landlords' voting power reduced by an arbitrary 75% of the value of their already discounted claims, the odds were always stacked against them. ""The landlords now have a 28-day window to consider whether to make a legal challenge against the process and will be looking at their options closely."" High Street retailers have been facing a harsh climate this year amid falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. Electronics chain Maplin and toy chain Toys R Us both collapsed into administration earlier this year. Other High Street chains such as Mothercare and Carpetright have been forced to close stores in order to survive.

She described her friend as having an infectious smile and said she was ""always so upbeat and so happy"". But Malin says there's a ""downside to reality TV"" that people don't see. ""There just needs to be more done about it and a lot more aftercare provided by certain reality TV shows,"" she told Newsbeat. Allow Twitter content?

Malin and Sophie formed a close bond during series two of Love Island and stayed in touch afterwards. ""She did talk to me a lot about personal situations quite close to when the show had finished. ""It was a shock for both of us when we came out of the villa, and I completely understood where she was coming from because I felt the same."" Malin says reality TV is a ""weird industry to be in"" Malin says she last heard from her friend a few days ago and news of her death came as as a shock. ""I didn't believe it. A close friend of mine rang me and told me. ""I thought it was a joke or something. It still hasn't sunk in to be honest and I don't think it will for a while."" Malin says reality TV is a ""weird industry"" to be involved in and she hinted she has had her own struggles. ""It's like you're constantly reaching for some kind of high and when work dies down and things go quiet you're constantly trying to chase it - and that's where depression can kick in. ""A lot of fellow friends that have been on shows have said the same, and it's something that's not looked into as much. ""It's really serious. I've been there myself and it's horrible.""

"This video can not be played Airbus loss 'would be an absolute disaster for Broughton' Thousands of Welsh jobs are at risk as Airbus has warned it could leave the UK if it exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal after Brexit. The European planemaker employs more than 6,000 people at its wing factory at Broughton in Flintshire and about 400 people at its base in Newport. The Welsh Government saidAirbus' warningwas ""extremely worrying"". ""The UK cannot take the economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift,"" it said. Airbus said the warning was not part of ""project fear, but it was a ""dawning reality"". Meanwhile Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has sparked a row within his party after a statement from the Brexiteeraccused the firm of making threats and doing a disservice to workers. Many employees of the firm have ""grave concerns"" about the future, according to union Unite's convener for Broughton Darren Reynolds. Meet the gargantuan air freighter that looks like a whale Plane flies Airbus wings from Broughton to France Brexit delays 'would damage' aerospace industry Speaking outside the factory, he said: ""I have just been speaking with the members locally in the plant and they are really concerned now regarding what the future looks like for Airbus."" Mr Reynolds said he had visited Downing Street twice this year to discuss the impact of Brexit with government ministers but was not sure they understood the concerns. He said: ""This site here employs 6,500 people, it's key to this area and the north west to have the jobs that we do."" This video can not be played Economy Secretary Ken Skates says the Airbus warning is ""deeply worrying"" Many people from Wales also travel to Airbus' Filton plant in Bristol, which employs a further 3,000 people, where wings are assembled. A further 2,500 work at sites in Portsmouth and in Stevenage. It is estimated that the aviation giant supports about 11,600 jobs in Wales alone in the supply chain. First Minister Carwyn Jones is holding talks with UK ministers and political counterparts at a meeting of the British Irish Council in Guernsey on Friday, where the issue is expected to be raised.

He has already issued a joint statement with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonurging the prime minister to pledge to stay in the EU's single market and customs union. They have warned that Theresa May's plan for the UK's departure from the EU was not ""consistent with the national interest"". Wings for all the Airbus commercial planes are made in Wales In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". Brexit: All you need to know Airbus warns over Brexit free movement Airbus stresses need for Brexit deal ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added. The company, which makes all the wings for its passenger planes at its Deeside plant, also said the current planned transition period which is due to end in December 2020 was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK. Analysis from Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This is not a shock in that Airbus has been warning for years that it might be less likely to invest in Wales and the rest of the UK in future if it doesn't have easy access to the EU. It is a sign of its increasing frustration with the lack of clarity over the future trading relationship that it is now saying its long-term commitments, including to its Flintshire plant, could be in doubt. Airbus currently has workers and products moving quickly and seamlessly across EU countries and it is planning for what happens if that stops after Brexit. There are also a number of companies in Flintshire whose business in a large part revolves around supplying Airbus so there would be a ripple effect on the local economy if it invests less or begins to withdraw completely. Some have argued that the company wouldn't really do this but many said the same about Tata's warnings over a number of years that it was at risk due to high energy costs and cheap Chinese steel. Politicians only made moves to tackle its problems after it put its entire UK operations up for sale. ""Workers urgently require reassurance,"" said local assembly member Jack Sargeant, who has also called for an emergency statement in the Senedd. The union Unite, which is the main union representing Airbus workers, said a 'cliff-edge' Brexit was becoming a ""cold hard reality"". ""It would be a betrayal of Airbus workers, their families and the tens of thousands workers in the wider supply chain if the government failed to secure frictionless trade and access to the customs union and single market,"" said the union's Steve Turner. Wings from Broughton are airlifted to France to complete production of the planes Responding to the comments from Airbus, a UK government official said: ""We have made significant progress towards agreeing a deep and special partnership with the EU to ensure trade remains as free and frictionless as possible, including in the aerospace sector, and we're confident of getting a good deal that is mutually beneficial. ""Given the good progress that we are continuing to make in the negotiations we do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise.""

"About 6,000 people work in wing manufacturing at the Airbus plant in Flintshire The aerospace industry could be damaged if Brexit introduces delays in how companies deal with cross-border supply issues, MPs have warned. The sector employs 12,000 people in Wales, turning over more than Â£5bn. MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee made the comments in a new report. The Department for Business said it was ""committed to making sure the UK aerospace sector remains competitive"" after the UK leaves the European Union. MPs on the committee want UK ministers to ensure investment in the industry is not delayed by uncertainty about the future relationship with the EU. It is a major, fast-growing industry in Wales, with engine maintenance bases, seat manufacturers and thousands employed by Airbus alone at its wing factory in Broughton, Flintshire. MPs examining the issue took evidence from a wide range of organisations and concluded future tariffs between the UK and Europe would not be a significant concern after Brexit because the UK is part of a World Trade Organisation agreement on civil aircraft trade. Aerospace centre plans 'would cost Â£25m' Aviation firm announces closure Airbus issues 'dangerous phase' Brexit warning Airbus builds its planes in four countries across Europe However, they concluded that in what has become a globalised industry, with complex cross-border ""just-in-time"" supply chains, there would be damage if the movement of goods was delayed by more paperwork. The aerospace industry employs about 120,000 people in the UK and generates about Â£28bn worth of exports. The committee's report also concluded the industry had nothing to gain from breaking away from existing regulations and it was in the UK's national interest to remain in the European Aviation and Safety Agency - which overseas rules on industry and passenger plane safety. It echoes calls earlier this yearby the industry's main trade body ADS to retain membership of the agency over fears there could be widespread disruption to air travel if the UK left. A Department for Business spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister has said that we want to explore the terms on which the UK could remain part of the European Aviation Safety Agency and we will continue to work closely with aerospace companies, ensuring they can continue to benefit from a frictionless trading environment.""

"This video can not be played Lauren Wright, politics and public affairs expert, on the significance of Melania Trump's ""I don't care"" jacket First Lady Melania Trump has been criticised for her choice of jacket worn on a trip to a migrant child detention centre in Texas. Mrs Trump was spotted in the coat, which featured graffiti writing on the back with the words ""I really don't care do u?"", as she boarded a plane. Her spokeswoman said ""there was no hidden message"" in the former fashion model's sartorial choice. The $39 (Â£29) jacket from Zara caused an uproar on social media. US President Donald Trump later tweeted his wife's coat ""refers to the Fake News Media"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs Trump was not seen wearing the coat when she first arrived in Texas, but had it on again when she returned to Washington DC. Katty Kay, BBC World News presenter, Washington Melania Trump's empathetic visit to the Mexican border risks being overshadowed by the unempathetic message on the back of her coat. It stretches credulity that the first lady would make the effort to fly down to Texas, visit children, talk to staff and engage in this heartbreaking story only to deliberately  undermine it with a callous choice of clothing. It's not clear how this was allowed to slip through the careful White House protocols but it's a mistake on the part of her staff. I give her the benefit of the doubt on compassion - but if she chose to wear this without thinking, it was pretty tone deaf. This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""I want to help reunite children with their families"" Mrs Trump made the previously unannounced visit to a child migrant detention centre on Thursday, saying she wanted to help reunite migrant children who were separated from their families. Her tour of the federally-funded New Hope Children's Shelter in McAllen, Texas, housing dozens of Central American children came as her husband's administration sought to quell the firestorm over migrant separations. Confusion over fate of US migrant children All the context you need on migrant children story The majority of the 55 children housed at the facility crossed the border unaccompanied, but some were separated from their parents as part of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy towards illegal immigration. Mrs Trump had changed out of the Zara coat by the time that she arrived in Texas Programme director Rogelio De La Cerda Jr told Mrs Trump that the majority of the children had arrived from Guatemala, and are normally  ""very distraught"" when they first arrive. Mrs Trump mingled with children during their lessons, asking them how long they had been in the facility and how often they are able to speak to their parents. ""Be kind and nice to others, OK?,"" she said, with her words at times being translated into Spanish. ""Good luck,"" she told another group of children. Twitter users were quick to criticise what they saw as the first lady's jacket faux pas and what some called the not-so-hidden message. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Sir Roger Singleton carried out a review on how abuse allegations were reported The Church of England ""botched"" its investigation into alleged cases of abuse, a report's author has said. Sir Roger Singleton, who reviewed the Church's ""flawed"" 2010 investigation, said it ""failed to give a complete picture"" of the abuse. But Sir Roger, whose report is due out next month, said he found ""no evidence of a planned deliberate attempt to mislead"". The Church has outlined four steps for improvement. They include the creation of an independently-chaired panel featuring survivors which will look at options to redress past cases, an independent ombudsman to review how complaints are handled and a strengthening of the clergy recruitment process. There will also be ""closer working with the Catholic Church to support survivors of sexual abuse"". Sir Roger, who was asked by the Church to review the 2010 Past Cases Review (PCR), told BBC Radio 4 Today the Church's investigators ""narrowed down"" the definition of who had been an abuser by limiting it ""to just new cases and cases where the Church took formal action"". He also said a survey the Church carried out ""wasn't completely comprehensive"", for example it didn't include some cathedrals or employees working with children in some parishes. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said the church's failures are ""deeply shaming"" The BBC has learned abuse allegations involving dead and retired clergy were also left out of the PCR which looked at more than 40,000 files. The review concluded that just 13 cases of alleged child sexual abuse needed formal action. Sir Roger, the former head of Barnardo's said the church's limitations ""had the impact"" of reducing the number of cases of abuse ""from probably near 100 to just two"". He also said it seems ""extraordinary"" now that the Church investigators did not meet with more victims and survivors but ""the importance of listening"" to them was ""less understood"" in 2010 than it is now. Sir Roger said the PCR had been ""well-intentioned"" but the Church needs to ""complete the incomplete job"" and review all the files. He also said the Church ""emphasised the positive aspects"" of the PCR in an attempt to ""protect the interests of the Church"". The Church must also put as much emphasis on preventing abuse as on reporting abuse allegations, he said. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the Church's failures were ""deeply shaming"". Survivors have accused the Church of a ""wholly inadequate"" response. Since March the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) has heard how the Church of England handled allegations of sexual misconduct stretching back to the 1950s. The Archbishops of York and Canterbury joined supporters of abuse victims in a silent protest The BBC has seen emails showing discussions and disagreements about which cases to include in the PCR. They show confusion about the criteria of who to include. Eventually the PCR excluded those who had died, retired, or who were deemed no longer to pose a risk. Other excluded cases related to a cleric who was allegedly addicted to pornography and another said to have had an ""obsessional interest in satanic ritual abuse"". Sexual offences which had been decriminalised were also left out, leaving the possibility that cases involving abuse of boys of the age of 16 or 17 went unrecorded. Allegations of grooming behaviour were also excluded. One diocesan bishop did not engage with the review at all and many files containing allegations remained unopened in filing cabinets. Justin Humphries said the Church may have failed to identify some abusers Justin Humphries of the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service says the review may have failed to identify some abusers. ""I can't say for sure but I think it would be fair to say that yes, that is a distinct possibility."" Documents also suggest the Church hierarchy worked behind the scenes to limit damage to the reputation of the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. In an email exchange in October 2010 - during theChichester sex abuse scandal- a press adviser to Dr Williams said ""the real danger here is that these stories are used to suggest that the CofE is as bad as Rome, both in abuse and cover-up"" and ""the aim must be to distance the current ABC (Archbishop of Canterbury) from it as much as poss"". Dr Williams told the inquiry he had not previously seen the email. Phil Johnson said the Church of England see 'survivors as the problem' In most cases survivors were not asked to give evidence to the PCR and there has been criticism of the Church for failing to fully involve them. Phil Johnson, who was abused by a clergyman in the Chichester Diocese, says the Church's response to survivors has been ""wholly inadequateâ¦ there's been a sense of paralysis almost on the part of the Church"" and ""of seeing the survivors as the problem"". The Church of England said it will support the recommendations in next month's report by Sir Roger and has also commissioned a survey from the Social Care Institute for Excellence, asking for the views of survivors.

"Actress Rhea Bailey, best known for playing Caz Hammond in Coronation Street, describes herself as being half West Indian and half English. To mark the 70th anniversary of Windrush, Rhea has been finding out more about her family history as part of a special report forBBC Radio 5 live. In the 1940s, West Indians were invited from British colonies in the Caribbean to come to the UK to help rebuild Britain after World War Two. Growing up, I always wondered why droves of people decided to leave paradise and come to jolly old England. I couldn't understand it. It was only recently that I discovered they were invited here. Their trips were even subsidised. No-one stowed away. No-one sneaked into the country or begged to get in. They were invited. My dad's parents emigrated from Saint Kitts in the 1960s. They came on the back of a promise of ""good jobs"" and ""great opportunities"". Saint Kitts, where Rhea's dad's family travelled from in the 1960s Growing up in a British colony, they were always immersed in British culture. My black grandparents enjoy a good cup of tea and a biscuit just as much as my white grandparents, who are Yorkshire born and bred. In fact, on a recent trip back to the island, the only request was that I bring rich tea biscuits and Tetley teabags. But 50 years ago, the reality of building a life here was very different. Settling in Leeds, my grandmother said, they were met with prejudice. They had only ever lived on a very small island in the heart of the Caribbean, surrounded by people who looked and talked the same as them. My grandmother said she never regretted leaving Saint Kitts - to her, it was an adventure. She was bored with her tiny island and wanted to see more of the world. Rhea's dad, Chris, as a boy My father had a scholarship to a private school, so he stayed behind with his grandma until he was 14. In Saint Kitts, they would make fudge together (a tradition he has passed onto me) and he would go swimming in the sea before school. Moving to England, he was reunited with his siblings but he was also met with prejudice, cruelty from teachers and racism from the police. I can't imagine what a culture shock it must have been. My dad is an intelligent guy. In his 20s, he got a job working on some of the first computers in the country - back when they were the size of entire rooms. As a result, he drove a red MG convertible. And although he loved it, he would get pulled over on a daily basis - just for being a young black man in a sports car. Rhea's mum and dad, Linda and Chris My granddad worked on the trains until he retired. My grandma worked in a factory. Their plan was only ever to stay until their kids had finished school and they had saved some money. But the reality of living in a more expensive country where wages were not what was advertised and raising a family proved difficult. Plus, they had started putting down roots. My dad met my mum on a night out when they were teenagers and they got married a few years later. My grandparents ended up living in the same house in Leeds for 30 years, where I remember running around playing games in my vest and knickers because the heating was always on full blast. Fifteen grandchildren later, they were finally able to retire back on Saint Kitts. The house they built is a great symbol of the fruition of all their hard work. I asked my grandmother and my great auntie, Millie, if I could interview them. They had some funny stories to tell. It was clear it had been an adventure. But after the interview my great auntie Millie also told me a sad story about how when she had been baptised, in Leeds, the minister had asked her if she would go last because another man did not want to be in the same water as a black woman. She also talked about how hard it had been for them to find somewhere to live, as no-one wanted black people in their neighbourhood. What was interesting to me was how guarded and private they were whenever I tried to speak about the hard times. It was as though they were keeping things from me. I notice it with my dad too. When I dig deep, he will tell a nice story or put a positive spin on it. I can only surmise that my father and my grandparents chose not to tell me all of the things they endured, so that I would be able to live in this country as an equal - to start life with a clean slate and not be angry or bitter about some of the things they went through. My parents and my grandparents did an incredible job of protecting me and my sisters from the racism they had received. I had a very happy childhood. I never felt out of place or unwelcome growing up. Rhea with her mum, Linda, and two sisters My oldest sister is the Grammy award winning artist, Corinne Bailey Rae. My second sister is a Labour councillor. And I am an actress and writer, who gets to travel the world doing the job I love. Everyone has their own reality of living in the UK, and though we were not rich, I recognise we have lived very privileged lives. I'm grateful to be British and thankful for the sacrifices my grandparents made for me. In my opinion, those that traded paradise to come and help rebuild our country deserve medals of honour, and nothing less.

Kate Spade had turned her name into a global accessories empire. She was particularly well known for her striking handbags.

"The rise of cheap, disposable clothes and their impact on the environment will be investigated by MPs. 'Fast fashion', worn a few times before being dumped, can add to landfill, release toxic chemicals in production and plastic fibres in the wash. The Commons environmental audit committee will look at how the industry could be made more sustainable. Thelatest report by campaigners Wrap,externalsuggests that about 300,000 tonnes of clothing is binned in the UK each year. That figure from 2015 is 50,000 tonnes less than it was three years earlier but Wrap says the clothing industry still has the fourth largest environmental impact, after housing, transport and food. Stella McCartney: 'We have to offer solutions' The problem with 'fast fashion' Used clothes: Why is demand declining? The fast fashion phenomenon - cheap clothing with a quick turnover that encourages people to keep buying -has come under fire,externalover its environmental impact, including water pollution, the use of toxic chemicals and textile waste. Committee chairwoman Mary Creagh said: ""The way we design, make and discard clothes has a huge environmental impact. Producing clothes requires toxic chemicals and produces climate-changing emissions. ""Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain and into the oceans. We don't know where or how to recycle end of life clothing. ""Our inquiry will look at how the fashion industry can remodel itself to be both thriving and sustainable."" The committee is inviting people to comment by September on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, waste, unwanted clothing and working conditions in UK garment factories. Among the questions it will ask is whether fast fashion is unsustainable, and what can be done to encourage people to buy fewer clothes and think more about how they are disposed of.

"This video can not be played Airbus loss 'would be an absolute disaster for Broughton' Thousands of Welsh jobs are at risk as Airbus has warned it could leave the UK if it exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal after Brexit. The European planemaker employs more than 6,000 people at its wing factory at Broughton in Flintshire and about 400 people at its base in Newport. The Welsh Government saidAirbus' warningwas ""extremely worrying"". ""The UK cannot take the economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift,"" it said. Airbus said the warning was not part of ""project fear, but it was a ""dawning reality"". Meanwhile Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has sparked a row within his party after a statement from the Brexiteeraccused the firm of making threats and doing a disservice to workers. Many employees of the firm have ""grave concerns"" about the future, according to union Unite's convener for Broughton Darren Reynolds. Meet the gargantuan air freighter that looks like a whale Plane flies Airbus wings from Broughton to France Brexit delays 'would damage' aerospace industry Speaking outside the factory, he said: ""I have just been speaking with the members locally in the plant and they are really concerned now regarding what the future looks like for Airbus."" Mr Reynolds said he had visited Downing Street twice this year to discuss the impact of Brexit with government ministers but was not sure they understood the concerns. He said: ""This site here employs 6,500 people, it's key to this area and the north west to have the jobs that we do."" This video can not be played Economy Secretary Ken Skates says the Airbus warning is ""deeply worrying"" Many people from Wales also travel to Airbus' Filton plant in Bristol, which employs a further 3,000 people, where wings are assembled. A further 2,500 work at sites in Portsmouth and in Stevenage. It is estimated that the aviation giant supports about 11,600 jobs in Wales alone in the supply chain. First Minister Carwyn Jones is holding talks with UK ministers and political counterparts at a meeting of the British Irish Council in Guernsey on Friday, where the issue is expected to be raised.

He has already issued a joint statement with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonurging the prime minister to pledge to stay in the EU's single market and customs union. They have warned that Theresa May's plan for the UK's departure from the EU was not ""consistent with the national interest"". Wings for all the Airbus commercial planes are made in Wales In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". Brexit: All you need to know Airbus warns over Brexit free movement Airbus stresses need for Brexit deal ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added. The company, which makes all the wings for its passenger planes at its Deeside plant, also said the current planned transition period which is due to end in December 2020 was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK. Analysis from Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This is not a shock in that Airbus has been warning for years that it might be less likely to invest in Wales and the rest of the UK in future if it doesn't have easy access to the EU. It is a sign of its increasing frustration with the lack of clarity over the future trading relationship that it is now saying its long-term commitments, including to its Flintshire plant, could be in doubt. Airbus currently has workers and products moving quickly and seamlessly across EU countries and it is planning for what happens if that stops after Brexit. There are also a number of companies in Flintshire whose business in a large part revolves around supplying Airbus so there would be a ripple effect on the local economy if it invests less or begins to withdraw completely. Some have argued that the company wouldn't really do this but many said the same about Tata's warnings over a number of years that it was at risk due to high energy costs and cheap Chinese steel. Politicians only made moves to tackle its problems after it put its entire UK operations up for sale. ""Workers urgently require reassurance,"" said local assembly member Jack Sargeant, who has also called for an emergency statement in the Senedd. The union Unite, which is the main union representing Airbus workers, said a 'cliff-edge' Brexit was becoming a ""cold hard reality"". ""It would be a betrayal of Airbus workers, their families and the tens of thousands workers in the wider supply chain if the government failed to secure frictionless trade and access to the customs union and single market,"" said the union's Steve Turner. Wings from Broughton are airlifted to France to complete production of the planes Responding to the comments from Airbus, a UK government official said: ""We have made significant progress towards agreeing a deep and special partnership with the EU to ensure trade remains as free and frictionless as possible, including in the aerospace sector, and we're confident of getting a good deal that is mutually beneficial. ""Given the good progress that we are continuing to make in the negotiations we do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise.""

"This video can not be played Sir Roger Singleton carried out a review on how abuse allegations were reported The Church of England ""botched"" its investigation into alleged cases of abuse, a report's author has said. Sir Roger Singleton, who reviewed the Church's ""flawed"" 2010 investigation, said it ""failed to give a complete picture"" of the abuse. But Sir Roger, whose report is due out next month, said he found ""no evidence of a planned deliberate attempt to mislead"". The Church has outlined four steps for improvement. They include the creation of an independently-chaired panel featuring survivors which will look at options to redress past cases, an independent ombudsman to review how complaints are handled and a strengthening of the clergy recruitment process. There will also be ""closer working with the Catholic Church to support survivors of sexual abuse"". Sir Roger, who was asked by the Church to review the 2010 Past Cases Review (PCR), told BBC Radio 4 Today the Church's investigators ""narrowed down"" the definition of who had been an abuser by limiting it ""to just new cases and cases where the Church took formal action"". He also said a survey the Church carried out ""wasn't completely comprehensive"", for example it didn't include some cathedrals or employees working with children in some parishes. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said the church's failures are ""deeply shaming"" The BBC has learned abuse allegations involving dead and retired clergy were also left out of the PCR which looked at more than 40,000 files. The review concluded that just 13 cases of alleged child sexual abuse needed formal action. Sir Roger, the former head of Barnardo's said the church's limitations ""had the impact"" of reducing the number of cases of abuse ""from probably near 100 to just two"". He also said it seems ""extraordinary"" now that the Church investigators did not meet with more victims and survivors but ""the importance of listening"" to them was ""less understood"" in 2010 than it is now. Sir Roger said the PCR had been ""well-intentioned"" but the Church needs to ""complete the incomplete job"" and review all the files. He also said the Church ""emphasised the positive aspects"" of the PCR in an attempt to ""protect the interests of the Church"". The Church must also put as much emphasis on preventing abuse as on reporting abuse allegations, he said. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the Church's failures were ""deeply shaming"". Survivors have accused the Church of a ""wholly inadequate"" response. Since March the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) has heard how the Church of England handled allegations of sexual misconduct stretching back to the 1950s. The Archbishops of York and Canterbury joined supporters of abuse victims in a silent protest The BBC has seen emails showing discussions and disagreements about which cases to include in the PCR. They show confusion about the criteria of who to include. Eventually the PCR excluded those who had died, retired, or who were deemed no longer to pose a risk. Other excluded cases related to a cleric who was allegedly addicted to pornography and another said to have had an ""obsessional interest in satanic ritual abuse"". Sexual offences which had been decriminalised were also left out, leaving the possibility that cases involving abuse of boys of the age of 16 or 17 went unrecorded. Allegations of grooming behaviour were also excluded. One diocesan bishop did not engage with the review at all and many files containing allegations remained unopened in filing cabinets. Justin Humphries said the Church may have failed to identify some abusers Justin Humphries of the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service says the review may have failed to identify some abusers. ""I can't say for sure but I think it would be fair to say that yes, that is a distinct possibility."" Documents also suggest the Church hierarchy worked behind the scenes to limit damage to the reputation of the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. In an email exchange in October 2010 - during theChichester sex abuse scandal- a press adviser to Dr Williams said ""the real danger here is that these stories are used to suggest that the CofE is as bad as Rome, both in abuse and cover-up"" and ""the aim must be to distance the current ABC (Archbishop of Canterbury) from it as much as poss"". Dr Williams told the inquiry he had not previously seen the email. Phil Johnson said the Church of England see 'survivors as the problem' In most cases survivors were not asked to give evidence to the PCR and there has been criticism of the Church for failing to fully involve them. Phil Johnson, who was abused by a clergyman in the Chichester Diocese, says the Church's response to survivors has been ""wholly inadequateâ¦ there's been a sense of paralysis almost on the part of the Church"" and ""of seeing the survivors as the problem"". The Church of England said it will support the recommendations in next month's report by Sir Roger and has also commissioned a survey from the Social Care Institute for Excellence, asking for the views of survivors.

"Roseanne Barr's tweets led to the cancellation of her hit TV sitcom ABC has ordered a spinoff to comedy series Roseanne, without the involvement of its creator and namesake, Roseanne Barr. The original writers, producers and cast members will appear in the new show, given the working title The Conners. Ms Barr will not receive any payment for the series, ABC said. The network cancelled Roseanne in May, immediately after Ms Barr posted a racist tweet. Later blaming sedative pill Ambien for her words,the comedian likened a former aide to President Barack Obama to an ape. Roseanne's five most controversial moments White House defiant on Roseanne race row A vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, Ms Barr received support from the White House in the ensuing scandal. This video can not be played President Trump once told supporters Roseanne ""was about us"" The Conners will start in the autumn and is expected to have Roseanne's daughter Darlene, played by Sara Gilbert, as the main protagonist. Aside from Ms Gilbert, core cast members John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Lecy Goranson and Michael Fishman will also star in the 10-episode season. In a joint statement the five said their characters ""not only have a place in our hearts, but in the hearts and homes of our audience, ""We are so happy to have the opportunity to return with the cast and crew to continue to share those stories through love and laughter."" For her part, Ms Barr expressed ""regret"" for her removal, saying in a statement she agreed to a settlement with ABC ""in order that 200 jobs of beloved cast and crew could be saved"" and wished the best for all involved.

"The House of Commons spent Â£2.4m on ""gagging clauses"" for former staff since 2013, BBC Newsnight has learned. Fifty-three departing members of the House of Commons Service signed contracts compelling them not to reveal information about the Commons. So-called ""non-disclosure agreements"" (NDAs) can be used to silence victims of bullying or harassment. A House spokesman said the clauses were used ""to resolve employment disputes under certain circumstances"". Newsnight uncovered the information via a Freedom of Information Act request, which was made as part of its investigation into bullying and harassment by MPs of members of the House of Commons Service - the apolitical employees who run the Commons and its committees. These people are usually referred to in Westminster as ""clerks"". Newsnight has previously reported thatAngus Sinclair, formerly the Speaker's secretary, was paid Â£86,000 - more than a year of pay - as part of a settlement that entailed him signing anon-disclosure agreement. He felt he was being paid off to stay quiet about being bullied by the Speaker of the House of Commons (an allegation that the Speaker denies). The answer to the request reveals that Â£2.4m was spent on 53 settlements including gagging clauses with departing staff members since 2013. (The Press Association has, by the same means, got the same information which they are publishing independently.) The average settlement cost Â£45,418. Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government, said: ""The public sector should not be allowed to waste taxpayers' money on NDAs"". She said it was ""impossible to justify as [value for money]"". These figures are a slight underestimate. There may also be some other cases in 2012 and 2018, but the numbers involved are small enough that they fear publishing them would allow people to figure out information about identifiable individuals. The House of Commons reply to Newsnight clarifies that the NDAs were ""settlement agreements (formerly known as compromise agreements) which include a confidentiality clause"". It is unclear how many of these contracts were signed, as Mr Sinclair believes was the case for him, in order to prevent information about bullying or harassment leaking out. Newsnight has established, however, that confidentiality clauses were not standard in House of Commons exit deals: the annual report for the financial year 2016-17 shows 43 people left the House on ""exit packages"", but only 23 were given NDAs in all of 2016 and 2017.  We also know that people, known toNewsnight, who had made complaints about sexual harassment or bullying at the House were asked to sign NDAs when they left with an exit deal. Some other NDAs, however, were really a means of getting rid of a staff member more easily. Getting them to sign a non-disclosure agreement could be used as a justification for a bigger pay-off. Gagging clauses are sometimes suggested by unions to get more money out of employers for a departing member of staff. So while some of these NDAs may have been intended to keep the culture under wraps, it is not clear how many that applies to. The House of Commons, however, is now likely to face questions about its use of NDAs. The House of Commons does not have trade secrets, for example, that might justify the use of gagging clauses. Maria Miller, chair of the women and equalities committee, which is researching the use of NDAs, said: ""There needs to be more transparency on why payments such as this are being made in the first place.""

"Orpheus Pledger plays Mason Morgan on Home and Away Home and Away actor Orpheus Pledger has described how he intervened to help a woman who was being attacked on an Australian street. The 25-year-old, who plays Mason Morgan in the Australian soap, said he had spotted the woman apparently being followed by a man in Sydney last year. When the woman was approached and thrown to the ground, Pledger grabbed the attacker and helped restrain him. The man, 28, was convicted of assault this week, Australian media reported. Pledger said he had noticed a ""suspicious character"" emerge from an alleyway during a walk at night. ""I instantly drew my attention to this person - my instinct told me something was wrong,"" said Pledger, who gave evidence to a court in April. Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported,externalthat Pledger could not speak publicly about the case, an attempted robbery, until it had concluded. The actor's account comes amid intense discussion in Australia about violence in public places followingthe high-profile killing of a young comedian in Melbourne. Pledger said he had acted after seeing the man run up behind the woman and throw her to the ground. ""In that moment my instincts kicked in and I ran up and was screaming, 'stop stop stop',"" he told the BBC. ""I pulled him off her and was holding him back physically while yelling out for someone to call the police."" He said nearby residents had alerted authorities and helped restrain the man until police arrived.

Pledger said the victim was ""ok"", but could not give further details. ""Violence towards anyone should never be tolerated,"" the actor said. The killing of comedian Eurydice Dixon, whose body was found in a Melbourne park last week, has prompted a wide-ranging discussion in Australia about bettering public safety.

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre The Pentagon has been asked to supply up to 20,000 beds at old military bases for migrant children held after illegally entering the US. Beds will be for migrant children who crossed the border unaccompanied, as well as those separated from parents. The moves follow President Donald Trump's reversal of the controversial separation policy. First Lady Melania Trump visited a facility for migrant children in Texas saying she wanted to reunite families. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Melania wears 'I really don't care' coat But her visit to the facility for young migrants was thrown into controversy after she was photographed wearing a jacket with the words ""I really don't care do u?"" as she boarded the plane to Texas. Melania Trump was spotted in the jacket while boarding her flight to Texas Plans for accommodating migrant children at military bases first came to light in May.Emails seen by US media revealed the bases would house minors,externalwho have crossed into the US without an adult relative as well as those who have been separated from their parents at the border. President Trump says he has directed agencies to begin reuniting children and parents separated after entering the US illegally. At least 2,300 children have been taken from their parents since 5 May after entering the country without documentation at the US-Mexico border. While the adults are held in custody pending court appearances, the children are being sent to holding cells, converted warehouses and desert tents under the ""zero tolerance"" policy introduced in April. Officials have also gone to court to try to lengthen the time children can be held as parents are prosecuted. A vote on a Republican bill on immigration has been postponed until at least Friday as it does not have enough support in the House of Representatives. Mr Trump had said that only Congress could resolve the issue of separated families but on Wednesday he signed an executive order to keep children with their families but in detention. The president's executive order,externalsays adults who illegally enter the US with children still face prosecution. It also calls for: Immigrant families to be detained together while their legal cases are considered Expediting immigration cases involving families Agencies, including the Pentagon, to construct facilities or make existing facilities available ""for the housing and care of alien families"" This video can not be played Mayor on reuniting families: 'It's going to be a Herculean task' A ruling known as the Flores Settlement dating from 1997 places a limit of 20 days on the detention of migrant children - with their families or alone. The Justice Department is now going to court in California to seek a modification to that limit, as the president's executive order requests. But analysts say it is unlikely the limit on detaining minors can be overturned within the next 20 days. Psychological impact on separated children Who decided to take the children away? Guatemalan undocumented immigrant Beata Mejia Mejia is suing the US government for allegedly violating her human rights when they took away her son, Darwin, after she crossed the US border.

"This video can not be played Sir Roger Singleton carried out a review on how abuse allegations were reported The Church of England ""botched"" its investigation into alleged cases of abuse, a report's author has said. Sir Roger Singleton, who reviewed the Church's ""flawed"" 2010 investigation, said it ""failed to give a complete picture"" of the abuse. But Sir Roger, whose report is due out next month, said he found ""no evidence of a planned deliberate attempt to mislead"". The Church has outlined four steps for improvement. They include the creation of an independently-chaired panel featuring survivors which will look at options to redress past cases, an independent ombudsman to review how complaints are handled and a strengthening of the clergy recruitment process. There will also be ""closer working with the Catholic Church to support survivors of sexual abuse"". Sir Roger, who was asked by the Church to review the 2010 Past Cases Review (PCR), told BBC Radio 4 Today the Church's investigators ""narrowed down"" the definition of who had been an abuser by limiting it ""to just new cases and cases where the Church took formal action"". He also said a survey the Church carried out ""wasn't completely comprehensive"", for example it didn't include some cathedrals or employees working with children in some parishes. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said the church's failures are ""deeply shaming"" The BBC has learned abuse allegations involving dead and retired clergy were also left out of the PCR which looked at more than 40,000 files. The review concluded that just 13 cases of alleged child sexual abuse needed formal action. Sir Roger, the former head of Barnardo's said the church's limitations ""had the impact"" of reducing the number of cases of abuse ""from probably near 100 to just two"". He also said it seems ""extraordinary"" now that the Church investigators did not meet with more victims and survivors but ""the importance of listening"" to them was ""less understood"" in 2010 than it is now. Sir Roger said the PCR had been ""well-intentioned"" but the Church needs to ""complete the incomplete job"" and review all the files. He also said the Church ""emphasised the positive aspects"" of the PCR in an attempt to ""protect the interests of the Church"". The Church must also put as much emphasis on preventing abuse as on reporting abuse allegations, he said. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the Church's failures were ""deeply shaming"".

Mission Lifeline, however, later posted an image on Twitter of a registration document,externalit says proves the ships sail under the Dutch flag. The group also tweeted that it had carried out another rescue overnight, though it is not clear how many additional migrants, if any, boarded their ship. Allow Twitter content?

The NGO's co-founder, Axel Steier, denied breaking any laws and defended his organisation's actions. ""In this situation you can't wait,"" he said. ""If you have a rescue you prevent people from dying, from drowning and then you have to make the decisions. You can't wait until someone has a port for you - you have to act immediately."" The planned seizure of the Lifeline and Seefuchs comes amid a deepening row over migrant rescues after Italy's new populist government refused earlier this month to take in a stranded rescue ship carrying 630 migrants. The Aquarius eventually sailed to Spainafter it was also turned away by Malta. It has now resumed its operations at sea. This video can not be played After a week of being in the political spotlight, the rescue ship Aquarius is back at sea French President Emmanuel Macron has accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the Aquarius dock. Then on Thursday, without referring directly to Italy, Mr Macron attacked the ""leprosy"" of anti-EU feeling among ""friends and neighbours"". Mr Salvini hit back at the French president. ""We may be leper populists, but I take the lessons from those who open their own ports. Welcome thousands of migrants and then we can talk,"" the interior minister said. The migrant crisis has caused deepening rifts between EU member states Leaders from 10 EU member states will meet in Brussels on Sunday to discuss how best to stem the flow of migrants to the bloc. The Italian government has saidit will not sign up to any EU plan unless it makes helping Italy a priority, while Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary - known as the Visegrad Group - say they will boycott the talks. Italy's government wants to deport half a million undocumented migrants, many of whom are housed in squalid reception centres. More than 600,000 have reached Italy from Libya in the past four years.

"EU citizens will have to answer three ""simple"" questions online if they want to continue living in the UK after Brexit, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the government's ""default"" position would be to grant, not refuse, settled status. People will be asked to prove their ID, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK. Their answers will be checked against government databases and a decision given ""very quickly"", said Mr Javid. The scheme,externalwill operate online and via a smartphone app, Mr Javid said, and would be ""as simple as people can reasonably expect"", with most decisions turned around within two weeks or sooner. What now for EU citizens in the UK? Brexit: All you need to know May to fight post-Brexit residency move Speaking to a House of Lords committee, Mr Javid said there would have to be ""a very good reason"" why an application would be refused. The Home Office said the criminal record checks would be about ""serious and persistent criminality, not parking fines"". The Â£170m scheme will be compulsory for all EU citizens living in the UK - the government expects a total of 3.5 million applications. EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for ""settled status"", meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely. Those who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status. The scheme also includes citizens of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Applications will cost Â£65 for adults and Â£32.50 for children and be free for EU nationals who already have residency or indefinite leave to remain. Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph. The process requires verification of the applicant's identity and nationality using a passport, ID card or other valid document, which can be done using a smartphone app or through secure post. The government hopes to start trials within a few weeks, with people allowed to start registering in the autumn. Mr Javid told the Lords EU Justice sub-committee he wanted it to be fully operational by the ""start of next year"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""surge"" of applicants when the UK leaves the EU in March. The scheme would run for at least two years after Brexit day, probably to around June 2021, said the home secretary. Applicants without smartphones or computers will be able to fill in their application online at libraries and special contact centres Those without access to computers, or who are unable to use them, will be given assistance and may be visited at home by immigration officials Help with translation will also be offered People from the Republic of Ireland will not need to apply for settled status but can do so if they wish to Those with pre-settled status will be able to obtain settled status without additional charge People who use Apple devices may have to send their passports in to verify their ID The hope is that most applicants will not have to provide supporting documents because their answers will be checked against HM Revenue and Customs and other government databases. Applicants with Android phones will be able to download an app which can read the chip in their passport to verify their identity - and they will be able to take a ""selfie"" that can be checked against Home Office records, said Mr Javid. But he said there was an ""an issue at the moment"" with Apple device users, who will not be able to make use of this app, and instead will have to send in their passport to prove their identity. The home secretary said he had raised the issue with Apple on a recent visit to Silicon Valley and the company was ""looking at it actively"". Analysis by BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What the Home Office is embarking on is a hugely complex project within a tight timescale. When challenged about the potential for it go wrong, officials point to the Passport Office as an example of a service successfully processing millions of cases every year. But unlike the biometric passport system, the EU registration scheme is being built from scratch. For hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, who have a straightforward and legitimate employment history in Britain and are comfortable using digital technology, their applications may well be resolved ""within days"", the time officials rather ambitiously claim cases will take. But for claimants hoping to bring in relatives, people unfamiliar with computers and those with a more sketchy background in Britain, perhaps involving some cash-in-hand work, the process may be a hurdle they'll struggle with - or avoid altogether.

Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said ""far more"" answers were needed from the government ""about what happens to those who aren't registered by June 2021 through no fault of their own, such as children"". ""At the moment it appears that if children aren't registered within the next three years then they will lose their legal rights even though they may have been here all their lives."" SNP home affairs spokeswoman Jo Cherry, speaking in the Commons, said: ""There are potentially significant numbers of people who could fall through the cracks here. ""If just 5% of the estimated three million EU citizens living in the UK don't register by the deadline there would be a population of nearly 200,000 left without status."" Former Labour minister Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, asked ministers if the scheme would still stand in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""We have confidence that there will be a deal."" Sajid Javid: Lessons have been learned from Windrush scandal Sajid Javid promised there would be no repeat of the Windrush scandal - which saw people who had lived in the UK for decades threatened with deportation because they did not have the right paperwork - for EU migrants, adding ""lessons had been learned"". The new ""settled status"" scheme would establish the right of EU migrants to remain in the UK, unlike in the case of Windrush families where there was only an assumption they had a right to stay, without any documentary proof, he told the committee. The home secretary accused EU nations, such as France and Spain, of failing to match the UK's progress on plans for expats after Brexit. There are about 900,000 UK citizens in the EU, according to ONS figures. Both sides of the Brexit negotiations have resolved to secure the status of expats by the time the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. But any deal they reach will have to be ratified by the European Parliament and agreed to by member states. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the status of British citizens living in the EU member states is less certain. The UK would expect member states to allow Britons living in the EU the same rights as it plans to grant EU citizens in the UK but it would be down to individual countries to decide what to do.

"This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us? The European Union (EU) has introduced retaliatory tariffs on US goods as a top official launched a fresh attack on President Donald Trump's trade policy. The duties on â¬2.8bn (Â£2.4bn) worth of US goods came into force on Friday. Tariffs have been imposed on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said duties imposed by the US on the EU go against ""all logic and history"".

The Trump administration announced in March that it would introduce tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US. Mr Trump has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatens American steel and aluminium producers, which are vital to the US. After being deferred, the duties on steel and aluminium went ahead on 1 June and affect the EU, Canada, Mexico and other close US allies, including India. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and US President Donald Trump (R) For its part, India has said it will raise taxes on 29 products imported from the US - including some agricultural goods, steel and iron products - in retaliation for the wide-ranging US tariffs. The new duties will come into effect from 4 August and will affect US almonds, walnuts and chick peas, among other products. South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs. However, Canada has announced it will impose retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6bn (Â£9.5bn) worth of US exports from 1 July. And Mexico put tariffs on $3bn worth of American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon two weeks ago. Earlier this week, Mr Trump threatened to impose 10% duties on an additional $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of Chinese goods which he said would come into force if China ""refuses to change its practices"". However, China accused the US of an act of ""extreme pressure and blackmail"" and said it would respond with ""strong counter-measures"". President Trump believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out. He is especially irked by the hefty deficits in US trade with China and Mexico, but has indicated that he will not let any country ""take advantage of us on trade any more"". Allow Twitter content?

The US trade deficit has increased in recent years, running at about $50bn (Â£38bn) a month. However, this could be the result of a stronger economy, with US consumers buying more goods from overseas. The new tariffs are meant to correct this imbalance. There were confrontational scenes and words after the recent G7 summit in Quebec, at which the leaders of other major world economies challenged Mr Trump's tariffs and trade policies. A war of words erupted between the US and its G7 allies after the summit The majority of US goods targeted by the EU, such as tobacco, Harley Davidson motorcycles, cranberries and peanut butter, will now carry a tariff of 25%. However, the EU has introduced a 50% duty on goods such as footwear, some types of clothing, and washing machines. Many of the products the EU has in its sights are specifically chosen to have maximum political effect. Bourbon whiskey is produced in Kentucky, the state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Orange juice is a key export for Florida, a swing state in the US elections. Meanwhile, economists have warned the US tariffs could lead to higher metal costs, disrupt supply chains and even get passed on to US households. It's difficult to tell. US trade officials have said they deliberately targeted a list of imports that will not raise prices for consumers. But retailers and producers do not agree. Rick Helfenbein, president and chief executive officer of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, says the average family of four in the US will pay at least an extra $500 a year to buy consumer products affected by the tariffs. In some cases, the tariffs may simply compel firms to seek supplies from other countries rather than pay the extra cost. If, for instance, Florida orange juice goes up in price in Europe because of the EU counter-tariffs, then firms can always import Brazilian orange juice instead. For the US, that would be an unintended consequence of the tit-for-tat spat. But it's a good example of how trade wars can take unexpected turns.

"This video can not be played Lauren Wright, politics and public affairs expert, on the significance of Melania Trump's ""I don't care"" jacket First Lady Melania Trump has been criticised for her choice of jacket worn on a trip to a migrant child detention centre in Texas. Mrs Trump was spotted in the coat, which featured graffiti writing on the back with the words ""I really don't care do u?"", as she boarded a plane. Her spokeswoman said ""there was no hidden message"" in the former fashion model's sartorial choice. The $39 (Â£29) jacket from Zara caused an uproar on social media.

Mrs Trump was not seen wearing the coat when she first arrived in Texas, but had it on again when she returned to Washington DC. Katty Kay, BBC World News presenter, Washington Melania Trump's empathetic visit to the Mexican border risks being overshadowed by the unempathetic message on the back of her coat. It stretches credulity that the first lady would make the effort to fly down to Texas, visit children, talk to staff and engage in this heartbreaking story only to deliberately  undermine it with a callous choice of clothing. It's not clear how this was allowed to slip through the careful White House protocols but it's a mistake on the part of her staff. I give her the benefit of the doubt on compassion - but if she chose to wear this without thinking, it was pretty tone deaf. This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""I want to help reunite children with their families"" Mrs Trump made the previously unannounced visit to a child migrant detention centre on Thursday, saying she wanted to help reunite migrant children who were separated from their families. Her tour of the federally-funded New Hope Children's Shelter in McAllen, Texas, housing dozens of Central American children came as her husband's administration sought to quell the firestorm over migrant separations. Confusion over fate of US migrant children All the context you need on migrant children story The majority of the 55 children housed at the facility crossed the border unaccompanied, but some were separated from their parents as part of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy towards illegal immigration. Mrs Trump had changed out of the Zara coat by the time that she arrived in Texas Programme director Rogelio De La Cerda Jr told Mrs Trump that the majority of the children had arrived from Guatemala, and are normally  ""very distraught"" when they first arrive. Mrs Trump mingled with children during their lessons, asking them how long they had been in the facility and how often they are able to speak to their parents. ""Be kind and nice to others, OK?,"" she said, with her words at times being translated into Spanish. ""Good luck,"" she told another group of children. Twitter users were quick to criticise what they saw as the first lady's jacket faux pas and what some called the not-so-hidden message. Allow Twitter content?

"Windrush generation members and their families were invited to the Westminster Abbey service More than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Empire Windrush ship to the UK. Hymns including Amazing Grace were played on steel drums as guests, including families of the Windrush generation, entered Westminster Abbey. The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain. But there continues to be concern over a scandal which saw some of the generation wrongly face deportation. As the music played in the abbey, Baroness Floella Benjamin was applauded as she briefly danced in the nave. The Liberal Democrat peer and patron of the Windrush Foundation said that she felt ""joy"", adding: ""I was floating, like a bird, free."" Prime Minister Theresa May, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and London Mayor Sadiq Khan attended the service, along with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Among the guests was Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen. By Helena Lee, BBC News Under the warm June sun the guests, more than 2,000 of them, queued outside the abbey ahead of the service. They shared stories with each other. They wanted to celebrate. Many of them were families of the Windrush generation. Karen Gibson's mother came to Britain from Guyana in 1962. She said her mother heard stories of ""gold on the streets"" of the UK. There was a heart-warming moment too. A handshake between two men, in their nineties, who unknown to each other, had both been on the Empire Windrush ship 70 years ago. Andria Marsh, 63, held up photographs of her parents and her original British passport after the Windrush service At the service, a short drama telling the story of how Caribbean migrants were invited to ""The Motherland"" to help rebuild post-war Britain was performed by actors. Addressing the congregation, the Reverend Canon Joel Edwards said: ""Settling down hasn't been plain sailing. ""The children of Windrush have experienced over-representation in Britain's prisons and mental health institutions. Knife crimes. ""Underachievement in education and the job market. Settlement has meant racism, sometimes too much policing and not enough protection. And Stephen Lawrence."" But he added: ""Windrush resilience arises, supremely."" The Dean of Westminster (right) wore a robe decorated with a photo montage of aspects of black history in Britain He described the Windrush as having ""gifted"" Britain with leaders in the worlds of politics, business, education, music and sport and acknowledged the influence of the Caribbean on British cuisine, including ""rice and peas, jerk chicken and Levi Roots sauce in our supermarkets"". Mr Edwards also referenced the scandal that has seen some Windrush members wrongly face deportation. He said: ""In recent months the word 'Windrush' has evoked a great deal of emotion and even anger across our political landscape. In this service of thanksgiving, Windrush means more than migration."" The service included the first performance of a specially composed anthem entitled Psalm To Windrush: For The Brave And Ingenious. Windrush generation 'deserve medals' The Windrush spark that never died 'The British Empire is nothing to be proud of' The Very Rev John Hall, Dean of Westminster, wore a robe decorated with a photo montage of aspects of black history in Britain since the arrival of Windrush. John Richards, 92, who came to Britain on the Windrush aged 21, said the service was ""great"". ""It brings back memories, yes, but I'm too old for the emotion,"" he said. Alford Gardner, a member of the Windrush generation, has lived in Leeds most of his life, but said that was not his intention when he arrived. The 92-year-old said: ""The plan was to come to England, get a good job, work for about five years, go back... but it wasn't to be. ""Within five years I had started a family and married. I had bought me house, working hard and settled down."" Mr Khan said it was a ""moving"" service in honour of a generation that ""contributes so much to our capital"". Allow Twitter content?

But Glenda Ceasar, who was born in Dominica in the 1960s, said she never got a British passport and lost her job recently because she could not prove her legal status. She said: ""So many years down the line... we're faced with this. ""The ship to me, the Windrush, it seems as if it was... we were just slaves being brought over here to be punished later on in life. That's the way that I feel."" Nearly 500 Caribbean migrants from countries including Jamaica, Bermuda and Trinidad exited the Windrush on 22 June 1948 when it docked at Tilbury in Essex. They had applied to job adverts after World War II with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948. This video can not be played What was life like for first-generation Windrush migrants? The Westminster Abbey service commemorates the contribution the migrants and their families have made to the UK. Meanwhile, a celebration of Caribbean culture marked the anniversary at Tilbury Docks. The government has also announced Baroness Benjamin is to lead a commemoration committee overseeing the creation of a ""fitting legacy"" to the Windrush generation. A statue celebrating their achievements is among the ideas for the permanent tribute. Nearly 500 Caribbean immigrants were on the Empire Windrush when it arrived 70 years ago Baroness Benjamin, a former children's television presenter and Lib Dem peer, was born in Trinidad but emigrated to the UK with her family in 1960. She said: ""This a significant step in recognising the contribution made to Britain by Caribbean people and this committee will make sure the work and sacrifices of the Windrush pioneers will live on in the hearts and minds of future generations."" This video can not be played Three Windrush generation migrants The right to remain in the UK for Commonwealth migrants who arrived before 1973 was supposed to be legally guaranteed. But it emerged this year that some migrants from the Windrush generation - many of them who arrived as children  - hadfaced deportation. They were being refused healthcare and access to jobs because they did not have the paperwork to prove their status following a tightening of immigration rules in 2014. The government has since apologised for the crisis and says a dedicated taskforce has now provided documentation to over 2,000 people demonstrating their right to live in the UK. Earlier this week, the government announced an annual Windrush Day would take place. Windrush generation: Three stories.

"The UK6 number plate has been in private ownership for more than 50 years Two rare number plates, including one first issued in 1910, are to be put up for auction. One, UK6, was issued just seven years after number plates were introduced and has been in private ownership for more than 50 years. It is set to be put up for auction by Humber & Ellis Auctioneers in Northamptonshire alongside 1RAN. Both are expected to fetch around Â£50,000 when they go under the hammer on 28 June. The auction house said the 1RAN plate ""may be of interest to athletes or ambassadors alike"". Those interested in 1RAN may be keeping one keen eye on the country's team at the World Cup It recently sold a number plate with the""head-turning"" TAX 1 emblazoned on it for Â£92,000. Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said: ""The market in private and cherished number plates is very much on the up.

"Airbus has warned it could leave the UK if it exits the European Union single market and customs union without a transition deal. The European planemaker said the warning was not part of ""project fear"", but was a ""dawning reality"". Airbus employs 14,000 people at 25 sites in the UK - around half in Wales. The UK government said it was confident of getting a good deal for all industries, but the Welsh government said it was ""extremely worrying"". In its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday,external, Airbus said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - meaning it left both the single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country,"" it added. The company, which makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK, also said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. As a result, it would ""refrain from extending"" its UK supplier base. It said it currently had more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK. Please upgrade your browser The customs union brings together the EU's 28 members in a duty-free area, in which they pay the same rate of duty on non-EU goods Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out staying in the customs union. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The UK government is considering two other options: a customs partnership that would remove the need for new customs checks at the border; and a ""highly streamlined"" customs arrangement that would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether. Michel Barnier, the EU's Brexit negotiator, has said that both options are unrealistic. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We are confident that we are going to get a good deal, one that ensures that trade is as free and frictionless as possible, including for the aerospace sector,"" A Welsh government spokespersonsaid: ""We have repeatedly warned that the UK cannot take the huge economic risk of cutting ourselves adrift from the single market and customs union. Particularly in the case of manufacturing sectors, which in Wales are so important in providing high-paid, high-skilled jobs."" Simon Jack, business editor It has been a source of exasperation for some cabinet members that although many companies have privately expressed concern - even alarm - at the progress of the Brexit negotiations, they have been reluctant to make their fears public, and have even dialled down the shrillness of their warnings when meeting the prime minister in person. Airbus' decision to warn that future investment in their operations in the UK are under review, while not exactly welcome, is therefore considered by some in government as an honest and helpful declaration of what's at stake for UK workers and the wider economy. Prominent Brexit supporter Sir Bernard Jenkin described Airbus' comments as the kind of ""speculation"" seen before, during and after the referendum from large companies. But Airbus' UK boss, Katherine Bennett, told the BBC, ""this is not project fear, this is dawning reality"". Tom Williams, chief operating officer of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said in ""any scenario"", Brexit had ""severe negative consequences"" for the UK aerospace industry and Airbus in particular. Without a deal, he said Airbus believed the impact on its UK operations could be ""significant"". ""Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus' future in the UK."" Brexit: All you need to know Industry sectors face Brexit extinction 'Treasury not the enemy of Brexit' Airbus's main civil aircraft business is based in a suburb of the French city of Toulouse. Apart from France and the UK, it has production and manufacturing facilities in Germany, Spain, China and the US. Mr Williams told the BBC's Today programmethat Airbus was currently working on developing the ""next generation"" of aircraft wings in the UK. ""We are seriously considering whether we should continue that development or whether we should find alternative solutions,"" he added. Airbus makes wings for the A380 and other models in the UK Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said the warning from Airbus should be a ""wake-up call"". Mr Crabb tweeted: ""The enormous Airbus factory in North Wales is one of the jewels in the crown of UK manufacturing. This is a wake-up call. A pragmatic, sensible Brexit that protects trade & jobs is vital."" And shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""If proof was needed that the PM's Brexit red lines need to be abandoned (and fast), this is it."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable described the Airbus warning as ""the 'Oh my God' moment where something real is happening"". He added: ""Airbus are making absolutely clear that if there is a risk of a hard Brexit, they will have to stockpile parts. They can't take the risk. ""A hundred and ten thousand jobs depend on this company.  About one-and-a-half billion in tax revenue that will not go into the NHS. ""We're now beginning to get serious about what Brexit means.""

"The Treasury is not ""the enemy of Brexit"", Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has insisted. In a speech in the City of London, Mr Hammond said the UK needed to protect patterns of trade with the EU that had been ""built over decades"". The chancellor also used his Mansion House speech to confirm taxes will have to go up to boost spending on the NHS. But he said the increase would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels post-Brexit. In the past the chancellor has come under fire from supporters of Brexit. Earlier this month Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson called the Treasury ""the heart of Remain"", in comments to a private dinner. However, addressing a City audience on Thursday, Mr Hammond said the ""immediate key"" to the UK and London's economic success was ""ensuring we get a good Brexit deal"". UK borrowing falls more than expected UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM He said the goal was a partnership that ""recognises that our European neighbours are our most important trading partners, and that Dover to Calais is the busiest trading corridor in Europe"". As the UK leaves the EU, he said the new relationship should ""maintain low friction borders and open markets"". He went on: ""That does not make the Treasury, on my watch, 'the enemy of Brexit'; rather, it makes it the champion of prosperity for the British people outside the EU, but working and trading closely with it."" Mr Hammond also said the Â£20bn five-year NHS funding package announced by the prime minister this week would be partly funded by lower contributions to Brussels. However, he also said the government would stick to its fiscal rules and ""continue to reduce debt"". As a result taxpayers will have to ""contribute a bit more"", he added. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a boost in NHS spending, which will see NHS England's budget increase by Â£20bn by 2023. The plan also means more money will be given to the rest of the UK - about Â£4bn - although it will be up to the Welsh and Scottish governments to decide how that is spent. Mr Hammond said the NHS was the government's ""number one priority for the forthcoming spending review"". ""So, as the Prime Minister said, taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more, in a fair and balanced way, to support the NHS that we all use.""
