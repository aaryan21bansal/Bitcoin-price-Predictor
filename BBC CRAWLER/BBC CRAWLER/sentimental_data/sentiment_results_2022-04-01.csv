"Rishi Sunak said it was OK for people to attack him, but not wife Akshata Murty Indian tech giant Infosys, in which UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife owns shares thought to be worth more than Â£400m, is closing its office in Russia. Sources told the BBC that the company was trying to find replacement roles abroad for staff employed in Moscow. Infosys has been under pressure to cease its Russian operations following the invasion of Ukraine. And Mr Sunak has faced questions over wife Akshata Murty's shares in the firm, which was founded by her father. Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News it was important for the chancellor to reveal whether his family had been ""benefiting from money made in Russia when the [UK] government has put in place sanctions"" on firms and individuals following the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Sunak told the BBC's Newscast podcast this week that he had found criticism of his wife ""very upsetting"", adding that he understood how film star Will Smith had felt when his own wife had been mocked by comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars over her medical condition. But he joked: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody, which is good."" I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak Sunak faces questions over firm operating in Russia Truss visits India on same day as Lavrov Infosys, one of India's biggest companies with a presence in about 50 countries, set up an engineering centre in Moscow in 2016 and it is thought that up to 100 people are employed there. After Russia invaded Ukraine, many global IT firms suspended operations in the country, but Infosys has kept what it called ""a small team... based out of Russia that services some of our global clients"" until now. ""We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,"" it added in a recent statement. A spokesperson for Infosys declined to comment on the decision to close the Moscow office or what its future involvement with companies operating in Russia would be. Rishi Sunak says it is unfair that his wife has faced criticism over her Infosys shares Ms Murty's shareholding of 0.9% of Infosys is estimated to be worth more than Â£400m. A spokesperson for Mr Sunak has previously said neither she nor any members of her family ""have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company"". But Labour and the Liberal Democrats have insisted the chancellor has questions to answer about whether his family benefits from the shareholding at a time when he is calling for UK businesses to divest from Russia. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News it was ""in the public interest"" to do so. He added: ""I'm not attacking their family but I do want to know if the chancellor's household is benefiting from money from a company that's investing in Russia when the government is saying quite rightly that nobody should be doing that."" The chancellor told Newscast that, being in public life, he was himself ""fair game"" for criticism, but it was ""very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my wife"". Infosys, which has offices in London, Edinburgh and Nottinghamshire, announced last year that it was hiring 1,000 extra staff in the UK. India's government, unlike the UK's, has not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and did not vote against it at the United Nations Security Council.

"The Centrica boss said there is ""a lot of emotion"" in the debate around fracking Fracking could boost UK energy supplies and reduce bills, according to Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica. The UK government placed a moratorium on fracking in 2019, amid fierce local opposition and fears of earthquakes. Mr O'Shea said there needed to be an ""informed debate"" about it. However, environmental group Greenpeace said there had been ""a decade of hype and bluster"" around shale gas. Fracking is the process of drilling into the earth, then directing a high pressure mixture of chemicals into layers of rock to release shale gas. ""We do have to be careful, if it does cause earthquakes, it's not something we should do,"" Mr O'Shea said. The UK met48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies,externalin 2020, and bought the rest on international markets, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Cuadrilla has been given an extra year to delay the closure of its site in Lancashire Mr O'Shea toldBBC Radio 5Live's Big Green Money show: ""The key question is, do we want to source our gas from overseas? Or do we want to have more gas domestically? And shale is certainly worth exploring."" The UK has only ever had one fracking site in operation, whichhalted in 2019following a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA). The indefinite suspension came after the OGS found was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice. However, this year regulators gave owners Cuadrilla anextra year to re-evaluate the sitebefore it could be sealed up in 2023. Mr O'Shea urged informed debate on fracking. What is fracking and why is it controversial? Fracking firm given extra year to evaluate fracking wells Boris Johnson horrified at onshore wind farm delays, sources say ""I can't tell you what the right answer is, but I can tell you we don't achieve that by people taking entrenched positions that are not based on the full facts,"" he said. He added that British Gas and Centrica had held off discontinuing a share in a fracking licence while it waits to see if the government will revive the possibility of shale gas extraction. ""We have a small residual share in a fracking licence which we were in the process of discontinuing,"" he said. ""What we've decided to do is just hold off for a year."" The fracking site owned by Cuadrilla Resources in Lancashire had to halt activities in 2019 following concerns about small earth tremors In March, the Energy Minister Greg Hands said in Parliament that shale gas""could be part of our future energy mix,"",externalbut added that it would need the ""support of local communities."" Mr Hands also said the government was clear that the gas was ""not the solution to near-term issues,"" adding that it would take years before commercial quantities could be produced. A group of Tory MPs known as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group has been pushing for the government toend its fracking ban,externalsaying that it could help secure energy supplies for Britain. Many environmental groups have said they were concerned about the potential for fracking to cause earthquakes. At Cuadrilla's site in Lancashire, more than120 small tremors were recorded while it was drilling.,external Rosie Rogers, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, told the BBC: ""After a decade of hype and bluster, all the fracking industry has given us are two holes in a muddy field and some minor earthquakes."" Previously, Greenpeace has said that fracking would not improve energy security, because any gas extracted would belong to the gas firm doing the drilling, not to Britain, and it would be sold on international markets. ""It will take many years to develop and if it ever gets produced, it will be sold to the highest bidder on the international market, with no impact on our energy bills,"" a Greenpeace spokesperson said. ""If the UK and Europe want to end their dependence on Russian gas, the quickest way to do that is by insulating homes, installing heat pumps and boosting renewables.""

"The WTO's director general, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, is worried that a food crisis is brewing The Ukraine war has led the World Trade Organization (WTO) to cut its global trade growth forecast for this year. The previous 4.7% growth forecast has been cut to 2.5% due to ""the impact of the war and related policies"", said WTO boss Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The cut is also linked to continuing global supply chain problems that started as a result of the pandemic. She said disruptions would make food more costly, saying ""my worry is that we have a food crisis that is brewing"". Dr Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC that although Russia and Ukraine only make up about 2.5% of global merchandise exports, they ""are very, very significant in certain sectors"". ""The first worry, of course, is for the people of Ukraine, who are being displaced [and] not having enough food to eat,"" she said. Ukraine war could hit global growth, OECD warns Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices The economic cost of China's zero-Covid policy She added the global economy was ""going to suffer some severe consequences"", and said poorer countries would particularly feel the impact of the shortages, and ""the supply constraints on food"". Supplies of manyfood products including wheat and cornhave been affected following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Industry groups have warned the EU faces a shortage of sunflower oil. In total, 46.9% of global exports come from Ukraine and 29.9% from Russia according to S&P Global, but with Ukraine's ports closed it is struggling to export it. ""I'm truly worried about looming hunger, particularly in poor countries that can least afford it,"" Dr Okonjo-Iweala warned. Using Africa as an example, the former Nigerian finance minister said 35 of 55 countries there imported wheat and other grains from Russia and Ukraine and 22 imported fertiliser. ""Work being done by the African Development Bank now shows that in many countries, food prices are rising by 20% to 50% already,"" she said. However, Dr Okonjo-Iweala said she was hopeful there were solutions to the supply problems. She said in the short term countries could be ""changing our dietary tastes"" to eat more homegrown products. She added in the longer term Africa was investing in ""heat tolerant varieties of wheat and other crops"" as it adapts to climate change.

Russia's mining industry is hugely important for many substances such as palladium, where it is responsible for 40% of global production of the metal that is essential for carmakers. Even before the war in Ukraine, the pandemic had caused a mismatch between supply and demand in many industries which pushed prices up, and the International Monetary Fund has warned that soaring inflation will reduce global economic growth this year. ""In the short to medium term, I think that we are going to see these inflationary pressures continue,"" Dr Okonjo-Iweala said. Trade has become a key tool many countries have used to pressure President Vladimir Putin over his decision to invade Ukraine. Ukraine has cut economic ties with Russia andled calls for it to be suspended from the WTO,externalbecause of the war.

"It is understood Prince Andrew returned Â£750,000 The Duke and Duchess of York have been named in a court case in which a Turkish millionaire is claiming Â£38m has been ""dishonestly misappropriated"" by a business adviser. The High Court in London has heard claims that ""substantial sums"" from Nebehat Isbilen were paid to Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah. It is understood that Â£750,000 has been repaid by the prince to Mrs Isbilen. The business adviser, Selman Turk, has rejected the allegations. The complex court case involves claims brought by 77-year-old Mrs Isbilen that her business adviser Mr Turk misused her funds. Court documents show that among the expenditure and investments being questioned were payments to Prince Andrew and Sarah, the Duchess of York. According to the court papers, Mrs Isbilen claims Mr Turk advised her to make a ""gift"" of Â£750,000 to Prince Andrew, which it is claimed she was misled into thinking was for assistance with her passport. This amount was transferred from her account on 15 November 2019. ""The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gift to the Duke of York in connection with her passport (or for any other purpose) was false,"" says her legal team in their claim of dishonesty against Mr Turk. Representatives of Prince Andrew have not commented on the ongoing court case. But it is understood that the prince was not aware of any arrangements between Mrs Isbilen and Mr Turk. And it is understood that the prince has returned Â£750,000 to Mrs Isbilen. The discovery of payments to Prince Andrew emerged after a court order allowed a search of Mr Turk's financial dealings, as Mrs Isbilen's lawyers tried to establish the whereabouts of her assets. Court papers show that some of the lost money had been attributed by Mr Turk to professional costs and unsuccessful investments, but there were claims of significant amounts still to be explained. The High Court had been told Mrs Isbilen needed help moving assets out of Turkey after her husband became a political prisoner, and that Mr Turk was trusted to help. Jonathan Tickner, Mrs Isbilen's lawyer, said she had been ""the victim of serious fraud and financial wrongdoing"", and was determined to pursue her claim against all those involved. Court documents show that Mr Turk has disputed the allegations and disagrees with her understanding of how her assets have been handled. Mr Turk had also been a winner of an award at the Pitch at the Palace business initiative, headed by Prince Andrew.

"Amazon Labor Union leader Christian Smalls celebrates the landmark win A team of Amazon workers has forced the technology giant to recognise a trade union in the US for the first time. Workers at a New York warehouse voted 55% in favour of joining the Amazon Labor Union. The group is led by former Amazon worker Chris Smalls, who made his name protesting against safety conditions at the retail giant during the pandemic. Mr Smalls' victory marks a major defeat for Amazon, which had fiercely fought against unionisation. However, in Alabama, where Amazon was facing a separate union drive, the company appeared to have fended off activists in a tight contest in which challenged ballots could yet overturn that result. Together, the two elections mark a milestone for activists, who have long decried labour practices at Amazon, the country's second largest employer. Mr Smalls emerged from the vote count looking tired but jubilant, and popped open a bottle of champagne he was handed by supporters. ""We did whatever it took to connect with these workers,"" he told the crowd, recounting an against-the-odds campaign that started with ""two tables, two chairs and a tent"" and relied on an online fundraiser for money. ""I hope that everybody's paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us."" Are we now in a 'golden age' for trade unions? The former Amazon worker who could make history In a statement, Amazon said it was disappointed by the loss in New York and that it was evaluating how to proceed. It also accused regulators of improperly influencing the vote. ""We believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,"" the company said. ""We're evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the [National Labor Relations Board]"". Amazon fired Christian Smalls in 2020 after his protest, citing quarantine violations Rebecca Givan, professor of labour studies at Rutgers University, said Amazon's defeat by Mr Smalls and his team of worker-organisers was a ""really big deal"", calling it a ""David and Goliath story"" that upset the odds. But she warned he will be facing another tough fight when it comes to contract negotiations. ""Amazon will do everything it can do undo this success, to break up these workers and to try to stop the momentum that will inevitably come from this victory,"" she said. After the vote, Chris Smalls was instantly surrounded by supporters and assembled camera crews. He and his team of worker organisers had struck out on their own, creating a brand new, independent labour union to launch their fight against Amazon. Their victory was a moment of vindication for the former Amazon worker, whomthe company once called ""not smart, or articulate""in a leaked strategy memo. But, as he told the crowd, it is far bigger than that. Amazon employs more than one million people in the US and it has extraordinary influence on work practices - even outside its doors. The company has put up a wall of resistance to unions since its inception. With this win, activists are hoping that wall is about to crumble. Amazon has already poured resources into fighting the unionising efforts, which it sees as an obstacle to business flexibility and warehouse efficiency. Officials have said the company offers competitive pay and benefits and believes it is better to work directly with workers. In meetings about the vote, representatives questioned union leaders' ability to win more in contract negotiations. Amazon said it may challenge the results, citing the timing of a decision by the National Labor Relations Board to sue the company last month alleging unfair labour practices in New York. As part of its statement, it shared comments by two of the country's most powerful business lobbies also raising objections, including a letter from the National Retail Federation to congressional leaders that called for an investigation of the matter. More than 4,000 votes were cast in the New York election Mr Smalls said he was undaunted by the challenges ahead. The 33-year-old had worked for Amazon for more than four years before the company fired him in 2020, after his coronavirus protest, citing quarantine violations. He established the Amazon Labor Union last year, calling for higher pay, stronger medical benefits, anti-discrimination policies and better leave among other changes. The 2,654 to 2,131 victory gives his group the right to negotiate a contract with Amazon for the roughly 8,000 workers at the Staten Island warehouse. His team is also behind a second union campaign at a smaller warehouse in the same industrial park, which is scheduled for a vote later this month. ""There's no doubt in my mind we're going to be successful in that one as well,"" he said. Organisers said Amazon made critical mistakes ahead of the vote, such as pushing to reverse policies relaxed under Covid, including allowing workers to keep their mobiles with them while working. Amazon Labor Union secretary Karen Ponce says defeating Amazon wasn't easy Still they said their win in some ways surprised even them, despite the intense efforts they had made to reach out to workers and make their case ahead of the vote. ""Watching all of this come true is pretty crazy,"" said Karen Ponce, Amazon worker and secretary of the Amazon Labor Union. The union drives at Amazon come amid an upswell of labour activism in the US. In recent months, organisers have led successful campaigns at coffee chain Starbucks, media outlets, smaller retailers and others. Analysts say the pandemic galvanised workers worried about their safety. The rapid rebound of the economy since the coronavirus shock has also produced an unusually tight labour market, giving workers more leverage. But across the US, just 6.1% of private sector workers belong to unions. ""It continues to be very difficult for workers to organize collectively,"" Prof Givan said. In Alabama, workers at the Bessemer warehouse voted 993 to 875 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, regulators said on Thursday. More than 400 challenged ballots have yet to be counted and could change that result. The unofficial tally showed a much closer election than the lopsided victory that Amazon claimed after last year's election, which regulators later declared invalid, ordering a do-over citing labour rule violations by Amazon. Amazon appeared to have headed off a separate union challenge at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama Turnout was also lower, with less than 40% of the more than 6,000 people working at the Bessemer warehouse casting votes in the election. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, which led the unionising drive in Alabama, said he was excited by the possibility of a union victory in New York. Crediting Mr Smalls and his team, he also said their win in part reflected differences between New York - where one in five workers is unionised - and Alabama, which is a notoriously anti-labour state. He said his union's initial union effort at the Amazon warehouse in Alabama last year had ""ignited a movement"". ""Regardless of the final outcome, workers here have shown what is possible,"" he said at a press conference on Thursday following the Alabama count. ""This is a sign of more to come.""

"Russia has said it will not cut off gas exports to Europe yet in a standoff over its demand to be paid in roubles. Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Thursday stating buyers must pay in roubles through Russian bank accounts from Friday. The Kremlin said this would not affect shipments which were already paid for, with payments for deliveries after 1 April due in mid-April at the earliest. The country is seeking to shore up the rouble as Western sanctions bite. ""Does this mean that if there is no confirmation in roubles, then gas supplies will be cut off from 1 April? No, it doesn't, and it doesn't follow from the decree,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The EU said it was talking to energy companies about how to pay for gas. Ditte Juul Jorgensen, the director general of the European Commission energy directorate,tweeted,externalthat the EU was ""working closely with member states and operators... to establish a common approach on currency payments for gas contracts with Russia"". Since Russia invaded Ukraine Western nations have placed sanctions on Russian companies and individuals. Unlike the US and Canada, the EU has not placed bans on oil or gas, as its member nations are heavily reliant on it. Ukraine war: Russia threatens to stop supplying gas if not paid in roubles Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing Russia supplies the European Union (EU) with about 40% of its gas and a third of its oil imports which are mainly paid for in euros and dollars. The EU has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted, but at the same time, Russia is making â¬400m (Â£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has very few options for rerouting this supply to other markets. Member states in the EU have been on alert for any disruption to Russian gas imports as tension continues between Russia and the West over the Ukraine invasion. On Wednesday, Germany and Austriatook the first steps towards gas rationing. Germany urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages, while Austria said it was tightening its monitoring of the gas market. A crunch point appeared to be in the offing when Moscow issued a decree on Thursday requiring foreign buyers of Russian gas to open rouble accounts from Friday or else risk being cut-off. Moscow did, however, offer a mechanism for buyers to obtain roubles via the state-run Gazprombank. The bank has escaped sanctions from the EU to allow energy trading to continue. The UK has imposed sanctions on Gazprombank, but imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia. UK and Dutch wholesale gas prices fell on Friday after the announcement that Russian gas supplies would not be halted immediately. Westbound flows of Russian gas via major routes were steady on Friday. European experts have said Mr Putin's decree is mainly aimed at shielding Russian energy giant Gazprom from future sanctions. If Gazprombank collects the money, the EU could not sanction it without cutting gas. ""It amounts to a warning from Putin not to tighten financial sanctions further,"" said Jeffrey Schott of the Peterson Institute of International Economics think tank. Jack Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said: ""What sounded grandiose has turned into a storm in a teacup. ""By making it the main recipient of money for gas, it puts an extra shield against sanctions around Gazprombank."" One European official said that he believed Mr Putin had demanded the switch to rouble payments to test who would go along with it, but no-one did. ""After the pushback, he is trying to find a system where he could claim that he had won, while in fact something close to the status quo is continuing,"" the official said.

"Corpses and burned out cars litter this stretch of the E-40 highway Footage of Russian troops shooting a man with his hands up on a highway outside Kyiv at the beginning of March was shared around the world. Now the Russians have been pushed out of the area and the BBC's Jeremy Bowen has been to see the grim aftermath of their short-lived occupation. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing We counted 13 bodies on a nightmarish stretch of road not much more than 200 yards long, between Mria and Myla, villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians who were killed by the Russians. The others have not been identified yet - they lie where they were killed - but only two are wearing recognisable Ukrainian military uniforms. Our BBC team was able to get to the area, on the main E-40 highway as it approaches Kyiv, because Ukrainian forces had captured the sector only 10 hours earlier. The marks of battle and of heavy shelling were everywhere. Petrol stations and a hotel that was well-known for its spa and restaurant were in ruins. Shell holes and craters pockmarked both carriageways. Ukrainian troops changing a wheel in the ruins of a roadside garage said the Russians were about 4km (2.5 miles) away and had pulled their remaining men and armour back after a hard fight, lasting several days, in the early hours of the morning. Warning: Graphic video ahead Left behind in the heart of the desolation were the dead bodies, and a mass of questions and concerns about who they were and how they died. This video can not be played Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv Some answers already exist for a couple who were killed by the Russians and left to decompose on 7 March. Their rusty, shrapnel riddled car lies in the road next to one of the petrol stations, reduced to a shell by fire. Next to it are the burnt and twisted remains of a body that is just about recognisable as the remains of a man. A wedding ring is still on the corpse's finger. Stretched out inside the hulk of their car is what is left of the incinerated body of a woman, the mouth opened in what looks like a scream. Their deaths were filmed by a Ukrainian drone on 7 March, operated by the Bugatti unit of Territorial Defence. The unit released the video, which was republished by news organisations around the world. It caused outrage because it showed the cold-blooded killing of a man who had raised his arms to show he was harmless, in the classic gesture of surrender. The bodies, the BBC discovered in an investigation this month, are of Maksim Iowenko and his wife Ksjena. They were part of a convoy of 10 civilian vehicles who were trying to escape the Russians and get to Kyiv. Ksjena and Maksim Iowenko were civilians and should have been protected As they drove down the road, they spotted a Russian tank in position, dug into the grass verge. The drone video shows it was clearly marked with the letter V, one of the identifiers used by the Russian armed forces. The other cars did quick U-turns and drove away at speed. But Maksim's car stopped, most likely because it was hit. As soon as the car stopped, Maksim leapt out and raised his hands. Within seconds he was shot dead. His wife was killed in the car. Also in the car were their six-year-old son and the elderly mother of one of Maksim's friends. Both of them survived and were eventually released by the Russian soldiers. They were found walking back down the road, and the woman told her family that Maksim was shouting that a child was in the car when he was killed. Both survivors, according to the Bugatti drone unit, are now safe but deeply traumatised. Warning: Graphic images ahead The car is now burnt out, but it was not on fire after the attack. One hypothesis must be that the bodies and the car were set on fire by the Russians to destroy the evidence of what they had done. The Bugatti Unit has submitted its drone video to the Ukrainian authorities and to the Metropolitan Police in London. More burnt cars and dead bodies line the road for the next few hundred yards. No video has emerged to show what happened. A credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by the tank crew, or other Russian soldiers. Some of the evidence the BBC gathered is too disturbing to show in full. Here a dead man has been covered by rubber tyres Here a Ukrainian soldier gestures towards sets of charred human remains by a burned out vehicle Attempts have been made to destroy the other bodies. Some have been left to rot where they were killed. But other corpses have been piled up and surrounded by tyres. Charred clothing indicates attempts were made to set fires around them. Tyres are flammable and must have been placed there as an accelerant. The emplacement where the tank was dug in has a clear arc of fire across the area where the 13 bodies are lying. The tank has gone but debris was left by its crew, including Russian army field rations. In the woods nearby is at least one other tank, which has been burnt out after being hit by an anti-tank missile. A Ukrainian soldier produced a wallet he had found in the tank. He emptied out Russian identity papers, bank notes in the Russian currency, the rouble, and small change in Belorussian coppers. The major thrust to the north-west of Kyiv came from invaders who had crossed the border from Belarus, Moscow's ally. Close by the knocked out tank are the remains of a chaotic camp, with dugouts, chairs and a long table piled high with the remains of food and drink. They are all surrounded by big piles of garbage, rotten food and empty bottles of alcohol. Ukrainian soldiers said shops at the petrol stations were looted. An abandoned Russian camp: the soldiers are said to have looted petrol stations Next to the table is a large pair of bolt-cutters. Piles of unburied rubbish scattered in a forward position are usually a sign of undisciplined soldiers. We decided to drive two or three kilometres further down the road, after Ukrainian soldiers said more Russian armour had been destroyed. In a small village, a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers were broken and burnt. Some of the wreckage was still smoking. The force of the weapon that destroyed the tank blew off its turret and main gun, which lay upside down and half buried in a crater around 15 yards away. In the pine woods on either side of the road Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and fox holes with shovels. Others were patrolling. It was far too early to say whether the Russians were gone for good, or whether they would be back. What is clear though is that Russian forces, under continued pressure from Ukrainian soldiers, have been forced to yield strategic territory around Kyiv. Every time they move back, the Ukrainian capital and its people become a little safer. This video can not be played Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians As and when the Russians leave, more evidence is likely to emerge of civilians having been killed - backing up the many stories that have emerged of such incidents. The gruesome scenes on the road were more than simply the terrible deaths of human beings who had become victims of President Putin's decision to invade. It is also a crime scene, with evidence that should be collected and preserved for an investigation whenever this war ends. Under the laws of war civilians are protected, and when they are killed in defiance of those laws, their deaths amount to war crimes.

"Amazon Labor Union leader Christian Smalls celebrates the landmark win A team of Amazon workers has forced the technology giant to recognise a trade union in the US for the first time. Workers at a New York warehouse voted 55% in favour of joining the Amazon Labor Union. The group is led by former Amazon worker Chris Smalls, who made his name protesting against safety conditions at the retail giant during the pandemic. Mr Smalls' victory marks a major defeat for Amazon, which had fiercely fought against unionisation. However, in Alabama, where Amazon was facing a separate union drive, the company appeared to have fended off activists in a tight contest in which challenged ballots could yet overturn that result. Together, the two elections mark a milestone for activists, who have long decried labour practices at Amazon, the country's second largest employer. Mr Smalls emerged from the vote count looking tired but jubilant, and popped open a bottle of champagne he was handed by supporters. ""We did whatever it took to connect with these workers,"" he told the crowd, recounting an against-the-odds campaign that started with ""two tables, two chairs and a tent"" and relied on an online fundraiser for money. ""I hope that everybody's paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us."" Are we now in a 'golden age' for trade unions? The former Amazon worker who could make history In a statement, Amazon said it was disappointed by the loss in New York and that it was evaluating how to proceed. It also accused regulators of improperly influencing the vote. ""We believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,"" the company said. ""We're evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the [National Labor Relations Board]"". Amazon fired Christian Smalls in 2020 after his protest, citing quarantine violations Rebecca Givan, professor of labour studies at Rutgers University, said Amazon's defeat by Mr Smalls and his team of worker-organisers was a ""really big deal"", calling it a ""David and Goliath story"" that upset the odds. But she warned he will be facing another tough fight when it comes to contract negotiations. ""Amazon will do everything it can do undo this success, to break up these workers and to try to stop the momentum that will inevitably come from this victory,"" she said. After the vote, Chris Smalls was instantly surrounded by supporters and assembled camera crews. He and his team of worker organisers had struck out on their own, creating a brand new, independent labour union to launch their fight against Amazon. Their victory was a moment of vindication for the former Amazon worker, whomthe company once called ""not smart, or articulate""in a leaked strategy memo. But, as he told the crowd, it is far bigger than that. Amazon employs more than one million people in the US and it has extraordinary influence on work practices - even outside its doors. The company has put up a wall of resistance to unions since its inception. With this win, activists are hoping that wall is about to crumble. Amazon has already poured resources into fighting the unionising efforts, which it sees as an obstacle to business flexibility and warehouse efficiency. Officials have said the company offers competitive pay and benefits and believes it is better to work directly with workers. In meetings about the vote, representatives questioned union leaders' ability to win more in contract negotiations. Amazon said it may challenge the results, citing the timing of a decision by the National Labor Relations Board to sue the company last month alleging unfair labour practices in New York. As part of its statement, it shared comments by two of the country's most powerful business lobbies also raising objections, including a letter from the National Retail Federation to congressional leaders that called for an investigation of the matter. More than 4,000 votes were cast in the New York election Mr Smalls said he was undaunted by the challenges ahead. The 33-year-old had worked for Amazon for more than four years before the company fired him in 2020, after his coronavirus protest, citing quarantine violations.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Firefighters tackle a blaze at an oil storage depot in Belgorod, which Russia says was attacked An oil storage depot was set on fire in a Russian city just north of Ukraine after what Russia described as an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. Avideo shared on Twitter,externalshowed a blaze near apartment blocks in Belgorod, 40km (25 miles) from the border. Some clips appeared to show rockets hitting the oil depot. Ukraine's top security official, however, denied Ukrainian forces were behind the attack. ""For some reason, they are saying we are behind it. This does not correspond to reality,"" security council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said. Ukrainian aircraft have not struck targets in Russia previously. Yet Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov accused Ukraine of launching the attack, and later Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov gave details. He said that at around 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) two Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopters entered Russian airspace at extremely low altitude and ""launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility"" on the outskirts of Belgorod. Some storage tanks were damaged and caught fire, he said. ""The oil storage facility has nothing to do with the Russian armed forces,"" he said. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said the incident ""cannot be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for continuing the talks"" with Kyiv. So far those peace talks have made little progress. The spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was now trying to reorganise the fuel supply chain to prevent disruption of Belgorod's energy supplies. The city of 370,000 lies just north of Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, which has been heavily shelled by Russian artillery and remains surrounded by Russian forces. Governor Gladkov said in a Telegram message that nobody was killed at the oil depot, which is run by Russian state oil firm Rosneft. He said emergency workers were trying to contain the fire and there was ""no threat"" to residents. The emergencies ministryposted video,externalof the blaze on Telegram. Russia's Interfax news agency reported that residents nearby were evacuated and two people were injured at the depot. It said eight fuel tanks were on fire and nearly 200 firefighters were on the scene. Queues of cars later formed at local petrol stations, but Mr Gladkov said Belgorod's fuel supplies were still plentiful. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency says the blaze in three of the tanks has been extinguished, but there is still a risk of the fire spreading. On 29 March several explosions were reported at an ammunition depot near Belgorod. Commenting on the oil depot blaze, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian ""aggression"" was being resisted ""on the territory of Ukraine"". ""It does not mean that Ukraine has to bear responsibility for all those catastrophes and all those events that happen on the territory of the Russian Federation. This is not the first time we have seen such accusations. So, dear friends, I will neither confirm nor deny this information,"" he said. Ukraine is yet to claim responsibility for this attack, but if it were confirmed it would be the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target. bringing the war home to Russia. Ukrainian helicopter pilots have plenty of experience of flying low and fast to avoid being detected by military radar and air defence systems. They've been doing exactly that in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine for years. I experienced and witnessed the extraordinary skills of the Ukrainian military pilots in 2018 - flying barely metres above the tree line and telegraph poles. But if these unconfirmed reports are correct - flying at night, well into Russian territory, to launch an attack on an enemy fuel depot would have required extraordinary bravery - as well as finely-honed flying skills. Low-flying helicopters are still vulnerable to short-range air defence systems. Flying at night would have lessened that risk, but heightened the danger of hitting an object near the ground. The Mi-24, or Hind helicopter, is known as the ""flying tank"". Its rockets would have been the weapon deployed to target the oil depot in Belgorod, Russia. This alleged attack alone will not dramatically alter the battle. But it could show Ukraine has managed to keep its air force functioning, and give a huge boost to the morale of Ukraine's military. A well-known Ukrainian journalist in Kyiv, Yury Butusov,posted on Facebook,externalthat it was a missile attack at 05:50 local time (02:50 GMT) by ""two Ukrainian Mi-24 combat helicopters, which flew from Ukraine to Russian Belgorod over low altitudes, inconspicuous for Russian anti-aircraft defence"". Vladimir Soloviev, host of a staunchly pro-Kremlin current affairs programme on Russian state TV, askedin a tweet:,external""Question. Who is in charge of the Belgorod air defences?

Ukrainian troops changing a wheel in the ruins of a roadside garage said the Russians were about 4km (2.5 miles) away and had pulled their remaining men and armour back after a hard fight, lasting several days, in the early hours of the morning. Warning: Graphic video ahead Left behind in the heart of the desolation were the dead bodies, and a mass of questions and concerns about who they were and how they died. This video can not be played Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv Some answers already exist for a couple who were killed by the Russians and left to decompose on 7 March. Their rusty, shrapnel riddled car lies in the road next to one of the petrol stations, reduced to a shell by fire. Next to it are the burnt and twisted remains of a body that is just about recognisable as the remains of a man. A wedding ring is still on the corpse's finger. Stretched out inside the hulk of their car is what is left of the incinerated body of a woman, the mouth opened in what looks like a scream. Their deaths were filmed by a Ukrainian drone on 7 March, operated by the Bugatti unit of Territorial Defence. The unit released the video, which was republished by news organisations around the world. It caused outrage because it showed the cold-blooded killing of a man who had raised his arms to show he was harmless, in the classic gesture of surrender. The bodies, the BBC discovered in an investigation this month, are of Maksim Iowenko and his wife Ksjena. They were part of a convoy of 10 civilian vehicles who were trying to escape the Russians and get to Kyiv. Ksjena and Maksim Iowenko were civilians and should have been protected As they drove down the road, they spotted a Russian tank in position, dug into the grass verge. The drone video shows it was clearly marked with the letter V, one of the identifiers used by the Russian armed forces. The other cars did quick U-turns and drove away at speed. But Maksim's car stopped, most likely because it was hit. As soon as the car stopped, Maksim leapt out and raised his hands. Within seconds he was shot dead. His wife was killed in the car. Also in the car were their six-year-old son and the elderly mother of one of Maksim's friends. Both of them survived and were eventually released by the Russian soldiers. They were found walking back down the road, and the woman told her family that Maksim was shouting that a child was in the car when he was killed. Both survivors, according to the Bugatti drone unit, are now safe but deeply traumatised. Warning: Graphic images ahead The car is now burnt out, but it was not on fire after the attack. One hypothesis must be that the bodies and the car were set on fire by the Russians to destroy the evidence of what they had done. The Bugatti Unit has submitted its drone video to the Ukrainian authorities and to the Metropolitan Police in London. More burnt cars and dead bodies line the road for the next few hundred yards. No video has emerged to show what happened. A credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by the tank crew, or other Russian soldiers. Some of the evidence the BBC gathered is too disturbing to show in full. Here a dead man has been covered by rubber tyres Here a Ukrainian soldier gestures towards sets of charred human remains by a burned out vehicle Attempts have been made to destroy the other bodies. Some have been left to rot where they were killed. But other corpses have been piled up and surrounded by tyres. Charred clothing indicates attempts were made to set fires around them. Tyres are flammable and must have been placed there as an accelerant. The emplacement where the tank was dug in has a clear arc of fire across the area where the 13 bodies are lying. The tank has gone but debris was left by its crew, including Russian army field rations. In the woods nearby is at least one other tank, which has been burnt out after being hit by an anti-tank missile. A Ukrainian soldier produced a wallet he had found in the tank. He emptied out Russian identity papers, bank notes in the Russian currency, the rouble, and small change in Belorussian coppers. The major thrust to the north-west of Kyiv came from invaders who had crossed the border from Belarus, Moscow's ally. Close by the knocked out tank are the remains of a chaotic camp, with dugouts, chairs and a long table piled high with the remains of food and drink. They are all surrounded by big piles of garbage, rotten food and empty bottles of alcohol. Ukrainian soldiers said shops at the petrol stations were looted. An abandoned Russian camp: the soldiers are said to have looted petrol stations Next to the table is a large pair of bolt-cutters. Piles of unburied rubbish scattered in a forward position are usually a sign of undisciplined soldiers. We decided to drive two or three kilometres further down the road, after Ukrainian soldiers said more Russian armour had been destroyed. In a small village, a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers were broken and burnt. Some of the wreckage was still smoking. The force of the weapon that destroyed the tank blew off its turret and main gun, which lay upside down and half buried in a crater around 15 yards away. In the pine woods on either side of the road Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and fox holes with shovels. Others were patrolling. It was far too early to say whether the Russians were gone for good, or whether they would be back. What is clear though is that Russian forces, under continued pressure from Ukrainian soldiers, have been forced to yield strategic territory around Kyiv. Every time they move back, the Ukrainian capital and its people become a little safer. This video can not be played Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians As and when the Russians leave, more evidence is likely to emerge of civilians having been killed - backing up the many stories that have emerged of such incidents. The gruesome scenes on the road were more than simply the terrible deaths of human beings who had become victims of President Putin's decision to invade. It is also a crime scene, with evidence that should be collected and preserved for an investigation whenever this war ends. Under the laws of war civilians are protected, and when they are killed in defiance of those laws, their deaths amount to war crimes.

"Comparing prices of every day items can help bring your spending down, experts say Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years and millions of households are facing the prospect of a soaring energy bill. We asked four experts for their top tips on what people can do to protect their finances and soften the blow of rising bills. Being a wedding or party guest can be expensive - consider whether you need to go to every occasion A good starting point is to look in-depth at your spending to find out exactly where your money is going, says Bola Sol, author of How to Save It. ""Start by assessing if there is room for negotiation in any of your fixed expenses,"" she says. ""Is there a better and cheaper provider?"" When it comes to variable monthly outgoings decide what should stay and what should go, she says. ""Every budget needs a miscellaneous fund for those expenses you did not see coming,"" she says. ""Have one in for each month."" ""Look at your calendar at who is celebrating a birthday, baby shower, wedding or occasion this month,"" she says. ""Ask yourself, if you go, how much will it cost you and is it worth going given the current climate?"" She suggests joining supermarket rewards schemes and family deals for streaming services as well as comparing prices online and searching for discount codes. Having treats like takeaway coffee less often could add up to decent savings says finance analyst Myron Jobson Small cuts in lots of places can be a less painful way to improve your finances, says Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at the investment platform, Interactive Investor. ""While making huge cuts to a few areas of spending could significantly ease the cost of living squeeze on your finances, they could also have an unacceptable knock-on effect on your quality of life and take a heavy toll on mental and emotional health,"" he says. But small changes can add up, he says. ""For example, you do not have to completely forgo your daily coffee purchase, but you can cut back on how often you buy them."" After over two years of Covid restrictions, many of us are keen to spend money on getting out more, he says. ""Halving the number of jaunts averaging Â£50 a week in a month, for example, would give you an extra Â£100 a month which could go towards footing the extra Â£57.75 a month increase to the average energy bill,"" he says. It's important to check you're getting all the benefits you are eligible for, the Citizens Advice Bureau If you are facing tough times it is important to make sure you are getting all the support you are entitled to, says Kayley Hignell, the head of families, welfare and work at Citizens Advice. You can use theCitizens Advice benefits calculator,externalto work out if here's any help you could be claiming, she says. ""Important benefits to consider might be Personal Independent Payment, if you need extra help for an illness or disability, or universal credit if you are on a low income or unemployed,"" she says. ""Pension Credit, which can top up your income in retirement, is something many people do not know they are entitled to. ""There are also schemes like local council tax reductions and the new Household Support Fund where you will need to speak to your local council about what might be on offer."" Low-income families might also be able to get help with the costs of sending children to school, including school meals, transport and uniform through your local education authority, she says. Money problems can impact on your mental health and vice versa, experts say Mental health and finances can be intrinsically linked, says Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. This means money troubles can have a serious impact on our mental wellbeing, and vice versa, she says. ""If you are feeling stressed or worried about your financial situation, it is important to know that you are not alone and there is help out there,"" she says. ""There is no debt problem that is not fixable with the right support. If you're struggling to keep up with bills, there are lots of free debt advice organisations that can help,"" she says. ""Similarly, if your finances are starting to take a toll on your mental health, it's important to seek help."" She suggests contacting your GP or speaking to a charity like the Samaritans. ""In recent years lots of banks and energy companies have introduced tools to help customers manage their finances so it is worth asking your providers what they can offer,"" she says. These include sending copies of bills and other letters to a nominated person of your choice, so that they can help you make decisions. Some banks now offer a carer's card, which is a debit card for a loved one to use on your behalf for limited purposes such as grocery shopping, she says. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"About 22 million households are about to have to pay a lot more for their energy bills, a move that could push millions into poverty. As warnings grow of the worst drop in living standards since records began, the BBC will be following a number of people throughout the year to see how they are managing. Ruchita Green has been thinking about spiralling costs for months, as she has watched petrol and food prices go up. The 38-year-old lives near Grimsby in Lincolnshire with her husband Darren, a teacher, their three children and her husband's parents. Their energy bill is already high at Â£198 a month, which includes the cost of heating an annexe in their home where Darren's parents live. They haven't yet summoned the courage to read their meter, but they are bracing themselves for a steep rise, and to have to tighten their belts. The average annual bill is likely to increase by Â£693, according to Ofgem - a rise like that would add another Â£58 to their monthly outgoings. ""We're really starting to worry about how it's all going to work,"" Ruchita says. Ruchita has an Indian cookery business and has seen the cost of her ingredients increase Darren's salary of about Â£2,750 a month is their main source of income. Ruchita runs a business teaching people how to cook Indian food in their own homes, but it doesn't bring in much and margins are tight. ""If a client decides they want to have meat for starters and meat as part of the main course my heart sinks,"" she says. She will soon have to decide whether to increase her prices, or only cook cheaper vegetarian meals. She worries either might also cause a drop in her business. The weekly petrol bill for their car has gone from Â£20 to Â£30 a week, so she's started to cut down on journeys. For the weekly shop, she's been buying cheaper brands, and buying tinned fruit instead of fresh, and they've cut down on takeaways, which she thinks has saved them at least Â£80 a month. She's also changed childminder, saving about Â£20 a week. Another area they've had to cut down on is on some of their other children's after-school activities, which Ruchita says has been tough on their eldest children, aged 11 and six. ""They ask me why can't we do multi-sports any more and I have to tell them it's because we can't afford it."" At the moment they're just about managing, Ruchita says, but she is aware that further increases could have a bigger impact. Esme's energy bills have risen from Â£30 a month in December to Â£95 in March Esme Buxton often doesn't earn enough to make ends meet, and regularly relies on family for help. She got a shock in December when her energy supplier told her the Â£30 monthly direct debit she'd been paying hadn't been enough to cover her energy bills, and it was increasing to Â£66. ""They then put it up to Â£75 in February, and then again to Â£95 in March,"" she says. The 30-year-old lives in a one-bedroom flat in Cheltenham which she shares with her Romanian rescue dog Arlo, and works as a freelance photographer and marketer. She says that the seasonal nature of wedding photography means she finds it hard to balance the books. Why are my energy bills going up and how high could they go? Big regional divide on some energy bill charges Why is the cost of living going up? She knows she is fortunate that her family will help, and she keeps a tight rein on her spending, but looking at her budget from February it's easy to see just how precarious things are. ""I earned Â£1,188 in February. My total bills came to Â£1,603. I got Â£500 of a top-up loan from my dad and grandad,"" she says. ""That left me with a grand total of Â£85 for any extras."" Those little extras are things like going swimming or to the gym or to have a coffee in the park with her mum. She was able to go to the cinema this month because of an offer she got with her mobile phone supplier, but as for things like eating out or the pub, they're all gone for the moment. ""I'm constantly worried about money and think about it all the time. I'm always juggling things in my head to try and make everything add up, which it doesn't."" Food for rescue dog Arlo, plus pet insurance, add to Esme's monthly outgoings As well as her Â£595 rent, Â£94 council tax and the money for other utility bills such as water and her phone, Esme also puts Â£300 aside every month for her annual tax bill. But the tax money is what she'll dip into if an unexpected bill comes in, like when she had to pay for a new wheel for her bike after it was stolen from outside her flat. ""The bike saves me money on public transport, so I knew I really needed to get it,"" she says, ""but that money will have to be paid back from next month's budget which will leave me short again."" To help cut back, she now only uses the heating in the evening. She's even bought an air fryer in an attempt to stop using her oven. ""The air fryer is great,"" she laughs. ""I made donuts in it the other day."" Esme is also trying to cut back on her food budget. She's allowing herself around Â£30 a week and now almost exclusively shops in her local Lidl. She has noticed the cost of fresh fruit going up and now buys frozen. The one thing she says she can't really cut back on is food for her dog Arlo. ""I try to shop around online to get a good deal, but even with doing that I'm spending nearly Â£50 feeding her every month,"" she says. ""I also have to pay pet insurance. If anything happened to her I wouldn't be able to afford the vet bills. All these things add up."" Once a week Andrew gets a free meal from a local charity and says he likes to make an effort to look smart Andrew McIntyre owes his energy supplier Â£1,200, and his monthly bill is about to go up from Â£75 to Â£120 a month. The 57-year-old lives off universal credit, and already regularly faces a shortfall between what he's got coming in and what he needs to pay on bills. As he gets ready to go to a local food charity for a free meal - something he does one day a week and likes to get dressed up smartly for - he explains that it means he's had to choose between paying his rent and heating his flat. ""Every month I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" he says. Andrew gets Â£325 a month in universal credit, and Â£351 a month in housing benefit. He has no savings. He pays Â£400 for rent, leaving him with Â£276 for food and bills. Andrew tries to keep his energy use to a minimum. ""During the winter I put on extra layers to keep warm,"" he says. ""If I am really cold sitting watching TV in the evening, I'll get inside my sleeping bag on the sofa and keep warm like that."" He allows himself about Â£80 a month on food, but that includes him skipping meals. ""If I can eat late in the morning then I don't have to eat again until my evening meal,"" he says. He has time to go to different supermarkets in his hometown of Walsall in the West Midlands to find the cheapest deals. ""I know the price of everything,"" he laughs. ""A change of only a few pence really makes a difference to how far my money will go."" The rest of his money goes on paying his phone bill, water bill and council tax. It's particularly important for Andrew that he keeps up with his rent. In 2009, he lost the factory job he'd worked at for nearly 29 years and split from his long-term partner, and he found himself living on the streets for seven months. ""I'll never forget the experience and how it hit me,"" he says. ""If I have to choose between keeping a roof over my head and paying my electric bill, it's an easy choice. There's no way I'll ever end up homeless again."" Andrew says he really did feel close to the edge at times, but he's also strangely positive now about the experience. ""I can sit on my settee in the evening and be thankful for what I've got. I don't have a lot, but what I do have I'm thankful for,"" he says.

"The battle-scarred town of Irpin now stands as an example of Ukrainian resistance, and of Russian defeat. President Putin's forces managed to enter the town but didn't manage to push through it. If they had, Kyiv would have been their next stop - the capital is just a short drive away, 13 miles (21km) down the road. Blocking the Russian advance here was critical. We reached the city centre under armed escort, driving through streets strewn with rubble and downed power lines - and devoid of life. Ukrainian forces gave us a careful tour - avoiding some main roads. We were told Russian forces might be present in the forests on the outskirts, though the Mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, insists the town itself is completely under Ukrainian control. Troops proudly showed us a Russian armoured personnel carrier which had been torn to shreds, its turret upturned. Another burnt out Russian vehicle was just down the road. But we were moved quickly from place to place because of the ongoing risk of Russian shelling. Most of the 70,000 people who used to live in this middle class commuter city fled over the past month - darting out of basements, running the gauntlet of relentless Russian shelling. Many may have little left to come back to. President Putin claims he is not targeting civilian areas, but the destroyed homes of Irpin give the lie to that. Many residential buildings in Irpin have been damaged or destroyed We saw extensive damage in residential areas, including one high-rise block where a shell had punched a neat hole right through a corner apartment. There was a child's red toy car on the ground, close to a forsaken playground. There were cars with bullet-riddled windscreens, and charred houses where the roofs have been ripped off. Some of the dead still lie beneath the rubble. Others were buried hastily in courtyards and parks because a proper funeral was impossible. The mayor estimates that between 200-300 civilians were killed here, some directly targeted as they fled. The final death toll is likely to be higher. The Russians had held 20-30% of the city, but the resistance here was dogged. Ukraine's defence ministry has recognised ""the mass heroism and resilience of the residents and the defenders"" with the honorary title ""Hero City of Ukraine"". The title dates from World War Two when it was awarded by the Soviet Union to several cities. Inside the city, as heavily armed police and troops kept watch, there was a palpable layer of tension. This victory was hard-fought, but troops we spoke to conceded that the Russians could be back at some point. ""Yes, I believe that,"" said Serhiy Smalchuk, whose day job is TV presenting. ""They need Kyiv, right, because Putin will lose if he doesn't take over Kyiv. So, perhaps they will try but we are prepared in case they come back, and we will defeat them."" Ivan Kolehin said he expected to die in the battle for Irpin ""We don't know what they are thinking,"" said Ivan Kolehin, a young territorial defence recruit. ""I don't think they will try again any time soon. Their ground forces have been removed but their artillery can still hit us."" Ivan had a day job in marketing before he took up arms. He seemed to be struggling to process the battle for Irpin, and the fact that he is still alive. ""I never thought I would live,"" he said. ""On our third day we heard a whistle and they started to bomb us directly. We sat in the basement and the ceiling started to crumble. We were pretty scared."" Now he worries for the future of the city. ""It's still not safe here, but in due time we will rebuild,"" he said. ""Probably it will take years, considering the damage. I am trying not to think about the fact that every house that was destroyed was built by someone, sometimes with their own hands."" He had Russian friends in the past, but not anymore. ""I hate the Russians from the depths of my heart,"" he said. ""There are no excuses for this."" Civilians are still being evacuated from Irpin Moscow now says it will drastically reduce its attacks around the capital, and focus on the eastern Donbas region. In reality the Kremlin had little choice, as its offensives around the capital had ground to a halt. But in time Russian forces may regroup and target the capital again. If they do, the ""hero city"" will once again be in their path, and in the line of fire. As we left Irpin a trickle of civilians was evacuating on foot, crossing a river bed on planks of wood balanced precariously on rubble and boulders.This is the wreckage of a bridge, blown up by Ukrainian forces to block the Russian advance - another sacrifice made by Irpin. An ambulance was waiting for two elderly women, carried up the riverbank on stretchers - survivors of a merciless and failed Russian assault. Further up the road a departing column of Ukrainian troops - with the swagger of victory - broke into an obscene chant about President Putin.

"This video can not be played Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv As Russia pulls its forces back from areas around Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the BBC has seen evidence of potential war crimes on the outskirts of the city. Our correspondent Jeremy Bowen counted 13 bodies on one small stretch of highway where, just hours earlier, Russian forces had been in control. We know who two of the dead were: a Ukrainian father and mother who had been fleeing to the capital with their daughter and an elderly woman. We know this because their deaths - as he put his hands up in surrender, trying desperately to stop Russian forces firing on the car they were travelling in - were caught on camera by a drone. In other places along the road, attempts had been made to cover up the bodies. Our correspondent says we don't know what happened to these people, but a credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by either the tank crew seen in the drone video, or other Russian soldiers. The drone footage has been handed to the authorities for investigation. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes made since the start of the invasion in February, and both the UN and the International Criminal Court are looking into them. Read Jeremy Bowen's full report into what he and his team found here Several fuel tanks are ablaze, Russian media report Russia accused Ukraine of being responsible for a huge fire at an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod. Russian officials said two Ukrainian military helicopters had crossed the border from Ukraine and fired missiles at the facility. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Russian city of Belgorod, some 40km (25 miles) from the border, said the early morning rocket attack left eight fuel tanks ablaze. Initial statements from Ukraine would neither confirm nor deny that - but later in the day, the secretary of Ukraine's security council, Oleksiy Danilov, said the Russian version of events ""does not correspond to reality"". But if it is true that Ukraine mounted the attack, our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale notes, it would mark the first time that Ukrainian aircraft have flown into Russian airspace to hit a target, bringing the war home to Russia. And it isn't impossible: the skills needed - flying low and fast to avoid detection - are ones Ukrainian pilots have been honing in recent years as the country battled separatists in the east. Read more here. A Red Cross team which had hoped to make it to the besieged city of Mariupol to help with an evacuation effort was forced to turn back after ""arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed"". The team of nine from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been hoping to help evacuate some of the thousands of residents still trapped in the coastal city, large parts of which have been destroyed in the fighting. The regional governor has accused Russia of breaking a promise to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The ICRC said it will try again on Saturday. It had initially been planned for Thursday. Moscow has begun shifting its attention from the capital and the north in general, trying instead to encircle Ukraine's forces in the east of the country. Its army is moving south, taking control of the city of Izyum and bombarding a succession of towns to the east. Eventually, it hopes to move further south still, to the town of Slovyansk. But what is it that Russia wants with this region, known as the Donbas? On paper at least, the aim is to ""liberate"" its Russian-speaking majority. The question remains: can Moscow's forces defeat the Ukrainian army here and - crucially - do the people of this former coal and steel-producing region want to be liberated? As the BBC's Paul Kirby has been finding out, a shared language may not be enough to win the region's loyalty. Read more:Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east The row between Europe and Moscow over how to pay for Russian gas continues. However, despite 1 April being the first day that all Russian gas must be paid for in roubles and through Russian bank accounts, the flow of gas has not been stopped. This is because shipments that have already been paid for are not affected. But anything ordered from today onwards will need to follow the new rules, it seems.

"Shocking images of bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to an outpouring of international condemnation of Russia US President Biden calls Vladimir Putin a war criminal â and says he should face trial over the incidents Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - on a visit to Bucha - accuses Russian forces of committing genocide The BBC has seen further evidence of civilian killings near Kyiv - a shallow grave where four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces were buried Downing Street says the attacks on civilians are ""barbaric"" and that the UK will push forward on more sanctions and military aid Russia says it rejects ""all allegations"" and is claiming videos have been faked, without providing any evidence Edited by Jude Sheerin Yogita LimayeBBC News Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksander are all said to have been killed In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light. In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs. Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed. ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."" Read more. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to zealously pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces in occupied regions of the country. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said investigators would do their upmost to identify the perpetrators of alleged atrocities. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible,"" he said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" ""All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit."" The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the status of the investigations with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv. Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered. The BBC cannot independently verify this claim. ""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said. ""At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city."" ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" he went on. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said it is in Kyiv's interest to have an open and transparent investigation into the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. ""I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the
most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which
will be known and explained to the entire international
community,"" Zelensky said. Airbnb has completed its cancellation of operations in Russia and Belarus. The policy was announced on 3 March, preventing new reservations in the two countries
from that point forward, though the home rental company allowed a month for reservations that had already been booked. Travellers located in Russia and Belarus are unable to book stays at other Airbnb listings. The policy was first announced after Russian shelling sparked a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and Spanish agents seized the ship on Monday US authorities say they have seized a yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, an ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. According to a warrant, the Ukrainian-born oligarch violated 2018 sanctions placed on him by the US. He was again sanctioned last month after Russia's invasion. The 78-meter (255ft) luxury vessel named Tango and valued at $90m (Â£70m) was held in a raid by Spanish  police on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, following a US request. The action was the first from the newly-created US Justice Department initiative dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, which was created to punish Russian oligarchs for violating US sanctions. Officials allege Vekselberg continued to make payments through US banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango. ""Today marks our task forceâs first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,â said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Civilians who fled Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to safer regions should wait several more days before returning, the city's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said, according to Reuters. ""Firstly, there is currently a round-the-clock curfew in the Kyiv region,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Secondly, in certain towns near Kyiv, it's likely that Russian occupiers left landmines, and there are [likely] a lot of unexploded munitions."" Earlier, we reported that Klitschko brandedthe killings near the Ukrainian capital as horror scenes. Authorities in the Brovary, Bucha and Vyshhorod districts of the wider Kyiv region have also said that a curfew will remain in place until April 7, Ukrainian media report. They said that Ukrainian forces would spend the coming days clearing the area of ""explosive 'surprises' left behind by the invaders"". The Ukrainian intelligence service has published what itâ claims is a list of Russian personnel ""who committed war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha"". The list, published on the website of the Ministry of Defense, included the names, dates of birth, passport numbers and ranks of about 2,000 servicemen. A message read: ""Remember! All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine."" It comes after senior government sources told the BBC that the UK government is considering action to target captains, majors, and colonels in the Russian military. The measures could include sanctions as well as ways to hold individuals legally accountable forâ any crimes committed in Ukraine. Russiaâs ambassador to UN has insisted no civilians were harmed during the month-long Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha - and accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence. As we've been reporting,the bodies of dozens of civilians as well as a mass gravehave been found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. But, speaking at a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzia said it was ""staged provocation"" by Western countries. He also accused the UK of ""unprecedented abuse"" in its role this month as president of the UN Security Council, said it was refusing to allow Russia to bring the Bucha incidents up. The BBC has verified footage in Buchain recent days and found the bodies in the streets would have been there for a number of days, and while the town was under Russian control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye visited the basement of a home in Bucha where the bodies of five men wearing civilian clothes were left. They had their hands bound behind their backs and appeared to have been shot. She also saw a shallow grave in the village of Motyzhyn - west of Kyiv - that contained the bodies of four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent A weekend of appalling images and harrowing stories has triggered a fresh wave of international outrage, and, inevitably, talk of more sanctions. No concrete announcements yet, butJoe Biden said those were coming and that heâd been right, in mid-March, to condemn Vladimir Putin in the harshest terms. War crimes trials may have to wait, but leaders agree new sanctions are needed. Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for more measures to target Russian oil and coal. Germanyâs chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Mr Putin and his supporters would, in his words, âfeel the consequencesâ of what happened in Bucha. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany was working towards an embargo on Russian energy, but that it couldnât happen immediately. The small Baltic republic of Lithuania is leading the way. After years of reducing its heavy reliance on Russian gas, its government announced, on Sunday, that imports had finally been reduced to zero. ""If we can do it,"" the countryâs president said, ""the rest of Europe can too"". The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said tough new sanctions will be announced at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers later this week. After meeting her Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, she said these would include banning Russian ships from western ports, cracking down further on Russian banks and going after new industries which she said were filling Mr Putinâs war chest, including gold. Since the withdrawal of Russian troops from Bucha, horrific images of bodies lying in the streets and accounts of killings have emerged. The reports have sparked widespread condemnation and the United Nations has called for an independent investigation into what happened in the town. Ukraine accused Russia of a ""deliberate massacre"" but Russia called it ""a staged provocation by the Kyiv regime"". It made a series of unfounded claims about the footage from Bucha, including that people shown are not actually dead and that no civilians in Bucha were harmed. The BBC has fact checked the claims. Read thefull report here.  The US State Department says the US is supporting a multi-national team of international prosecutors going to the region to collect, preserve and analyse evidence, at the request of Ukrainian officials. The aim is to pursue criminal accountability against Russia, a spokesperson for the State Department said. ""Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable as must those who ordered them. ""They cannot and will not act with impunity."" They said the US is tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.  France is the latest country to decide to expel Russian diplomatic staff, after its foreign ministry announced it was expelling many Russian diplomats. ""Their actions go against our national security interests,"" the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""This move is part of a European initiative."" The French news agency AFP quoted a source close to the Foreign Ministry as saying 35 people would be expelled. It follows a similar decision taken by Germanywhich expelled 40 Russian envoysover the killings of civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. HARDtalkBBC News programme This video can not be played Ukraine war: Bucha massacre is a game changer - Ukraine foreign minister The killings in Bucha should be a ""game changer"" for the support the West is willing to provide Ukraine, the country's foreign minister has said. Speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Dmytro Kuleba said: ""The Bucha massacre should
remove any kind of hesitation and reluctance in the West to provide Ukraine
with all necessary weapons... to defend our country and to free it from the
Russian occupants."" He said additional support should include planes, tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and armoured vehicles as well as a strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Kuleba added that the outcome of the war would be decided not only on the battleground, but in the ""offices in Europe and
North America"" where decisions about the level of additional support will be taken. ""I'm ready to exchange every word of sympathy
and admiration for a tank or a plane that will help me, or or an embargo on gas
and oil that will help me to save human lives in Ukraine,"" he said. A mass grave has been found outside a church in Bucha More now from the joint press conference this afternoon between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. In addition to calling for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" from the UK and its allies to stop Putin's war efforts, Truss backed Kuleba's call for Russia to be expelled from the European Human Rights Council after ""appalling crimes"" including the killing of civilians in Bucha. Kuleba said any G7 and EU nations countries that ""still have doubts"" and are continuing to trade with Russia - by buying fossil fuels, for example - should make their minds up by visiting any of the mass graves in Ukraine. The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports.

"Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years but energy is the most significant People have been warned to brace for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. This could add another Â£629 a year to a typical bill, on top of Friday's unprecedented Â£700-a-year rise, says energy consultancy Cornwall Insight. The expected rise in bills just as colder weather kicks in has prompted calls for fresh government support to those struggling to pay. Energy prices have been affected by the Ukraine war and pressure on suppliers. The most up-to-date prediction from Cornwall Insight would, if accurate, push annual energy bills for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to up to Â£2,600 from October. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky. Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating. ""We are going to see an extra Â£500 or Â£600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,"" he told the BBC. ""He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."" The warning comes on top ofa huge rise in what energy suppliers can charge customers from Friday. The Â£693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of Â£708 a year. At the same time, a host of bill hikes take effect with council tax, water bills and car tax  going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. Why are prices rising so quickly? Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals. This video can not be played Energy price cap rise: 'I've taken a second job' New official figures suggest,externalfour in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. How we cut back: Skipping meals and fewer car journeys Money saving tips: How to budget as energy bills rise 'I'm mending my son's shoes, not buying a new pair' Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. ""We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,"" he toldthe BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. The government has said it was taking ""decisive action"" to help people with the cost of living, including a Â£200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a Â£150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as ""pathetic"". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak toldthe BBC's Newscast: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly.""

"P&O Ferries faces a probe into the controversial no-notice sackings of nearly 800 members of staff. The Insolvency Service has launched criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances around the redundancies. In a letter, it said it would consider ""prompt and appropriate action"" if the law was broken. Grant Shapps has also asked the service to consider disqualifying its boss from acting as a company director. The transport secretary made the announcement as part of new pay plans for the ferry industry this week after P&O Ferries sacked 786 employees without notice and replaced with them with agency workers. P&O Ferries said on Friday that all but one of the sacked employees had taken steps to accept the redundancy offer made by the company. One former P&O worker, John Lansdown, told the BBC he did not respond to the company's offer. The company declined to comment on the Insolvency Service's investigation when approached by BBC News. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he and Mr Shapps would follow the new investigations into P&O Ferries closely as they develop.

Mr Shapps said earlier this week that his new package of measures would force P&O Ferries to ""fundamentally rethink"" its decision.

Ferry industry groups, however, hit out at the transport secretary's plans, with the UK Major Ports Group saying they should not have to ""be the police for the labour practices of ferry companies"". Unions also expressed disappointment that the plans did not go far enough for workers who had already lost their jobs. P&O Ferries' boss Peter Hebblethwaite admitted that the firm knowingly broke the law by not consulting with unions and planning to compensate workers instead. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs The firm said previously that staff would be offered Â£36.5m in total- with about 40 getting more than Â£100,000 each. P&O Ferries said some employees were set to get 91 weeks' pay and the chance of new employment, and no employee would receive less than Â£15,000. Mr Hebblethwaite has insisted that a U-turn on the redundancies would cause the company's total collapse, leading to a loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. He told MSPs this week that P&O had ""painstakingly explored all possible alternatives"", but that it could not expect ""unconditional support"" from parent company DP World for the business without a plan to become viable after making a Â£100m loss year-on-year. Mr Shapps branded the executive a ""pirate of the sea"", accusing him of ""disgracefully shredding the reputation"" of the company. However, Mr Hebblethwaite said he would not step down. He said he felt compelled ""to discharge my duties for this historical company"" and provide ""the effective operation of the trade routes upon which this country depends"". ""I will therefore continue to do my utmost to ensure that this company has a sustainable business for the future.""

"Shocking images of bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to an outpouring of international condemnation of Russia US President Biden calls Vladimir Putin a war criminal â and says he should face trial over the incidents Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - on a visit to Bucha - accuses Russian forces of committing genocide The BBC has seen further evidence of civilian killings near Kyiv - a shallow grave where four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces were buried Downing Street says the attacks on civilians are ""barbaric"" and that the UK will push forward on more sanctions and military aid Russia says it rejects ""all allegations"" and is claiming videos have been faked, without providing any evidence Edited by Jude Sheerin Yogita LimayeBBC News Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksander are all said to have been killed In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light. In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs. Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed. ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."" Read more. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to zealously pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces in occupied regions of the country. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said investigators would do their upmost to identify the perpetrators of alleged atrocities. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible,"" he said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" ""All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit."" The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the status of the investigations with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv. Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered. The BBC cannot independently verify this claim. ""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said. ""At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city."" ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" he went on. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said it is in Kyiv's interest to have an open and transparent investigation into the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. ""I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the
most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which
will be known and explained to the entire international
community,"" Zelensky said. Airbnb has completed its cancellation of operations in Russia and Belarus. The policy was announced on 3 March, preventing new reservations in the two countries
from that point forward, though the home rental company allowed a month for reservations that had already been booked. Travellers located in Russia and Belarus are unable to book stays at other Airbnb listings. The policy was first announced after Russian shelling sparked a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and Spanish agents seized the ship on Monday US authorities say they have seized a yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, an ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. According to a warrant, the Ukrainian-born oligarch violated 2018 sanctions placed on him by the US. He was again sanctioned last month after Russia's invasion. The 78-meter (255ft) luxury vessel named Tango and valued at $90m (Â£70m) was held in a raid by Spanish  police on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, following a US request. The action was the first from the newly-created US Justice Department initiative dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, which was created to punish Russian oligarchs for violating US sanctions. Officials allege Vekselberg continued to make payments through US banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango. ""Today marks our task forceâs first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,â said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Civilians who fled Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to safer regions should wait several more days before returning, the city's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said, according to Reuters. ""Firstly, there is currently a round-the-clock curfew in the Kyiv region,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Secondly, in certain towns near Kyiv, it's likely that Russian occupiers left landmines, and there are [likely] a lot of unexploded munitions."" Earlier, we reported that Klitschko brandedthe killings near the Ukrainian capital as horror scenes. Authorities in the Brovary, Bucha and Vyshhorod districts of the wider Kyiv region have also said that a curfew will remain in place until April 7, Ukrainian media report. They said that Ukrainian forces would spend the coming days clearing the area of ""explosive 'surprises' left behind by the invaders"". The Ukrainian intelligence service has published what itâ claims is a list of Russian personnel ""who committed war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha"". The list, published on the website of the Ministry of Defense, included the names, dates of birth, passport numbers and ranks of about 2,000 servicemen. A message read: ""Remember! All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine."" It comes after senior government sources told the BBC that the UK government is considering action to target captains, majors, and colonels in the Russian military. The measures could include sanctions as well as ways to hold individuals legally accountable forâ any crimes committed in Ukraine. Russiaâs ambassador to UN has insisted no civilians were harmed during the month-long Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha - and accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence. As we've been reporting,the bodies of dozens of civilians as well as a mass gravehave been found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. But, speaking at a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzia said it was ""staged provocation"" by Western countries. He also accused the UK of ""unprecedented abuse"" in its role this month as president of the UN Security Council, said it was refusing to allow Russia to bring the Bucha incidents up. The BBC has verified footage in Buchain recent days and found the bodies in the streets would have been there for a number of days, and while the town was under Russian control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye visited the basement of a home in Bucha where the bodies of five men wearing civilian clothes were left. They had their hands bound behind their backs and appeared to have been shot. She also saw a shallow grave in the village of Motyzhyn - west of Kyiv - that contained the bodies of four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent A weekend of appalling images and harrowing stories has triggered a fresh wave of international outrage, and, inevitably, talk of more sanctions. No concrete announcements yet, butJoe Biden said those were coming and that heâd been right, in mid-March, to condemn Vladimir Putin in the harshest terms. War crimes trials may have to wait, but leaders agree new sanctions are needed. Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for more measures to target Russian oil and coal. Germanyâs chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Mr Putin and his supporters would, in his words, âfeel the consequencesâ of what happened in Bucha. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany was working towards an embargo on Russian energy, but that it couldnât happen immediately. The small Baltic republic of Lithuania is leading the way. After years of reducing its heavy reliance on Russian gas, its government announced, on Sunday, that imports had finally been reduced to zero. ""If we can do it,"" the countryâs president said, ""the rest of Europe can too"". The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said tough new sanctions will be announced at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers later this week. After meeting her Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, she said these would include banning Russian ships from western ports, cracking down further on Russian banks and going after new industries which she said were filling Mr Putinâs war chest, including gold. Since the withdrawal of Russian troops from Bucha, horrific images of bodies lying in the streets and accounts of killings have emerged. The reports have sparked widespread condemnation and the United Nations has called for an independent investigation into what happened in the town. Ukraine accused Russia of a ""deliberate massacre"" but Russia called it ""a staged provocation by the Kyiv regime"". It made a series of unfounded claims about the footage from Bucha, including that people shown are not actually dead and that no civilians in Bucha were harmed. The BBC has fact checked the claims. Read thefull report here.  The US State Department says the US is supporting a multi-national team of international prosecutors going to the region to collect, preserve and analyse evidence, at the request of Ukrainian officials. The aim is to pursue criminal accountability against Russia, a spokesperson for the State Department said. ""Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable as must those who ordered them. ""They cannot and will not act with impunity."" They said the US is tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.  France is the latest country to decide to expel Russian diplomatic staff, after its foreign ministry announced it was expelling many Russian diplomats. ""Their actions go against our national security interests,"" the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""This move is part of a European initiative."" The French news agency AFP quoted a source close to the Foreign Ministry as saying 35 people would be expelled. It follows a similar decision taken by Germanywhich expelled 40 Russian envoysover the killings of civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. HARDtalkBBC News programme This video can not be played Ukraine war: Bucha massacre is a game changer - Ukraine foreign minister The killings in Bucha should be a ""game changer"" for the support the West is willing to provide Ukraine, the country's foreign minister has said. Speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Dmytro Kuleba said: ""The Bucha massacre should
remove any kind of hesitation and reluctance in the West to provide Ukraine
with all necessary weapons... to defend our country and to free it from the
Russian occupants."" He said additional support should include planes, tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and armoured vehicles as well as a strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Kuleba added that the outcome of the war would be decided not only on the battleground, but in the ""offices in Europe and
North America"" where decisions about the level of additional support will be taken. ""I'm ready to exchange every word of sympathy
and admiration for a tank or a plane that will help me, or or an embargo on gas
and oil that will help me to save human lives in Ukraine,"" he said. A mass grave has been found outside a church in Bucha More now from the joint press conference this afternoon between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. In addition to calling for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" from the UK and its allies to stop Putin's war efforts, Truss backed Kuleba's call for Russia to be expelled from the European Human Rights Council after ""appalling crimes"" including the killing of civilians in Bucha. Kuleba said any G7 and EU nations countries that ""still have doubts"" and are continuing to trade with Russia - by buying fossil fuels, for example - should make their minds up by visiting any of the mass graves in Ukraine. The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. Tom BatemanReporting from Zaporizhzhia Weâve arrived at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia at the same time as a long convoy of cars.

"Corpses and burned out cars litter this stretch of the E-40 highway Footage of Russian troops shooting a man with his hands up on a highway outside Kyiv at the beginning of March was shared around the world. Now the Russians have been pushed out of the area and the BBC's Jeremy Bowen has been to see the grim aftermath of their short-lived occupation. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing We counted 13 bodies on a nightmarish stretch of road not much more than 200 yards long, between Mria and Myla, villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians who were killed by the Russians. The others have not been identified yet - they lie where they were killed - but only two are wearing recognisable Ukrainian military uniforms. Our BBC team was able to get to the area, on the main E-40 highway as it approaches Kyiv, because Ukrainian forces had captured the sector only 10 hours earlier. The marks of battle and of heavy shelling were everywhere. Petrol stations and a hotel that was well-known for its spa and restaurant were in ruins. Shell holes and craters pockmarked both carriageways. Ukrainian troops changing a wheel in the ruins of a roadside garage said the Russians were about 4km (2.5 miles) away and had pulled their remaining men and armour back after a hard fight, lasting several days, in the early hours of the morning. Warning: Graphic video ahead Left behind in the heart of the desolation were the dead bodies, and a mass of questions and concerns about who they were and how they died. This video can not be played Watch: Jeremy Bowen finds bodies on a road Russians occupied outside Kyiv Some answers already exist for a couple who were killed by the Russians and left to decompose on 7 March. Their rusty, shrapnel riddled car lies in the road next to one of the petrol stations, reduced to a shell by fire. Next to it are the burnt and twisted remains of a body that is just about recognisable as the remains of a man. A wedding ring is still on the corpse's finger. Stretched out inside the hulk of their car is what is left of the incinerated body of a woman, the mouth opened in what looks like a scream. Their deaths were filmed by a Ukrainian drone on 7 March, operated by the Bugatti unit of Territorial Defence. The unit released the video, which was republished by news organisations around the world. It caused outrage because it showed the cold-blooded killing of a man who had raised his arms to show he was harmless, in the classic gesture of surrender. The bodies, the BBC discovered in an investigation this month, are of Maksim Iowenko and his wife Ksjena. They were part of a convoy of 10 civilian vehicles who were trying to escape the Russians and get to Kyiv. Ksjena and Maksim Iowenko were civilians and should have been protected As they drove down the road, they spotted a Russian tank in position, dug into the grass verge. The drone video shows it was clearly marked with the letter V, one of the identifiers used by the Russian armed forces. The other cars did quick U-turns and drove away at speed. But Maksim's car stopped, most likely because it was hit. As soon as the car stopped, Maksim leapt out and raised his hands. Within seconds he was shot dead. His wife was killed in the car. Also in the car were their six-year-old son and the elderly mother of one of Maksim's friends. Both of them survived and were eventually released by the Russian soldiers. They were found walking back down the road, and the woman told her family that Maksim was shouting that a child was in the car when he was killed. Both survivors, according to the Bugatti drone unit, are now safe but deeply traumatised. Warning: Graphic images ahead The car is now burnt out, but it was not on fire after the attack. One hypothesis must be that the bodies and the car were set on fire by the Russians to destroy the evidence of what they had done. The Bugatti Unit has submitted its drone video to the Ukrainian authorities and to the Metropolitan Police in London. More burnt cars and dead bodies line the road for the next few hundred yards. No video has emerged to show what happened. A credible working assumption for any investigation must be that the other dead people were killed by the tank crew, or other Russian soldiers. Some of the evidence the BBC gathered is too disturbing to show in full. Here a dead man has been covered by rubber tyres Here a Ukrainian soldier gestures towards sets of charred human remains by a burned out vehicle Attempts have been made to destroy the other bodies. Some have been left to rot where they were killed. But other corpses have been piled up and surrounded by tyres. Charred clothing indicates attempts were made to set fires around them. Tyres are flammable and must have been placed there as an accelerant. The emplacement where the tank was dug in has a clear arc of fire across the area where the 13 bodies are lying. The tank has gone but debris was left by its crew, including Russian army field rations. In the woods nearby is at least one other tank, which has been burnt out after being hit by an anti-tank missile. A Ukrainian soldier produced a wallet he had found in the tank. He emptied out Russian identity papers, bank notes in the Russian currency, the rouble, and small change in Belorussian coppers. The major thrust to the north-west of Kyiv came from invaders who had crossed the border from Belarus, Moscow's ally. Close by the knocked out tank are the remains of a chaotic camp, with dugouts, chairs and a long table piled high with the remains of food and drink. They are all surrounded by big piles of garbage, rotten food and empty bottles of alcohol. Ukrainian soldiers said shops at the petrol stations were looted. An abandoned Russian camp: the soldiers are said to have looted petrol stations Next to the table is a large pair of bolt-cutters. Piles of unburied rubbish scattered in a forward position are usually a sign of undisciplined soldiers. We decided to drive two or three kilometres further down the road, after Ukrainian soldiers said more Russian armour had been destroyed. In a small village, a Russian tank and two armoured personnel carriers were broken and burnt. Some of the wreckage was still smoking. The force of the weapon that destroyed the tank blew off its turret and main gun, which lay upside down and half buried in a crater around 15 yards away. In the pine woods on either side of the road Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and fox holes with shovels. Others were patrolling. It was far too early to say whether the Russians were gone for good, or whether they would be back. What is clear though is that Russian forces, under continued pressure from Ukrainian soldiers, have been forced to yield strategic territory around Kyiv. Every time they move back, the Ukrainian capital and its people become a little safer. This video can not be played Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians As and when the Russians leave, more evidence is likely to emerge of civilians having been killed - backing up the many stories that have emerged of such incidents. The gruesome scenes on the road were more than simply the terrible deaths of human beings who had become victims of President Putin's decision to invade. It is also a crime scene, with evidence that should be collected and preserved for an investigation whenever this war ends. Under the laws of war civilians are protected, and when they are killed in defiance of those laws, their deaths amount to war crimes.

"Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years but energy is the most significant People have been warned to brace for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. This could add another Â£629 a year to a typical bill, on top of Friday's unprecedented Â£700-a-year rise, says energy consultancy Cornwall Insight. The expected rise in bills just as colder weather kicks in has prompted calls for fresh government support to those struggling to pay. Energy prices have been affected by the Ukraine war and pressure on suppliers. The most up-to-date prediction from Cornwall Insight would, if accurate, push annual energy bills for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to up to Â£2,600 from October. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky. Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating. ""We are going to see an extra Â£500 or Â£600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,"" he told the BBC. ""He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."" The warning comes on top ofa huge rise in what energy suppliers can charge customers from Friday. The Â£693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of Â£708 a year. At the same time, a host of bill hikes take effect with council tax, water bills and car tax  going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. Why are prices rising so quickly? Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals. This video can not be played Energy price cap rise: 'I've taken a second job' New official figures suggest,externalfour in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. How we cut back: Skipping meals and fewer car journeys Money saving tips: How to budget as energy bills rise 'I'm mending my son's shoes, not buying a new pair' Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. ""We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,"" he toldthe BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. The government has said it was taking ""decisive action"" to help people with the cost of living, including a Â£200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a Â£150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as ""pathetic"". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak toldthe BBC's Newscast: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly.""

"Unite workers went on strike for a week last month Some school transport and special schools face disruption on Friday due to strike action by the Unite union. Members of Unite who work for the Education Authority (EA) are striking over pay. Glenveagh Special School in Belfast has told parents that it has ""no option"" but for pupils to remain at home as a result. The union also said it is likely there will be ""considerable disruption"" to school transport in some areas. Members of Unite are taking action over a local government pay offer of 1.75%, which the union has called a ""real terms pay cut"". Inflation in the UK is rising at its fastest rate for 30 yearsas fuel, energy and food costs surge. Unite is one of the largest public sector unions, and its members in councils, the Education Authority and the Housing Executive recently took strike action for a week from 21 March to 27 March. Its members who work for the EA are taking a further day of strike action on Friday 1 April. In a statement, Kieran Ellison from Unite said the EA needed to make a ""realistic"" pay offer. ""Full responsibility for this lies with the Education Authority who have failed to make any response even after the first week of strike action,"" he said. ""We are calling on them to come forward with a realistic pay offer to address our members' pay expectations."" Union 'wouldn't exempt special schools' from strike Some Education Authority 'yellow bus' drivers, school meals staff and classroom assistants are members of Unite. Transport to some special schools is likely to be particularly affected as many pupils rely on EA buses to get to school. But Glenveagh Special School has told parents that almost all of its ""non-teaching"" staff including classroom assistants will not be in school on Friday. ""The support staff in Glenveagh bring immeasurable value to the children with whom they work and are critical to the safe operation of the school,"" a letter from the school said. ""We fully respect their right to engage in industrial action."" But the letter said Glenveagh had ""a vastly higher number of support staff"" who were members of Unite than other schools. ""It is anticipated that less than 1% of our non-teaching staff will be in attendance on Friday,"" the letter said. ""We simply cannot safely provide face-to-face teaching for pupils in these circumstances. ""We understand that this will cause further disruption to our pupils and families."" Unite, which also took action in March, says the EA needs to make a ""realistic"" pay offer The school also urged the EA and the union to ""engage in discussions"" to resolve the situation and warned parents the school may be affected by further strike action in the future. There will be 15 Unite picket lines across Northern Ireland at some schools and other EA buildings. The EA said that they had again asked Unite for exemptions from the strike action for special school staff, and for drivers transporting pupils to special schools, to minimise the disruption to children and young people. ""However, these latest requests were considered and not accepted,"" the EA said. In a statement, the EA's director of human resources, Clare Duffield, said the national pay deal had already been accepted by the majority of trade unions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. ""Therefore, local government organisations, including the EA, do not have the power or authority to renegotiate this for Northern Ireland,"" she said. ""This being the case, I remain very concerned about the disproportionate impact the industrial action is having on children, particularly those with special educational needs, and would call upon Unite to reconsider putting in place exemptions for special school staff and transport.""

"P&O Ferries faces a probe into the controversial no-notice sackings of nearly 800 members of staff. The Insolvency Service has launched criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances around the redundancies. In a letter, it said it would consider ""prompt and appropriate action"" if the law was broken. Grant Shapps has also asked the service to consider disqualifying its boss from acting as a company director. The transport secretary made the announcement as part of new pay plans for the ferry industry this week after P&O Ferries sacked 786 employees without notice and replaced with them with agency workers. P&O Ferries said on Friday that all but one of the sacked employees had taken steps to accept the redundancy offer made by the company. One former P&O worker, John Lansdown, told the BBC he did not respond to the company's offer. The company declined to comment on the Insolvency Service's investigation when approached by BBC News. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng tweeted that he and Mr Shapps would follow the new investigations into P&O Ferries closely as they develop. The Insolvency Service has the power to investigate allegations of corporate abuse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Shapps said earlier this week that his new package of measures would force P&O Ferries to ""fundamentally rethink"" its decision. He urged ports to block ferries from docking if they do not pay their crew the UK minimum wage, with plans to create new laws. Ferry industry groups, however, hit out at the transport secretary's plans, with the UK Major Ports Group saying they should not have to ""be the police for the labour practices of ferry companies"". Unions also expressed disappointment that the plans did not go far enough for workers who had already lost their jobs. P&O Ferries' boss Peter Hebblethwaite admitted that the firm knowingly broke the law by not consulting with unions and planning to compensate workers instead. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs The firm said previously that staff would be offered Â£36.5m in total- with about 40 getting more than Â£100,000 each. P&O Ferries said some employees were set to get 91 weeks' pay and the chance of new employment, and no employee would receive less than Â£15,000. Mr Hebblethwaite has insisted that a U-turn on the redundancies would cause the company's total collapse, leading to a loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. He told MSPs this week that P&O had ""painstakingly explored all possible alternatives"", but that it could not expect ""unconditional support"" from parent company DP World for the business without a plan to become viable after making a Â£100m loss year-on-year. Mr Shapps branded the executive a ""pirate of the sea"", accusing him of ""disgracefully shredding the reputation"" of the company. However, Mr Hebblethwaite said he would not step down. He said he felt compelled ""to discharge my duties for this historical company"" and provide ""the effective operation of the trade routes upon which this country depends"". ""I will therefore continue to do my utmost to ensure that this company has a sustainable business for the future.""

"Rishi Sunak said it was OK for people to attack him, but not wife Akshata Murty Indian tech giant Infosys, in which UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife owns shares thought to be worth more than Â£400m, is closing its office in Russia. Sources told the BBC that the company was trying to find replacement roles abroad for staff employed in Moscow. Infosys has been under pressure to cease its Russian operations following the invasion of Ukraine. And Mr Sunak has faced questions over wife Akshata Murty's shares in the firm, which was founded by her father. Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News it was important for the chancellor to reveal whether his family had been ""benefiting from money made in Russia when the [UK] government has put in place sanctions"" on firms and individuals following the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Sunak told the BBC's Newscast podcast this week that he had found criticism of his wife ""very upsetting"", adding that he understood how film star Will Smith had felt when his own wife had been mocked by comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars over her medical condition. But he joked: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody, which is good."" I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak Sunak faces questions over firm operating in Russia Truss visits India on same day as Lavrov Infosys, one of India's biggest companies with a presence in about 50 countries, set up an engineering centre in Moscow in 2016 and it is thought that up to 100 people are employed there. After Russia invaded Ukraine, many global IT firms suspended operations in the country, but Infosys has kept what it called ""a small team... based out of Russia that services some of our global clients"" until now. ""We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,"" it added in a recent statement. A spokesperson for Infosys declined to comment on the decision to close the Moscow office or what its future involvement with companies operating in Russia would be. Rishi Sunak says it is unfair that his wife has faced criticism over her Infosys shares Ms Murty's shareholding of 0.9% of Infosys is estimated to be worth more than Â£400m. A spokesperson for Mr Sunak has previously said neither she nor any members of her family ""have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company"". But Labour and the Liberal Democrats have insisted the chancellor has questions to answer about whether his family benefits from the shareholding at a time when he is calling for UK businesses to divest from Russia. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News it was ""in the public interest"" to do so. He added: ""I'm not attacking their family but I do want to know if the chancellor's household is benefiting from money from a company that's investing in Russia when the government is saying quite rightly that nobody should be doing that."" The chancellor told Newscast that, being in public life, he was himself ""fair game"" for criticism, but it was ""very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my wife"". Infosys, which has offices in London, Edinburgh and Nottinghamshire, announced last year that it was hiring 1,000 extra staff in the UK. India's government, unlike the UK's, has not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and did not vote against it at the United Nations Security Council.

"Millions of households are facing a Â£700 a year rise in energy costs, alongside hikes in the cost of council tax, water bills and other utilities. It has led to warnings that many people on lower incomes will be forced to choose between paying for heating, or food. A selection of your questions have been answered by: Kevin Peachey -personal finance correspondent Nicholas Barrett -Reality Check Why do we pay more using a prepayment meter? - Gary Steventon For the 4.5 million people on prepayment meters, the price of energy has now risen by an average Â£708 - to Â£2,017 a year. That compares to an annual rise of Â£693 - to Â£1,971 - for those on standard tariffs, paid by direct debit. Energy regulator Ofgem's argument is that there are higher fixed costs associated with running a prepayment meter. Charities and some suppliers have said that these customers are often among the most vulnerable and should be given more help by the government. Prepayment energy customers feeling the strain Who allowed the price cap to increase by so much, especially when the energy companies have made record profits? - Chris Yaxley The price cap, covering England, Wales and Scotland, is set every six months by energy regulator Ofgem. It is designed to reflect the costs faced by suppliers and to prevent profiteering. There has been a huge rise this time, owing to the rising cost energy companies pay for gas. This is now being passed on to customers. How high could my energy bills go? There has been a debate aboutwhether energy companies should be taxed more, with the money raised used to help those struggling with bills. Energy companies argue that their retail arms are making very little, or no, profit. While the energy generation business is having a much better time of it, they argue that they are already heavily taxed. Gas prices do not increase by themselves. What is causing the increase? - John Ashburn There are a host of reasons why the wholesale price of gas - paid by energy companies - has been volatile. At present it is about six times higher than it was a year ago. One reason is the surge in demand for energy, as businesses and economies get going again after the lifting of Covid restrictions. There is also the ongoing issue of a shortage of gas storage across Europe. A further rise in the price cap - predicted to push up the typical household energy bill by another Â£600 a year - is expected in October. This is mainly because of the potential restriction of Russian gas supplies - linked to the war in Ukraine. While we get very little gas from Russia in the UK, we are affected by the global price of gas. Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Can people forced to work from home ask employers to contribute to energy bills? - Andrew Green There is nothing to stop you asking. What response you get from your employer is down to them. Some employers have offeredtemporary grants and payments, to help their staff pay their energy bills. Unions and employees themselves are likely to point to the rising cost of living - including higher energy bills - to ask for higher salaries. Will giving up Netflix, Amazon Prime, alcohol and mobile phones offset the rising cost? - Leslie Cox The average UK household spends about Â£916 on alcohol each year. The cheapest Netflix plan costs Â£84 a year, while Amazon Prime costs Â£96. Some mobile phone deals exceed Â£80 a month but, depending on your contract, you may be able to switch to a SIM-only deal for as little as Â£36 a year. Giving up all of these costs could save between Â£1,132 and Â£2,056 a year. A 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay Â£1,971 per year. So, going without could make a difference. But even then, a further rise pushing the annual bill up to Â£2,600 should be expected in October, analysts have told the BBC. How is the assistance provided going to help pensioners who have been robbed of a triple-lock increase? Dave The triple-lock, a policy used to set the rise in state pensions, wassuspendedlast year because it followed the average rise in wages and would have meant an increase of 8%. At the time that seemed like a big increase, but inflation is now 6.2%. Instead of the state pension going up by 8%, it's going up by 3.1% - based on the rate of inflation in September last year, which is a much smaller pay rise for state pensioners. Changes announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Spring Statement were mostly aimed at working people who pay National Insurance. There has not been any specific new support for pensioners. What is the triple lock and why has it been 'suspended'? Why have tariffs on 100% renewable electricity gone up? - Karl Oldham Eco providers are still affected by wholesale prices, which are driving bill rises. These providers try to buy in advance from renewable sources, and invest in schemes for renewable generation. But ultimately, at present, they have to source electricity from the National Grid - some of which is generated from gas. As a result, they are not immune to the situation in the wider market, and prices charged by renewable generators have been going up too.

"Passengers are being warned of longer than usual queues at airports over Easter due to staff shortages. The Airport Operators Association (AOA) said its members had been trying to hire for new roles following job losses and staff departing to other industries during the coronavirus pandemic. But it warned recruitment problems and Covid-related staff absences could put operations at airports under strain. The AOA represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh. Karen Dee, chief executive of the AOA, said at peak time passengers ""may not have the experience they are used to"". She said airports were working hard to recruit more staff in the run-up to the Easter holidays, and were ""working with the UK government to resolve any delays in the necessary checks before staff can start work"". The AOA has asked travellers to arrive early for flights due to longer check-in waits and has also urged people to make sure they have any Covid-related documents needed for their destination. Holiday bookings jumped with trips planned for Easter after UK Covid travel tests were scrapped. However, airports have said they are operating in a very tight labour market and are trying to keep up with rising demands following the sharp drops in people travelling abroad over the past two years. Kevin O'Reilly, of the specialist aviation and airport recruitment company One Resourcing, said finding enough airport ground staff, including cleaners and baggage handlers, was proving very challenging. ""It's always been a tough market to recruit for, but it's become harder this year,"" he said. Mr O'Reilly said there were a number of reasons businesses were struggling to replenish their staffing levels. ""A huge number of people left the aviation industry due to the pandemic and whilst many have come back, many have found alternative positions in other sectors and do not want to risk returning to work in an industry that made them redundant,"" he added. ""Now there's a bounce-back from having no people travelling, to suddenly everyone wanting travel. ""Recruitment at airports doesn't happen overnight, people must go through a thorough security vetting process to get an airside pass."" He said some other jobs were tempting workers away from the industry, and some EU nationals had left after Brexit. Manchester Airport has already blamed staff shortages on long passenger queues in recent weeks, ahead of the busier Easter break. Its bossadmitted further problems were likelyas the airport struggled with increasing demand after ""dramatically scaling back"" operations during the pandemic. Earlier this month, Britain's biggest airport Heathrow saidpeak demand over the summer holidays could reach 85% of pre-pandemic levels. It said it would need to gear up to meet this demand, as airlines, handlers and airports did not currently have the capacity. Heathrow added it was ""particularly concerned over Border Force's ability to scale up"".

"Comparing prices of every day items can help bring your spending down, experts say Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years and millions of households are facing the prospect of a soaring energy bill. We asked four experts for their top tips on what people can do to protect their finances and soften the blow of rising bills. Being a wedding or party guest can be expensive - consider whether you need to go to every occasion A good starting point is to look in-depth at your spending to find out exactly where your money is going, says Bola Sol, author of How to Save It. ""Start by assessing if there is room for negotiation in any of your fixed expenses,"" she says. ""Is there a better and cheaper provider?"" When it comes to variable monthly outgoings decide what should stay and what should go, she says. ""Every budget needs a miscellaneous fund for those expenses you did not see coming,"" she says. ""Have one in for each month."" ""Look at your calendar at who is celebrating a birthday, baby shower, wedding or occasion this month,"" she says. ""Ask yourself, if you go, how much will it cost you and is it worth going given the current climate?"" She suggests joining supermarket rewards schemes and family deals for streaming services as well as comparing prices online and searching for discount codes. Having treats like takeaway coffee less often could add up to decent savings says finance analyst Myron Jobson Small cuts in lots of places can be a less painful way to improve your finances, says Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at the investment platform, Interactive Investor. ""While making huge cuts to a few areas of spending could significantly ease the cost of living squeeze on your finances, they could also have an unacceptable knock-on effect on your quality of life and take a heavy toll on mental and emotional health,"" he says. But small changes can add up, he says. ""For example, you do not have to completely forgo your daily coffee purchase, but you can cut back on how often you buy them."" After over two years of Covid restrictions, many of us are keen to spend money on getting out more, he says. ""Halving the number of jaunts averaging Â£50 a week in a month, for example, would give you an extra Â£100 a month which could go towards footing the extra Â£57.75 a month increase to the average energy bill,"" he says. It's important to check you're getting all the benefits you are eligible for, the Citizens Advice Bureau If you are facing tough times it is important to make sure you are getting all the support you are entitled to, says Kayley Hignell, the head of families, welfare and work at Citizens Advice. You can use theCitizens Advice benefits calculator,externalto work out if here's any help you could be claiming, she says. ""Important benefits to consider might be Personal Independent Payment, if you need extra help for an illness or disability, or universal credit if you are on a low income or unemployed,"" she says. ""Pension Credit, which can top up your income in retirement, is something many people do not know they are entitled to. ""There are also schemes like local council tax reductions and the new Household Support Fund where you will need to speak to your local council about what might be on offer."" Low-income families might also be able to get help with the costs of sending children to school, including school meals, transport and uniform through your local education authority, she says. Money problems can impact on your mental health and vice versa, experts say Mental health and finances can be intrinsically linked, says Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. This means money troubles can have a serious impact on our mental wellbeing, and vice versa, she says. ""If you are feeling stressed or worried about your financial situation, it is important to know that you are not alone and there is help out there,"" she says. ""There is no debt problem that is not fixable with the right support. If you're struggling to keep up with bills, there are lots of free debt advice organisations that can help,"" she says. ""Similarly, if your finances are starting to take a toll on your mental health, it's important to seek help."" She suggests contacting your GP or speaking to a charity like the Samaritans. ""In recent years lots of banks and energy companies have introduced tools to help customers manage their finances so it is worth asking your providers what they can offer,"" she says. These include sending copies of bills and other letters to a nominated person of your choice, so that they can help you make decisions. Some banks now offer a carer's card, which is a debit card for a loved one to use on your behalf for limited purposes such as grocery shopping, she says. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"The club opened in 1980 and has since hosted many internationally renowned artists Landlords of a beloved music venue have pledged that it will not close down. Managers at Sheffield's Leadmill said on Thursday that owners Electric Group had served an eviction notice ordering them to quit the building next March. But the group said there was ""never any question"" of it closing and it would be refurbished at the end of the current agreement in March 2023. In a response, venue bosses said they owned its name and brand, adding: ""Without us there is no Leadmill"" The legendary music venue opened its doors in 1980 and has hosted artists including Pulp, Coldplay, The Stone Roses and Oasis. Bands, comedians and past gig-goers rushed to voice their support on social media after its managers announced they had been served notice to quit in a year's time. Yorkshire's Kaiser Chiefs recalled playing the club in their early days,saying,externalthey had ""very fond memories"" and losing the Leadmill would be a loss for ""the whole UK music scene"". Legendary music venue facing closure In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson from the Brixton-based Electric Group, which also owns and runs venues in London, Bristol and Newcastle, said it would oversee ""a substantial investment"" in the venue once the current tenant had gone. Mike Weller, from the group, said: ""The refurb will make the room better-equipped to accommodate the modern wants of live music and club nights, for audiences and performers."" His colleague Dominic Maddentweeted,externalthat, as landlords, they were ""music people"" and the Leadmill would continue ""as a special music venue"". ""The management may change but the song stays the same,"" he said. The Leadmill criticised the landlords' actions in a statement on social media In a response posted on Twitter, Leadmill management said the eviction order amounted to an ""extermination"" of the club's hard-won reputation. ""Millions of pounds have been spent by the Leadmill (not the landlord) on the fabric of what was once a derelict building"", they said. ""It is the hard-working, dedicated and local family of staff that have put 42 years' worth of their blood, sweat and tears into making it the cultural asset it is today. ""Everything that people love about it would be gone."" Sheffield City Council said the Leadmill was an ""iconic"" part of its history and it did not want to see it go. Executive director Kate Martin said, the authority had been working with the venue in recent weeks but had limited powers and could not ""directly intervene in the legal process"" between landlord and tenant. Meanwhile, five Sheffield MPs have written to Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries asking for an urgent meeting to discuss how to save the venue. In the letter, they said: ""It is an essential part of the UK's cultural heritage and an asset to our creative industries, which we cannot lose.""

"Lord Patel was appointed Yorkshire chair in November after Roger Hutton resigned Yorkshire chair Lord Patel hailed an ""overwhelming vote for positive change"" after structural reforms at the club were approved. Thursday's changes mean Yorkshire can host international matches again, havingmet criteriaset out by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The ECB suspended the club's right to stage England games over its handling of theAzeem Rafiq racism scandal. ""We thank the members for their full and proper consideration,"" said Patel. ""This support will help Yorkshire County Cricket Club to be an inclusive and welcoming place and gives us the clarity and certainty we need to keep building this great club."" Former spinner Rafiq said on social media: ""Relieved to see Lord Patel's reforms backed today and that Yorkshire members chose a bright, inclusive future for my club. ""Big opportunity to show the world what can be achieved when you have strong leadership and good people."" Patel, who wasappointed in November,said in January that Yorkshirefaced a ""huge financial crisis""if the ban was not lifted and that regaining its international status was key to the planned reforms. Yorkshire's right to host England matches was reinstated subject to key requirements being met by the end of March. The club held an extraordinary general meeting at Headingley on the day of the deadline and members overwhelmingly passed three special resolutions. Former chairman Robin Smith had said thatPatel's appointment was ""invalid"", but one of the three resolutions saw Patel confirmed as chair. Members also voted in favour of changes to the composition of the board and the removal of legal liability from decisions made by board members since November. An ECB spokesperson said the vote ""is an important step forward in bringing about real change and setting the club on course for a more inclusive future"". They added: ""However, there is much work still to be done at Yorkshire and it is important that the plans set out so far are now delivered. We will continue to monitor progress closely. ""Our regulatory investigation into the complaints brought by Azeem Rafiq, which is separate to this process, remains ongoing and we will update on this in due course."" Headingley is now set to host England's Test against New Zealand from 23 June and the final match of their one-day international against South Africa on 24 July. It was announced on Friday that Surrey's African Caribbean Engagement Programme (ACE) will be extended across the country, including in Leeds. It will also be expanded to Nottingham, Manchester and additional London boroughs. ACE was established by former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent at Surrey in 2020 to provide opportunities to cricketers from black communities.

"Shocking images of bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to an outpouring of international condemnation of Russia US President Biden calls Vladimir Putin a war criminal â and says he should face trial over the incidents Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - on a visit to Bucha - accuses Russian forces of committing genocide The BBC has seen further evidence of civilian killings near Kyiv - a shallow grave where four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces were buried Downing Street says the attacks on civilians are ""barbaric"" and that the UK will push forward on more sanctions and military aid Russia says it rejects ""all allegations"" and is claiming videos have been faked, without providing any evidence Edited by Jude Sheerin Yogita LimayeBBC News Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksander are all said to have been killed In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light. In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs. Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed. ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."" Read more. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to zealously pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces in occupied regions of the country. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said investigators would do their upmost to identify the perpetrators of alleged atrocities. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible,"" he said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" ""All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit."" The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the status of the investigations with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv. Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered. The BBC cannot independently verify this claim. ""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said. ""At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city."" ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" he went on. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said it is in Kyiv's interest to have an open and transparent investigation into the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. ""I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the
most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which
will be known and explained to the entire international
community,"" Zelensky said. Airbnb has completed its cancellation of operations in Russia and Belarus. The policy was announced on 3 March, preventing new reservations in the two countries
from that point forward, though the home rental company allowed a month for reservations that had already been booked. Travellers located in Russia and Belarus are unable to book stays at other Airbnb listings. The policy was first announced after Russian shelling sparked a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and Spanish agents seized the ship on Monday US authorities say they have seized a yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, an ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. According to a warrant, the Ukrainian-born oligarch violated 2018 sanctions placed on him by the US. He was again sanctioned last month after Russia's invasion. The 78-meter (255ft) luxury vessel named Tango and valued at $90m (Â£70m) was held in a raid by Spanish  police on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, following a US request. The action was the first from the newly-created US Justice Department initiative dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, which was created to punish Russian oligarchs for violating US sanctions. Officials allege Vekselberg continued to make payments through US banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango. ""Today marks our task forceâs first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,â said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Civilians who fled Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to safer regions should wait several more days before returning, the city's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said, according to Reuters. ""Firstly, there is currently a round-the-clock curfew in the Kyiv region,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Secondly, in certain towns near Kyiv, it's likely that Russian occupiers left landmines, and there are [likely] a lot of unexploded munitions."" Earlier, we reported that Klitschko brandedthe killings near the Ukrainian capital as horror scenes. Authorities in the Brovary, Bucha and Vyshhorod districts of the wider Kyiv region have also said that a curfew will remain in place until April 7, Ukrainian media report. They said that Ukrainian forces would spend the coming days clearing the area of ""explosive 'surprises' left behind by the invaders"". The Ukrainian intelligence service has published what itâ claims is a list of Russian personnel ""who committed war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha"". The list, published on the website of the Ministry of Defense, included the names, dates of birth, passport numbers and ranks of about 2,000 servicemen. A message read: ""Remember! All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine."" It comes after senior government sources told the BBC that the UK government is considering action to target captains, majors, and colonels in the Russian military. The measures could include sanctions as well as ways to hold individuals legally accountable forâ any crimes committed in Ukraine. Russiaâs ambassador to UN has insisted no civilians were harmed during the month-long Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha - and accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence. As we've been reporting,the bodies of dozens of civilians as well as a mass gravehave been found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. But, speaking at a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzia said it was ""staged provocation"" by Western countries. He also accused the UK of ""unprecedented abuse"" in its role this month as president of the UN Security Council, said it was refusing to allow Russia to bring the Bucha incidents up. The BBC has verified footage in Buchain recent days and found the bodies in the streets would have been there for a number of days, and while the town was under Russian control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye visited the basement of a home in Bucha where the bodies of five men wearing civilian clothes were left. They had their hands bound behind their backs and appeared to have been shot. She also saw a shallow grave in the village of Motyzhyn - west of Kyiv - that contained the bodies of four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent A weekend of appalling images and harrowing stories has triggered a fresh wave of international outrage, and, inevitably, talk of more sanctions. No concrete announcements yet, butJoe Biden said those were coming and that heâd been right, in mid-March, to condemn Vladimir Putin in the harshest terms. War crimes trials may have to wait, but leaders agree new sanctions are needed. Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for more measures to target Russian oil and coal. Germanyâs chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Mr Putin and his supporters would, in his words, âfeel the consequencesâ of what happened in Bucha. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany was working towards an embargo on Russian energy, but that it couldnât happen immediately. The small Baltic republic of Lithuania is leading the way. After years of reducing its heavy reliance on Russian gas, its government announced, on Sunday, that imports had finally been reduced to zero. ""If we can do it,"" the countryâs president said, ""the rest of Europe can too"". The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said tough new sanctions will be announced at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers later this week. After meeting her Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, she said these would include banning Russian ships from western ports, cracking down further on Russian banks and going after new industries which she said were filling Mr Putinâs war chest, including gold. Since the withdrawal of Russian troops from Bucha, horrific images of bodies lying in the streets and accounts of killings have emerged. The reports have sparked widespread condemnation and the United Nations has called for an independent investigation into what happened in the town. Ukraine accused Russia of a ""deliberate massacre"" but Russia called it ""a staged provocation by the Kyiv regime"". It made a series of unfounded claims about the footage from Bucha, including that people shown are not actually dead and that no civilians in Bucha were harmed. The BBC has fact checked the claims. Read thefull report here.  The US State Department says the US is supporting a multi-national team of international prosecutors going to the region to collect, preserve and analyse evidence, at the request of Ukrainian officials. The aim is to pursue criminal accountability against Russia, a spokesperson for the State Department said. ""Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable as must those who ordered them. ""They cannot and will not act with impunity."" They said the US is tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.  France is the latest country to decide to expel Russian diplomatic staff, after its foreign ministry announced it was expelling many Russian diplomats. ""Their actions go against our national security interests,"" the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""This move is part of a European initiative."" The French news agency AFP quoted a source close to the Foreign Ministry as saying 35 people would be expelled. It follows a similar decision taken by Germanywhich expelled 40 Russian envoysover the killings of civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. HARDtalkBBC News programme This video can not be played Ukraine war: Bucha massacre is a game changer - Ukraine foreign minister The killings in Bucha should be a ""game changer"" for the support the West is willing to provide Ukraine, the country's foreign minister has said. Speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Dmytro Kuleba said: ""The Bucha massacre should
remove any kind of hesitation and reluctance in the West to provide Ukraine
with all necessary weapons... to defend our country and to free it from the
Russian occupants."" He said additional support should include planes, tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and armoured vehicles as well as a strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Kuleba added that the outcome of the war would be decided not only on the battleground, but in the ""offices in Europe and
North America"" where decisions about the level of additional support will be taken. ""I'm ready to exchange every word of sympathy
and admiration for a tank or a plane that will help me, or or an embargo on gas
and oil that will help me to save human lives in Ukraine,"" he said. A mass grave has been found outside a church in Bucha More now from the joint press conference this afternoon between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. In addition to calling for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" from the UK and its allies to stop Putin's war efforts, Truss backed Kuleba's call for Russia to be expelled from the European Human Rights Council after ""appalling crimes"" including the killing of civilians in Bucha. Kuleba said any G7 and EU nations countries that ""still have doubts"" and are continuing to trade with Russia - by buying fossil fuels, for example - should make their minds up by visiting any of the mass graves in Ukraine. The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. Tom BatemanReporting from Zaporizhzhia Weâve arrived at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia at the same time as a long convoy of cars. Theyâve driven here across Russian lines from the south. Many have white cloth or scarves tied to the wing-mirrors to stop them being targeted.

"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon fired at Sri Lanka protesters Sri Lankan police imposed curfew and fired tear gas at demonstrators protesting dire food, fuel and power shortages outside the president's house. Agitated protesters stormed through barricades, and were accused of setting fire to a bus on Thursday night. President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa blamed the events on ""extremist elements"". Sri Lanka is in the midst of a foreign exchange crisis that has crippled its economy. Faced with 13-hour power cuts, a lack of fuel, essential food items and medicines, public anger has reached a new high. The protest outside the President's house began peacefully, but participants say things turned violent after police fired tear gas, water cannons and also beat people present. Protesters retaliated against the police by pelting them with stones. On Friday morning, police arrested 45 people although no charges have been made against them yet. The demonstrations mark a massive turnaround in popularity for Mr Rajapaksa who swept into power with a majority win in 2019, promising stability and a ""strong hand"" to rule the country. Who is Sri Lanka's controversial new president? Critics have been pointing to rank corruption and nepotism - his brothers and nephews occupy several key ministerial portfolios - as one of the main reasons for the situation the country has found itself in. Protesters chanted slogans and burned signs on the roads at Thursday's demonstration News reports that the president and his ministers are exempt from the power cuts, along with opulent displays of wealth by family members, have only increased anger. The government has been blaming the crisis on the pandemic's impact on tourism - one of the island nation's main sources of foreign revenue - along with a series of attacks on churches on Easter Sunday 2019 which led to a marked drop in tourists. But experts say that this crisis has been a long time in the making. ""This is an implosion, an accumulated outcome of what has been building up for a couple of decades and as usual there is no one to take responsibility for it. Of course, the present government is directly responsible for its wilful mismanagement of the crisis since they came into power in 2019 by sheer incompetency, arrogance and of course corruption,"" Jayadeva Uyangoda, a political scientist and commentator, told the BBC. Sri Lanka's former deputy central bank governor WA Wijewardena told the BBC that Sri Lanka made a fundamental mistake in not integrating with the global economy after the end of a civil war in 2009 which saw its economy grow at rates of almost 9%. ""Exports which accounted for 33% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2000 have now fallen to 12% and remain at that level,"" he said. How soaring cost of living is hitting Sri Lanka hard Sri Lanka tests UN's patience on human rights In the more immediate term, a government refusal to let the Sri Lankan rupee depreciate also took a massive toll on its foreign reserves. Accordingly, foreign reserves which stood at $7.6bn (Â£5.8bn) at the end of 2019 have now fallen to a level of $2.3 bn; of those reserves, usable reserves have fallen to some $300mn. Mr Wijewardena feels things will get a lot worse before they get better, as there is no sustainable flow of foreign exchange for the heavily import-reliant country. Sri Lanka no longer has enough dollars to buy essential items like fuel to power vehicles or even generate power. As a result, the country's electricity board has been imposing power cuts that have grown longer and longer in duration. On Thursday, power was switched off for 13 hours, with 16-hour cuts expected in the coming days. Protesters hurled rocks at police after they shot tear gas into the crowd This has disrupted businesses, education and day to day life for millions. Long lines have been reported outside fuel stations, while people have also had to queue up for hours in the heat to buy items like cooking gas cylinders with sometimes tragic results. Five elderly people have died after collapsing in queues over the last few weeks. Shortages in food items and essential medicines are also being reported from across the country.

"Lord Patel was appointed Yorkshire chair in November after Roger Hutton resigned Yorkshire chair Lord Patel hailed an ""overwhelming vote for positive change"" after structural reforms at the club were approved. Thursday's changes mean Yorkshire can host international matches again, havingmet criteriaset out by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The ECB suspended the club's right to stage England games over its handling of theAzeem Rafiq racism scandal. ""We thank the members for their full and proper consideration,"" said Patel. ""This support will help Yorkshire County Cricket Club to be an inclusive and welcoming place and gives us the clarity and certainty we need to keep building this great club."" Former spinner Rafiq said on social media: ""Relieved to see Lord Patel's reforms backed today and that Yorkshire members chose a bright, inclusive future for my club. ""Big opportunity to show the world what can be achieved when you have strong leadership and good people."" Patel, who wasappointed in November,said in January that Yorkshirefaced a ""huge financial crisis""if the ban was not lifted and that regaining its international status was key to the planned reforms. Yorkshire's right to host England matches was reinstated subject to key requirements being met by the end of March. The club held an extraordinary general meeting at Headingley on the day of the deadline and members overwhelmingly passed three special resolutions. Former chairman Robin Smith had said thatPatel's appointment was ""invalid"", but one of the three resolutions saw Patel confirmed as chair. Members also voted in favour of changes to the composition of the board and the removal of legal liability from decisions made by board members since November. An ECB spokesperson said the vote ""is an important step forward in bringing about real change and setting the club on course for a more inclusive future"". They added: ""However, there is much work still to be done at Yorkshire and it is important that the plans set out so far are now delivered. We will continue to monitor progress closely. ""Our regulatory investigation into the complaints brought by Azeem Rafiq, which is separate to this process, remains ongoing and we will update on this in due course."" Headingley is now set to host England's Test against New Zealand from 23 June and the final match of their one-day international against South Africa on 24 July. It was announced on Friday that Surrey's African Caribbean Engagement Programme (ACE) will be extended across the country, including in Leeds. It will also be expanded to Nottingham, Manchester and additional London boroughs. ACE was established by former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent at Surrey in 2020 to provide opportunities to cricketers from black communities.

"Canada's top court has imposed a C$9.1m ($7.3m; Â£5.5m) fine on a man behind one of the country's stickiest crimes - the theft of 3,000 tonnes of maple syrup. The so-called Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist saw the loss of nearly C$18m worth of syrup from the country's reserves by a group of thieves. The court ordered Richard ValliÃ¨res, a ""major player"" in the scheme, to pay a penalty or face six years in prison. ValliÃ¨res was found guilty in 2016 of fraud, trafficking and theft. He is currently serving an eight year prison sentence. At trial, ValliÃ¨res said he sold the syrup for C$10m and made a personal profit of around C$1m. In a unanimous decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled that ValliÃ¨res should pay a penalty equal to the value of the stolen goods within a decade. The ruling overturns a decision by the Quebec Court of Appeal to reduce his fine to just C$1m - equivalent to what ValliÃ¨res says he pocketed. The Quebec Maple Syrup Producers - the so-called Opec of maple syrup - holds an emergency reserve of the product to help meet global supply in years of poor harvests. The Canadian province produces almost three-quarters of the world's maple syrup. Between 2011 and 2012, ValliÃ¨res and the group of thieves targeted a central Quebec warehouse where the product is stockpiled, often replacing the syrup in the barrels with water. The thieves went on to distribute the stolen syrup throughout Canada and the US. The theft was discovered in 2012 during a routine survey when an inspector climbed on a stack of maple syrup barrels - which typically weigh some 270kg (595 lbs)- and one nearly tipped over. It was empty.

"Andy Pollard, pictured with his wife, spent years spraying pesticides on his land Some British farmers are calling for a ban on the UK production of toxic weedkiller Paraquat, saying studies suggest it could be a factor in the onset of Parkinson's Disease. It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them. Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements. He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment. ""Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,"" his wife Sue says. ""Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere."" She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical. ""Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?"" she asks. ""We've got a lot of people in the same situation."" Millions of farmers have used Paraquat to kill weeds on their land Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale. It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths. Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies. Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's. The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. ""The farmers come here not because they're ill,"" Julie explains, ""but because they want to get on with living."" John Stockley would hand-spray the chemical in his fields Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease. Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. ""He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used."" He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. ""He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down."" John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years. Parkinson's has caused Ken Barnes to lose his clarity of speech Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. ""It's a horrible disease,"" says his wife Sue. ""It's taken his life away."" She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. ""I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father."" Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world. In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities. Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year. The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further. Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action. He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. ""If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,"" he says. ""The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?"" There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's. In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was ""a well-recognised environmental risk factor"" but Parkinson's UK said studies show ""a small increased risk"" at most. In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users. But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found. Prof Jon Heylings with a strategy document written while Paraquat was still in use by UK farmers But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health. Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies ""citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat"". He explains: ""Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's."" It said: ""In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company.
