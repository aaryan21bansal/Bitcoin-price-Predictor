"Another victim of the 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York City has been identified, according to the city medical examiner. The male victim is the 1,641st person to be identified out of a total of 2,753 people who died in the attack. His identity - which was determined using new DNA technology - is being withheld at the request of his family. Before Monday's announcement, it had been over two years since the last identification took place. The last time a victim was identified was March 2015. Victims remains returned to Ground Zero 9/11 memories from the wreckage The man's identity was determined by New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, which had been retesting DNA recovered in 2001.

"The Natrix helvetica was originally thought to be a subspecies of the grass snake A new type of snake has been identified in the UK after genetic testing re-classified its native grass snakes. Scientists say the common or eastern grass snake,Natrix natrix,is actually called the barred grass snake,Natrix helvetica. Grass snakes are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act making it illegal to injure or kill them. The other two snakes native to the UK are the smooth snake and the adder, which is venomous. The barred grass snake is normally found in lowland regions in the south of England. The snakes can be more than a metre (3ft) long, are found near water and eat mainly amphibians like frogs and newts. The newly distinguished snake is grey, not olive green like the N. natrix and does not have the same bright yellow collar. The snake is also found in Switzerland, Italy and France and also has been seen in western Germany. The species has been distinguished from the common or eastern grass snake Along its entire length theN. helveticahas black stripes, which on the common grass snake are barely noticeable. The Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany led the study into the genetics of more than 1,600 grass snakes. Professor Uwe Fritz said: ""We discovered that the barred grass snake, previously considered a subspecies, is in fact a distinct species. ""We now have to pay close attention to which species of grass snake is involved in each case, in order to be able to assess whether one of them may be more threatened than previously thought."" Correction 31 August 2017: This story has been updated to clarify that following genetic testing the total number of snake species in the UK remains at three, but the former 'grass snake' has a new name.

It is a struggle many former smokers experience. Have a few drinks and, before you know it, you're puffing away again. Now it seems ex-Prime Minister David Cameron - who has previously spoken of his battle to give up nicotine - is also no stranger to this predicament. In a snap from the weekend's Wilderness Festival in Oxfordshire, Mr Cameron was photographed by art consultant Lucy Edwards holding a drink and a cigarette. Back in 2011, Mr Cameron described himself as a ""former smoker"" at Prime Minister's Questions when responding to a question about a ban in cars when children were present. Four years later, he spoke in the Commons about his ""relatively successful"" battle to give up smoking. He was responding to a question about e-cigarettes and whether he could highlight the role they play in helping people give up smoking. This video can not be played Ex-smoker David Cameron said the ban on lighting up in workplaces has been a success Mr Cameron said: ""Certainly as somebody who has been through this battle a number of times, eventually relatively successfully, lots of people find different ways of doing it and certainly for some people e-cigarettes are successful."" Two years on and now out of the public eye, it seems Mr Cameron has turned to tobacco once again. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of charity ASH (action on smoking and health), said: ""Quitting smoking can be difficult but getting the right support throughout the process makes quit attempts much more likely to succeed. ""It's vital that smoking cessation services are properly funded and available to all who need them, whether plumber or former prime minister."" But Mr Cameron is far from being the only politician who has talked about smoking or their struggle to give up. Barack Obama said in 2013 that he hadn't had a cigarette in six years In 2010, then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg confessed to being a secret smoker. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the Liberal Democrat leader said his luxury item, if stranded alone on an island, would be a ""stash of cigarettes"". And former US President Barack Obama started smoking as a teenager but promised his wife he would give up if she would allow him to run for president. ""Look, I've said before that as a former smoker I constantly struggle with it,"" Mr Obama told reporters in 2009. ""Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No. I don't do it in front of my kids. I don't do it in front of my family. And, you know, I would say that I am 95% cured."" Mr Obama has acknowledged using nicotine gum. And in 2013, he wasquoted as saying,externalhe hadn't had a cigarette in six years. ""That's because I'm scared of my wife,"" he added. Maybe he could give Mr Cameron some tips.

"This video can not be played Sam Kanizay, 16, was left covered in blood by the flesh-eating bugs in Melbourne An Australian teenager is recovering in hospital after being bitten by multiple ""mite-sized sea critters"". Sam Kanizay, 16, found his feet and ankles covered in blood after soaking his legs in Melbourne's Brighton Beach on Saturday evening. Jarrod Kanizay said his son arrived home with what ""looked like a war injury"" and that his legs would not stop bleeding. The family are seeking expert opinion to identify the flesh-eating bugs. Marine biologists have said they were likely to have been sea fleas, tiny scavenging marine animals. WARNING: This article contains a close up image of the injury. After a tiring football game on Saturday evening, the 16-year-old decided to soak his legs in the cold bay near his home. Speaking to the BBC's World Update radio show, Sam described feeling pins and needles in his legs after standing waist-deep in dark cold water for about half an hour. After shaking off what he thought was sand coated around his ankles, he walked across the beach before looking down and realising that his feet were ""covered in blood"". ""It bled for ages, and it's still seeping blood now,"" he said. Sam Kanizay was seen immediately at hospital ""It looked like a war injury... like a grenade attack. It was really bloody,"" his father told BBC News. ""We got him in the shower but as soon as we did that the blood kept re-appearing,"" said Mr Kanizay. ""It wasn't clotting at all. It just kept bleeding and bleeding."" After two local hospitals could not identify the cause of the multiple pin-prick injuries, the Melbourne father decided to investigate and went back to the beach. ""Sam is very positive,"" said his father. ""I collected these strange creatures from the same spot last night by trapping them in a net and standing in the water myself,"" he said. ""We got thousands of these little mite-type bugs and they've been sent on to experts."" Mr Kanizay said he hoped the sandy-coloured mites would not scar his son, and he is expected to make a full recovery. ""We are just waiting on the experts to tell us what they are and how they behave and why this happened."" Marine biologist Dr Genefor Walker-Smith, who saw some of the samples,told Australia's Herald Sun newspaper,externalthat the bugs were probably lysianassid amphipods, or sea fleas. ""It's possible he disturbed a feeding group but they are generally not out there waiting to attack like piranhas,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Chloe Ayling: ""I've been through a terrifying experience"" A British model who was allegedly kidnapped and held captive in Milan has been telling UK police about her ""horrific ordeal"", her agent has said. Chloe Ayling, 20, travelled to the city for a photo shoot on 11 July. She was kidnapped by a group calling itself Black Death and was released five days later, Phil Green, from Supermodel Agency, said in a statement. Ms Ayling wasn't allowed to return to the UK until she had attended a pre-trial hearing, the statement added. The model's passport was detained by police until she gave evidence on Friday, and she was also asked to visit the crime scene before flying back to the UK on Sunday, her agent said. Since her return, she has been ""debriefing"" the Metropolitan Police and the Foreign Office and ""has requested to spend the rest of the day in privacy with her mother"", said Mr Green. Italian police said she was attacked by two men and drugged and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. The officers said they had arrested Polish national Lukasz Herba, who lives in Oldbury in the West Midlands, on kidnapping charges. Italian police released an image of suspect Lukasz Herba It is alleged the kidnappers attempted to sell the model online for Â£230,000 ($300,000) and demanded her agent paid a ransom fee. Italian police said the modelwas drugged with ketamine before being locked in a bagand transported in a car to a house in Borgial, north-west of Turin. She was handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in a bedroom for six days until she was released and taken to the British consulate in Milan, they said. Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"". She added: ""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release."" Investigations into the case are being carried out by authorities in Italy, Poland and the UK. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said it had been working with the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and the Italian authorities. A spokesman said: ""A house in the Oldbury area linked to Lukasz Pawel Herba was searched on 18 July by EMSOU officers with assistance from West Midlands Police. ""Computer equipment seized is being forensically examined."" The Metropolitan Police said officers were made aware on 12 July of ""concerns over the welfare of a woman overseas"". ""The case was subsequently referred to specialist officers within the Met who worked in conjunction with the family and specialist officers from the East Midlands area.""

"A very small number of eggs contaminated with a toxic insecticide reached the UK earlier this year. Some of the eggs, which originated from the Netherlands, were also found in France, the country's agricultural ministry said. The UK's Food Standards Agency say the risk to the public is very low. The agency is ""urgently investigating"" the issue, but to the best of their knowledge, the affected products are no longer on shelves. It says there is no need for people in Britain to avoid eating eggs and any potential exposure is unlikely to harm. The revelations come after the supermarket chain Aldiwithdrew all eggs from sale in its stores in Germanylast week. Tests had shown the chemical fipronil, which can harm kidneys, liver and thyroid glands, was found in the eggs. It is feared that farmers in the Netherlands may now need to cull millions of birds as it seeks to eradicate traces of the insecticide from production, according to LTO, a Dutch farming organisation. On its website,the FSA said:,external""Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. ""Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs."" Belgian officials have already admitted that they knew in June that eggs from Dutch farms might be contaminated with the fipronil insecticide Fipronil can treat lice and ticks in chickens, but should not be used on food-producing animals because of its toxicity. Shops in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, have removed the eggs from sale as a precaution. About 180 poultry farms in the Netherlands have also been temporarily shut in recent days while investigations are held. The FSA says approximately 21,000 eggs were distributed to the UK from implicated farms in the Netherlands between March and June of this year. But it says this is a very small proportion of the 1.8 billion eggs the UK imports each year. Around 85% of eggs consumed in Britain are home-produced.

"Stephanie Davis and Jeremy McConnell began a relationship after appearing on Celebrity Big Brother Reality TV star Jeremy McConnell has been found guilty of assaulting his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Davis. McConnell, 27, attacked Miss Davis at her home in Rainhill, Merseyside while she was holding their baby son, Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard. Former Hollyoaks star Miss Davis told the trial she thought that ""psychotic"" McConnell was ""going to kill"" her after taking cocaine. The pair began a relationship after appearing onCelebrity Big Brother. They rowed during the hearing and at one point Judge Wendy Lloyd ordered a break in proceedings when McConnell began laughing in the dock after Miss Davis broke down in tears. The actress said: ""He's completely destroyed my life, it's been the worst 18 months."" The court heard the attack happened on 10 March after the couple went out for a meal with friends in Liverpool the night before to celebrate her birthday. Miss Davis said McConnell went on to a local pub with two of the friends. When he returned he was ""out of it"" and had been taking cocaine, the court heard. Jeremy McConnell leaving the Celebrity Big Brother House ""He said that I was fat, he said that no one was going to want to touch me again,"" she told the court. She added that McConnell had grabbed her by the face while holding her son Caben-Albi. He then took her phone as she tried to call for help before pushing her and biting the inside of her arm. Miss Davis said McConnell left but later returned and began kicking the doors in an attempt to get in. She said: ""I heard him go over the gate, it was literally like a horror film. ""I just thought, 'this is it, he's going to kill me'."" She said she let him in after fearing he would smash the glass patio doors and he followed her upstairs and threw her on to the bed. Miss Davis said he punched her to the side of the head and pushed her against the wall after accusing her of having affairs. Miss Davis said McConnell was ""psychotic"". He then left the house again but returned, this time snapping handles off the patio doors to get in. The actress denied making a complaint to police, three days after the attack, in a bid to prevent McConnell appearing on TV show Ex On The Beach. When asked about why she had retracted her statement in May, Miss Davis said: ""That was Jeremy getting me to retract my statement, he also threatened to throw acid in my face."" She said the couple used to argue about his drug use, claiming he spent Â£180,000 on cocaine last year. McConnell told the court Miss Davis attacked him after learning he had taken cocaine. He said he pushed her away in self-defence and claimed injuries shown in photos were ""self-inflicted"". James Morris, defending, said: ""She is aggrieved that he actually ended their relationship some six weeks ago."" McConnell, of Swords, Dublin, pleaded guilty to criminal damage of Miss Davis's property at an earlier hearing. He is due to be sentenced on Friday.

"Sir James said the approved care plan was ""not a matter for congratulation"" A judge who said society should be ""ashamed"" for not protecting a suicidal girl has approved a care plan for her. The girl, known as X, will be moved to a special unit on Thursday after doctors managed to find her a place. Sir James Munby, head of the family courts in England and Wales, said the provision of care ""should not be dependent"" on legal involvement. The secure unit where the 17-year-old has been living has spent Â£125,000 on extra staff to care for her. The unit - which has not been named - said the Youth Justice Board ""failed"" to provide additional resources to maintain X's safety despite repeated requests. The details were revealed in the latest judgement in her case. Three social care staff were said to be off work suffering from ""stress and anxiety"" due to the ""unusual experiences"" they had observed with the girl. Sir James, who previously criticised the lack of supervision available for the girl, said the latest development was ""not a matter for congratulation"". He spoke out last Thursday to saythere would be ""blood on our hands""if the teenager did not receive adequate supervision upon her release from secure custody. He made his comments after finding out a secure unit place had not been found for the girl, who had made several suicide attempts. In Sir James' judgement, he said: ""I feel shame and embarrassment; shame, as a human being, as a citizen and as an agent of the State... that I can do no more for X."" The judgement in the case of X - who is in the formal care of Cumbria County Council - revealed she was convicted at a youth court and has been detained in custody for almost six months. Girl X's care reflects 'wholly unacceptable' situation in England, MP says An earlier ruling heard how unit staff had witnessed ""a profoundly disturbing and distressing scene when X self-harmed by repeatedly banging her head and face against the wall"". Staff said she must be checked every 50 seconds when she is in the shower. The unit has said 13 young people who were also being detained at the centre complained the quality of the care they were receiving was ""in breach of their statutory rights"" because staff had to attend to X and had less time to organise activities for them. Following the latest ruling, the judge said X should not be ""privileged"" because her case came before a senior judge. He added: ""I emphasise this because a mass of informed, if anecdotal, opinion indicates that X's is not an isolated case and that there are far too many young women in similar predicaments.

"Eloise Dixon and her family had reportedly ended up in a favela because of a miscommunication A British woman who was shot after she reportedly travelled to a Brazilian favela by mistake is ""lucky"" to be alive, according to a local hospital. Eloise Dixon, her partner and their three children were driving in Angra dos Reis on Sunday, when their car was approached by an armed group, Brazilian newspaperO Globo,externalreported. She was shot twice, once in the abdomen, but is recovering in hospital. Ms Dixon's family were unhurt, the paper added. O Globo said the family had apparently been searching for water to buy in Angra dos Reis - a coastal resort about 90 miles (145 km) from Rio de Janeiro. According to theO Dia,externalnewspaper, they ended up in the Agua Santa - or holy water - community because of a difficulty in understanding the language. The slum area is known to have drug traffickers. Images shown on Brazilian television show the family's car with a flattened tyre Images of the family's car shows damage to the front seat after the shooting Authorities told O Globo the family were shot at after they were told to leave their car by armed men but did not understand the request. One bullet was aimed at the head of Ms Dixon, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, but missed, while two others hit her in the abdomen. Neither of them hit any vital organs. The director of the hospital where she was treated, Rodrigo Mucheli, told Brazilian media: ""The projectile passed through the abdomen and fortunately did not hit the big vessels. She was really lucky."" Ms Dixon, from south-east London, is now reportedly in a stable condition after she underwent two hours of surgery. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are assisting the family of a British woman who has been hospitalised in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. ""Our staff remain in contact with the local authorities."" By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent Angra dos Reis, the place that Eloise Dixon was shot, is a jumping-off point for some of Brazil's most famous tourist destinations. It's where tourists catch ferries to head to the beaches of Ilha Grande and not far away is the popular colonial town of Paraty. But while most tourists would feel safe in those parts, this shooting just shows how easy it is to get caught up in troubles. Agua Santa is a favela, or slum. A poor neighbourhood that would have probably started informally but then integrated into the main city. They are often controlled by drugs gangs so tourists are not advised to go in without  a local resident or guide. This shooting of Eloise Dixon isn't the first. There have been similar incidents in the city of Rio, with tourists following instructions from mobile apps and straying into favela territory with fatal consequences.

"A very small number of eggs contaminated with a toxic insecticide reached the UK earlier this year. Some of the eggs, which originated from the Netherlands, were also found in France, the country's agricultural ministry said. The UK's Food Standards Agency say the risk to the public is very low. The agency is ""urgently investigating"" the issue, but to the best of their knowledge, the affected products are no longer on shelves. It says there is no need for people in Britain to avoid eating eggs and any potential exposure is unlikely to harm. The revelations come after the supermarket chain Aldiwithdrew all eggs from sale in its stores in Germanylast week. Tests had shown the chemical fipronil, which can harm kidneys, liver and thyroid glands, was found in the eggs. It is feared that farmers in the Netherlands may now need to cull millions of birds as it seeks to eradicate traces of the insecticide from production, according to LTO, a Dutch farming organisation. On its website,the FSA said:,external""Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. ""Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs."" Belgian officials have already admitted that they knew in June that eggs from Dutch farms might be contaminated with the fipronil insecticide Fipronil can treat lice and ticks in chickens, but should not be used on food-producing animals because of its toxicity. Shops in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, have removed the eggs from sale as a precaution. About 180 poultry farms in the Netherlands have also been temporarily shut in recent days while investigations are held. The FSA says approximately 21,000 eggs were distributed to the UK from implicated farms in the Netherlands between March and June of this year. But it says this is a very small proportion of the 1.8 billion eggs the UK imports each year. Around 85% of eggs consumed in Britain are home-produced.

"Hooded youths were photographed throwing objects at police vehicles Petrol bombs, stones and other missiles have been used to attack police vehicles and parked cars during hours of disorder in Belfast's Markets. Two cars were destroyed after they were set on fire and other vehicles were damaged by stones and paint. The trouble followed the removal of material gathered by republican youths for an anti-internment bonfire. Officers in riot gear have since been deployed to the area and number of police Land Rovers remain at the scene. Police in riot gear have been deployed to the scene Police responding to reports of stone throwing came under attack themselves Bonfires are traditionally lit in some republican areas to mark the anniversary of the introduction of interment - detention without trial - on 9 August 1971. Supt Andrea McMullan said: ""Police are dealing with some localised disorder in the Friendly Street area of the Markets, which has been caused by a small group of youths. ""We are working with local representatives and members of the community to address the situation. ""There has been some stone throwing, damage to parked cars and a number of petrol bombs have also been thrown."" One man, who told the BBC he had been parking in the area for about a year, said he found his car burned out when he finished work. One of the two cars destroyed in the attacks on Monday afternoon Sinn FÃ©in councillor Deirdre Hargey condemned the attacks as 'nothing short of mindless vandalism' He said police could not tell him what happened, only that they had found the car burned out. The man, who did not want to be identified, said he felt ""frustrated"" and would now have to buy a new car. Local Sinn FÃ©in councillor Deirdre Hargey condemned the attacks as ""nothing short of mindless vandalism"". ""Both commuters and residents have been affected,"" she said. ""Cars have been smashed with stones and several have been set alight."" ""Over the weekend there were a series of incidents of vandalism in the Market area. ""There is no defending this behaviour at all and it needs to stop now."" Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough Brown also condemned the attacks. Allow Twitter content?

It was understood to have been posted on a wall telling staff to only speak English for health and safety reasons. A statement issued by the company said it had sent the guidance on its language policy to all UK stores. Welsh Language Commissioner Meri Huws isinvestigating any breaches in rules. The notice, which was printed on Sports Direct-headed paper, was criticised by Plaid Cymru AM Sian Gwenllian who said it was ""discriminatory"" in an area where a lot of people speak Welsh.

"A wildfire raged in Sicily's Messina district last month Italian police have questioned 15 volunteer firefighters in southern Sicily accused of starting fires in order to get paid to put them out. In the alleged fraud, the volunteers rang the emergency 115 number themselves or got friends or relatives to do it. Their commander allegedly skipped shifts in order to start fires. The team, in the Ragusa district, were each paid about 10 euros (Â£9) an hour. They came under suspicion because they were called out more often than others. The fires date back to 2013-2015, and police decided to impose house arrest only on the commander - not the others - because the criminality was not recent. He was named as Davide De Vita. Italian media report that most of the 15 volunteers have admitted committing fraud against the state. Ragusa is in south-eastern Sicily, about 105km (65 miles) from Catania. An Italian police photo showed the main suspect, Davide De Vita (flanked by officers), under arrest Davide De Vita, 42, is suspected of having started fires Police said analysis of the 115 calls had shown up mistakes by some of those involved in the fraud. Sometimes the same phone was used repeatedly but different names were given, police said. In some cases, call-outs were reported for non-existent fires. To explain why water had not been used in such cases, the volunteers claimed that animals had been roaming in the area, and had to be left alone. Italians are currently sweltering in a heatwave that has pushed temperatures above 40C (104F) and dried out the vegetation, making wildfires common.

The Labour leader called for a dialogue in the country, where more than 120 people have died during months of anti-government protests. He has been under pressure to condemn President Nicolas Maduro, after voicing support for him in the past. Mr Maduro has been accused of behaving like the ""dictator of an evil regime"" by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. In the latest developments, Mr Maduro said asearch was under way in Venezuela for 10 menwho escaped with weapons after an attack on a military base.

He also shared a platform with Mr Maduro in 2006. Speaking in Crawley, West Sussex, where he was attending a meeting of Labour Party members, Mr Corbyn said: ""I'm very sad at the lives that have been lost in Venezuela. The people who have died, either those on the streets or security forces that have been attacked by people on the street - all of those lives are terrible for the loss of them. ""There has to be a dialogue and a process that respects the independence of the judiciary and respects the human rights of all."" This video can not be played The week's most powerful photos from Venezuela Asked whether he condemned Mr Maduro's actions, Mr Corbyn said: ""What I condemn is the violence that's been done by any side, by all sides, in all this. ""Violence is not going to solve the issue. The issues in Venezuela are partly structural because not enough has been done to diversify the economy away from oil - that has to be a priority for the future."" He added that ""effective and serious attempts at reducing poverty in Venezuela"" should be recognised. Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Juan AndrÃ©s MejÃ­a, founding member and national director of one of the main Venezuelan opposition parties, Popular Will, said: ""What I would say to to Jeremy Corbyn is that he really has to know what's going on in our country to be able to make a statement. ""Violence has not been done by both sides. Violence has been promoted by the government."" Labour MP John Spellar, a member of a new Parliamentary group on Venezuela who has been a critic of Mr Corbyn, said: ""We should be clearly on the side of Venezuelan freedom and should be calling for respect for the clear mandate of the freely elected national assembly and the freeing of all political prisoners.

Rival parties criticised Mr Corbyn's response to questions about the country. Conservative MP Henry Smith attacked his ""failure to condemn Venezuela's strangulation of democracy and descent into chaotic poverty"" while Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: ""The leadership of the Labour Party must make it abundantly clear that they have ended their infatuation with the Venezuelan regime.""

"Usain Bolt is widely acknowledged as the greatest sprinter of all time. As the Jamaican prepares to retire after theWorld Championships in London,here are 9.58 reasons why he deserves to be called a legend, and how he achieved it. He is the fastest runner in history.Bolt has set the past three world records at 100m, and it is nine years since he first broke it. Bolt beat compatriot Asafa Powell's record of 9.74 seconds by clocking 9.72 in May 2008, then lowered it to 9.69 at the Beijing Olympics later that year. At the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, he shaved more than a tenth of a second off his record, clocking 9.58 seconds. Back in 1912, American Donald Lippincott ran 10.6 seconds in Stockholm to set the first time recognised by the sport's newly founded governing body, the IAAF. Jim Hines, in 1968, was the first man to officially dip under 10 seconds, but it took almost a century for Lippincott's time to be bettered by a whole second - courtesy of Bolt. He has run faster, more often.The IAAF's pre-London list of all 100m runs under 10 seconds shows just a handful of rivals come close to Bolt's times. Since Hines, another 124 men have beaten the 10-second mark. But no-one except Bolt, fellow Jamaicans Yohan Blake and Asafa Powell, and Americans Justin Gatlin and Tyson Gay (highlighted on the chart) have run under 9.78 seconds. Bolt himself has managed that an astounding nine times in total - more than anyone else. And of course, it's not all just about the 100m.Bolt excels in the 200m and is the only man to hold world records in both distances since the IAAF began utilising automatic timekeeping in 1977. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Bolt broke US sprinter Michael Johnson's 12-year-old 200m record of 19.32 seconds with a run of 19.30, before lowering it to 19.19 a year later in Berlin. He is incredibly consistent.London 2017 aside, Bolt has won virtually every Olympic and World Championship race he has entered from 2008 onwards. Rio 2016 saw him complete an unprecedented ""triple triple"" of consecutive Olympic gold medals in 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay - making him ""immortal"", in his own words. Bolt has since lost the 2008 relay medal after team-mate Nesta Carter failed a retrospective drugs test - affecting the whole relay team. Carter has lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Bolt's World Championships career is blotted only by a bronze medal in London in 2017, and a false start in the 100m in Daegu, South Korea, in 2011 which meant an automatic disqualification. From 2008 onwards, he has only ever been beaten once in the 200m - by compatriot Blake at the Jamaican National Championships in 2012. Blake also won the 100m at the same meet, one of only five times Bolt has failed to win at that distance in a major event. Gatlin, Christian Coleman, Powell and Gay are the other athletes to have beaten Bolt in the 100m. He's even faster than you think.Bolt ran the fastest 10m of his 100m world record in a mere 0.81 seconds. That equates to 27.66 mph (44.51 km/h) - about the same speed as a galloping horse. But the Jamaican has covered 100m quicker than 9.58 seconds when given a rolling start. He ran the second half of his 19.19 200m in in 9.26 seconds, and has clocked well under nine seconds several times in the 4x100m relay, with the fastest a blistering 8.65 in 2015. That said, age and injury have taken their inevitable toll on Bolt, who is now almost 31. His season's bests have slowed and he has raced less often. In 2016 he ran 9.81 for 100m and 19.78 for 200m - slow by his standards, but winning times nonetheless. How does he do it?There is no simple answer but a study by Mackala Krzysztof and Antti Mero, published in the Journal of Human Kinetics, found his 6ft 5in (195cm) frame is one factor that gives him an advantage over other competitors. Being tall is often regarded as a disadvantage for sprinters at the start of a race as it can limit the drive phase, when runners push forwards at an angle to gain acceleration. But, the researchers say, by midway ""Bolt's body height resulting in long strides makes it possible for him to maintain high speed for a longer time and decelerate at a slower rate than shorter sprinters"". And that stride length can average 2.47m.That's a full 20cm longer than that of most other competitors - but he maintains a high stride frequency. It's a devastating combination for his rivals, as once Bolt is in full flight, he can gain ground with every step. The Jamaican covered his world record 100m in less than 41 strides, whereas the other finalists averaged almost 45, Krzysztof and Mero found. So what about that slow start for tall sprinters?Bolt overcomes it - usually. True, he is slower out of the blocks than other competitors: if you look at all his reaction times out of the blocks across his Olympic and World Championship 100m races (except for his false start at Daegu 2011), pre-London he averaged 0.158 seconds while the other finalists averaged 0.149 seconds. But, according to Michael Johnson, in his best races Bolt manages to achieve a similar drive phase as less tall runners. ""You will see that in the first 30m or so he's right there with the shorter sprinters, which is rare,"" Johnson told the Olympic Channel. In his world record race, Bolt was the quickest throughout. He was already ahead by 20m and fastest over every subsequent 20m section. At London 2017, though, his reaction time of 0.183 was slow for him - and 0.031 slower than anyone else in the race. With Bolt, there is always more besides the running.From his 'Lightning Bolt' pose, to goofing around on the track, to his claim he ate ""about 1,000"" chicken nuggets at the Beijing Olympics, Bolt's playful personality has brought superstar status. Occasional criticism for ""showboating"" before crossing the line has done little to dent his reputation with fans. On the eve of his retirement, he is one of the world's most popular track athletes on social media with a following of almost 19 million on Facebook, 7.1 million on Instagram and 4.75 million on Twitter. With the fame comes the sponsorship. Contracts with Puma, Mumm champagne, Advil and others brought his annual earnings to $34.2m (Â£26.2) in 2016-17, according to Forbes magazine, which put him at 88 in itscelebrity 100 list.,external Bolt donates to charity through his foundation, including many years' support for his old high school in Trelawny Parish, Jamaica. But will he now step off the world stage into the shadows? The man himself says he wants to ""relax a little bit, enjoy myself as much as possible"". And, after that, perhaps a continuing role in global athletics. But there is no doubt that the sport will miss him. IAAF president Lord Coe told the BBC recently: ""What we will miss is the personality. We do want athletes with personality."" There's no chart that can capture that.

"Elina Berglund Scherwitzl, co-founder of Natural Cycles Inventing the first app in the world to be approved as a contraceptive started as a hobby project for Elina Berglund Scherwitzl. The nuclear physicist, who'd been working on the team that discovered the Higgs boson, was tired of using hormonal contraception but wasn't ready to have a baby. So the Swede set about using her data skills to find an alternative. ""Like many women I had tried many different contraception options since my teenage years and hadn't really found a solution that fit me,"" she explains. ""It was in my quest for an effective natural alternative that I discovered that you can see when you're fertile by your temperature, and for me that was really a revelation."" The Natural Cycles app tells users when they are ovulating Using complex mathematics and data analysis, Mrs Berglund Scherwitzl began developing an algorithm designed to be so precise it could pinpoint exactly when in her cycle she would ovulate. This enabled her to map out the days when she would need to use protection, to a much higher degree of certainty than similar ""rhythm"" or natural planning methods. She was so pleased with the results that, together with her Austrian husband, fellow physicist Raoul Scherwitzl, she set about founding her own business called Natural Cycles. It offers an app designed to help women around the world with their fertility and contraception needs, by allowing them to collect their own temperature data sets and closely monitor their cycle trends. Mrs Berglund Scherwitzl was tired of using birth control but not ready to have baby Launched in 2014, it now has some 300,000 users, who pay a monthly or annual fee for the service. In the UK a yearly deal costs Â£50, which includes the cost of a thermometer. The company has attracted $8m (Â£6.1m) in investment and has so far made sales of more than $6m. However, if it wasn't for the timing of another large scientific discovery, the project may not have got off the ground so quickly. Mrs Berglund Scherwitzl, who was raised in Malmo in southern Sweden, had been working at Cern, the Geneva-based European Organization for Nuclear Research. In 2012, after decades of research, the team she was part of finally found the Higgs boson particle, crucial to our understanding of how the universe works. Mrs Berglund Scherwitzl founded the business with her husband Raoul ""A lot is about coincidence and also timing. We had just got married. The experiment was shutting down for a couple of years and I was thinking, 'If I would ever try something outside of physics, now would be the time'. ""My husband had always wanted to become an entrepreneur, so he suggested, 'Okay let's leave physics and make this algorithm into an app'."" Following several medical trials, their app became the first tech-based device on the planet to be formally certified for use as contraception, in February 2017. It gained approval for use across the EU after getting the green light from the German inspection and certification organisation Tuv Sud. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The restaurateur who puts hospitality above food How Bite Beauty is building an all-natural lipstick business The millionaire boss who admits he had a lot of luck The man who built a $1bn firm in his basement How one man built a global hospitality empire Yet the journey from launch to European certification was ""a rollercoaster"", she says. An initial approval from the Swedish Medicinal Products Agency was revoked in 2015, amid headlines about the app encouraging risky behaviour among young women in her home country, where the couple had returned to develop their business. The company was banned from marketing the app for 18 months, resulting in ""a big bump in the road"" for the growth of the firm. ""Since I came from the scientific angle I thought that if I just create a product that's really good, it will sell itself and everyone will trust it. I realise that that's not at all the case,"" she admits. The entrepreneur wants to support women with their health issues ""But it was maybe good that I was so naive, because if I would have known all the challenges ahead, maybe I wouldn't have dared to do it."" The start-up now markets itself as being ""as effective as the pill"", following one of the largest clinical studies in contraception involving more than 4,000 women, published in the peer-reviewed European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care. The researchers - which included the co-founding couple - found that 7% of women who used the app in a ""typical"" way (allowing for some human error) got pregnant, compared to 9% taking the pill and less than 1% using IUD coils. Against this background, Mrs Berglund Scherwitzl accepts that her product relies on women sticking closely to the app's instructions and therefore might not be for everyone, not least because it also fails to protect its users from sexually transmitted diseases. The firm now wants to help women with family planning ""Just like the pill we need some effort from the user on a daily basis. But we really hope to be the default alternative if you don't want to use hormonal contraception or IUDs,"" she argues. While the product is only currently certified in the EU, where its users are concentrated in the UK and the Nordics, it is available worldwide and, despite its earlier controversies has attracted users in some 160 countries. Mrs Berglund Scherwitzl says that global sales have already shot up since its EU certification was confirmed in February, with the firm already more than doubling last year's turnover of $2m. Alongside expanding its subscription base of women seeking to avoid getting pregnant, the company is also trying to attract more customers using the app from a family planning perspective - to work out when is the best time to conceive. Continuing to build their company - which now has 30 employees based in Stockholm - while also caring for a young child has not been easy, she says. However it has guaranteed they spend plenty of time together. ""It's our passion and our hobby. At night when we come home and have a glass of wine we talk about our goals and we become a bit more visionary than we have time to do during the work day."" That vision involves raising awareness of how technology can be used to tackle issues linked to women's health, something which she says has been ""largely ignored because researchers are often men"". The pair also hope to increase the number of the app's users in developing countries and nations where religion is a barrier to contraception. ""We've come even further than I first hoped, and that's an amazing feeling. But I feel like we should not stop here, she says.

"Lily is ""very happy and doing well"", her mum says For most parents, their child's move to secondary school is a big moment which requires planning, even more so for those with transgender children. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has been following two of the UK's youngest trans children for the last two-and-a-half years. ""I won't mention it, but if it comes up I will be honest. I'm not going to say, 'Guess what, I'm trans', but if someone mentions it I will say I am, because I am,"" says Jessica. The 10-year-old's friends do not really mention the fact she has transitioned from living as male to female, a fact she prefers. She just wants to be treated ""like a normal girl"". We first met ""Jessica"" and ""Lily"", who is now nine, in January 2015. We are not using their real names. Jessica's stepfather ""Alex"" - who transitioned from living as female to male - says he is ""taken aback, but quite proud"" that she plans to be open when she moves to her next school in just over a year's time. While it is not without problems, he says that approach avoids having to worry about whether someone will find out, which can be stressful for both the child and siblings who could accidentally ""out"" them. ""It's a big secret to keep. It just puts so much pressure on them. And so if somebody does feel that they can sort of be open about it, I personally I think that's a better way,"" he says. Find out more Jessica has been going to school as a girl for over two years Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel. Our first piece about Lily and Jessica can befound here. Our second piece can be readhere. Transgender is a term used to describe a person who does not identify as the gender that was assigned to them at birth  - they may wish to be seen as a different gender or no gender at all. The UK's only centre specialising in gender issues in under-18s is the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which is based in London and has clinics across the UK. In the last two years, the number of children aged 10 or under who were referred to the NHS because they were unhappy with their biological gender has risen from 87 to 216, including 32 aged five or under over the last year. It is something psychologists at the trust admit surprised them. They say it is impossible to know for sure why so many more children are being referred, but that it is clear there is much greater awareness and acceptance in society for young people to be able to talk about questioning their gender. Lily has two years remaining at primary school Lily's mum ""Jen"" says the search for the right secondary school began two years ago, before her older son started. She asked how it would support trans children, so she knew it could help both of her offspring. At the time, the school had not encountered any other transgender children, but said it was happy to build something into the curriculum to educate the other pupils. The school already has two children transitioning from male to female. ""It's reassuring that they've got a bit of experience of it and getting their heads around it,"" she says. Lily, who still has two years left at primary school, is ""very happy and doing well"", her mum says. ""[She's] possibly more confident and just seems more relaxed in herself. At school it doesn't seem to be an issue any more, it's just a kind of old news really."" But Lily says her fellow pupils are not always kind. ""There was a person, they said, 'You won't be a very good woman, you should just be a man', and that really upset me."" Jessica went through a more difficult period at the end of last year as hormones began to kick in, her parents said. ""Occasionally she'll bring up, 'When I grow up I'm going to live alone, because no-one will want to live with me because I'm trans, I won't ever get a boyfriend',"" says mum ""Ella"". ""They should be children, they should just be allowed to get on with stuff. I just want everything to go smoothly and normal for her, as normal as life is,"" she adds. Jessica (left) and Lily Jessica's parents say she felt much better after speaking to a consultant at the Tavistock clinic, who reassured her that the physical changes linked to puberty were some way off. Younger transgender children can receive treatment on the NHS, but at that age it takes the form of counselling and support sessions. Medical intervention is not considered until they approach puberty, when hormone blockers might be offered. Blockers pause the physical changes associated with puberty, giving the young person time to think for much longer about their gender identity. At around the age of 16, a patient can then take cross-sex hormones, which would mean they go through the puberty of the gender that they feel that they are. Ella says she worries about whether they will have the money to pay for private treatment if Jessica wants hormones earlier. ""I've got friends whose children need it for their own mental health, their hormones earlier. So I am aware that Jessica may need them sooner."" Jen adds: ""It's hard being a teenager anyway, (let alone) to have to wait until you're 16 for your body to develop. It's upsetting to think all her peers are going to be talking about periods and developing breasts and wearing bras and things and she will be waiting - a really tough thing for her to go through."" Lily has been wearing a skirt to school for the last two years The most crucial thing for both sets of parents is to support their children as they grow up and ensure that they have the skills to handle the challenges ahead. ""The research evidence shows that teenagers and young people who are trans who have had that support, had the treatment that they need, have the support from families and schools have got the same or better mental health than normal non-trans young people,"" says Jen. She says the families are fortunate that they are going through the experience now. ""Even five years ago things were so different. There were no blockers, that must have been so hard for families going through what we're going through,"" she says. For more information and support: NHSpage with general information,external.

"Brigitte Macron is said to receive about 150 letters a week Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, should not be given the official status of first lady, according to more than 200,000 people who have signed an online petition. ""There is no reason why the wife of the head of state should get a budget from public funds,"" wrote its creator Thierry Paul Valette, an artist and equality campaigner. A charter that codifies her role is now in preparation, according to the French media. The French constitution gives no official status to a president's spouse, although they are typically allocated an office in the ElysÃ©e Palace, an assistant or two, and security guards. They are also expected to accompany their partner at official engagements and often become involved in charity work. In a TV interview during the campaign, he said that, if elected, he would want the role of first lady to be ""defined"". ""She [Brigitte Macron] will have a say on what she wants to be,"" he told TF1 in April, ""I want to get out of French hypocrisy... When a person lives with you, she must have a role and be recognised in this role."" Emmanuel and Brigitte posing for photographs during the presidential campaign He then insisted she would not be paid by the taxpayer. Nonetheless, ""hypocrisy"" is exactly what his critics are shouting. During his campaign, Mr Macron vowed tostamp out nepotism. His conservative rival, FranÃ§ois Fillon, had been embroiled in ascandal over payments to his wife,which is thought to have cost him the presidency. She was allegedly paid hundreds of thousands of euros for little or no work. Meet France's new first lady Trump and Macron's never-ending handshake Macron targets nepotism In response to the outcry, Mr Macron said he would ban politicians from employing relatives. Brigitte Macron welcomed pop star and charity founder Rihanna to the Elysee Palace in July ""Do as I say, not as I do,""tweeted,externalFrench politician Thierry Mariani last month. An ally of Mr Fillon, he linked to an article about speculation over Mrs Macron receiving official status and a budget. Brigitte Macron is certainly getting a lot of attention, in her homeland and worldwide. French newspaper LibÃ©ration called her ""omnipresent"". ""The French elected a man, but it is a certainly a couple that lives in the ElysÃ©e,"" wrote Voici magazine. ""Brigitte! Brigitte! Brigitte!"", shouted the crowd when she took the stage after her husband was elected in May. Brigitte T-shirts have featured in fashion magazines. (""Our new fashion crush"",said Elle magazine,external.) But she has also been targeted by abuse, often related to the 24-year age gap between her and her younger husband. This video can not be played The US president told Brigitte Macron she was ""in good shape"" In hispetition,external, Mr Valette made clear the criticism was not personal. ""We fiercely denounce all sexist attacks against Brigitte Macron and we do not question her skills,"" he wrote. The unofficial first lady receives about 150 letters a week, according to French media. New staff could help her deal with the post. There are no known plans to give her a salary, but she could get extra money for employees and expenses. One argument is that this creates jobs. In the US, the Obamas were often referred to as the ""first family"" She told Vanity Fair magazine she wanted to use her husband's presidency to ""change the lives of disabled people and their families"". Meanwhile, President Macron's popularity has fallen (only 36% of people are satisfied, according to recent poll), leading some critics to speculate that he may be trying to boost his image via his wife. Others have accused the couple of copying the US model, specifically looking to Michelle Obama, who played a very active role during her husband's time in the White House. However, the US role of first lady is also unofficial. ""This is pointless as it is nothing new,"" political analyst Olivier Rouquan told RMC radio. He claims that Mrs Macron has no higher profile than any of her predecessors. He cited Yvonne de Gaulle and Claude Pompidou, as wives that also had a big public image. ""I do not understand how one could institutionalise the status of first lady. It has no democratic meaning,"" he said. ""We do not elect a presidential couple."" Her immediate predecessor certainly had a very different profile. Journalist ValÃ©rie Trierweiler was never married to President FranÃ§ois Hollande. Their relationship began as an affair, they split up while he was still in office and she later wrote a kiss-and-tell memoir. The relationship between former French President Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie Trierweiler soured And before that, President Nicolas Sarkozy had two consecutive first ladies while in office. He and his wife Cecilia divorced soon after he took office. He then met and married singer Carla Bruni, who was swiftly rated as one of the50 most powerful women in the world,external, according to Forbes magazine. (It was 2010, and Michelle Obama was number one.) The Macrons have been together for more than 20 years and married for 10. However, as the petition says, ""We do not know who will be the next president..."" And what happens if the next president is a woman? Is France ready for its first official ""first man""?

"On Friday Donald Trump jetted off to his resort golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a 17-day vacation. The White House has been quick to note that this is a ""working"" vacation. The president won't be leaving the duties of office totally behind. It's fair to say, however, that Mr Trump will spend more than a little bit of time on the fairways. The White House is coy about how much the president has played golf so far during his time in office, but given that he's visited his golf properties at least 43 times so far, he almost certainly has teed up more at this point in his administration than any past president. Trump's 17-day holiday causes a stir So while he's lining up his shots over the next two weeks, will memories of his past six months in office break his concentration? Will an ill-timed twinge of concern turn what would have been a solid drive into a wayward slice or cause a sure-thing birdie putt to lip out of the hole? How many of his apparently unlimited supply of mulligans will he have to use to soothe a troubled mind? The president may comfort himself with thoughts of low unemployment or a booming stock market. He may smile when he recalls the cheering crowds at recent campaign-style rallies or the unexpected coup of the Democratic West Virginia governor joining the Republican Party. But as any vacationing piker knows, when a holiday ends there's twice as much work and a load of problems that have piled up in the meantime. Even if the president sails through his vacation without a care, there are plenty of troubles brewing back in Washington. Here's a look at some of them. Perhaps the single biggest legislative accomplishment of the Trump presidency so far is the law imposing new sanctions on Iran and North Korea and strengthening existing ones on Russia. Given that the president signed the measure with extreme reservations, it's safe to say things aren't going according to plan. Efforts to repeal and replace Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms were dramatically dynamited by a handful of Republicans and a united Democratic Party in the Senate. An overhaul of the tax law is currently barely a glimmer in legislators' eyes. The proposed modifications to the legal immigration system recently unveiled at the White House have been deemed dead on arrival in Congress, while any kind of infrastructure spending package is going nowhere fast. Where Trump went wrong on healthcare When the politicians return to Congress in September they will have their hands full with more pressing matters. Hardliners may attempt to prevent the treasury from issuing new government debt - raising the ""debt ceiling"" - without extracting spending cuts. New appropriations bills must be passed to avoid a government shutdown. All this leaves little time for big new legislative efforts to reach fruition before the calendar flips to 2018 and legislators start thinking about their re-election campaigns. View from the tee:The president faces a treacherous par four, with water on both sides and sand around the green. If Mr Trump's domestic agenda creates headaches, the international outlook has the makings of a splitting migraine. North Korea continues to press ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, despite harsh presidential tweets and steely gazes from the vice-president. The administration has warned of grave consequences, but what's his next step? Mr Trump has called on China to do more - while at the same time threatening to take punitive trade measures against that nation for intellectual property theft. While Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a cordial summit in Mar-a-Lago in April, Sino-American relations could be heading toward treacherous ground. What can the outside world do about N Korea? The president also has some hard choices to make when it comes to Afghanistan, where his generals are calling for an increase in troop numbers to break a strategic stalemate with Taliban insurgents. While Mr Trump often has said he will defer to the Pentagon on military matters, some of his civilian advisers view an increased commitment as counter to candidate Trump's America-first foreign policy promises. As if that weren't enough, Iran could also become a political flashpoint if the president follows through with his reported desire not to certify that the nation is complying with the multi-party nuclear agreement when it next comes up for review in October. It's another area where various presidential aides are giving diametrically opposed advice - and the president will have to be the decider. View from the tee:A high-risk, high-reward scenario where almost everyone will be relieved if the president decides to play it safe. At a Thursday evening rally in West Virginia, Mr Trump attempted to paint the ongoing investigation into possible links between his campaign and Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election as an us-against-them situation. ""They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story,"" he said. The president's speech came on the heels of news that special counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury to assist in his investigation - giving him new powers to subpoena documents, solicit sworn testimony and, with sufficient evidence, bring criminal indictments. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Over the past weeks reports have circulated that Mr Mueller is casting a wide net in his probe, looking at the controversial June 2016 meeting between senior members of the Trump campaign and Russian advocates, as well as the business dealings of Mr Trump and those close to him. Then there are the ongoing congressional committee investigations. Presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort have already spoken with investigators behind closed doors. They - or Donald Trump Jr - could be called for public testimony at some point in the months ahead, which would make for a national political spectacle. The concurrent investigations could all end up duds - or set off explosions that shake the very foundations of the Trump presidency. The answer lies somewhere on the other side of August. View from the tee:In the words of Bill Murray's Carl Spackler in Caddyshack,'The heavy stuff isn't going to come down for quite a while'. Just over two weeks ago Mr Trump had a chief of staff, a press secretary and no communications director. As he heads to New Jersey he has a new chief of staff, a new press secretary and a recently fired communications director. He has an attorney general who says the president's swipes at him over the past few weeks were ""kind of hurtful"" and who just held a press event that seemed primarily designed to convince Mr Trump that, yes, he's trying really hard to fight leaks, just like he asked. His national security adviser, HR McMaster, is systematically removing aides brought in before he took over from Michael Flynn - individuals who were more in step with White House adviser Steve Bannon's fiercely nationalistic worldview. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Arrivederci, Mooch - The story of Anthony Scaramucci As a result Mr McMaster himself has become the target of a concerted attempt by some on the right to force him from his job. A website called McMasterLeaksfeatured a cartoon,externalof the retired general as a puppet being controlled by liberal billionaire (and conservative bogeyman) George Soros, who himself was puppeteered by ""the Rothschilds"". (The website has since changed ""Rothschilds"" to ""Saudis"" after accusations of anti-Semitism.) The long knives have come out over the past two weeks, forcing Republican establishment figures like Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer from their senior White House jobs. Mr Kelly, another former general, is supposed to be bringing new discipline to the West Wing, but the verdict on his efforts won't come until long after Mr Trump has returned to the Oval Office. View from the tee:A golf course can't operate when the caddies are at war with each other. The president has a lot to worry about as he rides around the links in his golf cart, but the real moment of reckoning may not come until he's back in the clubhouse, freshening up after his round. As he checks his hair in the bathroom mirror, he may come face to face with the biggest aid - or obstacle - to his long-term presidential success. Himself. Time and time again over the past six-plus months Mr Trump has undermined his agenda with ill-timed tweets or off-message comments, needlessly complicating what is already the hardest job in the nation. Trump on Twitter: A history of the man and his medium Trump 'covfefe' tweet melts internet He managed to alienate several Republican senators - Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona - who were instrumental in sinking his healthcare reform legislation. Just last week he took multiple swipes at Congress, including the leadership of his own party, saying they ""look like fools"" for not doing away with the legislative filibuster and laying the current poor state of US-Russia relations at their feet. Given that the president needs Congress's help in the days ahead, such antics seem of questionable wisdom. Already one Republican Senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, has made a very visible break with the president. The mediaare buzzing,externalwith reports that others may be plotting to go their own way. Congress has tied the president's hands on Russian sanctions. Legislation is being drafted that would limit his ability to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller. The Senate is staying in session just to keep the president from using a procedural trick to replace Mr Sessions without their consent. Despite the president's urging, there are now bipartisan efforts to come up with ways to modify Obamacare and not repeal it.

"Police were alerted by a neighbour on Saturday afternoon A man murdered his wife before killing himself at their home with their three children inside, police say. The woman, 26, was ""violently attacked"" before she was killed at the house in Oldbury, West Midlands, police said. The pair's bodies were found by police after a neighbour raised the alarm when they heard the children crying at about 14:00 BST on Saturday. No-one else is being sought over the deaths. Detectives believe they died earlier on in the morning. More updates on this story The three children are being cared for by family members after the bodies were found at the home in Pel Crescent. Detectives believe they died earlier on in the morning Neighbours said the alarm was raised after the couple's eldest child knocked on the door of the house next door. Det Insp Jim Munro said: ""This is a truly tragic incident. ""It's understood the woman was violently attacked before the offender took his own life. ""The timeline of exactly what happened is unclear but we believe the two people died during the morning."" A post-mortem examination is due to take place later. Neighbours, who described the couple as Eastern European, said three ambulances arrived at the home on Saturday afternoon. One man, who did not want to be named, said one of the children initially refused to leave the property as they wanted to stay inside with the mother. Another neighbour added: ""It's such a shock, I can't believe it. Nothing usually happens here, it's really quiet. ""I just feel for the kids, you know, because they've lost their mum and their dad.""

"The head of the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command rarely gives interviews but ahead of a special programme from New Scotland Yard on Tuesday, Dean Haydon spoke to the BBC Asian Network about the challenges the force faces. Cdr Dean Haydon agrees the last few months have been ""demanding"" and ""challenging"". Since he started the job in December 2015, there have been four separate terror attacks - at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park Mosque. ""If you were talking to me 12 months ago, I'd be talking about a different terrorist threat - the threat's shifted, it's changed,"" he says. But Cdr Haydon says the public are not aware of the plots that have been stopped during the same period. ""Six were disrupted, and over the last three years, 19 different terrorist plots have been stopped,"" he explains. Prevent criticism 'stems from ignorance' 'Terrorism masquerades as Islam' Before Westminster, the highest-profile terror attacks in the UK in recent years were the murder of MP Jo Cox in June 2016 and soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May 2013. For Cdr Haydon, the difficulty facing police now is individuals who have been acting alone and using everyday items such as knives and cars. ""Twelve months ago the plots we were preventing were those aimed at the police, the military and government officials. ""But the recent attacks were on the public, the community. They're indiscriminate."" 'Record number of calls' Cdr Haydon says the job of monitoring and disrupting plots is an around the clock task and a lot of the work relies on information provided by the public. ""I would class these attackers as lone actors,"" he says. Cdr Haydon said Prevent is not about ""spying"" on communities ""It's difficult to identify, disrupt and prevent these individuals [so] we do need the help of the public, because the police and security service can't do this alone."" The public, and especially Muslims, have been urged to be more vigilant and proactive in reporting suspicious individuals. But recently it emerged that members of that community had reported Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi and Khuram Butt, one of the men behind the London Bridge attack, to the police through its anti-terror hotline. Asked why the authorities did not act on the information, Cdr Haydon insists every call is treated seriously. ""This year we've had the highest amounts of calls we've ever seen. Every one we get is prioritised. ""Some of the information goes into wider intelligence picture and some is based on live operations we're running. If you phone us anonymously, obviously we can't call you back. If you've left your contact details, and we think it's safe to call you back, we will."" Last year a record number of people contacted the confidential hotline, with the service receiving more than 22,000 calls. About a third of these calls feed the police's operations. Cdr Haydon defended the response to reports about the Manchester attacker Salman Abedi But when people report suspicious behaviour, or suspect someone has been radicalised and wants to go abroad to fight, what happens next? ""We have a duty of care to protect individuals regardless.,"" says Cdr Haydon. ""We'll do everything to stop them going. We'll take their passports off them. There are various systems at airports and ports across the country to identify individuals. But I'm glad to see there's a slowing down of people going abroad and that's thanks to the work we've done."" He says 850 people have left the UK to join terrorist organisations. Some have been killed in war zones, some have stayed overseas but others have returned. It's the latter that ""cause [him] concern"". ""Some of them have had military training abroad and been radicalised. We are contingency planning now in relation to all of them. We've got a fair idea of who every individual is."" Many would ask, why let them back? Why trust them? Cdr Haydon emphasises that it is his job to protect all Britons and if there's evidence of terrorist activity, individuals will be arrested and prosecuted. But he says the police has a duty to protect the young and vulnerable. ""We work with local authorities, some of them are statutory partners, some of them are intervention providers, trusted members of the community who work alongside us and ultimately safeguard and protect young people."" 'Not just about Muslim community' One of the key ways in which his force and the government are attempting to safeguard is through its anti-terrorism strategyContest,external. Yet the part of it that has caused much controversy isPrevent. Former Met Ch Supt Dal Babu - one of Britain's most senior Muslim officers - called it ""toxic"". He said many Muslims do not trust it and see it as a form of spying. But Cdr Haydon says those who criticise it are not offering another solution. ""I hear criticism but I absolutely don't accept it,"" he says. ""Prevent is not about spying on communities. It's about safeguarding."" Safeguarding is something Cdr Haydon mentions several times. Having previously headed the Child Abuse and Sexual Offences arm of the police and enforced safeguarding systems there, he sees Prevent as its equivalent in the terrorism world. Nevertheless doesn't the criticism of Prevent affect him, especially as it comes from the people he needs to help him do his job effectively? ""I hear that, but sometimes it's based on ignorance and sometimes it comes from sections of the community that just don't want it to work."" One thing that is striking about the conversation with Cdr Haydon is that he rarely mentions the word Muslim, preferring to use words ""community"" or ""communities"". But he does stress that he wants to reassure those who feel unfairly under suspicion. ""Prevent is not just about the Muslim community. It goes across all communities."" He said a third of the cases related to domestic extremism and involved tackling the threat from right-wing extremists. ""I have seen the positive work of Prevent,"" he said, adding it had stopped people from being radicalised or going abroad. ""It's a fantastic tool and it's here to stay.""

"Tesco will stop the sale of 5p carrier bags across the UK in three weeks' time, and will instead offer 10p ""bags for life"" to shoppers. Tesco sells about 700 million single-use carrier bags a year, the highest among the major supermarkets, but sales will end in stores on 28 August. The supermarket said the decision followed a trial which led to a 25% cut in bag sales. Charges for plastic bags have been in place in the UK since October 2015. In 2011,Walesstarted charging 5p per bag and saw a 71% drop in the number used by customers.Northern Irelandintroduced charges in 2013, followed by Scotland in 2014.Englandwas the last country in the UK to charge, recording an 83% drop in use. Tesco conducted a10-week trialin Aberdeen, Dundee and Norwich in May. Plastic, single-use bags were withdrawn leaving shoppers with the choice of bringing their own or buying a ""bag for life"". That will now be a permanent move at stores across the UK. The more expensive bags are made from 94% recycled plastic and will be exchanged without charge when damaged, the supermarket says. Online shoppers can still opt to receive their deliveries in single-use carrier bags after store sales end, Tesco says, although just over half already choose a bagless delivery. Sales of the more expensive ""bags for life"" fund grants for community projects - similar to other supermarkets' charity donations following the introduction of plastic bag charging. Tesco said that its scheme had paid Â£33m to more than 6,400 groups. Matt Davies, UK and Irish Republic chief executive at Tesco, said: ""The number of bags being bought by our customers has already reduced dramatically. [This] move will help our customers use even fewer bags but ensure that those sold in our stores continue to fund thousands of community projects across the country chosen by customers."" Sainsbury's scrapped single-use bags from stores when carrier bag charges were introduced. Louise Edge, senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: ""It is great to see major retailers moving away from disposable plastic. For too long we've seen plastic as something to be used once and thrown away. But there is no such place as 'away' - and millions of tonnes of plastic are ending up in our rivers, beaches, streets and in the sea every year, harming marine life. ""The plastic bag charge has done wonders for reducing the number of bags polluting our coastlines and waters. Now we need to see the same for throwaway plastic bottles - a deposit return scheme which encourages collection."" 5p plastic bags: All you need to know Sainsbury's delivers 53 items in 23 bags Tesco stops 5p carrier bag sales in trial Plastic bag use plummets in England Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Why does North Korea want nukes? North Korea has vowed to retaliate and make ""the US pay a price"" for drafting fresh UN sanctions over its banned nuclear weapons programme. The sanctions, which wereunanimously passed by the UNon Saturday, were a ""violent violation of our sovereignty,"" the official KCNA news agency said. Separately, South Korea says the North has rejected an offer to restart talks, dismissing it as insincere. The sanctions will aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third. The UN Security Council decision followed repeated missile tests by the North which have escalated tensions on the peninsula. In its first major response on Monday, North Korea insisted that it would continue to develop its controversial nuclear weapons programme. The state-run KCNA news agency said Pyongyang would ""not put our self-defensive nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table"" while it faces threats from the US. It threatened to make the US ""pay the price for its crime... thousands of times,"" referring to America's role in drafting the UN sanctions resolution. Speaking to reporters at a regional forum in the Philippine capital, Manila, North Korean spokesman Bang Kwang Hyuk said: ""The worsening situation on the Korean peninsula, as well as the nuclear issues, were caused by the United States. ""We affirm that we'll never place our nuclear and ballistic missiles programme on the negotiating table, and won't budge an inch on strengthening nuclear armament."" Can the US defend itself against North Korea? N Korea: The possible solutions The remarks come after reports emerged that the North and South Korean foreign ministers had met briefly on Sunday evening on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Manila. South Koreanmedia reported,externalthat its Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung-wha, shook hands with her North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, in a brief and unarranged meeting at an official dinner event. A South Korean official told the BBC that Mr Ri had dismissed Ms Kang's offer of talks as ""insincere"". This video can not be played Japanese people practising nuclear attack drills South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Ms Kang as saying that Mr Ri's rejection of the talks proposal appeared to be connected to the new sanctions. ""I told him that [the two offers for talks] are an urgent matter that should be carried out immediately with any political agenda put aside and asked him to proactively react,"" she was quoted as saying. How advanced are N Korea missiles? The one place the US and N Korea meet The foreign minister of China, which is Pyongyang's closest ally, told journalists on Monday: ""My feeling is that the North did not entirely reject the positive proposals raised by the South."" Wang Yi added that China also supported the South's initiatives, and was ""100%"" committed to enforcing the latest round of UN sanctions. Importing coal, seafood, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore from North Korea is banned Countries cannot receive new North Korean workers No new joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals No new investment in existing joint ventures More individuals targeted with travel bans and assets freezes Member states to report to the UN Security Council within 90 days on how they have implemented resolution US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also at the Asean forum, where he spoke about North Korea. Noting Russia and China's participation in the unanimous vote, he told journalists it was clear there was now ""no daylight among the international community"" on their desire for North Korea to stop its tests. ""The best signal that North Korea can give us [is] that they are prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches,"" he added. Russia and China have previously differed with others on how to handle Pyongyang, but in recent months have joined calls for North Korea to stop its missile tests - while also urging the US and South Korea to halt military drills, and withdraw an anti-missile system from the South. This video can not be played North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was ""seen from Japan"" Meanwhile, the US military has said it is working with its close ally South Korea to review guidelines covering the size of missile warheads that South Korea can deploy. The current bilateral guidelines limit the power of South Korean missiles, but Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said these restrictions might be altered. ""It is a topic under active consideration here and I would tell you that we would be favourably inclined to do anything which furthers the defensive capabilities of South Korea,"" he told reporters. ""We will always adapt to the threat as it changes."" On Monday, US President Donald Trump spoke to his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in over the phone about relations on the Korean peninsula. They agreed that North Korea ""poses a grave and growing direct threat"" and the two leaders were committed to fully implementing the latest round of UN sanctions, the White House said in a statement.

"Eloise Dixon and her family had reportedly ended up in a favela because of a miscommunication A British woman who was shot after she reportedly travelled to a Brazilian favela by mistake is ""lucky"" to be alive, according to a local hospital. Eloise Dixon, her partner and their three children were driving in Angra dos Reis on Sunday, when their car was approached by an armed group, Brazilian newspaperO Globo,externalreported. She was shot twice, once in the abdomen, but is recovering in hospital. Ms Dixon's family were unhurt, the paper added. O Globo said the family had apparently been searching for water to buy in Angra dos Reis - a coastal resort about 90 miles (145 km) from Rio de Janeiro. According to theO Dia,externalnewspaper, they ended up in the Agua Santa - or holy water - community because of a difficulty in understanding the language. The slum area is known to have drug traffickers. Images shown on Brazilian television show the family's car with a flattened tyre Images of the family's car shows damage to the front seat after the shooting Authorities told O Globo the family were shot at after they were told to leave their car by armed men but did not understand the request. One bullet was aimed at the head of Ms Dixon, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, but missed, while two others hit her in the abdomen. Neither of them hit any vital organs. The director of the hospital where she was treated, Rodrigo Mucheli, told Brazilian media: ""The projectile passed through the abdomen and fortunately did not hit the big vessels. She was really lucky."" Ms Dixon, from south-east London, is now reportedly in a stable condition after she underwent two hours of surgery. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are assisting the family of a British woman who has been hospitalised in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. ""Our staff remain in contact with the local authorities."" By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent Angra dos Reis, the place that Eloise Dixon was shot, is a jumping-off point for some of Brazil's most famous tourist destinations. It's where tourists catch ferries to head to the beaches of Ilha Grande and not far away is the popular colonial town of Paraty. But while most tourists would feel safe in those parts, this shooting just shows how easy it is to get caught up in troubles. Agua Santa is a favela, or slum. A poor neighbourhood that would have probably started informally but then integrated into the main city. They are often controlled by drugs gangs so tourists are not advised to go in without  a local resident or guide. This shooting of Eloise Dixon isn't the first. There have been similar incidents in the city of Rio, with tourists following instructions from mobile apps and straying into favela territory with fatal consequences.

"Jodie Whittaker was revealed as the new Doctor last month Jodie Whittaker says she didn't see people's reactions to her becoming the first female Doctor Who, because she's not on social media. Speaking to BBC 6 Music in herfirst broadcast interviewsince her casting was revealed, she said: ""This will be a blessing and a curse. ""I've missed a lot of the fun stuff and probably the bad stuff."" The Broadchurch star also praised fans of the sci-fi series as ""the most amazing, creative people"". All the Doctors so far, from Hartnell to Whittaker Time Lord's new gender splits Doctor Who fans This video can not be played Jodie Whittaker reveals how she feels about becoming the 13th Doctor And she said she had spoken to the actors who have previously played the Doctor - although she didn't ask for advice. ""The overwhelming sense was this is such an exciting journey,"" she said. ""It's to be enjoyed. There's no advice you can do - no person plays this part the same. What a freeing thing it is."" This video can not be played Find out what advice Jodie received from former Time Lords The reaction to Whittaker's casting was mostly positive - but a sizeable minority protested that the Doctor shouldn't be played by a woman. ""The people that are in this role, that we're excited by and we're passionate about, that we look up to, don't always have to tick the same box, and that's what's really incredible about it."" The actress said she managed to avoid most of the commentary. ""I've missed a lot of the fun stuff and probably the bad stuff because I'm not on any type of social media and never have been,"" she told Shaun Keaveny. ""So if I get something it's a mate screen grabbing something and sending it to me. ""They obviously edit... actually, sometimes they don't!"" she added, joking that any negative posts sent on to her by friends left her confidence on the floor.

The 35-year-old said that when she found out her audition had been successful: ""I didn't faint - I played it really cool and cried."" Jodie Whittaker in Trust Me She added she was looking forward to the ""freedoms and fun"" and the ""scale of the storylines"" - especially as she is going to be working with Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall, who is the new Doctor Who showrunner. ""I already know Chris - I already know how incredible he is. The direction he's going to take it is going to be amazing. I get excited by it,"" she said. ""I don't even know what the journey is. Every script I read will be brand new. This certainly is very different."" And in an interview with BBC News, the actor said she felt ""relief"" at the news of her role being ""public knowledge"". She added that she'd had ""a lot of fantastic advice"" about the attention she would receive as the Doctor. This video can not be played See how Jodie Whittaker was revealed as the next Time Lord ""I'm lucky because I've had a body of work, so it's not like going from anonymous to recognised.

"This video can not be played CEO of Oxford Information Labs tells Today we need more information on how our data is collected and used Britons could obtain more control over what happens to personal information under proposals outlined by the government. Citizens will be able to ask for personal data, or information posted when they were children, to be deleted. The proposals are part of an overhaul of UK data protection lawsdrafted under Digital Minister, Matt Hancock,external. Firms that flout the law will face bigger fines, levied by the UK's data protection watchdog. The bill will transfer the European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Regulation,external(GDPR) into UK law. ""The new Data Protection Bill will give us one of the most robust, yet dynamic, set of data laws in the world,"" said Mr Hancock in a statement. ""It will give people more control over their data, require more consent for its use, and prepare Britain for Brexit,"" he added. Proposals included in the bill will: make it simpler for people to withdraw consent for their personal data to be used let people ask for data to be deleted require firms to obtain ""explicit"" consent when they process sensitive personal data expand personal data to include IP addresses, DNA and small text files known as cookies let people get hold of the information organisations hold on them much more freely make re-identifying people from anonymised or pseudonymised data a criminal offence This places a strong burden on firms to protect data and allows for significant fines if they fail to protect information or suffer a breach. If you worry about embarrassing social media posts lingering online for years, you will soon have the right to ask for them to be removed. And should you wish for any firm that holds your personal data - from your name to your DNA - you will be able to ask them to delete it. There are, however, arguments that those holding the data can put forward to refuse such requests, such asfreedom of expression and matters that are of scientific or historical importance,external. Many of these measures are already part ofthe EU's forthcoming GDPR,external, but they are also being woven into the government's bill. All of this goes beyond the ""right to be forgotten"" rules thatalready apply to search engines- those affect what can be listed in search results - but the GDPR and associated legislation impact data held by a wide range of companies. Have you ever tried to get personal data removed from the web? Share your experiences athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,externalor message us on WhatsApp at 07525900971. In the UK firms that suffer a serious data breach could be fined up to Â£17m or 4% of global turnover. The current maximum fine firms can suffer for breaking data protection laws is Â£500,000. The UK's Information Commissioner will have its powers strengthened and extended to help it police the new regime. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, said: ""We are pleased the government recognises the importance of data protection, its central role in increasing trust and confidence in the digital economy and the benefits the enhanced protections will bring to the public."" But small companies were largely in the dark about what the proposed law would mean for them, warned Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses. ""They simply aren't aware of what they will need to do, which creates a real risk of companies inadvertently facing fines,"" he said. And as for members of the public, many find it ""almost impossible"" to understand the complex ways in which firms handle their data, according to computer security researcher Steven Murdoch at University College London. He argued that privacy groups should be able to make independent data protection complaints on behalf of consumers. ""Currently, the UK's proposal does not take up this option available under EU law,"" he told the BBC.

"The head of the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command rarely gives interviews but ahead of a special programme from New Scotland Yard on Tuesday, Dean Haydon spoke to the BBC Asian Network about the challenges the force faces. Cdr Dean Haydon agrees the last few months have been ""demanding"" and ""challenging"". Since he started the job in December 2015, there have been four separate terror attacks - at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park Mosque. ""If you were talking to me 12 months ago, I'd be talking about a different terrorist threat - the threat's shifted, it's changed,"" he says. But Cdr Haydon says the public are not aware of the plots that have been stopped during the same period. ""Six were disrupted, and over the last three years, 19 different terrorist plots have been stopped,"" he explains. Prevent criticism 'stems from ignorance' 'Terrorism masquerades as Islam' Before Westminster, the highest-profile terror attacks in the UK in recent years were the murder of MP Jo Cox in June 2016 and soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May 2013. For Cdr Haydon, the difficulty facing police now is individuals who have been acting alone and using everyday items such as knives and cars. ""Twelve months ago the plots we were preventing were those aimed at the police, the military and government officials. ""But the recent attacks were on the public, the community. They're indiscriminate."" 'Record number of calls' Cdr Haydon says the job of monitoring and disrupting plots is an around the clock task and a lot of the work relies on information provided by the public. ""I would class these attackers as lone actors,"" he says. Cdr Haydon said Prevent is not about ""spying"" on communities ""It's difficult to identify, disrupt and prevent these individuals [so] we do need the help of the public, because the police and security service can't do this alone."" The public, and especially Muslims, have been urged to be more vigilant and proactive in reporting suspicious individuals. But recently it emerged that members of that community had reported Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi and Khuram Butt, one of the men behind the London Bridge attack, to the police through its anti-terror hotline. Asked why the authorities did not act on the information, Cdr Haydon insists every call is treated seriously. ""This year we've had the highest amounts of calls we've ever seen. Every one we get is prioritised. ""Some of the information goes into wider intelligence picture and some is based on live operations we're running. If you phone us anonymously, obviously we can't call you back. If you've left your contact details, and we think it's safe to call you back, we will."" Last year a record number of people contacted the confidential hotline, with the service receiving more than 22,000 calls. About a third of these calls feed the police's operations. Cdr Haydon defended the response to reports about the Manchester attacker Salman Abedi But when people report suspicious behaviour, or suspect someone has been radicalised and wants to go abroad to fight, what happens next? ""We have a duty of care to protect individuals regardless.,"" says Cdr Haydon. ""We'll do everything to stop them going. We'll take their passports off them. There are various systems at airports and ports across the country to identify individuals. But I'm glad to see there's a slowing down of people going abroad and that's thanks to the work we've done."" He says 850 people have left the UK to join terrorist organisations. Some have been killed in war zones, some have stayed overseas but others have returned. It's the latter that ""cause [him] concern"". ""Some of them have had military training abroad and been radicalised. We are contingency planning now in relation to all of them. We've got a fair idea of who every individual is."" Many would ask, why let them back? Why trust them? Cdr Haydon emphasises that it is his job to protect all Britons and if there's evidence of terrorist activity, individuals will be arrested and prosecuted. But he says the police has a duty to protect the young and vulnerable. ""We work with local authorities, some of them are statutory partners, some of them are intervention providers, trusted members of the community who work alongside us and ultimately safeguard and protect young people."" 'Not just about Muslim community' One of the key ways in which his force and the government are attempting to safeguard is through its anti-terrorism strategyContest,external. Yet the part of it that has caused much controversy isPrevent. Former Met Ch Supt Dal Babu - one of Britain's most senior Muslim officers - called it ""toxic"". He said many Muslims do not trust it and see it as a form of spying. But Cdr Haydon says those who criticise it are not offering another solution. ""I hear criticism but I absolutely don't accept it,"" he says. ""Prevent is not about spying on communities. It's about safeguarding."" Safeguarding is something Cdr Haydon mentions several times. Having previously headed the Child Abuse and Sexual Offences arm of the police and enforced safeguarding systems there, he sees Prevent as its equivalent in the terrorism world. Nevertheless doesn't the criticism of Prevent affect him, especially as it comes from the people he needs to help him do his job effectively? ""I hear that, but sometimes it's based on ignorance and sometimes it comes from sections of the community that just don't want it to work."" One thing that is striking about the conversation with Cdr Haydon is that he rarely mentions the word Muslim, preferring to use words ""community"" or ""communities"". But he does stress that he wants to reassure those who feel unfairly under suspicion. ""Prevent is not just about the Muslim community. It goes across all communities."" He said a third of the cases related to domestic extremism and involved tackling the threat from right-wing extremists. ""I have seen the positive work of Prevent,"" he said, adding it had stopped people from being radicalised or going abroad. ""It's a fantastic tool and it's here to stay.""

"The UK's Brexit negotiations have not begun well amid ""differences"" inside the cabinet, a former head of the diplomatic service has said. Sir Simon Fraser, chief mandarin at the Foreign Office until 2015, said the UK side had been ""a bit absent"" from formal negotiations in Brussels. Sir Simon, who now advises businesses on Brexit, said he was concerned the UK had not put forward a clear position. Downing Street said it disagreed strongly with his comments. The government is expected to publish ""position papers"" on key issues soon. Brexit: All you need to know UK 'must prepare a Brexit fallback' Cars, curry and Brexit Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, Sir Simon, who campaigned for Remain ahead of last year's referendum, said he feared divisions within the cabinet were preventing the government from presenting a united front. ""The negotiations have only just begun, I don't think they have begun particularly promisingly, frankly, on the British side,"" he said. ""We haven't put forward a lot because, as we know, there are differences within the cabinet about the sort of Brexit that we are heading for and until those differences are further resolved I think it's very difficult for us to have a clear position."" He added: ""I think so far we haven't put much on the table apart from something on the status of nationals, so we are a bit absent from the formal negotiation."" He called on the government to publish further details about its views on issues, including future customs arrangements and the Northern Irish border in the coming weeks. ""I think we need to demonstrate that we are ready to engage on the substance so that people can understand what is really at stake here and what the options are."" Downing Street rejected Sir Simon's analysis. ""The last two months, we have had a constructive start to the negotiations. We have covered a significant amount of important ground,"" the prime minister's spokesman said. ""As the secretary of state for exiting the European Union said at the end of the last negotiating round, important progress has been made in understanding one another's positions on key issues."" Last month, Brexit Secretary David Davis said he was confident negotiations would continue as planned after reports Brussels may delay trade talks because of a lack of progress on the ""divorce"" settlement. At the weekend,the Sunday Telegraph,externalclaimed UK negotiators are now prepared to pay up to Â£36bn to the EU to settle the so-called Brexit divorce bill. Downing Street said it did not recognise this figure. Conservative MP Peter Bone said it would be ""totally bizarre"" for the UK to give the EU any money, let alone Â£36bn, adding that such a fee was unlikely to get through Parliament. Another Eurosceptic MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said there was ""no logic"" to the figure that was being reported. Responding to Sir Simon's comments, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""This government is in the middle of the single biggest economic and diplomatic negotiation in our history. ""Yet while the clock is running down, key cabinet members are still squabbling over what type of Brexit to pursue.""

"The head of the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command rarely gives interviews but ahead of a special programme from New Scotland Yard on Tuesday, Dean Haydon spoke to the BBC Asian Network about the challenges the force faces. Cdr Dean Haydon agrees the last few months have been ""demanding"" and ""challenging"". Since he started the job in December 2015, there have been four separate terror attacks - at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park Mosque. ""If you were talking to me 12 months ago, I'd be talking about a different terrorist threat - the threat's shifted, it's changed,"" he says. But Cdr Haydon says the public are not aware of the plots that have been stopped during the same period. ""Six were disrupted, and over the last three years, 19 different terrorist plots have been stopped,"" he explains. Prevent criticism 'stems from ignorance' 'Terrorism masquerades as Islam' Before Westminster, the highest-profile terror attacks in the UK in recent years were the murder of MP Jo Cox in June 2016 and soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May 2013. For Cdr Haydon, the difficulty facing police now is individuals who have been acting alone and using everyday items such as knives and cars. ""Twelve months ago the plots we were preventing were those aimed at the police, the military and government officials. ""But the recent attacks were on the public, the community. They're indiscriminate."" 'Record number of calls' Cdr Haydon says the job of monitoring and disrupting plots is an around the clock task and a lot of the work relies on information provided by the public. ""I would class these attackers as lone actors,"" he says. Cdr Haydon said Prevent is not about ""spying"" on communities ""It's difficult to identify, disrupt and prevent these individuals [so] we do need the help of the public, because the police and security service can't do this alone."" The public, and especially Muslims, have been urged to be more vigilant and proactive in reporting suspicious individuals. But recently it emerged that members of that community had reported Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi and Khuram Butt, one of the men behind the London Bridge attack, to the police through its anti-terror hotline. Asked why the authorities did not act on the information, Cdr Haydon insists every call is treated seriously. ""This year we've had the highest amounts of calls we've ever seen. Every one we get is prioritised. ""Some of the information goes into wider intelligence picture and some is based on live operations we're running. If you phone us anonymously, obviously we can't call you back. If you've left your contact details, and we think it's safe to call you back, we will."" Last year a record number of people contacted the confidential hotline, with the service receiving more than 22,000 calls. About a third of these calls feed the police's operations. Cdr Haydon defended the response to reports about the Manchester attacker Salman Abedi But when people report suspicious behaviour, or suspect someone has been radicalised and wants to go abroad to fight, what happens next? ""We have a duty of care to protect individuals regardless.,"" says Cdr Haydon. ""We'll do everything to stop them going. We'll take their passports off them. There are various systems at airports and ports across the country to identify individuals. But I'm glad to see there's a slowing down of people going abroad and that's thanks to the work we've done."" He says 850 people have left the UK to join terrorist organisations. Some have been killed in war zones, some have stayed overseas but others have returned. It's the latter that ""cause [him] concern"". ""Some of them have had military training abroad and been radicalised. We are contingency planning now in relation to all of them. We've got a fair idea of who every individual is."" Many would ask, why let them back? Why trust them? Cdr Haydon emphasises that it is his job to protect all Britons and if there's evidence of terrorist activity, individuals will be arrested and prosecuted. But he says the police has a duty to protect the young and vulnerable. ""We work with local authorities, some of them are statutory partners, some of them are intervention providers, trusted members of the community who work alongside us and ultimately safeguard and protect young people."" 'Not just about Muslim community' One of the key ways in which his force and the government are attempting to safeguard is through its anti-terrorism strategyContest,external. Yet the part of it that has caused much controversy isPrevent. Former Met Ch Supt Dal Babu - one of Britain's most senior Muslim officers - called it ""toxic"". He said many Muslims do not trust it and see it as a form of spying. But Cdr Haydon says those who criticise it are not offering another solution. ""I hear criticism but I absolutely don't accept it,"" he says. ""Prevent is not about spying on communities. It's about safeguarding."" Safeguarding is something Cdr Haydon mentions several times. Having previously headed the Child Abuse and Sexual Offences arm of the police and enforced safeguarding systems there, he sees Prevent as its equivalent in the terrorism world. Nevertheless doesn't the criticism of Prevent affect him, especially as it comes from the people he needs to help him do his job effectively? ""I hear that, but sometimes it's based on ignorance and sometimes it comes from sections of the community that just don't want it to work."" One thing that is striking about the conversation with Cdr Haydon is that he rarely mentions the word Muslim, preferring to use words ""community"" or ""communities"". But he does stress that he wants to reassure those who feel unfairly under suspicion. ""Prevent is not just about the Muslim community. It goes across all communities."" He said a third of the cases related to domestic extremism and involved tackling the threat from right-wing extremists. ""I have seen the positive work of Prevent,"" he said, adding it had stopped people from being radicalised or going abroad. ""It's a fantastic tool and it's here to stay.""

"The 37-year-old's family said their world had ""fallen apart"". A former Royal Marine died in a motorcycle crash during a British Superbike Championship race, event organisers have confirmed. Mark Fincham died at Thruxton Circuit, near Andover, following a two-bike crash on Sunday afternoon. He had his left leg amputated in 2007 and had been racing for the True Heroes team, which gives injured military veterans motor sport experience. The 37-year-old's family said their world had ""fallen apart"". The other rider was uninjured. A tribute, released by police on behalf of the family of Mr Fincham, from King's Lynn, said: ""Our world has fallen apart, we as a family are completely and utterly heartbroken. ""We have lost a totally amazing son, brother, brother-in-law, uncle and boyfriend, who lived his life to fullest no matter what it threw at him."" The family also thanked those who had tried to save Mr Fincham. Mark Fincham, who had his left leg amputated in 2007, met the Duchess of Cornwall at Headley Court in Surrey during his rehabilitation in 2009 In a statement,external, race organisers said the crash happened during a race for the Pirelli National Superstock 1000 Championship. ""It is with great regret that we have to announce that Mark Fincham succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment,"" the statement added.

" The Premier League is 25 years old on 15 August 2017. To mark the anniversary, BBC Sport has produced five pieces, each covering a five-year period in the competition's history. This is the first piece, focusing on the span from the first season in 1992-93 to the end of the 1996-97 campaign. Scroll down for written insight, a visual timeline, Mark Lawrenson's team of the era, a tailored tactics board and tables, before testing yourself with our Merlin sticker quiz. When Sky's adverts to herald the new Premier League famously promised ""a whole new ball game"" it was as much about hype and hope as the reality. A little was new but a lot was still old. The ad featured Gordon Strachan with a 1980s mullet and John Wark with a 1970s moustache, even if David Hirst was wearing an earring and Tony Daley working out with his top off. It was soundtracked by a Simple Minds song, Alive and Kicking, that was seven years old and had more to do with the Brat Pack than the Brit set, let alone the country's nascent rave culture. All 22 clubs (there were that many) had British managers. Shirt sponsors were the traditional - JVC for Arsenal, Sharp for Manchester United - and aimed at the VHS market rather than the satellite. Others were targeted squarely at the local market rather than overseas eyes: Shipstones and Nottingham Forest, Fisons and Ipswich. Glamour was hard-working Scandinavians such as Gunnar Halle and John Jensen. Manchester United's big summer signing was Dion Dublin, for £1m, from Cambridge United. Dublin's new team, 25 years without a league title, would begin the brave new world by losing at Sheffield United. Only one manager in the division was sacked in that first season. Two years further on, 15 of the 22 Premier League clubs changed their manager during the season or in the close seasons that bookended it. Ian Porterfield was the only Premier League boss to lose his job in the 1992-93 season, sacked by Chelsea in February and replaced by David Webb If that was an indication of how quickly the influx of television money and its attendant pressures were altering the landscape, so too were the signings teams were making. By the league's fourth birthday Middlesbrough, who had been relegated in 1993 with a team led by Bernie Slaven playing in a 90-year-old stadium, could celebrate the opening of their new 30,000 all-seater ground with the arrival of Champions League winner Fabrizio Ravanelli from Juventus and a line-up that featured three Brazilians. Inflation took hold even as the nation's economy flatlined. By the summer of 1995, Warren Barton was worth £4m to Newcastle, which at least made Liverpool feel better about the £3.5m they had spent on his Wimbledon team-mate John Scales the year before. Neither man played a competitive fixture for England. With each passing season the quality of the football on offer seemed to improve a little more. Strikes that were comfortable winners of Goal of the Month a few years before became humdrum; seemingly impossible efforts from Matt le Tissier and Tony Yeboah reflected the sense of never having had it so good. With it came wonder games too, Liverpool's 4-3 win over Newcastle in April 1996 maybe the best of the lot. The breakaway had been triggered in part by the Football Association's desire to improve the England team. After an awful European Championship in 1992 was followed by a failure to qualify for the following World Cup, Premier League talent took an invigorated Terry Venables team to the semi-finals of Euro '96. Of course, they lost on penalties to Germany, just as they had in 1990, just as they routinely would to other nations into the future. But the hosting of that tournament and the national celebration that came with it, Three Lions and all, fed back into the Premier League. Football had come home, and now everyone was into it, even if not everyone could now afford to watch. There were crises along the way - Arsenal manager George Graham sacked for taking bungs, former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar being accused of match-fixing, Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson admitting to addictions to cocaine, alcohol and gambling. Ever more money in the game, ever more temptation. Arsenal's Paul Merson broke down in tears at a press conference in 1995 following his treatment for various addictions Nothing was as shocking as when Manchester United striker Eric Cantona launched himself into the Selhurst Park crowd. But then nothing had been as critical to the direction of the league as United's decision to sign the Frenchman close to the start of it all. When Alex Ferguson brought him in on 26 November 1992, following a phone call from Leeds enquiring about Denis Irwin, United had just gone seven league games without a win and were eighth in the table. Over the next five years they would win the title in all but one, establishing a hegemony that would only occasionally be broken over the next 15 years. The seeds of the next era were being sown too. On 17 August 1996, David Beckham scored from the halfway line in a 3-0 win over Wimbledon, beginning a transformation that would take football players into the celebrity mainstream and in many cases beyond. Just over a month later, Arsenal appointed 46-year-old Frenchman Arsene Wenger as their new manager. Few had heard of him. Even fewer guessed the changes he would bring to the Premier League. Farewell beer, hello broccoli; in with foreign talent, out with the old certainties. Now it was a new ball game, and there was a great deal more to come. 15 August 1992:The Premier League begins. The first goal is scored by Sheffield United’s Brian Deane in the fifth minute of a 2-1 home win over Manchester United. 26 November 1992:Manchester United, who have just gone seven league games without a win and are eighth in the table, sign striker Eric Cantona in a £1.2m deal from Leeds, the team who beat the Red Devils to the title the previous season. 26 April 1993:Brian Clough announces that he will retire as Nottingham Forest manager at the end of the season after 18 years in charge. Clough won two European Cups, the league title and four League Cups with Forest, who are relegated from the top flight a week later. 2 May 1993:Manchester United are confirmed as Premier League champions, finishing 10 points ahead of second-placed Aston Villa. They will repeat the feat the following season, improving their overall points tally from 84 to 92. 29 July 1994:Jurgen Klinsmann - a villainous figure in English football for his role for Germany in England’s semi-final defeat at Italia ‘90 and his reputation as a diver - joins Tottenham from Monaco for £2m. The striker makes a huge impression in one season, scoring 20 league goals, celebrating the first, in a 4-3 win at Sheffield Wednesday on the opening day, with a dive celebration. 10 January 1995:Manchester United break the British transfer record to sign Andy Cole from Newcastle for £7m. Newcastle boss Kevin Keegan takes to the steps of St James’ Park to address fans who are angry at the sale. Cole has an inconsistent first season but does score five goals in one match as United beat Ipswich 9-0. 25 January 1995:As he walks from the field after being sent off at Crystal Palace, Manchester United’s Eric Cantona leaps into the crowd and kicks spectator Matthew Simmons. The Frenchman is banned until 30 September by the FA and threatens to quit English football, but stays and returns to action later in the year. 21 February 1995:It is a difficult season for Arsenal as midfielder Paul Merson goes into rehab for drink and drug addiction before manager George Graham is sacked after admitting receiving illegal payments from transfers. 14 May 1995:Blackburn break Manchester United’s monopoly on the Premier League by claiming the top-flight title for the first time in 81 years. On a dramatic final day, Rovers lose at Liverpool but triumph by a point after United can only draw at West Ham. 19 August 1995:After Manchester United sell Mark Hughes, Paul Ince and Andrei Kanchelskis, Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen declares that “you can't win anything with kids” as they suffer an opening-day 3-1 defeat at Aston Villa. A United side containing the Neville brothers, David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes bounce back quickly and go on to win the double. 3 April 1996:The best game in the Premier League era? Striker Stan Collymore scores a late winner in a pulsating 4-3 win for Liverpool that crushes title-chasing Newcastle. Kevin Keegan’s side had been 12 points clear at the top at the end of January, but this defeat leaves them three points behind leaders Manchester United with a game in hand. 30 April 1996:After Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson suggests that teams like Nottingham Forest might not try as hard against Newcastle as they do against his side, Magpies boss Kevin Keegan erupts in a live interview on Sky, which includes the now infamous lines: “You can tell him now, we're still fighting for this title and he's got to go to Middlesbrough and get something. And I'll tell you, honestly, I will love it if we beat them. Love it”. They don't. 30 July 1996:Striker Alan Shearer, whose £3.6m move to Blackburn in 1992 broke the British transfer record, leaves Rovers to join his hometown club Newcastle United for a world record fee of £15m. 17 August 1996:Manchester United's David Beckham scores a late goal from the halfway line in a 3-0 win over Wimbledon on the opening day of the season. It is an iconic goal from the man who would go on to captain England on 59 occasions. 28 September 1996:Arsenal appoint largely unknown 46-year-old Frenchman Arsene Wenger as manager. The former Monaco coach arrives from Japanese side Nagoya Grampus Eight and is met initially by suspicion and surprise. Wenger would win the Double twice with the Gunners by 2002. 5 January 1997:Newcastle are rocked by the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan, who claims he has “taken the club as far as I can”. Only eight days earlier they had beaten Tottenham 7-1 at home and were fourth in the league. He is replaced by Kenny Dalglish. 14 May 1995:Blackburn break Manchester United’s monopoly on the Premier League by claiming the top-flight title for the first time in 81 years. On a dramatic final day, Rovers lose at Liverpool but triumph by a point after United can only draw at West Ham. 11 May 1997:Despite having spent big on Brazilian midfielders Juninho and Emerson and Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, Middlesbrough are relegated to the second tier. They would have survived but for the docking of three points for failing to fulfil a fixture with Blackburn in December. Their squad was struck by injury and illness at the time but the punishment stuck. Built with Shorthand",Negative,1.2200971e-08
"This video can not be played Automatic weapons fire can be heard coming from the beach in San Jose del Cabo Gunmen have killed three people and wounded two others on a popular beach in north-western Mexico, officials say. The victims, all men, were resting under a palm tree in San JosÃ© del Cabo, in Baja California Sur state, reports say. Their identities have not been confirmed. No arrests have been made. There was panic among tourists when the incident happened, witnesses say. Mexico has seen a spike in violence in recent months. The two wounded, a man and woman, were taken to a hospital, prosecutors said. The Palmilla beach was evacuated following the incident. A tourist said: ""We heard the shots and just ran to get somewhere safe. It was automatic weapons fire."" The Mexican doctor rehydrating the dead A guide to Mexico's drug cartels In a separate development, a mass grave with the bodies of 14 people - 11 men and three women - was uncovered in a mountainous region of ValparaÃ­so, in the northern state of Zacatecas. Some of the bodies were dismembered, prosecutors said, adding that there could be more victims in the site. DNA tests will be carried out in the bodies to determine their identities. Experts say the latest violence may have been fuelled by the arrest of top drug cartel leaders, which has spawned independent criminal groups that have moved beyond drug trafficking into other crimes, including robbery and kidnapping.

"One of Scotland Yard's most senior police officers says criticism of the government's Prevent programme is based on ""ignorance"". It was set up to stop people being drawn into terrorist activities, but has been labelled ""toxic"" by critics. ""They don't understand properly how Prevent works,"" Cdr Dean Haydon told the BBC's Asian Network. He added that some criticism came from parts of the community that ""don't want Prevent to work in the first place"". The programme was set up by Labour in 2003 and its remit was widened by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition in 2011. Designed to support people at risk of joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities, it is focused on schools, faith organisations, prisons and other communities where people can be at risk of radicalisation. 'Prevent not just about Muslim community' Reality Check: Why Prevent divides opinion Baroness Warsi: Prevent should be paused Manchester bomber 'not known' to Prevent scheme But the Muslim Council of Britain has said young Muslims were being targeted, and a former senior Muslim policeman, Dal Babu, said Prevent had become a ""toxic brand"" because it was not trusted by communities. By Nomia Iqbal and Nalini Sivathasan, BBC Asian Network The head of the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command rarely gives interviews but ahead of a special programme from New Scotland Yard on Tuesday, Dean Haydon spoke to the BBC Asian Network about the challenges the force faces. ""If you were talking to me 12 months ago, I'd be talking about a different terrorist threat - the threat's shifted, it's changed,"" he says. For Cdr Haydon, the difficulty facing police now is individuals who have been acting alone and using everyday items such as knives and cars. ""Twelve months ago the plots we were preventing were those aimed at the police, the military and government officials. ""But the recent attacks were on the public, the community. They're indiscriminate."" Read more from the interview Cdr Haydon, however, told the Asian Network that the counter-terrorism programme was not about spying on people but about keeping them safe, claiming it had achieved ""fantastic"" results. ""Some of the criticisms come from sections of the community that, for a variety of different reasons, political or otherwise, just don't want Prevent to work in the first place,"" he said. ""Prevent is not just about the Muslim community. It goes across all communities."" He said a third of the cases related to domestic extremism and involved tackling the threat from right-wing extremists. ""I have seen the positive work of Prevent,"" he said, adding it had stopped people from being radicalised or going abroad. ""It's a fantastic tool and it's here to stay."" The government programme came under further scrutiny in the wake of the recent terror attacks in Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge - and was a talking point during the recent general election. Police cordon off an area near London Bridge station after the attack in June In May, the Green Party's Caroline Lucas told Andrew Marr: ""Many in the Muslim community believe it's been an attack on their group in particular."" The strategy is backed by senior police figures,with some calling it ""fundamental"" in the fight against terrorism. But in March this year, Home Secretary Amber Rudd admitted there needed to be more of an effort ""to sell it to communities... to show that this is a safeguarding initiative."" Government figures say 150 people were stopped from entering conflict zones in Iraq and Syria in 2015 because of the programme. In the interview with Asian Network, Cdr Haydon spoke of his concerns about people returning to the UK from Syria and Iraq. He said the ""default"" position was ""arrest and prosecution"".

"Mr Pence said the report was an attempt to divide the Trump administration US Vice-President Mike Pence has dismissed as ""disgraceful and offensive"" a report suggesting he is preparing a run for president in 2020.

"Tributes have been paid to Dame Helen Alexander, the first female president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), who has died aged 60.

Her career also included boardroom roles at Rolls-Royce, Centrica and Northern Foods.

Helen Alexander, then CBI president, speaking in 2011 She was also co-chair of the Hampton-Alexander review - a government commissioned review into increasing the number of women in senior business roles.
