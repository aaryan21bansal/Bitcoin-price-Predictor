"David Davis, who has quit as Brexit secretary, had one of the toughest jobs in politics - negotiating Britain's exit from the EU - and he also has one of the most colourful CVs. A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a self-styled political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics in July 2016 as secretary of state for exiting the EU. He took to the role of negotiating Brexit with characteristic swagger, brushing off accusations from critics that he was too lazy, or lacked the intellectual depth, for such an apparently complex and nuanced task. ""What's the requirement of my job? I don't have to be very clever. I don't have to know that much. I do just have to be calm,"" he told LBC radio. May meets Davis amid Brexit 'backstop' row Davis hits out at EU over Galileo Remain-backing MPs seize on Davis comment The Brexit secretary job might have been unexpected, but as a long-time opponent of Britain's EU membership it was an opportunity he grabbed with both hands. He proved more publicly loyal to Theresa May than fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson, earning the trust of the prime minister as her representative in Brussels, in what have turned out to be fraught talks with his opposite number, Michel Barnier. His former reputation as someone who likes to be the centre of the media's attention - he once dramatically walked out of David Cameron's shadow cabinet and called a by-election - lingers on. His appearances before Hilary Benn's Brexit select committee have become box-office moments at Westminster. On one occasion, Mr Benn tried to pin him down about comments he had made in July 2016 - two days before Mrs May drafted him into the cabinet - when he said the UK would be able negotiate a free-trade area ""massively larger than the EU"" within two years of Brexit. A laughing Mr Davis said the comments had been made before he had become a minister, later adding: ""That was then, this is now."" Some of his former allies on the libertarian left struggled to come to terms with the new, ministerial Mr Davis. Mr Davis and David Cameron rarely saw eye to eye Journalist Henry Porter, who often shared a platform with him at debates and campaign events,wrote in the Observer,external:  ""I came to like him a lot and to admire his bounce and pugnacity. ""Among all the politicians I knew - with the possible exception of [Remain-supporting Tory MP] Dominic Grieve - David possessed the deepest instinct for liberty."" But Brexit clearly mattered far more to Mr Davis than protecting ancient Parliamentary liberties, said Porter, as he lamented the changes he had seen in his friend since taking on ministerial office. ""While I would be happy to be in the jungle or stuck in a lift with him, I would draw the line at being stranded in a planning room with him,"" he said. Mr Davis launched an unexpected leadership bid in 2001 Date of birth:21 December, 1948 (69) Most recent post:Secretary of state for exiting the EU, MP for Haltemprice and Howden since 1987 Education:Tooting Bec grammar school, Warwick University (Bsc molecular science and computer science), London Business School, Harvard University management school Family:Married Doreen in 1973. Three children Before politics:Senior executive at sugar giant Tate and Lyle Initially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, David Davis was elected to Parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle. But Mr Davis did not fit the traditional mould of a Tory MP. Despite being a passionate opponent of socialism in all its forms, his political hero is the late Tony Benn, father of Hilary and hero of the radical, Corbynista left. He had a troubled background. ""I was a wild kid,"" hetold an audience at the Royal Festival Hall in 2002, where he shared the stage with Mr Benn, something, he said, that would have made his Labour-voting parents very proud. The two bonded over their shared Euroscepticism - but little else - at that event. He got into Warwick University on an army scholarship and trained with the SAS as a reservist to help pay his way. His military background, and fearless attitude, endeared him to Tory grandees such as the late Alan Clark, another of his heroes, as he began his rise through the party ranks in the early 1990s. Over dinner hosted by Clark at his medieval Saltwood Castle, in Kent, Mr Davis agreed to walk along the crumbling ramparts overlooking the ruins of a chapel. ""[He] did the 'black' route without turning a hair, then retraced his footsteps, hands in pockets - first time that's ever been done!"" Clark wrote in his diary. ""He is an extraordinarily optimistic and self-confident person,"" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell - a long time friend and ally -told the BBC's Newsnight programme's Nick Watt last year. ""I remember one of the Cameroons saying to me in exasperation that he was the only person he knows who did not go to Eton but has the same level of self-confidence you get from an Eton education."" Despite his Eurosceptic views, Mr Davis served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration. Mr Davis later admitted the use of T-shirts emblazoned with his 2005 leadership campaign slogan, ""It's DD for me,"" had backfired He later served as Mr Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he has since been charged with unpicking. His ""hard man"" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the frontrunner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005 (he had made an unexpected, and unsuccessful tilt at the job in 2001). He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms, even though the two men had little time for each other. In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge. He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May. He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data-retention plans - dubbed the ""snoopers' charter"" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet. Mr Davis will celebrate his 70th birthday in December, just over three months before Britain officially leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.

"David Davis' unhappiness has been not secret for some time After many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. Junior ministerial colleague Steve Baker has also quit alongside him from the Brexit department. David Davis' move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Some of Theresa May's colleagues had urged her to face down her Brexiteer ministers but Number 10 had hoped to keep them all on side, and a carefully designed strategy to move them to her position brokered an agreement in cabinet at the end of their day-long meeting at Chequers on Friday . Theresa May secured her cabinet's support at a meeting at Chequers on Friday But Mr Davis, who was meant to be responsible for Brexit policy, felt,  according to colleagues, that he was ""wondering if he really had a proper job"" after Number 10 chose to follow a very different path to the now former Brexit secretary's intention. Mr Davis has been frustrated for some time after the most senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU - Olly Robbins - was moved into Number 10 to work directly for Theresa May. To some former Remainers, Mr Davis' departure could even be considered a temporary relief. One of his fellow ministers remarked, ""it's just a personal outburst"", adding: ""He is not exactly the cleverest, he has always struggled to muscle into any of the complicated arguments."" But conditions in the Tory party are febrile. Theresa May had carefully constructed her cabinet with a balance of Brexiteers and former Remainers. With no majority, and unhappiness on the back benches, it adds instability at a time when the prime minister was pursuing calm. And when she was hoping to project an image to Brussels of authority and stability, it is a headache she could well do without. He could provide a rallying point from outside government for those forces in the Tory party who believe the Brexit plan the prime minister is pursuing is not the Brexit that a clear but narrow majority of the public chose. Michael Gove was tipped as a replacement for David Davis Westminster being Westminster, eyes will immediately turn to who will replace him. The most likely candidate it seems at this stage is Michael Gove who has pitched himself as the Brexiteer that ""remainers can do business with"". His public appearances defending the Brexit policy over the weekend make him certainly near the top of the list for one of the most important jobs in government.

"This video can not be played There were cheers and applause as the first boys' rescue was confirmed The operation to free 12 boys and their coach trapped in a cave in northern Thailand is running ""smoothly"", the head of the operation says. Four boys have been brought above ground so far in good health, rescuers say. The mission has now been paused for at least 10 hours as air tanks need to be replaced. Rescuers decided to go ahead with the hazardous operation on Sunday because of fears of rising waters. The next phase would begin on Monday morning, after relaying ""all of the air tanks and all systems along the way"", Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said. He corrected earlier reports that said six boys had been freed. Sunday's events as they happened How risky is the Thai boys rescue? Divers have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. They have reportedly been able to make the last part of the journey on foot. Rescuers took advantage of a break in the rain to launch the mission much earlier than originally expected. The first phase has also been conducted much faster than officials had predicted. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" The group and their families had all given their agreement that they should be moved as soon as possible, said Mr Narongsak. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. An ambulance arrives at a nearby hospital after leaving the cave site Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest section is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". BBC's Nick Beake at the scene This is a hugely high-profile rescue attempt and Thailand knows the world is watching. It has embarked on a dangerous option but believes it's the best for bringing the group out alive. It has assembled a team of internationally renowned divers and so far their expertise has brought four boys - thought to be the weakest - back to their families. But the relief of those mums and dads will be tempered by the knowledge that nine other families face an anxious wait for the turn of their loved ones to be shepherded through the narrow and murky corridors of the Tham Luang cave complex. As one diving expert put it to me, when underwater cave rescues go wrong they go wrong in a big way. So despite this promising start, there is a sense of unease here in Chiang Mai. But the overriding impression from the rescuers is a clear focus and unshakable resolve to finish the job.

Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths. Officials had originally thought the group might have to stay where they were until the rainy season ended - and that could have meant months underground. They had also been exploring whether they could drill down into the cave, as well as scouring the mountainside for another way in. But with the rainy season just beginning, it has become clear that the flooding which originally trapped the boys will only get worse in the coming days.

"The couple touched a contaminated item with their hands but police have not identified the source Police have launched a murder inquiry after a woman exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Wiltshire died. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in hospital on Sunday evening after falling ill on 30 June. Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent in Amesbury, remains critically ill in hospital. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident - but said accusations that it was involved are ""absurd"". The UK government previously blamed Russia for the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with Novichok in Salisbury in March. Russian authorities denied any involvement in the poisoning. Investigators say the possibility that the two cases are linked is a ""clear line of inquiry"". Theresa May said she was ""appalled and shocked"" by the death of mother of three Ms Sturgess, from Durrington. Home Secretary Sajid Javid will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra later today. A post-mortem examination of Ms Sturgess is due to take place and her family has been informed, police said. What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? The investigation is being led by detectives from the Counter-Terrorism Policing Network and about 100 detectives are working on the case alongside Wiltshire Police. Officers are still trying to work out how Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were exposed to the nerve agent - although tests have confirmed they touched a contaminated item with their hands. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of UK Counter-Terrorism policing, said: ""This is shocking and tragic news. Dawn leaves behind her family, including three children, and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this extremely difficult time. ""The 45-year-old man who fell ill with Dawn remains critically ill in hospital and our thoughts are with him and his family as well."" Mr Basu said the death ""has only served to strengthen our resolve to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible for what I can only describe as an outrageous, reckless and barbaric act"". He said: ""Detectives will continue with their painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence so that we can understand how two citizens came to be exposed with such a deadly substance that tragically cost Dawn her life."" This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Dr Christine Blanshard, medical director at Salisbury District Hospital, where Ms Sturgess died, said it was ""desperately sad"" and she expressed condolences to her family. She said: ""The staff here at Salisbury District Hospital worked tirelessly to save Dawn. Our staff are talented, dedicated and professional and I know today they will be hurting too. ""They did everything they could."" Mr Rowley is also being treated at the hospital. A police officer who was tested for Novichok poisoning wasgiven the all clear. Mrs May sent her ""thoughts and condolences"" and said officials were ""working urgently to establish the facts"". She said: ""The government is committed to providing full support to the local community as it deals with this tragedy."" British diplomat Julian King, the European Commissioner responsible for the EU's security union, said: ""Those behind this are murderers."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This desperately sad news only strengthens our resolve to find out exactly what has happened."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""shocked"", adding: ""A full and thorough police investigation must now establish the facts, provide support to the local community and bring those responsible to justice."" The couple collapsed at a flat on Muggleton Road in Amesbury on 30 June Public Health England said the risk to the general public ""remains low"". Professor Paul Cosford said: ""As a precaution we still advise the public not to pick up any strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers."" He also said people in five locations between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 June should continue to follow advice, namely: ""Wash your clothes in a washing machine and to keep your items double-bagged and securely fastened, if they are dry-clean only."" Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Baroness Scott, the leader of Wiltshire Council, said the residents of John Baker House - the hostel where Ms Sturgess lives - have been rehoused and are being given support. Angus Macpherson, Wiltshire police and crime commissioner, said he was ""horrified and appalled"". He said: ""Ms Sturgess was an innocent member of the public who should have been able to go about her daily life without becoming an unwilling victim in such an unprecedented, international, incident."" By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The working hypothesis is that the pair became contaminated after touching a poison container left over from the March attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The death of Dawn Sturgess, a British citizen on British soil, now changes the investigation to a murder inquiry, with all the diplomatic and security ramifications that carries. Britain has been blaming Moscow for the original attack in March, saying there is no plausible alternative to the Kremlin having ordered the assassination attempt. Russia has denied any involvement, suggesting instead this was the action of a weak British government looking to undermine the success of the current World Cup being hosted by Russia. The next few days are likely to see further accusations and counter-accusations. The poisoning of the Skripals, both of whom spent weeks in hospital before being discharged, was blamed by the UK government on Russia. Russian authorities denied any involvement. Mr Skripal, 66,is a Russian former double agent.He was accused by Russia of spying for Britain's MI6 and jailed in 2006. He was later pardoned and allowed to settle in the UK. After the hospitalisation of Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley, Mr Javid accused the Russian state of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"". The Russian Embassy hit back, accusing the government of trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""frighten its own citizens"". Yulia Skripal and her father Sergei were exposed to Novichok in Salisbury in March Russian media has suggested alternative explanations of what happened in Amesbury, including claims the UK government staged it because it is finding the World Cup ""hard to swallow"" or to disrupt the Russia-US summit on 16 July. According to BBC Monitoring, other theories in the media include the claim that Porton Down or a former employee of the research lab are to blame, or the Amesbury couple poisoned themselves. In a statement, the Met Police said the possibility the poisoning of the Skripals and Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley are linked is a ""clear line of inquiry"". A spokesman said the investigators are ""not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to"". He also said: ""There is no evidence that (Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley) visited any of the sites that were decontaminated following the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March.""

"This video can not be played 'Be generous or we'll walk away' - Gove's warning to EU Michael Gove has urged Tory MPs to back a compromise Brexit plan as the best chance of a ""proper"" exit from the EU. He told the BBC it was not all he hoped for, but said he was a ""realist"" and dismissed claims it would leave the UK as a ""vassal state"". But he warned the EU had to be more generous or the UK would have no option than to walk away without a deal. Labour also urged the EU to be more flexible but said Theresa May's customs plan was a ""fudge"" and would ""unravel"". In the Commons on Monday, Theresa May will tell MPs her plan will mean ""a complete end to freedom of movement"", restore the ""supremacy of the British courts"" and ensure no more ""vast sums of money"" would be sent to Brussels. She is expected to say that since the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU, ""I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit"". Several Tory MPs have expressed unease since Friday, when the cabinet approved a document setting out the UK's vision for its future relationship with the EU after it leaves in March 2019. Under the proposals, yet to be presented to the EU, there would be a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods, based on a ""common rule book"" and a ""combined customs territory"". Laura Kuenssberg: Tory tensions on Europe still profound Johnson criticised May's Brexit plan At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Boris Johnson is understood to have strongly criticised the plan during the cabinet meeting at Chequers before signing up to it. He is said to have warned colleagues it could be a ""serious inhibitor to free trade"" and striking deals with other countries. The foreign secretary then backed the proposals - despite claiming that defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"". Boris Johnson has signed up to the plan but made his misgivings known But environment secretary Mr Gove, who campaigned for Brexit alongside Mr Johnson in the 2016 referendum, told the BBC's Andrew Marr show he was satisfied the solution would ""honour"" the result of the vote. The free movement of people was ending, he said, and the UK Parliament would have the final say over rules governing a ""huge swathe"" of the British economy. ""In all the important areas where an independent country chooses to exercise sovereignty, the UK will be able to do so and, in so doing, respect the referendum result and the mandate we were given,"" he said. Asked if Mrs May's offer was all he had hoped for, he replied: ""No, but then I'm a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn't, you shouldn't, make the perfect the enemy of the good."" While urging his colleagues to get behind the prime minister as she tries to secure a deal by October, he said the UK must be prepared for this not happening. ""We are being generous to the EU, we are showing flexibility,"" he said. ""If the EU is not generous and flexible, we may have to contemplate walking away without a deal. ""No-one wants to walk away now because we are in the middle of a negotiation - what we need to be able to do is to walk away in March 2019."" This video can not be played MP says the Cabinet needs to learn from England and pull together as a team. After ministers signed up to the deal on Friday night, Mrs May said the time for them to air their concerns in public was over and collective cabinet responsibility had been re-instated - a stance endorsed by Mr Gove. The prime minister has urged the EU to take her offer seriously. She refused to rule out offering EU citizens some form of special status as part of a proposed new ""mobility framework"". Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon But Tory Brexiteers not in the government have spoken out against the plan, warning the UK will have to follow EU laws and European Court of Justice rulings and not have an ""effective international trade policy"". Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said the proposed deal was ""indefensible"" as it was ""probably worse than staying in the EU"". He suggested his support for the prime minister was not unconditional. ""At the moment, she's not only let the party down, she's let herself down,"" he told the BBC. ""If she sticks with this deal, I have no confidence in it. If she sticks with this, I will have no confidence in her."" And pro-Remain Tory MP Phillip Lee has suggested the offer was the ""worst of all worlds"" and restated his call for a second referendum - with the option of staying in the EU to be on the ballot paper. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said proposals to avoid customs checks by differentiating between UK and EU-bound goods, in terms of what tariffs should be paid, were ""a bureaucratic nightmare"". ""This has got fudge written all over it,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""She (Theresa May) has not met our demands. It is going to unravel and she will have to think again."" He urged Mrs May to put her customs proposals to a vote in Parliament in a week's time, suggesting Labour's alternative plan for a comprehensive customs union had the backing of the majority of MPs. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""game on"" for the SNP and others who wanted the UK to remain in the existing customs union and single market. Allow Twitter content?

"Brazil's ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, better known as Lula, is to remain in prison after a day of legal wrangling. On Sunday, an on-call judge ruled that Lula should be released, but Judge Joao Pedro Gerbran Neto rejected this. Eduardo Thompson Flores, the head of the federal court that convicted Lula, has now stepped in and said that there is no legal basis for his release. Lula says he is innocent and the case is politically motivated. His conviction was part of an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has implicated top politicians from several parties. The initial announcement by Rogerio Favreto - the weekend duty judge - came after members of Lula's Workers Party challenged his jailing in an application on Friday. Mr Favreto had said the politician should be freed from jail while he appeals a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering. ""With all due respect, [Mr Favreto] has absolutely no qualified authority to override the decision,"" responded Federal Judge Sergio Moro, who has been the driving force behind Operation Car Wash. He told police to wait for clarification on the legal impasse. Judge Joao Pedro Gerbran Neto then overruled the decision, ordering police and jail authorities not to take any action. Mr Faverto then raised his order for the third time, but the one-hour deadline he imposed on police passed without any move being made to free the ex-president. The head of the court's intervention means that Lula will remain in prison. Read more about Lula A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula, who led the country from January 2003 to December 2010, is a divisive figure. Thousands of people took to the streets earlier this year to call for his immediate imprisonment, while his supporters also turned out in large numbers to insist he should be freed. His jailing was controversial as defendants in Brazil were previously allowed to remain free until their final appeal had been exhausted. However, the Supreme Court sided with a 2016 ruling from a lower court, under which defendants could be sent to jail after a failed first appeal. Polls conducted before Lula was jailed in April suggested he was the frontrunner for October's presidential elections. Many political analysts say he will be disqualified from standing again because of his criminal conviction. But this did not stop his supporters launching a campaign with an event last month. Judge Faverto cited this as a reason for him to be released, saying it counted as a new development and all candidates should be free in order to protect ""the democratic process"". However, others disputed this, saying Lula's intention to run was long known and nothing had changed to provoke a sudden change in his status. Lula's supporters held an event in June to launch his pre-nomination campaign The electoral court will make an official decision in August on whether Lula can run. In 2014, after Lula left office, prosecutors started investigating allegations that executives at the state oil company Petrobras had accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m; Â£790,000) as a bribe by engineering firm OAS. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula lost his first appeal in January, when the appeals court not only upheld his conviction but increased the sentence from nine-and-a-half years to 12.

"The parade started off from Portland Place in central London on Saturday Pride in London organisers have apologised after anti-trans protesters ""forced their way to the front of the parade"". Members of lesbian and feminist group Get The L Out demanded to march behind the rainbow flag, which marks the start of the event, organisers said. The group argues the trans movement is attacking lesbian rights and said it protested to protect those rights. Pride said their behaviour on Saturday was ""shocking and disgusting"". It said they could not forcibly remove the small group because their protest was not a criminal offence, adding ""we are sorry"" but the ""actions of eight people did not stop the joy and love"". Its statement said: ""The protest group showed a level of bigotry, ignorance and hate that is unacceptable.,externalWe reject what this group stands for. They do not share our values, which are about inclusion and respect and support for the most marginalised parts of our community. ""We are proud of our trans volunteers, proud of the trans groups that are in our parade, proud of our trans speakers at events and proud of the trans people who take part in our campaigns and proud of those who cheered even louder for them yesterday."" Pride values are about inclusion and respect, organisers said The parade, which coincided with England's World Cup quarter-final in Russia,included about 30,000 people from 472 organisations. Up to one million other people are thought to have lined the streets to watch the event. The activists stole the place of the NHS, TransPALS said Patricia Curtis, of TransPals said: ""It's disappointing that anti-trans activists decided to hijack the front of a parade, an insult to all the hardworking staff in the NHS whose place they stole. ""But their vile stunt failed. London is a place that doesn't tolerate hate."" Pride said this year's parade was the most diverse A Get The L Out spokeswoman said: ""We protested to protect our rights and on behalf of all the lesbians intimidated, threatened and silenced by the GBT community everywhere. ""The GBT community today, by supporting the rights of males who ""identify as lesbians"" (also called ""transwomen"") over the rights of lesbians to choose their sexual partners (on the basis of their sex, not how they ""identify"") is in fact enforcing heterosexuality on lesbians. ""This is a misogynistic and anti-lesbian manifestation of the rape culture we live in.""

"BP fuel stations across the UK are now able to accept card payments after a glitch which lasted over three hours. BP had said earlier its stations were only able to accept cash and that it was directing customers to its ATMs. The oil giant said all its sites had now returned to normal service, and it was launching ""a full investigation"" into what had caused the problem. ""We will monitor the situation overnight to ensure the smooth running of our operations,"" it said. BP earlier said the issue had caused ""a handful"" of stations to close. The company said it did not know what had caused the issue. A BP spokesperson said the problem had started around 19:00. ""We would like to thank our customers for their patience and again apologise for any inconvenience caused during the brief outage,"" they added. BP has 1,280 BP stations across the UK. Highways England had earlier tweeted that all motorway service areas with BP fuel stations were affected by the problem. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Adam Johnston, who works at Spital BP station in Bebington, Wirall, said the card payment problem had been ""an absolute nightmare"" with ""queues out the door and people struggling to get onto the forecourt"". The station had to fill out 10 forms where people were unable or unwilling to use the ATM, which required them to return and pay within seven days, he said. He said the station was typically busier than normal BP fuel stations because it was also an M&S franchise. ""Most customers are sympathetic but some not so much resulting in arguments and a lot of stress,"" he added. Heather Brogan, a customer at a BP fuel station in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, was also affected. She had gone to buy ""a handful of items"" from the shop and used the onsite ATM to pay the Â£20 required. "" It's only a small town. People were absolutely fine about it,"" she said.

"Home secretary Sajid Javid met people in Salisbury and Amesbury to reassure them Sajid Javid has said there are ""no current plans"" to impose fresh sanctions on Russia over the latest nerve agent poisonings in Wiltshire. He repeated the government's assessment that Russia was the source of the poison but said he would not ""jump to conclusions"". The home secretary was speaking during a visit to Amesbury, where two people remain critically ill in hospital. Their symptoms were the same as those of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Mr Skripal, a Russian former spy, and his daughter werepoisoned with Novichok in March. Amesbury Novichok poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? Are you in the area? Do you have any information to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. It was Mr Javid's first visit as home secretary to Salisbury and Amesbury, whereDawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell illa week ago. Police believe the couple handled an item contaminated with the nerve agent Novichok. Mr Javid praised emergency personnel for their work ""What our expert scientists have determined is that the nerve agent in this incident is the same exact nerve agent that was used back in March,"" he said. ""We know back in March that was the Russians. We know it was a barbaric, inhuman act by the Russian state."" Russia has denied any involvement. Mr Javid added: ""Again for this particular incident we need to learn more and let the police do their work."" He met local people and business owners during his visit, and also praised emergency services for their response to the poisonings. The home secretary said ""the risk to the public remains low"", adding that he was ""very confident"" police would uncover the source of the poison. The nerve agent Novichok is highly toxic He said the area remains ""open for business"" and urged people to show their support and visit. The police's ""working hypothesis"" is that the Amesbury poisoning and the Salisbury incident are linked, but Mr Javid called for the police to be given ""time and space"" to work. ""What I am very confident of, with the amount of police work that's going on here - the support both from Wiltshire Police but also more than 100 officers from the counter-terrorism network involved as well - that they will eventually, one way or the other, get to the bottom of this,"" he said. He rejected suggestions that the government had been too quick to insist Salisbury was safe after the attack on the Skripals in March.

"US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will be in the UK for two days Donald Trump's visit to the UK in the next week will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces, the Police Federation has warned. The US president will spend time in London, Windsor and Scotland during the two-day working visit. Thousands are expected to protest and police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist. The Home Office said other forces can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". Trump to visit Windsor and Chequers on UK trip Trump's Scotland visit confirmed Treasury to cover policing cost of Trump visit Forces assist one another outside their regions when dealing with major incidents and emergencies, under the so-called ""mutual aid"" agreement. Mr Trump's visit will see thousands of officers deployed from their home forces, said Simon Kempton, from the Police Federation of England and Wales. ""The fact cannot be ignored that while the officers on mutual aid are deployed elsewhere thousands more of their colleagues left behind in their home force will be expected to pick up the slack, leaving them even more stretched,"" he said. ""There was a time when we could do it all but now choices have to be made - we cannot do it all and this type of event puts a service which is already creaking at its knees under unquestionable pressure."" Protesters plan to fly a Trump baby balloon over Parliament Square in London during the visit Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, before spending the night at Winfield House in London. On Friday, the president will travel to Chequers in Buckinghamshire for bilateral talks with Theresa May. In the afternoon, he will meet the Queen in Windsor and then fly to Scotland, where the couple plan to spend the weekend. Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday and marches are also planned for Scotland, where Mr Trump owns golf courses. The Treasury has confirmed it willfund policing costsof up to Â£5m in Scotland. With officers sent in to help, local policing was being reduced to a ""reactive service"", Mr Kempton said, with additional strain due to the World Cup and the Novichok poisonings in Amesbury. ""You have to ask what would happen if we're unable to resource incidents like these,"" Mr Kempton added. ""Would we see the situation where the military were drafted in place of police officers? Green uniforms instead of the blue ones people would - and should - expect to see? It's a worrying prospect."" The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services.""

""We would like to thank our customers for their patience and again apologise for any inconvenience caused during the brief outage,"" they added. BP has 1,280 BP stations across the UK. Highways England had earlier tweeted that all motorway service areas with BP fuel stations were affected by the problem. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Adam Johnston, who works at Spital BP station in Bebington, Wirall, said the card payment problem had been ""an absolute nightmare"" with ""queues out the door and people struggling to get onto the forecourt"". The station had to fill out 10 forms where people were unable or unwilling to use the ATM, which required them to return and pay within seven days, he said. He said the station was typically busier than normal BP fuel stations because it was also an M&S franchise. ""Most customers are sympathetic but some not so much resulting in arguments and a lot of stress,"" he added. Heather Brogan, a customer at a BP fuel station in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, was also affected. She had gone to buy ""a handful of items"" from the shop and used the onsite ATM to pay the Â£20 required. "" It's only a small town. People were absolutely fine about it,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Rohit century leads India to T20 series win over England Third Twenty20 international, Bristol: England 198-8 (20 overs):Roy 67, Pandya 4-38 India 201-3 (18.4 overs):Rohit 100*, Kohli 43 India won by seven wickets; won series 2-1 Scorecard Rohit Sharma made a stunning 100 not out to help India beat England by seven wickets in the third Twenty20 and secure a 2-1 series victory. England, batting first, could manage only 87 runs from the final 10 overs to post 198-8 in Bristol, despite Jason Roy's 67 from 31 balls. Rohit shared an 89-run stand with Virat Kohli and accelerated in the final overs to put India in control. He and Hardik Pandya closed out the match with eight balls to spare. It was the highest successful run chase by any team against England in an international T20. Three terrific catches - one from Jake Ball and two by Chris Jordan - interrupted India's chase. However, Pandya took 20 runs from the 18th over - bowled by Ball - to put India ahead of the run-rate and turn the match firmly in their favour. A lofted drive from Pandya, who made an unbeaten 33 from 14 balls, secured an impressive victory from India in front of a packed crowd. A three-match one-day series starts on Thursday at Trent Bridge, before the first of five Tests gets under way on 1 August. England v India - fixtures & results Listen to the Test Match Special podcast England's leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson remarked that it was ""not a day to be a bowler"" as both sides made hay on a good pitch with short boundaries. The bowlers had their moments, certainly. Seven wickets went down in the final 10 overs of England's innings and Ben Stokes - returning to the side after a hamstring injury in place of Joe Root - bowled smartly to restrict India at the start of their reply. Some terrific displays of athleticism in the field, such as Jordan's stunning run and catch to dismiss KL Rahul, momentarily tipped things back in the favour of the fielding side too. But on a pitch where anything that was too short or full could be flayed to the boundary, it rarely felt as though it was an even contest between bat and ball. This video can not be played 'Take a bow!' - Chris Jordan takes incredible diving catch India rarely looked troubled in their run-chase, despite losing Shikhar Dhawan early to a superb, low catch from Ball at short fine leg. Any hopes England had of applying pressure were snuffed out by Rahul, who arrived at the crease and drove his first delivery to the boundary. Only moments of brilliance from England kept India in check. Rahul pounced on Ball, striking him for a straight six, but when he tried to repeat the shot, Jordan sprinted to his right at long-on to take a diving catch that left the batsman shaking his head. But India's strength in depth meant the runs just kept coming. Kohli and Rohit's partnership mixed patience and aggression, the two seeing off sole spinner Adil Rashid before hitting the pace bowlers to all sides of the ground. Kohli was left in disbelief when he drove a delivery straight back to Jordan, who took a catch at waist height, but Pandya picked up where the captain had left off. England captain Eoin Morgan shuffled his bowlers but saw David Willey hoisted over long-off for six by Rohit, before Pandya angled the same bowler for back-to-back fours in the 18th over. A dab to backward point brought Rohit his third T20 century, before Pandya hammered a Jordan delivery back over his head to close out the win in emphatic style. Jason Roy and Jos Buttler got England off to a blistering start England will feel they missed their opportunity with the bat after Roy and Jos Buttler got off to a blistering start by adding 94 inside eight overs. A six brought up Roy's half-century from 23 balls - the joint second quickest for England in T20s - and the hosts looked set for a total in excess of 200. However, India slowly brought themselves back into the match. Buttler was bowled heaving at Kaul Siddarth, while Roy edged a slower ball from debutant Deepak Chahar. Credit has to be given to India's bowlers, who recovered well from a chastening start. Pandya mixed up his pace and length to finish with 4-38, having Stokes caught at mid-off for 14 and enticing Bairstow, on 25, to edge behind. Dhoni, who took became the first player to take five catches in a T20 international, removed his glove before the final ball of the innings, making it easier for him to run out Jordan as he tried to pinch a bye. England captain Eoin Morgan on BBC Test Match Special:""We failed to execute big shots and it didn't come off. The execution wasn't up to scratch. Capitalising on starts like is something we have to learn from. ""That total isn't defendable when a guy comes out and plays like that on a small ground. India played better than us."" India skipper Virat Kohli: ""The comeback from the bowlers was outstanding. At one point we thought they would get 225-230. The character we showed is something we're very proud of. ""It was a brutal day for the bowlers. The guys produced the goods for us. We had to make the batsmen feel like they would make mistakes. We applied pressure and pulled the game back nicely."" India batsman and man of the series Rohit Sharma:""I like to be calm, not to panic, because I know once you're there you can make up time. With the wicket being so good, I knew I just needed to stay there as long as possible.""

"Some residents spoke of the speed at which the water rose Residents have described a torrent of water gushing into the air and flooding homes when one of Birmingham's ""largest"" mains in the city burst. About 100 properties were affected after a major water main burst on Wheeler Street in the Newtown area on Saturday. Many people had to be rescued by boat and roads were left badly damaged, with huge craters visible. An investigation is set to begin into what caused the pipe to burst. Engineers worked through the night to repair what Severn Trent described as ""one of the largest"" mains in the city. Local residents told the BBC they first heard the burst main at about 07:00 and later, at its height, water almost reached their waists. ""I heard the rush of the water and thought it was rain, but then thought 'how could it be rain?',"" Hubert Henry said. ""It was gushing into the air about six or seven foot. I couldn't believe how quickly it was rising. I thought this is getting serious."" This video can not be played Birmingham burst water main leaves homes cut off After waking up his grandchildren, Mr Henry said he looked out of the window and discovered his whole house was surrounded. ""It started creeping under the door and then I just heard a big gush,"" he said. Getting out of the house was a struggle with the weight of water at the door, he added. ""I chucked my grandchildren on the trampoline and chucked my dog on the trampoline. Then I made like a bridge from the trampoline to the neighbour's fence. ""Bricks were being carried down the road and all sorts."" Water supplies were restored by Saturday night. A new section of pipe has been put in the ground and engineers are hoping to connect it later. The broken section has been removed and engineers will analyse it to discover what caused the burst. Repairs to the main are expected to completed soon but it will take considerably longer repair the road, the water firm said. Wheeler Street is expected to stay closed until Thursday at the earliest, Severn Trent said. Mr Henry said engineers had worked ""tirelessly"" to repair the pipe, but the road was in a terrible state. He said he had noticed the road had seemed to have ""sunk"" in an area near to where the burst appeared when driving down it last week. The pipe, described as one of the biggest in Birmingham, is 30in in diameter (76cm) Wheeler Street is expected to remain shut for the foreseeable future Marc Hudson, from West Midlands Fire Service, said the priority soon after the flooding had been to move people out of their homes or make sure they could get on to the first floor. Mr Henry's family was put up in a nearby Premier Inn, but it's not clear what will happen tonight. He said carpets, furniture and paintwork in his home had been badly soaked and it would be some time until ground-floor rooms dried out. Nobody is thought to have been injured, including several disabled people living on the streets rescued by firefighters.

Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent Over the past week we have called
in to chat to Nopparat Kanthawong, the head coach of the Wild Boars football
team, and usually found him talking tensely on the phone to parents of the
boys. He went over and over the events of the day the boys went into the caves
with his assistant after football practice. He says he had no idea they were
going. Tonight there was an entirely
different atmosphere in the house, just below the mountains where the men who
run the Wild Boars meet. They laughed, shouted cheers and shook hands in a very
un-Thai way. And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost
speechless. ""I donât know what to say â I just want to see them, and hug them,"" he told me. I was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford
next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little
disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool
fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. ""Is this for real?"" they
asked. Getting them to UK from this
far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol,
who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a
fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they
just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave. They will probably make it to
Manchester Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The young footballers had been invited by Fifa to attend the World Cup Final in Moscow on Sunday. But their attendance was always a long shot, given the health risks they face after spending more than two weeks in a pitch-dark cave. Fifa has just told the BBC that the boys will not be making the match. Here's what they said: FIFA would like to express its great joy at the news of the rescue of the 12 young footballers and their coach. We would like to convey our profound gratitude to all persons involved in the rescue operation, which unfortunately took the life of one of the divers. Our thoughts are with his family. We have been informed by the Football Association of Thailand that due to medical reasons, the boys will not be in a position to travel to Moscow for the FIFA World Cup final. FIFA's priority remains the health of everyone involved in the operation and we will look into finding a new opportunity to invite the boys to a FIFA event to share with them a moment of communion and celebration. We can also confirm that a meeting with the Football Association of Thailand is scheduled to take place in Moscow around the FIFA World Cup final. The BBC's Nick Beake is at the hospital where the boys are being treated: This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission
Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the
final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldnât believe
it, others claimed they never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.
Scores of reporters rushed to their live positions to bring the news to
their audiences at home. Japanese and Brazilian networks were either side of
us. Up on the 8th floor, the doctors who declared this morning that the
first eight boys to be rescued are doing well will now be examining their remaining
teammates and their coach. Psychologists will be being assessing the impact a
fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the
Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of
a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. An ambulance leaves the Tham Luang cave on Tuesday Petty Officer Saman Gunan, a former Thai navy diver in his late thirties, died on 6 July while helping to re-supply the cave with new air tanks. He ran out oxygen and lost consciousness. BBC Thai spoke to his family after his death. ""I really loved him,"" his wife  Waleeporn Gunan  said.

"The crime scene in Wood White Drive in Aylesbury has been taped off by police A woman has been stabbed to death in an attack which also left a 14-year-old boy in hospital. Police were called to reports of an assault in Wood White Drive, Aylesbury, at about 15:45 BST on Saturday. The victim, 54, died at the scene while the boy was taken to hospital with ""non-life threatening"" injuries, Thames Valley Police said. A man, 32, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and was being held for questioning. Floral tributes to the victim have been left outside the house Police believe it was an isolated incident Det Supt Ian Hunter, head of the major crime unit, said he wanted to ""reassure people that we believe it to be an isolated incident"". He said: ""We currently have a number of police officers at the scene carrying out inquiries and I would encourage anyone with any questions to feel free to approach them."" He also urged any witnesses or anyone with information to contact the police. Members of the public have left flowers outside the three-storey house on the Buckinghamshire Park Estate. Its front door has been sealed off and a police car was stationed outside on Sunday. The force said the victim's next-of-kin have been informed and were being supported by specially-trained officers.

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Sweden 0-2 England highlights England have reached the World Cup semi-final for only the third time in their history - but many of their stars in Russia have had unusual paths to the top. Gone are the academy-raised, household names of the 'Golden Generation' and in their place is a squad featuring players who have plied their trade at the likes of Darlington, Alfreton, Halifax, Welling and Aldershot. Three, in particular, impressed in the 2-0 quarter-final win against Sweden on Saturday. Harry Maguire scored the first goal, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was named man of the match and Kieran Trippier was outstanding again. Those three - not even in the squad when qualifying began and all uncapped in competitive games until October - topped yourplayer ratingsfor the win in Samara. Here, we look at their remarkable rise. Round-up of reaction to England victory 'It's coming home' - pundits on England win Reaching semi-finals 'incredible feeling' for Southgate Some of the clubs that England's World Cup squad have played for Darlington, Alfreton, Burton, Carlisle, Bradford, Coventry, Barnsley, Stocksbridge Park Steels, Halifax, Fleetwood, Peterborough, Bristol City, Leyton Orient Millwall, Harrow, Welling, Aldershot Age:27Position:Right-backCaps:11 Kieran Trippier only made his England debut as a 26-year-old Right-back Trippier only made his Premier League debut at the age of 23 and did not make his England bow until June last year - in a friendly defeat by France. He came through the Manchester City academy but never broke into their first team. After two spells at Barnsley and one at Burnley - all in the Championship - he joined the Clarets for a reported Â£450,000 in January 2012. After 185 appearances for the Clarets he moved to Tottenham for Â£3.5m in 2015 - but only made six Premier League appearances in his first campaign and 12 in his second. He benefited from now England team-mate Kyle Walker's move to Manchester City last summer, but even then only started 21 league games in 2017-18 as he battled with Serge Aurier for a place in the team. A major beneficiary of Gareth Southgate's decision to play 3-5-2 and move Walker to the centre,'the Bury Beckham'has excelled in Russia in a right wing-back role, setting up 13 chances and scoring in the shootout against Colombia. On comparisons with the England great's crossing, he said: ""Loads of people have been saying that but I'm nowhere near Beckham's qualities. All I can do is keep doing the best I can and every opportunity I get I'll try to put balls in like David Beckham."" Age:25Position:Centre-backCaps:10 Harry Maguire's rise is best demonstrated by the fact he was at Euro 2016 as a fan - at which stage he had made a total of three Premier League appearances. Asked recently by BBC Radio 5 live if he could see himself playing for England at that stage, he replied: ""Definitely not. Hull went up through the play-offs but I wasn't a regular. If I thought I'd be in this position I'd be dreaming."" Maguire went to Saint-Etienne with his friends and two brothers to watch England draw 0-0 against Slovakia at Euro 2016 Maguire came through the youth set-up at his hometown club Sheffield United, playing in League One until 2013-14. He joined Hull that summer but after 91 minutes of Premier League action, he went on loan to Wigan. He did end up breaking into the Tigers team and after a season in the Premier League earned himself aÂ£17m move to Leicester last summer,with then-manager Craig Shakespeare suggesting he could be a ""future England captain"". He was an ever present for the Foxes in the league, and says playing against England team-mate Jamie Vardy in training made him a better player. He only made his England debut in the final World Cup qualifier against Lithuania in October - the same game in which Trippier made his competitive debut. With his header against Sweden, Maguire became the first player to score their first England goal in a World Cup knockout match since Rio Ferdinand in 2002 against Denmark. Maguire told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It's a remarkable rise I have had over the last year or two. At the moment I'm in a bubble and maybe I'll realise my achievement over time."" BBC One pundit Ferdinand said: ""In both boxes Harry Maguire was immense. He was a man-mountain but with the ball at his feet he is graceful as well. He is indispensable to this team at the moment.""

I wasn't born in 1990, so I will take that' - Pickford It seems strange to put the third most expensive goalkeeper of all time on a list of unlikely heroes - but Pickford has only had two full seasons in the Premier League, one of which ended in relegation. The 24-year-old has, however, already played in the top five divisions of English football. Pickford started his career with local club Sunderland but had loan spells in the Conference with Darlington and Alfreton, Burton in League Two, Carlisle and Bradford in League One and Preston in the Championship before breaking into the Black Cats team. After 35 appearances for Sunderland - where he kept only five clean sheets behind a shambolic defence -Everton paid up to Â£30mto sign him last summer. He impressed for the Toffees, despite their disappointing season, and made his England debut in November, keeping a clean sheet against Germany in a friendly.

BBC One co-commentator Martin Keown said it was ""the game of his life"". Former Germany striker Jurgen Klinsmann said: ""What really impressed me was Jordan Pickford's overall game and his distribution. His body language was always positive. You had the feeling he commanded his box."" Pickford is the youngest England goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup match at 24 years and 122 days.

"Brazil's ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, better known as Lula, is to remain in prison after a day of legal wrangling. On Sunday, an on-call judge ruled that Lula should be released, but Judge Joao Pedro Gerbran Neto rejected this. Eduardo Thompson Flores, the head of the federal court that convicted Lula, has now stepped in and said that there is no legal basis for his release. Lula says he is innocent and the case is politically motivated. His conviction was part of an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has implicated top politicians from several parties. The initial announcement by Rogerio Favreto - the weekend duty judge - came after members of Lula's Workers Party challenged his jailing in an application on Friday. Mr Favreto had said the politician should be freed from jail while he appeals a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering. ""With all due respect, [Mr Favreto] has absolutely no qualified authority to override the decision,"" responded Federal Judge Sergio Moro, who has been the driving force behind Operation Car Wash. He told police to wait for clarification on the legal impasse. Judge Joao Pedro Gerbran Neto then overruled the decision, ordering police and jail authorities not to take any action. Mr Faverto then raised his order for the third time, but the one-hour deadline he imposed on police passed without any move being made to free the ex-president. The head of the court's intervention means that Lula will remain in prison. Read more about Lula A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula, who led the country from January 2003 to December 2010, is a divisive figure. Thousands of people took to the streets earlier this year to call for his immediate imprisonment, while his supporters also turned out in large numbers to insist he should be freed. His jailing was controversial as defendants in Brazil were previously allowed to remain free until their final appeal had been exhausted. However, the Supreme Court sided with a 2016 ruling from a lower court, under which defendants could be sent to jail after a failed first appeal. Polls conducted before Lula was jailed in April suggested he was the frontrunner for October's presidential elections. Many political analysts say he will be disqualified from standing again because of his criminal conviction. But this did not stop his supporters launching a campaign with an event last month. Judge Faverto cited this as a reason for him to be released, saying it counted as a new development and all candidates should be free in order to protect ""the democratic process"". However, others disputed this, saying Lula's intention to run was long known and nothing had changed to provoke a sudden change in his status. Lula's supporters held an event in June to launch his pre-nomination campaign The electoral court will make an official decision in August on whether Lula can run. In 2014, after Lula left office, prosecutors started investigating allegations that executives at the state oil company Petrobras had accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m; Â£790,000) as a bribe by engineering firm OAS. The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Lula lost his first appeal in January, when the appeals court not only upheld his conviction but increased the sentence from nine-and-a-half years to 12.

Four boys have been brought above ground so far in good health, rescuers say. The mission has now been paused for at least 10 hours as air tanks need to be replaced. Rescuers decided to go ahead with the hazardous operation on Sunday because of fears of rising waters. The next phase would begin on Monday morning, after relaying ""all of the air tanks and all systems along the way"", Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said. He corrected earlier reports that said six boys had been freed. Sunday's events as they happened How risky is the Thai boys rescue? Divers have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. They have reportedly been able to make the last part of the journey on foot. Rescuers took advantage of a break in the rain to launch the mission much earlier than originally expected. The first phase has also been conducted much faster than officials had predicted.

A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. An ambulance arrives at a nearby hospital after leaving the cave site Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest section is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". BBC's Nick Beake at the scene This is a hugely high-profile rescue attempt and Thailand knows the world is watching. It has embarked on a dangerous option but believes it's the best for bringing the group out alive. It has assembled a team of internationally renowned divers and so far their expertise has brought four boys - thought to be the weakest - back to their families. But the relief of those mums and dads will be tempered by the knowledge that nine other families face an anxious wait for the turn of their loved ones to be shepherded through the narrow and murky corridors of the Tham Luang cave complex. As one diving expert put it to me, when underwater cave rescues go wrong they go wrong in a big way. So despite this promising start, there is a sense of unease here in Chiang Mai. But the overriding impression from the rescuers is a clear focus and unshakable resolve to finish the job.

Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths. Officials had originally thought the group might have to stay where they were until the rainy season ended - and that could have meant months underground. They had also been exploring whether they could drill down into the cave, as well as scouring the mountainside for another way in. But with the rainy season just beginning, it has become clear that the flooding which originally trapped the boys will only get worse in the coming days.

"We asked you to select the team to face Croatia and you have made two changes: in come Alli and Rashford It is England's biggest game for 28 years. On Wednesday evening they face Croatia in the World Cup semi-final - uncharted territory for Gareth Southgate and his squad, 17 of whom were not even born when Bobby Robson's side took on West Germany in Turin on 4 July, 1990. Following therelatively stress-free 2-0 quarter-final win over Swedenand with no fresh injury worries or suspensions, the smart money would be on Southgate selecting the same XI for Wednesday's last-four tie with Croatia. And you largely agree, but for one notable exception - the selection of Marcus Rashford in attack in place of Raheem Sterling. The only other change from your chosen XI against Sweden sees midfielder Dele Alli, who was in Southgate's XI but not yours as he came back from injury, return for Ruben Loftus-Cheek. There wasn't much in it between Rashford and Sterling, but the Manchester United striker just got the nod, receiving 60,988 selections to the Manchester City forward's 59,672. Unsurprisingly, the most picked player is Tottenham's Harry Kane, whose six goals have put him in pole position to win the tournament's Golden Boot and who was selected by 111,112 people. The second and third most popular selections are Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (109,490) and the scorer of the first goal against Sweden, Leicester defender Harry Maguire (106,232) You can still pick your team below, and remember to share your selection on social media with your friends. We also asked you where England would finish at the World Cup and you gave a confident response, with 86% of voters backing Gareth Southgate's side to reach the final. And if 48% of votes are to be believed, football is coming home!

"Some residents spoke of the speed at which the water rose Residents have described a torrent of water gushing into the air and flooding homes when one of Birmingham's ""largest"" mains in the city burst. About 100 properties were affected after a major water main burst on Wheeler Street in the Newtown area on Saturday. Many people had to be rescued by boat and roads were left badly damaged, with huge craters visible. An investigation is set to begin into what caused the pipe to burst. Engineers worked through the night to repair what Severn Trent described as ""one of the largest"" mains in the city. Local residents told the BBC they first heard the burst main at about 07:00 and later, at its height, water almost reached their waists. ""I heard the rush of the water and thought it was rain, but then thought 'how could it be rain?',"" Hubert Henry said. ""It was gushing into the air about six or seven foot. I couldn't believe how quickly it was rising. I thought this is getting serious."" This video can not be played Birmingham burst water main leaves homes cut off After waking up his grandchildren, Mr Henry said he looked out of the window and discovered his whole house was surrounded. ""It started creeping under the door and then I just heard a big gush,"" he said. Getting out of the house was a struggle with the weight of water at the door, he added. ""I chucked my grandchildren on the trampoline and chucked my dog on the trampoline. Then I made like a bridge from the trampoline to the neighbour's fence. ""Bricks were being carried down the road and all sorts."" Water supplies were restored by Saturday night. A new section of pipe has been put in the ground and engineers are hoping to connect it later. The broken section has been removed and engineers will analyse it to discover what caused the burst. Repairs to the main are expected to completed soon but it will take considerably longer repair the road, the water firm said. Wheeler Street is expected to stay closed until Thursday at the earliest, Severn Trent said. Mr Henry said engineers had worked ""tirelessly"" to repair the pipe, but the road was in a terrible state. He said he had noticed the road had seemed to have ""sunk"" in an area near to where the burst appeared when driving down it last week. The pipe, described as one of the biggest in Birmingham, is 30in in diameter (76cm) Wheeler Street is expected to remain shut for the foreseeable future Marc Hudson, from West Midlands Fire Service, said the priority soon after the flooding had been to move people out of their homes or make sure they could get on to the first floor. Mr Henry's family was put up in a nearby Premier Inn, but it's not clear what will happen tonight. He said carpets, furniture and paintwork in his home had been badly soaked and it would be some time until ground-floor rooms dried out. Nobody is thought to have been injured, including several disabled people living on the streets rescued by firefighters.

"Home secretary Sajid Javid met people in Salisbury and Amesbury to reassure them Sajid Javid has said there are ""no current plans"" to impose fresh sanctions on Russia over the latest nerve agent poisonings in Wiltshire. He repeated the government's assessment that Russia was the source of the poison but said he would not ""jump to conclusions"". The home secretary was speaking during a visit to Amesbury, where two people remain critically ill in hospital. Their symptoms were the same as those of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Mr Skripal, a Russian former spy, and his daughter werepoisoned with Novichok in March. Amesbury Novichok poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? Are you in the area? Do you have any information to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. It was Mr Javid's first visit as home secretary to Salisbury and Amesbury, whereDawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell illa week ago. Police believe the couple handled an item contaminated with the nerve agent Novichok. Mr Javid praised emergency personnel for their work ""What our expert scientists have determined is that the nerve agent in this incident is the same exact nerve agent that was used back in March,"" he said. ""We know back in March that was the Russians. We know it was a barbaric, inhuman act by the Russian state."" Russia has denied any involvement. Mr Javid added: ""Again for this particular incident we need to learn more and let the police do their work."" He met local people and business owners during his visit, and also praised emergency services for their response to the poisonings. The home secretary said ""the risk to the public remains low"", adding that he was ""very confident"" police would uncover the source of the poison. The nerve agent Novichok is highly toxic He said the area remains ""open for business"" and urged people to show their support and visit. The police's ""working hypothesis"" is that the Amesbury poisoning and the Salisbury incident are linked, but Mr Javid called for the police to be given ""time and space"" to work. ""What I am very confident of, with the amount of police work that's going on here - the support both from Wiltshire Police but also more than 100 officers from the counter-terrorism network involved as well - that they will eventually, one way or the other, get to the bottom of this,"" he said. He rejected suggestions that the government had been too quick to insist Salisbury was safe after the attack on the Skripals in March. It is not believed that the couple in the latest poisoning incident had visited the sites connected to the Skripals in Salisbury, he added.

"US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will be in the UK for two days Donald Trump's visit to the UK in the next week will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces, the Police Federation has warned. The US president will spend time in London, Windsor and Scotland during the two-day working visit. Thousands are expected to protest and police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist. The Home Office said other forces can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". Trump to visit Windsor and Chequers on UK trip Trump's Scotland visit confirmed Treasury to cover policing cost of Trump visit Forces assist one another outside their regions when dealing with major incidents and emergencies, under the so-called ""mutual aid"" agreement. Mr Trump's visit will see thousands of officers deployed from their home forces, said Simon Kempton, from the Police Federation of England and Wales. ""The fact cannot be ignored that while the officers on mutual aid are deployed elsewhere thousands more of their colleagues left behind in their home force will be expected to pick up the slack, leaving them even more stretched,"" he said. ""There was a time when we could do it all but now choices have to be made - we cannot do it all and this type of event puts a service which is already creaking at its knees under unquestionable pressure."" Protesters plan to fly a Trump baby balloon over Parliament Square in London during the visit Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, before spending the night at Winfield House in London. On Friday, the president will travel to Chequers in Buckinghamshire for bilateral talks with Theresa May. In the afternoon, he will meet the Queen in Windsor and then fly to Scotland, where the couple plan to spend the weekend. Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday and marches are also planned for Scotland, where Mr Trump owns golf courses. The Treasury has confirmed it willfund policing costsof up to Â£5m in Scotland. With officers sent in to help, local policing was being reduced to a ""reactive service"", Mr Kempton said, with additional strain due to the World Cup and the Novichok poisonings in Amesbury. ""You have to ask what would happen if we're unable to resource incidents like these,"" Mr Kempton added. ""Would we see the situation where the military were drafted in place of police officers? Green uniforms instead of the blue ones people would - and should - expect to see? It's a worrying prospect."" The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services.""

French actress Emmanuelle Seigner accused the Academy of ""insufferable hypocrisy"" over the incident. Polanski, who admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old in the US in 1977, was ejected from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in May. The 84-year-old directoris currently suing the Academy,externalover the expulsion. What has #MeToo actually changed? Four key themes from this year's Oscars Seigner, who was one of 928 artists invited to join the Academy as part of a bid to boost diversity last month, gave her response in an open letter published in France's Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper. She said: ""I have always been a feminist. But how can I ignore the fact that a few weeks ago the Academy expelled my husband, Roman Polanski, in an attempt to appease the zeitgeist - the very same Academy which in 2002 awarded him an Oscar for The Pianist! A curious case of amnesia! ""The Academy probably thinks I am enough of a spineless, social climbing actress that I would forget that I have been married to one of the world's greatest directors for the past 29 years."" Seigner has worked with her husband on films including Bitter Moon, Venus in Fur and The Ninth Gate. The 52-year-old has also appeared in The Man Who Laughs and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. In December the Academy issued anew code of conductfor its members that outlined its plans to address sexual harassment in the film industry. It came in response to the allegations of sexual misconduct against Harvey Weinstein and others in the ensuing #MeToo campaign. Harvey Weinstein was only the second person to be expelled from the Academy Academy CEO Dawn Hudson wrote a letter to all 8,427 members telling them they would be expected to abide by the new guidelines. ""There is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognised standards of decency,"" she wrote. Polanski admitted unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was 13 years old in 1977, and served 42 days in prison. The Rosemary's Baby director subsequently fled the US over concern that a plea bargain deal would be scrapped. Weinstein was the first person to be kicked out of the Academy in recent years, in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal. The mogul, whose films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations, wasexpelled from the organisation in October. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex andpleaded not guiltyto rape and sexual assault charges earlier this month. In May, the decision was taken to expel Polanskialong with disgraced TV star Bill Cosby. Actor Carmine Caridi lost his membership in 2004 for sharing copies of film screeners.

"Home secretary Sajid Javid met people in Salisbury and Amesbury to reassure them Sajid Javid has said there are ""no current plans"" to impose fresh sanctions on Russia over the latest nerve agent poisonings in Wiltshire. He repeated the government's assessment that Russia was the source of the poison but said he would not ""jump to conclusions"". The home secretary was speaking during a visit to Amesbury, where two people remain critically ill in hospital. Their symptoms were the same as those of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Mr Skripal, a Russian former spy, and his daughter werepoisoned with Novichok in March. Amesbury Novichok poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? Are you in the area? Do you have any information to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. It was Mr Javid's first visit as home secretary to Salisbury and Amesbury, whereDawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell illa week ago. Police believe the couple handled an item contaminated with the nerve agent Novichok. Mr Javid praised emergency personnel for their work ""What our expert scientists have determined is that the nerve agent in this incident is the same exact nerve agent that was used back in March,"" he said. ""We know back in March that was the Russians. We know it was a barbaric, inhuman act by the Russian state."" Russia has denied any involvement. Mr Javid added: ""Again for this particular incident we need to learn more and let the police do their work."" He met local people and business owners during his visit, and also praised emergency services for their response to the poisonings. The home secretary said ""the risk to the public remains low"", adding that he was ""very confident"" police would uncover the source of the poison. The nerve agent Novichok is highly toxic He said the area remains ""open for business"" and urged people to show their support and visit. The police's ""working hypothesis"" is that the Amesbury poisoning and the Salisbury incident are linked, but Mr Javid called for the police to be given ""time and space"" to work. ""What I am very confident of, with the amount of police work that's going on here - the support both from Wiltshire Police but also more than 100 officers from the counter-terrorism network involved as well - that they will eventually, one way or the other, get to the bottom of this,"" he said. He rejected suggestions that the government had been too quick to insist Salisbury was safe after the attack on the Skripals in March. It is not believed that the couple in the latest poisoning incident had visited the sites connected to the Skripals in Salisbury, he added.

"This video can not be played There were cheers and applause as the first boys' rescue was confirmed The operation to free 12 boys and their coach trapped in a cave in northern Thailand is running ""smoothly"", the head of the operation says. Four boys have been brought above ground so far in good health, rescuers say. The mission has now been paused for at least 10 hours as air tanks need to be replaced. Rescuers decided to go ahead with the hazardous operation on Sunday because of fears of rising waters. The next phase would begin on Monday morning, after relaying ""all of the air tanks and all systems along the way"", Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said. He corrected earlier reports that said six boys had been freed. Sunday's events as they happened How risky is the Thai boys rescue? Divers have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. They have reportedly been able to make the last part of the journey on foot. Rescuers took advantage of a break in the rain to launch the mission much earlier than originally expected. The first phase has also been conducted much faster than officials had predicted. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" The group and their families had all given their agreement that they should be moved as soon as possible, said Mr Narongsak. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. An ambulance arrives at a nearby hospital after leaving the cave site Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest section is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". BBC's Nick Beake at the scene This is a hugely high-profile rescue attempt and Thailand knows the world is watching. It has embarked on a dangerous option but believes it's the best for bringing the group out alive. It has assembled a team of internationally renowned divers and so far their expertise has brought four boys - thought to be the weakest - back to their families. But the relief of those mums and dads will be tempered by the knowledge that nine other families face an anxious wait for the turn of their loved ones to be shepherded through the narrow and murky corridors of the Tham Luang cave complex. As one diving expert put it to me, when underwater cave rescues go wrong they go wrong in a big way. So despite this promising start, there is a sense of unease here in Chiang Mai. But the overriding impression from the rescuers is a clear focus and unshakable resolve to finish the job.

Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths. Officials had originally thought the group might have to stay where they were until the rainy season ended - and that could have meant months underground. They had also been exploring whether they could drill down into the cave, as well as scouring the mountainside for another way in. But with the rainy season just beginning, it has become clear that the flooding which originally trapped the boys will only get worse in the coming days. This video can not be played Thailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers Rescuers have been desperately pumping water out of the cave, and Mr Narongsak said on Sunday that water levels inside were at their lowest levels so far.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will bring an end to free movement"" Boris Johnson strongly criticised Theresa May's plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU before agreeing to back it at Friday's cabinet meeting, the BBC understands. The prime minister held the Brexit meeting at Chequers, where the cabinet agreed to support her favoured option. Mr Johnson used colourful language as he made the argument Mrs May's plan would leave the UK as a ""vassal state"". Labour said Mrs May's customs plan was a ""fudge"" and would soon ""unravel"". At Friday's summit, ministers signed up to a plan to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"". They also backed what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC on Sunday that the deal was a compromise that would lead to a ""proper Brexit"". But he said the UK should be prepared to walk away if the EU was not willing to negotiate. Laura Kuenssberg: Tory tensions on Europe still profound At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon At Friday's get-together, Mr Johnson told colleagues the plan could be a ""serious inhibitor to free trade"", according to BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley. The foreign secretary backed the proposals at Chequers despite claiming that defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"". An ally of the prime minister said Mr Johnson's comments were made in a humorous style, and after a dinner Mr Johnson had then paid a rousing tribute to the prime minister. Boris Johnson has signed up to the plan but made his misgivings known After ministers signed up to the deal late on Friday night, Mrs May said the time for ministers to air their concerns in public was over and collective cabinet responsibility had been re-instated. Friends of Mr Johnson say he is staying in the cabinet to ""make the argument for Brexiteers"". Mr Gove said the plan ""honoured"" the 2016 referendum vote as the UK would be outside EU institutions and structures, telling the BBC it ""achieved all of the things we campaigned for"". Although the UK would sign up to EU rules on goods, he said the UK would have the ""sovereign ability"" to diverge where it wanted and that this autonomy would apply across a ""a swathe of the economy"". This video can not be played 'Be generous or we'll walk away' - Gove's warning to EU Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if the proposed deal was everything he had hoped for, Mr Gove replied: ""No, but I am a realist"" - adding that cabinet unity was important. If the EU did not show flexibility, the UK may have to ""contemplate walking away without a deal"", he added. ""No-one wants to walk away now because we are in the middle of a negotiation,"" he said. ""What we need to do is to be able to walk away in March 2019."" Tory Brexiteers are uneasy about many aspects of the plan, warning the UK will have to follow EU laws and European Court of Justice rulings and not be able to develop an ""effective international trade policy"". Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen called the PM's pledges a ""a pretence and charade intended to dupe the electorate"". Writing in theMail on Sunday, Mr Bridgen,externalsaid the ""time has come for a new [Conservative] leader"" which he believes should be Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith,externaltold the Sunday Telegraph if the public perceive Mrs May's plan as ""continued membership"" of the customs union and single market for goods, the government ""will suffer the consequences at the next election"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""This is a serious, workable proposal"" But Mrs May told the Sunday Times: ""The only challenge that needs to be made now is to the European Union to get serious about this, to come round the table and discuss it with us."" She said her plan was a ""serious, workable proposal"" and when people voted to leave the EU, ""they wanted to take control of our money, our laws and our borders and that's exactly what we will do"". Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said proposals to avoid customs checks by differentiating between UK and EU-bound goods, in terms of what tariffs should be paid, were ""a bureaucratic nightmare"". ""This has got fudge written all over it,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""She (Theresa May) has not met our demands. It is going to unravel and she will have to think again."" He urged Mrs May to put her customs proposals to a vote in Parliament in a week's time, suggesting Labour's alternative plan for a comprehensive customs union had the backing of the majority of MPs. The prime minister gathered her 26 cabinet ministers together at her country residence to resolve differences over the shape of the UK's relations with the EU and break the current deadlock with the EU. The main details from theChequers statement,external, to be incorporated in a white paper next week, are: The UK would accept continuing ""harmonisation"" with EU rules on the trade in goods, covering only those necessary to ensure frictionless trade Parliament would have the final say over how these rules are incorporated into UK law, retaining the right to refuse to do so There will be different arrangements for trade in services, including financial products, with greater ""regulatory flexibility"" and ""strong reciprocal arrangements"" Freedom of movement as it stands will come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other's territories and apply for study and work A new customs arrangement will be phased in, with the goal of ""a combined customs territory"" The UK will be able to control its own tariffs and develop an independent trade policy The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will end but the UK will pay regard to its decisions in areas where common rules are in force The Observer reported thatmore than 100 entrepreneurs and business leaders,externalregard Mrs May's plan as ""unworkable"" and ""costly and bureaucratic"".

"The nerve agent is highly toxic and can pass through the skin A police officer tested for possible exposure to a nerve agent in Salisbury has been given the medical all-clear. The Wiltshire Police officer was treated a short distance from Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill last Saturday. They remain in a critical condition after being exposed to Novichok by handling a contaminated item. The officer was cleared at Salisbury District Hospital. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case What are Novichok nerve agents? Wiltshire Police confirmed that one of their officers had been ""seeking medical advice"" at the hospital as part of ""a precautionary measure"". A Salisbury District Hospital spokesperson said: ""There is nothing to suggest there is any wider risk to anyone at the hospital."" The spokesperson added that the hospital had ""the ability to carry out the appropriate specialist tests. ""Salisbury District Hospital has seen a number of members of the public who have come to the hospital with health concerns since this incident started and none have required any treatment. ""We would like to reiterate the advice from Public Health England (PHE) that the risk to the wider public remains low."" The emergency department at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon where the officer initially attended had been closed but reopened at about 22:00 BST. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday An operation into the poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess is expected to take months as police examine more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage. Police are conducting a search for the item believed to have exposed the pair to Novichok. However, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the hunt has been hindered by the heatwave as chemical weapons experts wearing Hazmat (Hazardous Material) suits can only spend a few minutes inside the property being searched. Locations visited by the couple, as identified by the police, include Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. PHE issued ""highly precautionary advice"" for anyone who visited those locations to wash worn clothes with a regular detergent at normal temperature and wipe items like phones and handbags. This investigation comes months afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. He called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" and accused the country of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"".

Most of the deaths have occurred in Hiroshima prefecture, which has been hit by torrential rain since Thursday. Hundreds of homes have been damaged. About 1.5 million people have been ordered to leave their homes and three million more advised to do so. Authorities say it could potentially be the worst weather disaster Japan has seen in decades. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the authorities were facing a ""race against time"" to save and evacuate people. Thousands of police, firefighters and soldiers are taking part in search-and-rescue operations. Some of the victims have been buried alive by landslides, Japan's Kyodo news agency reports.

Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent Over the past week we have called
in to chat to Nopparat Kanthawong, the head coach of the Wild Boars football
team, and usually found him talking tensely on the phone to parents of the
boys. He went over and over the events of the day the boys went into the caves
with his assistant after football practice. He says he had no idea they were
going. Tonight there was an entirely
different atmosphere in the house, just below the mountains where the men who
run the Wild Boars meet. They laughed, shouted cheers and shook hands in a very
un-Thai way. And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost
speechless. ""I donât know what to say â I just want to see them, and hug them,"" he told me. I was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford
next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little
disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool
fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. ""Is this for real?"" they
asked. Getting them to UK from this
far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol,
who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a
fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they
just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave. They will probably make it to
Manchester Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The young footballers had been invited by Fifa to attend the World Cup Final in Moscow on Sunday. But their attendance was always a long shot, given the health risks they face after spending more than two weeks in a pitch-dark cave. Fifa has just told the BBC that the boys will not be making the match. Here's what they said: FIFA would like to express its great joy at the news of the rescue of the 12 young footballers and their coach. We would like to convey our profound gratitude to all persons involved in the rescue operation, which unfortunately took the life of one of the divers. Our thoughts are with his family. We have been informed by the Football Association of Thailand that due to medical reasons, the boys will not be in a position to travel to Moscow for the FIFA World Cup final. FIFA's priority remains the health of everyone involved in the operation and we will look into finding a new opportunity to invite the boys to a FIFA event to share with them a moment of communion and celebration. We can also confirm that a meeting with the Football Association of Thailand is scheduled to take place in Moscow around the FIFA World Cup final. The BBC's Nick Beake is at the hospital where the boys are being treated: This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission
Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the
final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldnât believe
it, others claimed they never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.

their audiences at home. Japanese and Brazilian networks were either side of
us. Up on the 8th floor, the doctors who declared this morning that the
first eight boys to be rescued are doing well will now be examining their remaining

"Demonstrators say not enough is being done to halt the practice Tens of thousands of women gathered in Seoul on Saturday calling for a crackdown on spy cam pornography, in one of the country's biggest ever female-only protests. Perpetrators film or photograph women with hidden cameras in public spaces. Although distributing pornography is illegal in South Korea, the videos and pictures are shared widely online. Organisers say women live in constant fear of being photographed or filmed without their knowledge. #MeToo takes hold in South Korea Korean revenge porn site owner arrested Carrying placards and banners with messages like ""My life is not your porn"", the women were mostly teenagers or in their 20s - seen as the main victims of the hidden cameras. ""Those men who film such videos! Those who upload them! Those who watch them! All of them should be punished sternly!"" they chanted. The women covered their faces with masks, hats and sunglasses as instructed by the organisers. Demonstrators said around 55,000 women took part, although police put the figure at around 20,000. All the protesters at the event were women The recent protests began after police arrested a 25-year-old woman in May for secretly photographing a male colleague who posed nude for university art students. She then shared the picture online. Demonstrators believe police only acted so swiftly because it was a female perpetrator, and pointed to instances of police closing cases with female victims because they could not find the photographers or track them online, because they posted on foreign servers. While the law mandates a maximum five-year prison term or 10 million won ($8,970; Â£6,770) fine for creating sexual images, and a maximum seven year sentence and 30 million won ($26,900; Â£20,200) fine for distributing them for profit, protesters say many receive far lighter punishments. This video can not be played The use of hidden and up-skirt cameras is a huge problem in South Korea South Korea has struggled to contain a rise in the crime in recent years. The number of hidden camera crimes rose from 1,100 in 2010 to more than 6,500 in 2017. Since 2004, the country has mandated that all smart phones should make loud shutter noises when they take a photo or video to make people aware of their use. But apps can be used to silence the noise, and perpetrators are also using miniature cameras hidden in walls, bags, shoes or toilets. President Moon Jae-in said the crime had become ""part of daily life"". Last week he reportedly told a cabinet meeting that offenders should ""suffer greater damage than the damage they inflict"", urging officials to look for stronger punishments such as notifying employers of any perpetrators on staff.

Their parents are going home to take a shower and change. They should be able to visit the children through the glass tonight."" Families have not yet been able to meet any of the rescued boys in person, due to a fear of infection. Instead they have had to stand behind a glass partition. Allow Twitter content?

The last ambulance has arrived at the hospital in Chiang Rai, the BBC's Howard Johnson says. It means the final four members of the team, plus the coach, now join the eight others who were rescued over the previous two days. The first eight have undergone X-rays and blood tests, and will remain under observation for at least seven days. They are said to be in good mental and physical health. Some of the boys have now seen their families, but only through a glass panel in the hospital as medical staff want to protect them from possible infections. Allow Twitter content?

Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent Over the past week we have called
in to chat to Nopparat Kanthawong, the head coach of the Wild Boars football
team, and usually found him talking tensely on the phone to parents of the
boys. He went over and over the events of the day the boys went into the caves
with his assistant after football practice. He says he had no idea they were
going. Tonight there was an entirely
different atmosphere in the house, just below the mountains where the men who
run the Wild Boars meet. They laughed, shouted cheers and shook hands in a very
un-Thai way. And coach Nop was smiling for the first time, and almost
speechless. ""I donât know what to say â I just want to see them, and hug them,"" he told me. I was then able to show him a note from Manchester United to the rescued boys. It was an invitation to visit Old Trafford
next season, as most of the boys are passionate Man U fans. There was a little
disbelief, and then elation, even from coach Nop, who admits he is a Liverpool
fan who has failed to convert the rest of his team. ""Is this for real?"" they
asked. Getting them to UK from this
far-flung border town will be a challenge. Three of the boys and coach Ekapol,
who was with them in the caves, are not recognised as full Thai citizens, a
fairly common problem for communities along the Thai-Myanmar border. But they
just made an almost miraculous escape from a cave. They will probably make it to
Manchester Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The young footballers had been invited by Fifa to attend the World Cup Final in Moscow on Sunday. But their attendance was always a long shot, given the health risks they face after spending more than two weeks in a pitch-dark cave. Fifa has just told the BBC that the boys will not be making the match. Here's what they said: FIFA would like to express its great joy at the news of the rescue of the 12 young footballers and their coach. We would like to convey our profound gratitude to all persons involved in the rescue operation, which unfortunately took the life of one of the divers. Our thoughts are with his family. We have been informed by the Football Association of Thailand that due to medical reasons, the boys will not be in a position to travel to Moscow for the FIFA World Cup final. FIFA's priority remains the health of everyone involved in the operation and we will look into finding a new opportunity to invite the boys to a FIFA event to share with them a moment of communion and celebration. We can also confirm that a meeting with the Football Association of Thailand is scheduled to take place in Moscow around the FIFA World Cup final. The BBC's Nick Beake is at the hospital where the boys are being treated: This is the moment Mission Impossible became Mission
Accomplished. Families in Chiang Rai gathered at the hospital to watch the
final ambulances bring in their precious cargo. Some said they couldnât believe
it, others claimed they never lost hope. All wore the brightest of smiles.
Scores of reporters rushed to their live positions to bring the news to
their audiences at home. Japanese and Brazilian networks were either side of
us. Up on the 8th floor, the doctors who declared this morning that the
first eight boys to be rescued are doing well will now be examining their remaining
teammates and their coach. Psychologists will be being assessing the impact a
fortnight trapped underground has had. The Wild Boars footballers went into the
Tham Luang cave as a team. They survived as a team. And tonight, at the end of
a remarkable 72-hour rescue, they are together as a team once again. An ambulance leaves the Tham Luang cave on Tuesday Petty Officer Saman Gunan, a former Thai navy diver in his late thirties, died on 6 July while helping to re-supply the cave with new air tanks. He ran out oxygen and lost consciousness. BBC Thai spoke to his family after his death. ""I really loved him,"" his wife  Waleeporn Gunan  said. ""Every day before he left for work, we said we loved each other. At midday, we'd text to see if the other had had lunch.

"The boys, aged between 11 and 17, have been trapped with their coach since 23 June Rescuers in Thailand have begun a hazardous operation to lead 12 boys and one adult out of a cave where they have been trapped for two weeks. The group are stranded on a ledge 4km inside the Tham Luang cave but amid fears of rising waters, officials have decided they cannot wait any longer. Officials have called it D-Day, saying the boys are fit and ready to move. Late on Sunday, local reports said the first two members of the group had been brought out to safety. It is unclear how long the whole mission will take. The boys are being rescued in groups. Expert divers are guiding them out through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the cave. LIVE: Latest updates on the rescue How risky is the Thai boys rescue? A huge volunteer and media operation has built up around the mouth of the cave over the past week. This video can not be played Rescue teams have begun the operation to extract the boys from the cave But early on Sunday, journalists were told they had to move down the road, sparking speculation that a rescue mission was about to begin. Narongsak Osottanakorn, who has been leading the operation, then confirmed that 18 divers had gone in to get the boys. ""This is D-Day,"" he said. ""The boys are ready to face any challenges."" He added that the boys had all been assessed by a doctor and were ""very fit physically and mentally... They are determined and focused"". The group and their families had all given their agreement that they should be moved as soon as possible, he said. 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' Officials had originally thought the group might have to stay where they were until the rainy season ended - that could have meant months underground. They'd also been exploring whether they could drill down into the cave, as well as scouring the mountainside for another way in. At a church in Chiang Rai, local people spent Sunday morning praying for the trapped boys But with the rainy season just beginning, it's become clear that the flooding which originally trapped the boys will only get worse in the coming days. Rescuers have been desperately pumping water out of the cave, and Mr Narongsak said on Sunday that water levels inside were at their lowest levels so far. ""There is no other day that we are more ready than today,"" said Mr Narongsak. ""Otherwise we will lose the opportunity."" Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting 11-hour round trip even for the experienced divers. When the operation began, officials said the earliest the boys were likely to reach the surface was 21:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Sunday. One official has said it could take two to three days to get them all out. They'll have to do a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving - all in complete darkness - along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy will be accompanied by two divers who will also carry their air supply. The toughest section is about halfway out - they'll reach section called ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers will have to take off their air tanks to get through. Eventually they'll reach Chamber 3, the cavern which has been turned into a forward base for the divers. They'll rest there before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They're expecting to be taken straight to hospital in Chiang Rai town. An expert's view on the dangers ahead In an indication of quite how dangerous the journey will be,a former Thai navy diver died in the caves earlier this week.Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues have said they ""will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". By Helier Cheung, Tham Luang cave This is the moment that everyone has been waiting for - and that some thought would never begin. Earlier on, the mood around the rescue sites had been upbeat once the boys were found alive. Smiling volunteers would hand out snacks, or offer massages, to those on the site. Now security to the site has been beefed up even more. Several police vans, military officers and ambulances have been entering and exiting the site. There's a solemn sense of anticipation in the air. Family and friends of the boys will be getting little rest until they learn the outcome of the rescue operation.

They took in only basic food. Letters of love from trapped Thai boys But it appears they went in too far at the wrong time of year, and unexpectedly got cut off. Against all odds, they were found by rescue divers early last week,perched on a high ledge in the darkness. They were hungry and scared but in remarkably good shape given their ordeal. Since then, they've been kept company by navy divers at all times, and had food, light and medical care sent in. They even managed to send letters home telling their parents not to worry, but that they were looking forward to coming home. Flooded Thai farmers support rescue effort.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will bring an end to free movement"" Boris Johnson strongly criticised Theresa May's plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU before agreeing to back it at Friday's cabinet meeting, the BBC understands. The prime minister held the Brexit meeting at Chequers, where the cabinet agreed to support her favoured option. Mr Johnson used colourful language as he made the argument Mrs May's plan would leave the UK as a ""vassal state"". Labour said Mrs May's customs plan was a ""fudge"" and would soon ""unravel"". At Friday's summit, ministers signed up to a plan to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"". They also backed what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC on Sunday that the deal was a compromise that would lead to a ""proper Brexit"".

Laura Kuenssberg: Tory tensions on Europe still profound At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon At Friday's get-together, Mr Johnson told colleagues the plan could be a ""serious inhibitor to free trade"", according to BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley. The foreign secretary backed the proposals at Chequers despite claiming that defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"". An ally of the prime minister said Mr Johnson's comments were made in a humorous style, and after a dinner Mr Johnson had then paid a rousing tribute to the prime minister. Boris Johnson has signed up to the plan but made his misgivings known After ministers signed up to the deal late on Friday night, Mrs May said the time for ministers to air their concerns in public was over and collective cabinet responsibility had been re-instated. Friends of Mr Johnson say he is staying in the cabinet to ""make the argument for Brexiteers"". Mr Gove said the plan ""honoured"" the 2016 referendum vote as the UK would be outside EU institutions and structures, telling the BBC it ""achieved all of the things we campaigned for"". Although the UK would sign up to EU rules on goods, he said the UK would have the ""sovereign ability"" to diverge where it wanted and that this autonomy would apply across a ""a swathe of the economy"". This video can not be played 'Be generous or we'll walk away' - Gove's warning to EU Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if the proposed deal was everything he had hoped for, Mr Gove replied: ""No, but I am a realist"" - adding that cabinet unity was important.

""What we need to do is to be able to walk away in March 2019."" Tory Brexiteers are uneasy about many aspects of the plan, warning the UK will have to follow EU laws and European Court of Justice rulings and not be able to develop an ""effective international trade policy"".

The Wiltshire Police officer was treated a short distance from Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill last Saturday. They remain in a critical condition after being exposed to Novichok by handling a contaminated item. The officer was cleared at Salisbury District Hospital. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case What are Novichok nerve agents? Wiltshire Police confirmed that one of their officers had been ""seeking medical advice"" at the hospital as part of ""a precautionary measure"". A Salisbury District Hospital spokesperson said: ""There is nothing to suggest there is any wider risk to anyone at the hospital."" The spokesperson added that the hospital had ""the ability to carry out the appropriate specialist tests. ""Salisbury District Hospital has seen a number of members of the public who have come to the hospital with health concerns since this incident started and none have required any treatment. ""We would like to reiterate the advice from Public Health England (PHE) that the risk to the wider public remains low."" The emergency department at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon where the officer initially attended had been closed but reopened at about 22:00 BST. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday An operation into the poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess is expected to take months as police examine more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage. Police are conducting a search for the item believed to have exposed the pair to Novichok. However, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the hunt has been hindered by the heatwave as chemical weapons experts wearing Hazmat (Hazardous Material) suits can only spend a few minutes inside the property being searched. Locations visited by the couple, as identified by the police, include Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. PHE issued ""highly precautionary advice"" for anyone who visited those locations to wash worn clothes with a regular detergent at normal temperature and wipe items like phones and handbags. This investigation comes months afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. He called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" and accused the country of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"". The Russian Embassy accused the UK of trying to ""frighten its own citizens"". Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Shock and worry after Novichok case What are Novichok nerve agents?

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will bring an end to free movement"" Theresa May has refused to rule out making it easier for EU citizens to come to the UK after Brexit than it is for people from elsewhere in the world. Under her plan for UK-EU relations - agreed by cabinet on Friday - unlimited immigration from the EU will end. But speaking to the BBC, Mrs May did not rule out preferential treatment for EU citizens after Brexit. ""We recognise that people will still want to have opportunities in each other's countries,"" she said. But a briefing being circulated tothe European Research Group (ERG)- a group of Eurosceptic Conservative backbench MPs - says the prime minister's plan ""would lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit"". The 18-page document expresses concern the UK would have to follow EU laws and European Court of Justice rulings and would not be able to develop an ""effective international trade policy"". Laura Kuenssberg: Tory tensions on Europe still profound At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon The BBC understands Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was vocal and hostile in his opposition to Mrs May's plan, which he reportedly said would leave the UK as a ""vassal state"" and be a ""serious inhibitor of free trade"". Allies of Mr Johnson say he is staying in the cabinet to ""make the argument for Brexiteers"". Asked if it was possible EU citizens might get some preferential treatment, the prime minister said: ""We are going to decide. What we're going to do is say what works for the UK, what's right for the United Kingdom?"" A day after she secured cabinet approval on a plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU, Mrs May said ministers were now expected to speak with collective responsibility. ""Collective responsibility has returned... we are moving forward together,"" she told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Tory Brexiteer and ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg previously told the BBC that when detail of the plan emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal. Mr Rees-Mogg, said that so far onlythe three page summary of the deal,externalhad been published, and he would have to wait to see the full 100-plus page document to decide whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a ""punishment Brexit"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""This is a serious, workable proposal"" Mrs May will now have to take the plan to the EU, which she said was now ready to sit down and discuss the proposals. ""From the soundings I've had so far, there is a willingness to sit down and talk about this and a recognition that actually we now are in the stage where we need to agree what the future relationship's going to be,"" Mrs May said on Saturday. ""This is a serious, workable proposal,"" she added. The plans that ministers backed would see an end to freedom of movement. But a ""mobility framework"" would be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply to study and work. Mrs May said when people voted to leave the EU, ""they wanted to take control of our money, our laws and our borders and that's exactly what we will do"". The main details from theChequers statement,external: The UK would accept continuing ""harmonisation"" with EU rules on the trade in goods, covering only those necessary to ensure frictionless trade Parliament would have the final say over how these rules are incorporated into UK law, retaining the right to refuse to do so There will be different arrangements for trade in services, including financial products, with greater ""regulatory flexibility"" and ""strong reciprocal arrangements"" Freedom of movement as it stands will come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other's territories and apply for study and work A new customs arrangement will be phased in, with the goal of ""a combined customs territory"" The UK will be able to control its own tariffs and develop an independent trade policy The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will end but the UK will pay regard to its decisions in areas where common rules are in force Kuenssberg: The deal is done 12 key Brexit words you need to know LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?
