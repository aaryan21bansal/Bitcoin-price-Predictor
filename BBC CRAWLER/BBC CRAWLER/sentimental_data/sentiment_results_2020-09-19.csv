"Bale's signing was announced on the same day as Sergio Reguilon's arrival at Spurs Tottenham have re-signed Wales forward Gareth Bale from Spanish champions Real Madrid on a season-long loan. Bale, 31,left Spurs for a then world record Â£85min 2013 and went on to score more than 100 goals and win four Champions Leagues with Real. ""It's nice to be back. It's such a special club to me. It's where I made my name,"" said Bale. ""Hopefully, now I can get some match fitness, get under way and really help the team and, hopefully, win trophies."" Spurs said Bale has signed for them with a knee injury sustained playing for Wales earlier this month and they ""anticipate that he will be match fit after October's international break"". That would mean the forward missing their next five games, with the club's first outing following the international break at home to West Ham on 17 October. This video can not be played Tottenham re-sign Bale from Real Madrid - watch some of his best Spurs goals Bale originally joined Tottenham as a 17-year-old from Southampton in 2007 for an initial payment of Â£5m. ""I always thought when I did leave that I would love to come back,"" he added. ""I feel like it is a good fit. It's a good time for me. I'm hungry and motivated. I want to do well for the team and can't wait to get started."" At Real, Bale has also won two La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey, three Uefa Super Cups and three Club World Cups. ""I think by going to Madrid, winning trophies and going far with the national team I feel like I have that kind of winning mentality, how to win trophies,"" he said. ""You don't realise it until you're there and in those situations, in finals, how to kind of deal with the situation, the nerves, the pressure, and I think that all goes with experience. ""Hopefully I can bring that to the dressing room, bring a bit more belief to everybody that we can win a trophy, and the target is to do that this season, to be fighting on every front possible. I want to bring that mentality here, back to Tottenham."" Bale remains the most expensive British player in history, as well as the top-scoring British player in La Liga - with 80 goals and 40 assists in 171 league appearances, averaging a goal or assist every 104 minutes. However, a run of injuries, indifferent form and a deteriorating relationship with manager Zinedine Zidane had seen Bale become a marginal figure. Opponents will worry about playing Spurs - Danny Murphy analysis The Premier League stars who have returned to former clubs Real eclipsed the Â£80m they paid Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 to take Bale to the Bernabeu, with the forward signing an initial Â£300,000-a-week, six-year contract. He extended his stay with a new six-year deal in 2016, reported to be worth Â£600,000 a week - andÂ£150m over its duration,external- in salaries and bonuses. The Welshman was hugely successful in his first few seasons at Real, scoring in the 2014 and 2018 Champions League finals, as well as the 2014 Copa del Rey final. BBC Sport readersvoted Bale as the best British exportof the Premier League era earlier this year, his 42% share comfortably eclipsing former England, Manchester United and Real Madrid winger David Beckham's 29%. Competition Won by Bale with Real Madrid Champions League 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 La Liga 2016-17, 2019-20 Copa del Rey 2014 Uefa Super Cup 2014, 2016, 2017 Club World Cup 2014, 2017, 2018 But, frustrated by a lack of playing time, Bale came close to a move to China last year beforeReal blocked it. Aftercelebrating Wales' qualification for Euro 2020 with a bannerreading ""Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that Order"" in November, he received a backlash in Spain and was jeered by Real fans in his first game back for the club. His relationship with Zidane deteriorated to the extent Bale asked not to travel with the squad for the Champions League last-16 second-leg tie against Manchester City in August because he knew he had no chance of being involved. He started just one match when the 2019-20 La Liga season resumed following the coronavirus shutdown and played only 100 minutes as Real won a first league title since 2017, and was conspicuously on the fringes of the team's celebrations.

Real Madrid gave a 45-word statement on Bale's departure Bale joins manager Jose Mourinho's other signings of this transfer window, joining goalkeeper Joe Hart, defender Matt Doherty, midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg andleft-back Sergio Reguilon at the club. Tottenham, Champions League finalists in 2019, were beaten 1-0 at home by Everton in their first match of the 2020-21 campaign on Sunday. They finished sixth in the English top flight last season to qualify for the Europa League, seven points adrift of Chelsea in the final Champions League position. Mourinho, beginning his first full campaign with Spurs after succeeding Mauricio Pochettino in December, tried to sign Bale when Real Madrid boss but the player arrived the season after the Portuguese's departure. All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur's Amazon documentary reviewed Bale's overhead kick in the 2018 Champions League final against Liverpool is one of the greatest in the history of the competition Former Spurs and England midfielder Danny Murphy: Gareth Bale has that ""wow"" factor, something only a few very special players in the world have got. When they play, they have a different aura and a presence on the pitch that affects everyone - even before they kick a ball. So, Bale will not just have a positive effect on his new Tottenham team-mates and give them a massive confidence boost, he will change the way opposition players feel about facing Spurs. They will be worried when they see his name on the teamsheet and then, when they face him on the pitch, I can tell you now they will drop off five yards because they will be scared of him - whoever they are. Read more from Murphy Simon Stone, BBC Sport The indications are that Tottenham will pay 40% of Bale's salary, which is in excess of Â£600,000 a week. This figure may involve bonuses, so the actual payment may be less than Â£260,000 a week, but it will still place Bale above even Harry Kane, who signed a Â£200,000-a-week deal in 2018. However, coming less than six months after chairman Daniel Levy put staff on furlough, and less than four months after Tottenham took out a Â£175m loan from the Bank of England - which it expressly says will not be used to buy players and is more likely to help pay loans for their Â£1bn stadium - it still raises questions about the deal. An astute operator with a keen business brain, Levy can presumably justify the move on two grounds. First, the impact Bale could have on Mourinho's squad, leading to success on the field and therefore more money off it. Secondly, Bale is a global star and will have a major commercial impact. Bale's arrival puts question marks over the short-term futures of two midfielders: Dele Alli, replaced at half-time during Sunday's home defeat by Everton, and Tanguy Ndombele, a Â£63m club record signing last summer. In 146 Premier League games for Tottenham Bale scored 42 times. In his last season at Tottenham in 2012-2013, Bale was involved in37 goalsin all competitions for the club (26 goals, 11 assists) - only Robin van Persie (39) and Juan Mata (49) were involved in more for a Premier League club that season. Nineof those 21 goalscame outside the box; the most by any player in a single season in the competition's history. Bale is one of four Premier League players to win thePFA Players' Player of the Yearon two occasions, after Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry and Ronaldo. He was also only the second Premier League player (along with Ronaldo) to win both this award alongside the Young Player of the Year award in the same season. Bale is one of seven players to score at least twice in a singleChampions League final,and the only British player to do so. Since he joined Madrid in the summer of 2013, only Ronaldo (318) and Karim Benzema (235) have been involved inmore competitive goalsfor Real Madrid than Gareth Bale (162). Over the past three seasons, Gareth Bale has seen hisattempted dribblesdrop to three or less per 90 minutes, compared to a high of 6.2 when at Tottenham and 5.8 in his first season at Real Madrid. Bale with team-mate Luka Modric celebrating more Champions League success with Madrid Andy West, Spanish football writer: The view in Madrid is... finally, he's gone. Whether it's fair or not (and the man himself appears to be way past caring), that will be the immediate reaction of most Real Madrid fans to the news of Gareth Bale's departure. In their minds, Bale's undeniably significant role in an impressive haul of silverware - including some genuinely sensational moments of match-winning brilliance - has been overshadowed by his startling lack of contribution in the past two years, during which time his attitude towards the club veered between disinterested apathy and hostile mockery. In time, the acrimony of his past couple of years will be forgotten and a more generous perception will emerge, and it is already widely acknowledged that Bale was an undoubted success during his first five years in Spain. But it can't be denied that he became an expensive burden by the end, and few fans will be sorry to see him leave.

"Sir Keir Starmer says Labour and the unions must ""stand together"" Sir Keir Starmer has been warned against ""watering down"" the ""radical policies"" he promised during his campaign to become Labour leader. The Fire Brigades Union told the BBC he must not ""cede any ground"" to the Conservatives and fight for ""root-and-branch"" reform of society. General Secretary Matt Wrack added that he had not ""heard Keir make that case"" since becoming Labour leader in April. Sir Keir has urged the party and unions to ""stand together like never before"". Labour's four-day annual conference, the first under his leadership, began on Saturday. Renamed Labour Connected, it is taking place online and will not feature votes, but the party's major figures will still give speeches and take part in discussions. A guide to party conferences in a Covid world Labour aims to build trust with new slogan Young people and home workers 'being scapegoated' In his campaign to become leader,Sir Keir set out 10 pledges.,external Among these was putting a ""Green New Deal at the heart of everything we do"", including a Clean Air Act to tackle pollution at a local level, and demanding ""international action"" on ""climate rights"". Sir Keir also pledged to work ""shoulder-to-shoulder with trade unions to stand up for working people, tackle insecure work and low pay"". He said a Labour government under him would repeal the Conservatives' 2016 Trade Union Act, which makes industrial action more difficult. The FBU wants Sir Keir Starmer to follow through on plans to reverse curbs on industrial action Mr Wrack, whose FBU is one of the more left-leaning of the 12 Labour-affiliated trade unions, said: ""Our present crisis has only made the case for that platform more urgent, but we haven't yet heard Keir make that case in opposition."" He said the Labour leader should promote the Socialist Green New Deal, agreed at last year's party conference. It calls for net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, bringing the energy sector into public ownership and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the environment sector, on union-negotiated rates of pay. Mr Wrack said: ""We look forward to seeing Keir making [the Socialist Green New deal] his own. But that can't mean any watering down of the radical policies we fought for. ""We don't want to see Labour cede any ground to the Tories, full stop - not least on the greatest issue of our time."" Mr Wrack called Labour Connected ""a chance for Keir and the shadow cabinet to prove to members that there will be no retreat on the policy pledges he was elected on"". ""Swapping to paper straws isn't going to save our planet,"" the FBU leader said. ""Nothing short of a root-and-branch transformation of our society and economic system will save our planet from the brink of destruction."" He added that rebuilding the economy after the pandemic ""should be seen as an opportunity to tackle the climate crisis as well"". The FBU backed Rebecca Long-Bailey in the Labour leadership contest The FBU split from Labour in 2004 following a dispute with Tony Blair's government over pay. It re-affiliated in 2015 when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. The union backed Rebecca Long-Bailey, another on the left of the party, against Sir Keir in the leadership contest earlier this year. She wassacked from the shadow cabinetin June after she re-tweeted an article Sir Keir said ""contained anti-Semitic conspiracy theories"". In a separate development, Len McCluskey, leader of Unite, the UK's second-biggest union, haspromised to review its financial supportfor Labour. Addressing the TUC Congress earlier this week, Sir Keir continued to promote a unifying message when he said: ""Labour and the trade union movement need to stand together like never before, to show the British people that we've got their back and their future too. ""We'll fight to protect jobs, incomes and working conditions at this time of national crisis, and show that there is a better, fairer society to come. That is our mission."" Last week, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady told the BBC that Sir Keir had made a ""really strong start"" as Labour leader. The party has been contacted for a response to Mr Wrack's comments.

"A new taskforce will meet next week to kick-start the recovery of cancer services across the NHS in England. Charities believe the pandemic has led to a significant reduction in people being referred for urgent cancer treatment. Cancer Research UK says three million people have missed cancer screenings since March. The taskforce aims to investigate how to ensure more people are referred, tested and checked. At Liverpool's new Clatterbridge cancer centre, which opened in June, treatment is up and running. The coronavirus meant face-to-face contacts with patients like Ian Crompton were greatly reduced. Ian has previously been treated for prostate cancer, which meant he had to self-isolate throughout lockdown. Now he needs a scan to make sure all is well. So his first appointment actually meeting staff has come as something of a relief. ""With being in isolation, in lockdown, you felt alone,"" Ian says. ""I find consultations face to face a lot better because you can ask questions. ""On the phone, there's no eye contact, which I find unusual."" Services are now starting to come back up to speed, but there is a significant backlog of patients who need treatment. It's also estimated that around 350,000 fewer patients than normal have been referred for an urgent cancer investigation. This video can not be played Hatti Gayner, 28, described a lump she'd found in her breast to a GP over the phone Hatti Gayner is a dancer and performer, who appeared with her group on BBC TV's The Greatest Dancer earlier this year. A lively and chatty Geordie, the 28-year-old is now undergoing treatment for breast cancer. She's being supported by the Trekstock charity, which helps younger people who have been diagnosed with cancer. Towards the end of lockdown she found a lump in her breast, but she had to make do with a telephone consultation with her GP. Initially she was told it might be an abscess or a cyst and was prescribed antibiotics. But her mum told her to push for a face-to-face consultation - and when that happened, it became clear it was much more serious. ""I'm a young girl, 28. I'm not a hypochondriac, I don't just phone up about nothing,"" she says. ""I know they don't know that, necessarily, but I think I should have been seen and I think I should have been examined."" Infection control and social distancing mean it now takes longer to treat people safely, and there are concerns about how much capacity there is to reduce the backlog of patients. NHS England says that between March and July of this year, more than 207,000 people started cancer treatment. That's around 85% of the number the NHS in England treated in the same period in 2019. Meanwhile a taskforce, involving all the main cancer charities and organisations such as the Royal College of GPs, will start work next week. The body, led by Prof Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer in England, aims to ensure more people are checked and tested. ""People have been staying away because they didn't want to put pressure on the NHS when it was busy coping with a huge number of people with the coronavirus,"" he said. ""We're very keen that they should come back, and if anybody's worried about symptoms, they should come forward now. ""We are working to try and match the capacity that we have got, whether it's across the NHS or in the independent sector, to the demand that we can see coming through,"" Prof Johnson said. ""And we're expecting during September and October that we're probably going to see more than the usual number of people as we catch up.""

"Bolton is currently subject to tighter restrictions A returning holidaymaker who went on a pub crawl instead of self-isolating was partly responsible for Bolton's ""extreme spike"" in coronavirus cases, the town's council leader said. David Greenhalgh said the man tested positive for Covid-19 two days after the night out with friends in the town. He said Bolton's high rate had been linked back to pubs and a ""cohort of people"" who refused to follow guidance. It is currently subject to tighter restrictions to halt the rise. Mr Greenhalgh told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the spike ""took us by surprise as we were arguing to have a further easing of restrictions at the time"". He said: ""We had an extreme spike where we went from 12 cases per 100,000 and in less than three weeks we were up at 212 cases."" The rise led Bolton to have thehighest rates of Covid-19 in the country. ""We had somebody who did not adhere to quarantine, did not stay the 14 days, literally went on a pub crawl with a number of mates,"" Mr Greenhalgh said. ""From that incident which took place over a weekend - (they) visited a number of premises - led to a large number of individual transmissions from that one person which you can imagine then is like holding back the tide because he then became symptomatic two days after they had all gone on this pub crawl. ""That is four or five days where all the people he was in contact with have been going about their normal day-to-day business.""

"A British businessman, formerly of MI6, is under investigation for allegedly selling information to undercover spies from China, a Whitehall official says.

He is alleged to have exchanged the information for thousands of Euros. But Mr Camerontold The Times,externalthe allegations were ""ridiculous"".

"John Turner's tenure as prime minister is the second shortest in Canada's history Former Canadian Prime Minister John Turner, who was in office for just 79 days and led his Liberal Party to a huge defeat in 1984, has died aged 91. A lawyer by training, he served as justice and then finance minister from 1968-1975. He resigned after arguments with party leader Pierre Trudeau. Turner resumed his legal work and nine years later won the party leadership. He called an election and then presided over what observers say was one of the worst campaigns in Canadian history. His gaffes combined with growing public fatigue with the Liberals, who had been in power for 20 of the previous 21 years, resulted in his party falling from 135 seats in the 282-member House of Commons to just 40. The Conservatives, under the leadership of Brian Mulroney, swept to power with 211 seats. Despite the result, Turner hung onto his post. In the 1988 election, Turner was a strong opponent of a proposed free trade agreement with the US but lost again to Mr Mulroney, but not as badly. He resigned as a Liberal leader in 1990. Turner spent years as cabinet minister and Liberal Party leader As justice minister, he defended reforms to Canada's Criminal Code that paved the way for LGBTQ rights and legal abortions. But in the finance ministry he faced economic pressures due to the global oil crisis. His 79-day tenure as prime minister is the second shortest in the country's history. Turner died at home in Toronto on Friday night,external, Marc Kealey, a former aide speaking on behalf of his relatives told the Montreal Gazette. He is survived by his wife Geills and four children.

"This video can not be played Thousands have gathered in the Thai capital for Saturday's protests Thousands of people have protested in the Thai capital Bangkok calling for reform of the political system, including the role of the monarchy. It was one of the biggest protests in years with at least 15,000 people, police said. ""Down with feudalism, long live the people,"" chanted some. There were no reports of violence. Since July, rallies have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha who took power in a 2014 coup and won disputed elections last year. Saturday's student-led demonstration moved from the campus of Thammasat University to a park next to a grand palace used for royal ceremonies. Demonstrators say they plan to stay overnight and march to the offices of the prime minister on Sunday morning. ""I hope the people in power will see the importance of the people,"" student leader Panupong ""Mike"" Jadnok, told the crowd, according to Reuters news agency. ""We're fighting to put the monarchy in the right place, not to abolish it."" The calls for royal reform are particularly sensitive in Thailand, with criticism of the monarchy punishable by long prison sentences. Organisers gave a much higher estimate for Saturday's turnout, saying 50,000 people had attended.A protest in August drew around 10,000 protesters. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve. The Future Forward Party (FFP) had proved particularly popular with young, first-time voters and garnered the third-largest share of parliamentary seats in the March 2019 election, which was won by the incumbent military leadership. Saturday's protest in Bangkok was one of the biggest since the 2014 coup Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. His whereabouts remain unknown and protesters accuse the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - something the police and government have denied. Since July there have been regular student-led street protests. Demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who seized power in the coup, be dissolved; that the constitution be rewritten; that the authorities stop harassing critics. Why young people are protesting in Thailand The students risking it all to challenge the monarchy The satirist who vanished in broad daylight Thai lese-majeste explained A series of political scandals, together with the economic disruption caused of Covid-19, have stirred public discontent in Thailand with the government, and sympathy for the student-led protests. The protest leaders hope that with this ambitious rally at the heart of Bangkok's old royal quarter they can keep up the momentum of their movement, which has already pushed the government to agree to discuss changes to the constitution. However, the government and its conservative supporters have denounced the students' other demand, for limits to be imposed on the spending, and on the political and military authority, of the king. The monarchy's status, they say, is untouchable. The protesters have now carried out a symbolic occupation of the park where the biggest royal ceremonies take place; once a large, open, grassy space, it has been fenced off in recent years,  part of what activists say is a worrying expansion of royal power. Publicly involving the monarchy in political disputes is something new in Thailand, an inflammatory move in a country where the institution is officially revered, but, the protest leaders say, one that is an essential prerequisite to modernising the political system. The demands of protesters took an unprecedented turn last month when a 10-point call for reform to the monarchy was read out at one rally. The move sent shockwaves through a country which is taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it. Protesters want Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to step down The young woman who delivered the manifesto, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, has said their intention ""is not to destroy the monarchy but to modernise it, to adapt it to our society"". But she and her fellow activists have been accused of ""chung chart"" - a Thai term meaning ""hatred of the nation"" - and they say they are deeply fearful of the consequences of doing ""the right thing"" by speaking out. Each of Thailand's 19 constitutions of modern times has stated, at the top, that: ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship"" and that ""no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action"". These provisions are backed by article 112 of the criminal code, known as the lese-majeste law, which subjects anyone criticising the royal family to secret trials and long prison sentences. The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy is unclear and human rights groups say the law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and opposition calls for reform and change. One man in 2015 faced up to 15 years in prison for posting images on social media of the then-king's favourite dog in a way that appeared to mock the monarch. Other ways of falling foul of the law include ""liking"" any critical reference on social media, questioning anything from Thai history that could be construed as negative to the monarch, or producing a book or play with characters resembling members of the royal family. The law had been increasingly enforced in the years after the 2014 coup, although it has slowed since King Vajiralongkorn let it be known he no longer wanted it to be so widely used. But observers say the government has used other legal routes, including the sedition law, to target dissent.

"Dominic Raab's bodyguard has been ""removed from operational duties"" after allegedly leaving his gun on a plane at Heathrow. A cleaner is reported to have found the loaded Glock 19 pistol in its holster on a seat on the United Airlines flight after it landed in London on Friday. The foreign secretary had been in Washington DC tospeak to US politicians about Brexit. Scotland Yard said an internal investigation was taking place. The cleaner raised the alarm after finding the weapon,the Sun reported,external, and police boarded the plane - before realising the gun belonged to one of Mr Raab's close protection officers. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""We are aware of the incident on a flight into the UK on Friday 18 September and we are taking this matter extremely seriously. ""The officer involved has since been removed from operational duties whilst an internal investigation into the circumstances is taking place."" The Sun reported that the officer took off his holster and put it on his seat before escorting the foreign secretary off the flight - leaving it behind. Former Met chief superintendent Nick Aldworth told the BBC there were strict rules about the handling of firearms, but that human error does happen. ""This sort of thing is not common, but it does happen,"" he told the Today programme. ""It happens because human beings are in the system and human beings operate under an enormous amount of stress sometimes, particularly when they are managing armed operations or in the middle of an armed operation. ""This appears to be an unfortunate lapse in concentration for which the officer will pay a price in their career, in as much as they have been removed from operational duties, which is something they probably love doing, and sadly for them, will no longer be able to do."" He added that the Met takes such matters ""incredibly seriously"". In February, abodyguard for former prime minister David Cameron was investigatedfor reportedly leaving his gun in a plane toilet. In that incident, the gun was found by a passenger on a British Airways flight from New York to London.  Mr Cameron is entitled to continued security provided by the Metropolitan Police as a former prime minister.

"As climate change becomes a focus of the US election, energy companies stand accused of trying to downplay their contribution to global warming. In June, Minnesota's Attorney General sued ExxonMobil, among others, for launching a ""campaign of deception"" which deliberately tried to undermine the science supporting global warming. So what's behind these claims? And what links them to how the tobacco industry tried to dismiss the harms of smoking decades earlier? To understand what's happening today, we need to go back nearly 40 years. Marty Hoffert leaned closer to his computer screen. He couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. It was 1981, and he was working in an area of science considered niche. ""We were just a group of geeks with some great computers,"" he says now, recalling that moment. But his findings were alarming. ""I created a model that showed the Earth would be warming very significantly. And the warming would introduce climatic changes that would be unprecedented in human history. That blew my mind."" A climate change protester outside the New York State Supreme Court during the ExxonMobil trial in October, 2019 Marty Hoffert was one of the first scientists to create a model which predicted the effects of man-made climate change. And he did so while working for Exxon, one of the world's largest oil companies, which would later merge with another, Mobil. At the time Exxon was spending millions of dollars on ground-breaking research. It wanted to lead the charge as scientists grappled with the emerging understanding that the warming planet could cause the climate to change in ways that could make life pretty difficult for humans. Hoffert shared his predictions with his managers, showing them what might happen if we continued burning fossil fuels in our cars, trucks and planes. Martin Hoffert But he noticed a clash between Exxon's own findings, and public statements made by company bosses, such as the then chief executive Lee Raymond, who said that ""currently, the scientific evidence is inconclusive as to whether human activities are having a significant effect on the global climate"". ""They were saying things that were contradicting their own world-class research groups,"" said Hoffert. Angry, he left Exxon, and went on to become a leading academic in the field. ""What they did was immoral. They spread doubt about the dangers of climate change when their own researchers were confirming how serious a threat it was."" So what changed? The record-breaking hot summer of 1988 was key. Big news in America, it gave extra weight to warnings from Nasa scientist Dr Jim Hansen that ""the greenhouse effect has been detected, and is changing our climate now"". Political leaders took notice. Then UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher acknowledged the great new global threat: ""The environmental challenge which confronts the whole world demands an equivalent response from the whole world."" In 1989, Exxon's strategy chief Duane Levine drew up a confidential presentation for the company's board, one of thousands of documents in the company's archive which were later donated to The University of Texas at Austin. Levine's presentation is an important document, often cited by researchers investigating Exxon's record on climate change science. ""We're starting to hear the inevitable call for action,"" it said, which risked what it called ""irreversible and costly draconian steps"". ""More rational responses will require efforts to extend the science and increase emphasis on costs and political realities."" How they made us doubt everythinginvestigates how some of the world's most powerful interests made us doubt the connection between smoking and cancer, and how the same tactics were used to make us doubt climate change. Listen to the podcast from BBC Radio 4here Kert Davies has scoured through Exxon's archive. He used to work as a research director at the environmental pressure group Greenpeace, where he looked into corporate opposition to climate change. This inspired him to set up The Climate Investigations Centre. He explains why this Exxon presentation mattered: ""They are worried the public will take this on, and enact radical changes in the way we use energy and affect their business, that's the bottom line."" He says this fear can also be seen in another document from the archive that sets out the so-called ""Exxon position"", which was to ""emphasise the uncertainty"" regarding climate change. Researchers argue this was just the start of a decades-long campaign to shape public opinion and to spread doubt about climate change. In June 2020, the General Attorney of Minnesota Keith Ellison sued ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and Koch Industries for misleading the public over climate change. The lawsuit claims that ""previously unknown internal documents confirm that the defendant well understood the devastating effects that their products would cause to the climate"". It says that despite this knowledge, the industry ""engaged in a public-relations campaign that was not only false, but also highly effective,"" which served to ""deliberately [undermine] the science"" of climate change. The accusations against Exxon and others - which the company has called ""baseless and without merit"" - build on years of painstaking research by people like Kert Davies and Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University and co-author of Merchants of Doubt. Naomi Oreskes ""Rather than accept the scientific evidence, they made the decision to fight the facts,"" she said. But this isn't just about Exxon's past actions. In the same year as the Levine presentation, 1989, many energy companies and fossil fuel dependent industries came together to form the Global Climate Coalition, which aggressively lobbied US politicians and media. Then in 1991, the trade body that represents electrical companies in the US, the Edison Electric Institute, created a campaign called the Information Council for the Environment (ICE) which aimed to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not fact)"". Some details of the campaign were leaked to the New York Times. ""They ran advertising campaigns designed to undermine public support, cherry picking the data to say, 'Well if the world is warming up, why is Kentucky getting colder?' They asked rhetorical questions designed to create confusion, to create doubt,"" argued Naomi Oreskes. The ICE campaign identified two groups which would be most susceptible to its messaging. The first was ""older, lesser educated males from larger households who are not typically information seekers"". The second group was ""younger, low-income women,"" who could be targeted with bespoke adverts which would liken those who talked about climate change to a hysterical doom-saying cartoon chicken. The Edison Electric Institute didn't respond to questions about ICE, but told the BBC that its members are ""leading a clean energy transformation, and are united in their commitment to get the energy they provide as clean as they can, as fast as they can"". But back in the 1990 there were many campaigns like this. ""Unless 'climate change' becomes a non-issue,"" says another, leaked to the New York Times in 1997, ""there may be no moment when we can declare victory"". To achieve victory, the industry planned to ""identify, recruit and train a team of five independent scientists to participate in media outreach"". This important tactic assumed the public would be suspicious if oil industry executives dismissed climate change, but might trust the views of seemingly independent scientists. These would be put forward to take part in debates on TV, potentially confusing a general audience who would see opposing scientists in white coats arguing about complex technical details without knowing who to believe. The problem was, sometimes these ""white coats"" weren't truly independent. Some climate sceptic researchers were taking money from the oil industry. Drexel University emeritus professor Bob Brulle studied the funding for the climate change ""counter movement"". He identified 91 institutions which he says either denied or downplayed the risks of climate change, including the Cato Institute and the now-defunct George C Marshall Institute. He found that between 2003 and 2007, ExxonMobil gave $7.2m (Â£5.6m) to such bodies, while between 2008 and 2010, the American Petroleum Institute trade body (API) donated just under $4m (Â£3m). In its 2007 Corporate Citizenship Report, ExxonMobil said it would stop funding such groups in 2008. Of course many researchers would argue such money didn't influence their climate contrarian work. It seems some may have been motivated by something else. Most of the organisations opposing or denying climate change science were right-wing think tanks, who tended to be passionately anti-regulation. These groups made convenient allies for the oil industry, as they would argue against action on climate change on ideological grounds. Jerry Taylor Jerry Taylor spent 23 years with the Cato Institute - one of those right wing think tanks - latterly as vice president. Before he left in 2014, he would regularly appear on TV and radio, insisting that the science of climate change was uncertain and there was no need to act. Now, he realises his arguments were based on a misinterpretation of the science, and he regrets the impact he's had on the debate. ""For 25 years, climate sceptics like me made it a core matter of ideological identity that if you believe in climate change, then you are by definition a socialist. That is what climate sceptics have done."" The BBC asked the Cato Institute about its work on climate change, but it did not respond. This ideological divide has had far-reaching consequences. Polls conducted in May 2020 showed that just 22% of Americans who vote Republican believed climate change is man-made, compared with 72% of Democrats. Unfortunately many of the ""expert scientists"" quoted by journalists to try to offer balance in their coverage of climate change were - like Jerry Taylor - making arguments based on their beliefs rather than relevant research. ""Usually these people have some scientific credentials, but they're not actually experts in climate science,"" says Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes. She began digging into the background of leading climate sceptics, including Fred Seitz, a nuclear physicist and former president of the US National Academy of Sciences. She found he was deeply anti-communist, believing any government intervention in the marketplace ""would put us on the slippery slope to socialism"". She also discovered that he had been active in the debates around smoking in the 1980s. ""That was a Eureka moment. We realised this was not a scientific debate. A person with expertise about climate change would in no way be an expert about oncology or public health or cardiovascular disease, or any of the key issues associated with tobacco. ""The fact that the same people were arguing in both cases was a clue that something fishy was going on. That's what led us to discover this pattern of disinformation that gets systemically used again and again."" Naomi Oreskes spent years going through the tobacco archive at the University of California at San Francisco. It contains more than 14 million documents that were made available thanks to litigation against US tobacco firms. A strikingly familiar story emerged. Decades before the energy industry tried to undermine the case for climate change, tobacco companies had used the same techniques to challenge the emerging links between smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s. Plaza Hotel (Right), Central Park, New York The story began at Christmas 1953. In New York's luxurious Plaza Hotel, the heads of the tobacco companies met to discuss a new threat to their business model. Details of the night's anxious conversations were recorded in a document written by public relations guru John Hill from Hill and Knowlton. Widely read mass-market magazines like Readers Digest and Time Life had begun publishing articles about the association between smoking and lung cancer. And researchers like those who had found that lab mice painted with cigarette tar got cancer were attracting increasing attention. As John Hill wrote in the 1953 document, ""salesmen in the industry are frantically alarmed, and the decline in tobacco stocks on the stock exchange market has caused grave concern"". Hill recommended fighting science with science. ""We do not believe the industry should indulge in any flashy or spectacular ballyhoo. There is no public relations [medicine] known to us at least, which will cure the ills of the industry."" As a later document by tobacco company Brown and Williamson summarised the approach: ""Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the minds of the general public."" Naomi Oreskes says this understanding of the power of doubt is vital. ""They realise they can't win this battle by making a false claim that sooner or later would be exposed. But if they can create doubt, that would be sufficient - because if people are confused about the issue, there's a good chance they'll just keep smoking."" Hill advised setting up the ""Tobacco Industry Research Committee"" to promote ""the existence of weighty scientific views which hold there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer"". As in the climate change debate decades later, ""Project Whitecoat"" would pit scientist against scientist. According to Oreskes, the project targeted those who were already doing research into other causes of cancer or lung conditions - such as asbestos - which the tobacco industry could fund. ""The purpose of these programmes was not to advance scientific understanding, it was to create enough confusion that the American people would doubt the existing scientific evidence."" Journalists were one of the tobacco industry's main targets. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee held meetings in its offices in the Empire State Building for major newspaper editors. It even persuaded one of the most famous broadcast journalists of the time, Edward R Murrow, to interview its experts. The eventual edition of Murrow's celebrated television programme ""See It Now"" - broadcast in 1955 -shows Project Whitecoat in action, with tobacco industry funded scientists set against independent researchers. But as would happen later with climate change, it was difficult for the audience at home to form an opinion when opposing scientists contradicted each other. Even Murrow ended up on the fence. ""We have no credentials for reaching conclusions on this subject,"" he said. If doubt was the industry's true product, then it appeared to be a roaring success. For decades, none of the legal challenges launched against the tobacco companies themselves succeeded. This was partly due to the effectiveness of Project Whitecoat, as an internal memo from tobacco firm RJ Reynolds in May 1979 concludes: ""Due to favourable scientific testimony, no plaintiff has ever collected a penny from any tobacco company in lawsuits claiming that smoking causes lung cancer or cardiovascular illness - even though 117 such cases have been brought since 1954."" But pressure on the tobacco companies continued to mount. In 1997, the industry paid $350m (Â£272m) to settle a class action brought by flight attendants who had developed lung cancer and other illnesses which they argued were caused by second-hand cigarette smoke from passengers. This settlement paved the way to a landmark ruling in 2006, when Judge Gladys Kessler found US tobacco companies guilty of fraudulently misrepresenting the health risks associated with smoking. Judge Kessler detailed how the industry ""marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs"". Flight attendant Norma Broin was the lead plaintiff in the passive smoking class action after developing lung cancer, despite being a non-smoker The tobacco companies may have eventually lost their battle to hide the harms of smoking, but the blueprint drawn up by John Hill and his colleagues proved to be very effective. ""What he wrote is the same memo we have seen in multiple industries subsequently,"" says David Michaels, professor of public health at George Washington University, and author of The Triumph of Doubt, which details how the pesticides, plastics and sugar industries have also used these tactics. ""We called it 'the tobacco playbook', because the tobacco industry was so successful. ""They made a product that killed millions of people across the world, and the science has been very strong [about that] for many years, but through this campaign to manufacture uncertainty, they were able to delay first, formal recognition of the terrible impact of tobacco, and then delay regulation and defeat litigation for decades, with obviously terrible consequences."" We asked Hill and Knowlton about its work for the tobacco companies, but it did not respond. In a statement, ExxonMobil told the BBC that ""allegations about the company's climate research are inaccurate and deliberately misleading"". ""For more than 40 years, we have supported development of climate science in partnership with governments and academic institutions. That work continues today in an open and transparent way. ""Deliberately cherry-picked statements attributed to a small number of employees wrongly suggest definitive conclusions were reached decades ago."" ExxonMobil added that it recently won the court case brought by the New York Attorney General which had accused the company of fraudulently accounting for the costs of climate change regulation. But academics like David Michaels fear the use of uncertainty in the past to confuse the public and undermine science has contributed to a dangerous erosion of trust in facts and experts across the globe today, far beyond climate science or the dangers of tobacco. He cites public attitudes to modern issues like the safety of 5G, vaccinations - and coronavirus. ""By cynically manipulating and distorting scientific evidence, the manufacturers of doubt have seeded in much of the public a cynicism about science, making it far more difficult to convince people that science provides useful - in some cases, vitally important - information. ""There is no question that this distrust of science and scientists is making it more difficult to stem the coronavirus pandemic."" It seems the legacy of ""the tobacco playbook"" lives on.

"People sit outside restaurants and bars in London's Soho district on Saturday evening Boris Johnson is spending the weekend considering whether to tighten Covid-19 measures in England, after saying the UK was ""now seeing a second wave"". The government is understood to be looking at a ban on households mixing, and reducing opening hours for pubs. At least 13.5 million people, roughly one in five of the UK population, are already facing local restrictions. It came as the PM announcednew fines for those avoiding self-isolation. Former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson said new measures were needed ""sooner rather than later"". The scientist, whose advice was crucial to the decision to go into lockdown in March, said: ""If we leave it another two to four weeks, we will be back at [infection] levels we were seeing more like mid-March. ""That's clearly going to cause deaths because people will be hospitalised,"" he told the BBC. New virus rules 'inevitable': The view near No 10 Can a 'circuit break' halt the second Covid wave? My neighbours are breaking the rules - what should I say? Mr Johnson only has direct power over restrictions in England. The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can set their own rules. Widespread growth of the virus has been recorded across the country, with cases doubling every seven to eight days. There were a further 4,422 confirmed UK cases on Saturday and 27 deaths. Friday was the first time the daily total of positive tests had exceeded 4,000 since 8 May. A further350 cases were reported on Saturday in Scotland, the highest daily increase since May,212 new cases in Wales, and222 in Northern Ireland. In Bolton,one returning holidaymaker, who did not self-isolate and instead went on a pub crawl, is being partly blamedfor the town's spike in cases. Meanwhile,governments across Europe have announced new restrictionsto tackle the surge in infections. Speaking on Friday, Mr Johnson said he did not ""want to go into bigger lockdown measures"" but that tighter social distancing rules might be necessary. He added: ""Clearly when you look at what is happening, you have got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in on Monday."" The government is understood to beconsidering a short period of tighter rules across England- ""a circuit break"" - which could involve closing hospitality venues. However, schools and workplaces would stay open. This video can not be played Newcastle pub-goers adapt to new coronavirus measures No 10 is also looking at limiting the opening hours of pubs and restaurants across the country, as has alreadyhappened in many areas of north-east England,where pubs had to close at 22:00 BST on Friday. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner called for the government to hold an emergency Cobra meeting, look at the science and improve its communication so ""people can do the right thing"". ""If the government are able to do that, we will back them,"" she told the BBC. She also said it had been ""shocking"" to see how ""monumentally"" the government's test and trace system had failed. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? UK coronavirus cases up by 4,422 on Saturday Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford are also calling for a Cobra meeting. Ms Sturgeon saidthe next few days would be ""critical""to avoid another full-scale lockdown in Scotland. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was extremely concernedby evidence of the accelerating speed with which coronavirus was spreading in the capital. ""We will be considering some of the measures which have already been imposed in other parts of the UK,"" he said. ""I am of the firm view that we should not wait, as happened six months ago, for this virus to again spiral out of control before taking action."" In London on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police said officers had made 32 arrests during an anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown protest in Trafalgar Square. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the R number - representing the number of people an infected person will pass the virus on to - had risen to between 1.1 and 1.4. Although deaths remain at a very low level, Sage said the rise in the R number ""shows that we are moving to wider spread growth in transmission at a faster rate"". The sharp rise in UK cases over the last two weeks comes amid ongoing problems with the government's test and trace programme, leading to people struggling to access tests. Prof Neil Ferguson said a two-week mini lockdown could help to ""reset"" the virus. ""We have a perfect storm right now, of people - as they've been told to - getting back to normal, schools reopening, a surge in cases and therefore the testing system is under strain,"" he told the BBC. ""Unfortunately we do have to roll the relaxation of measures back a little bit and get contacts down in the population."" Asked if this should mean more restrictions on going abroad, he said the bigger risk was normal everyday interactions, which needed to be ""dialled back a little"". The question is no longer where we are, but where we are heading. Yes, the number of people infected, in hospital with Covid or dying from the disease are all at far lower levels than at the peak. Scientists will quibble about the exact definition of a ""second wave"", but all data points to rising numbers of infections. The government's science advisers say the number is now doubling every week. If those trends continue then infections could go from the estimated 6,000-a-day to more than 100,000 by mid-October. It is that trajectory, which is not written in stone, the government is trying to change. There are questions for politicians, from whether it should do a ""circuit-break"" to improving Test and Trace. But, with evidence suggestingonly one in five people are following the self-isolation rules,externalwhen they get sick, there are also questions for all of us. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) has urged the government to introduce tighter measures in England to avoid another national lockdown, including toughening up the rule of six. It said the rule makes it possible for six households to meet indoors potentially several times in a day and it is suggesting the number of households should be reduced.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: Follow rules or 'more stringent enforcement' coming Restrictions will get tougher if rules are not followed, Matt Hancock says, as Â£10,000 fines for those who fail to self-isolate are introduced in England. The health secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the country was facing a ""tipping point and we have a choice"". The prime minister is understood to be considering a ban on households mixing, and reducing opening hours for pubs. On Monday there will be a briefing on the latest coronavirus data led by two of the government's leading scientists. In the broadcast, at about 11:00 BST on Monday, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, with Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, is expected to say the trend in the UK ""is heading in the wrong direction"" with the country at a ""critical point in the pandemic"". ""We are looking at the data to see how to manage the spread of the virus ahead of a very challenging winter period,"" Prof Whitty is due to say. Earlier, asked if England could face another national lockdown, Mr Hancock said: ""I don't rule it out, I don't want to see it."" ""If everybody follows the rules then we can avoid further national lockdown,"" he said. In the BBC interview, he also: Said he would call the police on people who refused to self-isolate Denied the government was overreacting given deaths and hospital admissions remain relatively low Said there was still hope a vaccine would get ""over the line"" this year The move under consideration by PM Boris Johnson could take the form of a two-week mini lockdown in England - being referred to as a ""circuit breaker"" - in an aim to stem a recent surge in cases. On Sunday, a further 3,899 new Covid-19 cases and 18 deathswere reported in the UK. Meanwhile,visitors have flocked to Blackpool this weekend, despite police warning against having a ""last blast"" in the resort before tighter restrictions come into force in the rest of Lancashire on Tuesday. Elsewhere, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has saidhe will meet council leaders on Mondayand then recommend any London-specific measures to ministers. He believes the capital city may be just ""two or three days"" behind the hotspots of the north-west and north-east of England. Can a 'circuit break' halt the second Covid wave? New virus rules 'inevitable': The view near No 10 What are the rules for meeting my friends? People in England who refuse an order to self-isolate could be fined up to Â£10,000 from 28 September. The new legal duty requires people to self-isolate if they test positive for coronavirus, or are traced as a close contact. New measures also include a one-off Â£500 support payment for those on lower incomes, and a penalty for employers who punish those told to self-isolate. Fines will initially start at Â£1,000 rising to Â£10,000 for repeat offenders, and for ""the most egregious breaches"". Until now, advice to self-isolate has been guidance only. More than 19,000 fines have been issued in England and Wales for alleged breaches of coronavirus laws, the attorney general said earlier this week, but more than half have not been paid so far. The idea of introducing fines sounds good on paper, given it is believed only one in five people fully self-isolate when they need to. But there is real concern it will have an unintended consequence - and end up discouraging people from having a test in the first place or taking calls from contact tracers. Self-isolation can be costly for some in terms of lost income and job security (even with the offer of Â£500 payments). There is now growing concern among experts - both those advising government and those looking in from the outside - about the path being taken by ministers. First of all, the messaging is confusing. One minute the public is being told to Eat Out to Help Out and to get back into the office, then they are being told to curb their mixing and not to gather in groups of more than six. There is also a growing sense that the public is tiring of the battle to contain the virus with ever more draconian messages. The idea of curbing the spread of the virus to stop the NHS being overwhelmed brought people together in the spring. But what is the aim now the NHS was not overwhelmed? Suppression of a virus that clearly can't be suppressed without a huge cost to society? As Prof Robert Dingwall, a government adviser, put it last week, this virus is here ""forever and a day"" and the public may just be growing comfortable with the idea that people will die - just as they accept that people die of flu ever year. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson told the Sun he had ""never much been in favour of sneak culture, myself"" and people should speak to Covid rule-breakers before reporting them to the police. In contrast, Mr Hancock said he would call the police on his neighbour if they were breaking rules, saying it was ""absolutely necessary"" to break the chains of transmission. Asked whether the government's response was an overreaction given coronavirus death rates were still low, Mr Hancock said the number of hospital admissions was rising and an increase in deaths would follow. He said he was ""very worried"" about the latest data which suggested the UK could be on the same path as Spain and France - where deaths and hospitalisations are increasing - without effective action. ""We have seen in other countries when the case rate shoots up, the next thing that happens is the numbers going into hospital shoot up,"" he said. ""Sadly, we have seen that rise, it is doubling every eight days or so - people going into hospital - then, with a lag, you see the number of people dying sadly rise."" He said it was worth comparing the UK to Spain - where the number of cases have been increasing - and Belgium - which appears to have reversed an upward trend - saying ""one gives the warning, the other gives us hope"". Currently, large swathes of the UK, where cases have spiked, are living under tighter local restrictions. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned London could be next. Mr Hancock, who has spoken to the mayor this weekend, told Times Radiohe would not rule out the possibility that Londoners could be told this week to avoid the commuteand get back to working from home. Mr Hancock said he remained hopeful that a vaccine would be ready before the end of the year. ""We have got the cavalry coming over the next few months - the vaccine, the mass testing and the improvements in treatments - but we have got to all follow the rules between now and then to keep people safe,"" he added. My neighbours are breaking the rules - what should I say? Starmer calls for apology over testing 'collapse' New virus rules 'inevitable': The view near No 10 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he supported the new fines, saying it was important to take action against the few people who were not complying. He also said he would back a future lockdown in order to reinforce the government's message. ""In the end this is not about party politics, this is about getting the nation through this virus,"" he added. The UK government hopes the new fines will be replicatedin Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - which all have powers to set their own coronavirus rules. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Martin Wolstencroft says restaurants have no idea how to plan for Christmas A resurgence of coronavirus has led the government to impose new restrictions on millions of people across the UK. For many restaurants, pubs and bars, the new rules have come just as business is picking up once again. ""Another lockdown would be disastrous for our business,"" the boss of a bar chain, Martin Wolstencroft, has said. ""We've done so well to get through the national lockdown, we reopened on 4 July with measures in place, we rebuilt.. and it's really frustrating."" Mr Wolstencroft runs Arc Inspirations, which owns 17 bars and bar restaurants in Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle. Its Newcastle site is affected by the new restrictions announced on Friday, which require bars and pubs to shut between 22:00 and 05:00. â¢Covid: New restrictions in North West, Midlands and West Yorkshire â¢Restaurants at 'critical risk' of eviction â¢Coronavirus: How are pubs keeping customers safe? New rules limiting gatherings to six people have also impacted his business, leading to 3,000 bookings being cancelled at Arc Inspirations' Manchester venues since the restriction came into effect a week ago. Mr Wolstencroft is now really worried about Christmas - traditionally the busiest season of the year for the hospitality industry: ""We were projecting our sales to be 20% down for the rest of the year without another lockdown. ""But over Christmas, if there are more measures in place, we will be in excess of 50% down,"" he says. We need that sales and profit which helps us through the rest of the year."" He says many customers are struggling to understand the increased regulations, and the uncertainty is making things worse for hospitality firms. ""It's just very, very frustrating trying to manage a business when you don't know what and when is going to happen in the future,"" he says. According to trade group UK Hospitality, the British hospitality sector is now ""on a knife-edge"", and 1 million people employed in the industry remain at risk of losing their jobs. ""Despite the boost delivered by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, consumer confidence is still low and it takes a further beating whenever lockdowns or restrictions are mentioned,"" says UK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""If lockdowns or restrictions are needed, they need to be formulated carefully, and come with government support, to minimise the damage to business."" She stresses that even having a hospitality venue close just an hour earlier ""has a huge impact"" on its business. Peter Borg-Neal says the hospitality industry is being ""picked on"" by the government's restrictions Peter Borg-Neal is the chairman of Oakman Inns, a chain of 25 pubs and hotels spread across Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire. He doesn't think that people socialising in restaurants and pubs is the main cause for the virus spreading, when ""yesterday there were only nine cases in the entire county [Buckinghamshire], out of half a million people"". According to data from real estate adviser Altus Group, the new curfew and restrictions of sales of food and drink to table service will affect one in 10 pubs in England. ""If the government wants to enforce further rules than it needs to be very specific - if the individual pub or restaurant doesn't comply, well close them,"" Mr Borg-Neal said. ""Don't pick on the people who are working really hard to get the economy moving again, working really hard to protect their customers and their employees."" Mr Borg-Neal wants the government to provide businesses with even more financial support if the hospitality industry has to be closed once again, or many will not survive. And he thinks a blanket policy to close restaurants, pubs and bars will have unintended consequences. ""If they close all the pubs, what will happen? Students will be gathering in tiny flats and bedsits with a bottle of cider,"" he stresses. ""It will be far, far worse. It makes no sense on public health grounds to close pubs."" Jonathan Gillespie says his pub will find a way to serve customers, no matter what happens While many hospitality firms are unhappy with the government's restrictions, some are in favour of it, like The Steam Packet pub in Chiswick, London, which is owned by pub chain Brunning and Price. ""We've suffered in terms of numbers as we're a small pub, but people are coming back in because they feel safe,"" pub manager Jonathan Gillespie tells the BBC. ""We will follow the government's regulations as they've made people feel safe."" He is worried about the future, but says it is difficult to predict what will happen: ""I am concerned about the impact it will have on my business but I don't know what it will look like. Mr Gillespie says his business is good at finding solutions to difficult challenges, and will continue to do so. ""Here we're doing takeaway food and drinks from a hatch, you can buy fish and chips or a pint and take it to go sit by the river and socially distance,"" he says. ""That's something that's really helped our business."" New Covid-19 rules for North West and Midlands Restaurants at 'critical risk' of eviction What will pubs, cafes and gigs be like from 19 July?

"There are fears muntjac deer could appear in Scotland Scotland's wildlife is increasingly at risk from non-native species, according to the country's nature agency. NatureScot says there are more than 180 species - 122 plants and about 60 animals - which pose threats such as killing wildlife or damaging habitats. But how have these species arrived here - and which are seen as the next big threat? Pink salmon, which are native to Pacific Ocean waters, have been found in Scottish rivers Some reached Scotland on the hulls or in the ballast of ships, while others have escaped from gardens, private animal collections or zoos. Other species have spread from elsewhere in Great Britain and continental Europe. Pink salmon, a fish native to Pacific Ocean waters, have been appearing in Scottish rivers in recent years. It spread to parts of northern Europe after being released into rivers in Russia in the 1960s. ""Unprecedented numbers"" were found in Scottish rivers in 2017and were filmed spawning in the River Ness in the Highlands. Anglers reported seeing the fish again last year. Abandoned exotic pets also pose a potential threat. Last week, several tropical fish were found in the River Ness at Inverness. The warm water fish, which did not survive long in the cold river, may have had diseases harmful to native species. Crayfish pose a threat to native freshwater species NatureScot said the worst invasive species included carpet sea-squirt, a marine animal originating from Japan that ""smothers"" seabed habitats. It has been found in the Clyde and parts of Argyll. Brownish with a leathery texture, carpet sea-squirt grows quickly and covers over areas of seabed, including fish spawning and feeding grounds. North America signal crayfish have been found at more than 20 locations in Scotland, includinglochs in Dumfries and Gallowayand a quarry pondin the Highlands. The crayfish have been described as an ""aggressive"" predator that kills native freshwater animals and burrows into riverbanks, causing erosion. They feed on fish eggs, as well as young salmon, trout and plants. The threat they pose to wildlife is considered so serious that it is illegal to put even accidentally-caught crayfish back into water. The advice is to kill them instead. Giant hogweed can be found on riverbanks Some of the plants posing risks to native species were brought to Scotland by private collectors in the 19th and 20th Centuries. They have spread into the wild and in some places have taken over. In these areas native species have become scarce or died out. Dense growths of Japanese knotweeds, giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam have been found on riverbanks. They support fewer species of insects than native plants, and when they die back in winter they leave river banks bare and prone to flood erosion. Efforts to tackle their spread include work in North Harris to control giant rhubarb and efforts led by Forestry and Land Scotland to remove rhododendron. In Argyll, NatureScot has funded a community project to eradicate rhododendron in Glen Creran. Killer shrimp could be one of the next invasive species to appear in Scotland NatureScot - formerly known as Scottish Natural Heritage - is asking people to look out for species it expects could soon arrive in the country. They include 3cm (1in) long freshwater killer shrimp, which were first recorded in the UK in 2010 but have not yet been seen in Scotland. The shrimp can outcompete rivals for food. It preys on an array of species, including other shrimp, damsel flies and aquatic insects like water boatmen. Killer shrimp have been linked to local extinctions in other countries, and research has suggested that it could be altering the behaviour of other speciesthrough fear alone. Scientists found the creatures it preyed on expended more energy trying to evade the shrimp than on normal behaviours. There are also fears about the introduction of muntjac, a deer that originates from China and is described as ""one of the most destructive non-native animals in Britain"". Dubbed the ""Asbo Bambi"" because it is considered such a nuisance, the deer can damage woodlands, crops and gardens. They have been present in England since the late 19th Century. In Scotland, it is illegal to the keep the deer without a licence and it is an offence to release them into the wild. Exotic fish have been found dumped in the River Ness NatureScot said there had been a ""dramatic increase"" in the number of non-native species arriving and becoming established since the start of the 19th Century. The State of Nature Scotland 2019 report,externalsuggested there was no sign of this trend slowing down. The UK's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) believes about 25 invasive species have become established in Great Britain in the last 20 years. It estimates that between 36 and 48 new species could become established in the next two decades. NatureScot said non-native species were one of the biggest threats to Scotland's wildlife, and cost industries like agriculture and forestry hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The agency aims to prevent their introduction and spread in the first place. ""Everyone has a responsibility to help stop the spread of invasive non-native species,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Pets should never be released into to the wild - it's cruel as well as dangerous for wildlife."" Mink have almost been eradicated from parts of the Western Isles NatureScot says the American mink is a ""voracious predator"" which preys on ground-nesting birds and water voles. Those found in Scotland and other parts of Great Britain are descended from mink that escaped or were deliberately released from fur trade farms in the 1950s and 60s. There has been an effort to control their numbers and even eradicate them from some areas. Trapping by the Hebridean Mink Project in the Western Isles has reduced their numbers to ""very low"" in Lewis and Harris, where no young mink have been caught since 2015. The animals have also been ""largely removed"" from Uist. Mink are also a target species for the Scottish Invasive Species Initiative. The project has been working with 10 fisheries trusts and the University of Aberdeen to control mink along with other invasive species at sites in a large area of northern Scotland.

"A new taskforce will meet next week to kick-start the recovery of cancer services across the NHS in England. Charities believe the pandemic has led to a significant reduction in people being referred for urgent cancer treatment. Cancer Research UK says three million people have missed cancer screenings since March. The taskforce aims to investigate how to ensure more people are referred, tested and checked. At Liverpool's new Clatterbridge cancer centre, which opened in June, treatment is up and running. The coronavirus meant face-to-face contacts with patients like Ian Crompton were greatly reduced. Ian has previously been treated for prostate cancer, which meant he had to self-isolate throughout lockdown. Now he needs a scan to make sure all is well. So his first appointment actually meeting staff has come as something of a relief. ""With being in isolation, in lockdown, you felt alone,"" Ian says. ""I find consultations face to face a lot better because you can ask questions. ""On the phone, there's no eye contact, which I find unusual."" Services are now starting to come back up to speed, but there is a significant backlog of patients who need treatment. It's also estimated that around 350,000 fewer patients than normal have been referred for an urgent cancer investigation. This video can not be played Hatti Gayner, 28, described a lump she'd found in her breast to a GP over the phone Hatti Gayner is a dancer and performer, who appeared with her group on BBC TV's The Greatest Dancer earlier this year. A lively and chatty Geordie, the 28-year-old is now undergoing treatment for breast cancer. She's being supported by the Trekstock charity, which helps younger people who have been diagnosed with cancer. Towards the end of lockdown she found a lump in her breast, but she had to make do with a telephone consultation with her GP. Initially she was told it might be an abscess or a cyst and was prescribed antibiotics. But her mum told her to push for a face-to-face consultation - and when that happened, it became clear it was much more serious. ""I'm a young girl, 28. I'm not a hypochondriac, I don't just phone up about nothing,"" she says. ""I know they don't know that, necessarily, but I think I should have been seen and I think I should have been examined."" Infection control and social distancing mean it now takes longer to treat people safely, and there are concerns about how much capacity there is to reduce the backlog of patients. NHS England says that between March and July of this year, more than 207,000 people started cancer treatment. That's around 85% of the number the NHS in England treated in the same period in 2019. Meanwhile a taskforce, involving all the main cancer charities and organisations such as the Royal College of GPs, will start work next week. The body, led by Prof Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer in England, aims to ensure more people are checked and tested. ""People have been staying away because they didn't want to put pressure on the NHS when it was busy coping with a huge number of people with the coronavirus,"" he said. ""We're very keen that they should come back, and if anybody's worried about symptoms, they should come forward now. ""We are working to try and match the capacity that we have got, whether it's across the NHS or in the independent sector, to the demand that we can see coming through,"" Prof Johnson said. ""And we're expecting during September and October that we're probably going to see more than the usual number of people as we catch up.""

"This video can not be played Thousands have gathered in the Thai capital for Saturday's protests Thousands of people have protested in the Thai capital Bangkok calling for reform of the political system, including the role of the monarchy. It was one of the biggest protests in years with at least 15,000 people, police said. ""Down with feudalism, long live the people,"" chanted some. There were no reports of violence. Since July, rallies have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha who took power in a 2014 coup and won disputed elections last year. Saturday's student-led demonstration moved from the campus of Thammasat University to a park next to a grand palace used for royal ceremonies. Demonstrators say they plan to stay overnight and march to the offices of the prime minister on Sunday morning. ""I hope the people in power will see the importance of the people,"" student leader Panupong ""Mike"" Jadnok, told the crowd, according to Reuters news agency. ""We're fighting to put the monarchy in the right place, not to abolish it."" The calls for royal reform are particularly sensitive in Thailand, with criticism of the monarchy punishable by long prison sentences. Organisers gave a much higher estimate for Saturday's turnout, saying 50,000 people had attended.A protest in August drew around 10,000 protesters. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve. The Future Forward Party (FFP) had proved particularly popular with young, first-time voters and garnered the third-largest share of parliamentary seats in the March 2019 election, which was won by the incumbent military leadership. Saturday's protest in Bangkok was one of the biggest since the 2014 coup Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. His whereabouts remain unknown and protesters accuse the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - something the police and government have denied. Since July there have been regular student-led street protests. Demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who seized power in the coup, be dissolved; that the constitution be rewritten; that the authorities stop harassing critics. Why young people are protesting in Thailand The students risking it all to challenge the monarchy The satirist who vanished in broad daylight Thai lese-majeste explained A series of political scandals, together with the economic disruption caused of Covid-19, have stirred public discontent in Thailand with the government, and sympathy for the student-led protests. The protest leaders hope that with this ambitious rally at the heart of Bangkok's old royal quarter they can keep up the momentum of their movement, which has already pushed the government to agree to discuss changes to the constitution. However, the government and its conservative supporters have denounced the students' other demand, for limits to be imposed on the spending, and on the political and military authority, of the king. The monarchy's status, they say, is untouchable. The protesters have now carried out a symbolic occupation of the park where the biggest royal ceremonies take place; once a large, open, grassy space, it has been fenced off in recent years,  part of what activists say is a worrying expansion of royal power. Publicly involving the monarchy in political disputes is something new in Thailand, an inflammatory move in a country where the institution is officially revered, but, the protest leaders say, one that is an essential prerequisite to modernising the political system. The demands of protesters took an unprecedented turn last month when a 10-point call for reform to the monarchy was read out at one rally. The move sent shockwaves through a country which is taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it. Protesters want Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to step down The young woman who delivered the manifesto, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, has said their intention ""is not to destroy the monarchy but to modernise it, to adapt it to our society"". But she and her fellow activists have been accused of ""chung chart"" - a Thai term meaning ""hatred of the nation"" - and they say they are deeply fearful of the consequences of doing ""the right thing"" by speaking out. Each of Thailand's 19 constitutions of modern times has stated, at the top, that: ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship"" and that ""no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action"". These provisions are backed by article 112 of the criminal code, known as the lese-majeste law, which subjects anyone criticising the royal family to secret trials and long prison sentences. The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy is unclear and human rights groups say the law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and opposition calls for reform and change. One man in 2015 faced up to 15 years in prison for posting images on social media of the then-king's favourite dog in a way that appeared to mock the monarch. Other ways of falling foul of the law include ""liking"" any critical reference on social media, questioning anything from Thai history that could be construed as negative to the monarch, or producing a book or play with characters resembling members of the royal family. The law had been increasingly enforced in the years after the 2014 coup, although it has slowed since King Vajiralongkorn let it be known he no longer wanted it to be so widely used. But observers say the government has used other legal routes, including the sedition law, to target dissent.

The cleaner raised the alarm after finding the weapon,the Sun reported,external, and police boarded the plane - before realising the gun belonged to one of Mr Raab's close protection officers.

"US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the history-making jurist, feminist icon and national treasure, has died, aged 87. Ginsburg became only the second woman ever to serve as a justice on the nation's highest court. She struggled against blatant sexism throughout her career as she climbed to the pinnacle of her profession. A lifelong advocate of gender equality, she was fond of joking that there would be enough women on the nine-seat Supreme Court ""when there are nine"". She did not let up in her twilight years, remaining a scathing dissenter on a conservative-tilting bench, even while her periodic health scares left liberal America on edge. Despite maintaining a modest public profile, like most top judges, Ginsburg inadvertently became not just a celebrity, but a pop-culture heroine. She may have stood an impish 5ft, but Ginsburg will be remembered as a legal colossus. She was born to Jewish immigrant parents in the Flatbush neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York City, in 1933 at the height of the Great Depression. Her mother, Celia Bader, died of cancer the day before Ginsburg left high school. She attended Cornell University, where she met Martin ""Marty"" Ginsburg on a blind date, kindling a romance that spanned almost six decades until his death in 2010. This video can not be played Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg remembered ""Meeting Marty was by far the most fortunate thing that ever happened to me,"" Ginsburg once said, adding that the man who would become her husband ""was the first boy I ever knew who cared that I had a brain"". The couple married shortly after Ginsburg's graduation in 1954 and they had a daughter, Jane, the following year. While she was pregnant, Ginsburg was demoted in her job at a social security office - discrimination against pregnant women was still legal in the 1950s. The experience led her to conceal her second pregnancy before she gave birth to her son, James, in 1965. Ginsburg in 1977 In 1956, Ginsburg became one of nine women accepted to Harvard Law School, out of a class of about 500, where the dean famously asked that his female students tell him how they could justify taking the place of a man at his school. When Marty, also a Harvard Law alumnus, took a job as a tax lawyer in New York, Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School to complete her third and final year, becoming the first woman to work at both colleges' law reviews. Despite finishing top of her class, Ginsburg did not receive a single job offer after graduation. ""Not a law firm in the entire city of New York would employ me,"" she later said. ""I struck out on three grounds: I was Jewish, a woman and a mother."" She wound up on a project studying civil procedure in Sweden before becoming a professor at Rutgers Law School, where she taught some of the first classes on women and the law. ""The women's movement came alive at the end of the 60s,"" she said to NPR. ""There I was, a law school professor with time that I could devote to moving along this change."" In 1971, Ginsburg made her first successful argument before the Supreme Court, when she filed the lead brief in Reed v Reed, which examined whether men could be automatically preferred over women as estate executors. ""In very recent years, a new appreciation of women's place has been generated in the United States,"" the brief states. ""Activated by feminists of both sexes, courts and legislatures have begun to recognise the claim of women to full membership in the class 'persons' entitled to due process guarantees of life and liberty and the equal protection of the laws."" The court agreed with Ginsburg, marking the first time the Supreme Court had struck down a law because of gender-based discrimination. In 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). That same year, Ginsburg became the first tenured female professor at Columbia Law School. She was soon the ACLU's general counsel, launching a series of gender-discrimination cases. Six of these brought her before the Supreme Court, five of which she won. She compared her role to that of a ""kindergarten teacher"", explaining gender discrimination to the all-male justices. Her approach was cautious and highly strategic. She favoured incrementalism, thinking it wise to dismantle sexist laws and policies one by one, rather than run the risk of asking the Supreme Court to outlaw all rules that treat men and women unequally. Cognisant of her exclusively male audience on the court, Ginsburg's clients were often men. In 1975, she argued the case of a young widower who was denied benefits after his wife died in childbirth. ""His case was the perfect example of how gender-based discrimination hurts everyone,"" Ginsburg said. She later said leading the legal side of the women's movement during this period - decades before joining the Supreme Court - counted as her greatest professional work. ""I had the good fortune to be alive in the 1960s, then, and continuing through the 1970s,"" she said. ""For the first time in history it became possible to urge before the courts successfully that equal justice under law requires all arms of government to regard women as persons equal in stature to men."" In 1980, Ginsburg was nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia as part of President Jimmy Carter's efforts to diversify federal courts. Though Ginsburg was often portrayed as a liberal firebrand, her days on the appeals court were marked by moderation. She earned a reputation as a centrist, voting with conservatives many times and against, for example, re-hearing the discrimination case of a sailor who said he had been discharged from the US Navy for being gay. Ginsburg with Senators Daniel Moynihan (left) and Joe Biden in 1993 She was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton after a lengthy search process. Ginsburg was the second woman ever confirmed to that bench, following Sandra Day O'Connor, who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Among Ginsburg's most significant, early cases was United States v Virginia, which struck down the men-only admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute. While Virginia ""serves the state's sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters. That is not equal protection"", Ginsburg wrote for the court's majority. No law or policy should deny women ""full citizenship stature - equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities."" Ginsburg at her Senate confirmation hearing During her time on the bench, Justice Ginsburg moved noticeably to the left. She served as a counterbalance to the court itself, which, with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh by President Donald Trump, slanted in favour of conservative justices. Her dissents were forceful - occasionally biting - and Ginsburg did not shy away from criticising her colleagues' opinions. In 2013, objecting to the court's decision to strike down a significant portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a 5-to-4 vote, Ginsburg wrote: ""The Court's opinion can hardly be described as an exemplar of restrained and moderate decision making."" The US Supreme Court justices pose for their official portrait in November 2018 In 2015, Ginsburg sided with the majority on two landmark cases - both massive victories for American progressives. She was one of six justices to uphold a crucial component of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. In the second, Obergefell v Hodges, she sided with the 5-4 majority, legalising same-sex marriage in all 50 states. As Ginsburg's legal career soared, her personal life was anchored by marriage to Marty. Their relationship reflected a gender parity that was ahead of its time. The couple shared the childcare and housework, and Marty did virtually all of the cooking. ""I learned very early on in our marriage that Ruth was a fairly terrible cook and, for lack of interest, unlikely to improve,"" he said in a 1996 speech. Professionally, Marty was a relentless champion of his wife. Clinton officials said it was his tireless lobbying that brought Ginsburg's name to the shortlist of potential Supreme Court nominees in 1993. He reportedly told a friend that the most important thing he did in his own life ""is to enable Ruth to do what she has done"". After her confirmation, Ginsburg thanked Marty, ""who has been, since our teenage years, my best friend and biggest booster"". Marty Ginsburg holds the Bible for his wife as she is sworn in as Supreme Court Justice In his final weeks, facing his own battle with cancer, Marty wrote a letter to his wife saying that other than parents and kids, ""you are the only person I have loved in my life. ""I have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at Cornell."" He died in June 2010 after 56 years of marriage. The next morning Ginsburg was on the bench at the Supreme Court to read an opinion on the final day of the term ""because [Marty] would have wanted it"", she later told the New Yorker magazine. Ginsburg had five major run-ins with cancer herself. Justice O'Connor, who had breast cancer in the 1980s, was said to have suggested that Ginsburg schedule chemotherapy for Fridays so she could use the weekend to recover for oral arguments. It worked: Ginsburg only missed oral arguments twice because of illness. Ginsburg said she also followed the advice of opera singer Marilyn Horne, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2005. ""She said, 'I will live,'"" Ginsburg recalled to NPR. ""Not that, 'I hope I live', or, 'I want to live', but, 'I will live.'"" Her longevity brought immense relief to liberal America, which fretted that another vacancy on the court would allow its conservative majority to become even more ascendant during the Trump era. Toward the end of her life, Ginsburg became a national icon. Due in part to her withering dissents, a young law student created a Tumblr account dedicated to Ginsburg called Notorious RBG - a nod to the late rapper The Notorious BIG. The account introduced Ginsburg to a new generation of young feminists and propelled her to that rarest of distinctions for a judge: she became a cult figure. The Notorious RBG was the subject of a documentary, an award-winning biopic and countless bestselling novels. She inspired Saturday Night Live skits and had her likeness plastered on mugs and T-shirts. ""It was beyond my wildest imagination that I would one day become the Notorious RBG,"" she said. ""I am now 86 years old and yet people of all ages want to take their picture with me."" Every aspect of her life was dissected and mythologised, from her workout routine to her love of hair scrunchies. Asked by NPR in 2019 if she had any regrets given the challenges she had faced in life, Ginsburg's supreme self-belief shone through. ""I do think I was born under a very bright star,"" she replied.

"British Airways is among many airlines hit hard by the pandemic, with problems in the sector having a knock-on effect on other industries The first ministers of the devolved nations have called for ""urgent"" UK government intervention to help the struggling aerospace sector. Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford of Wales and Arlene Foster from Northern Ireland have signed a joint letter. They believe a taskforce should be launched to help the industry, which has been hit hard by coronavirus. The UK government said the industry was a ""critical part"" of the UK economy. A spokesman said it continued to work closely with the sector to ensure it can rebuild as the civil aviation market recovers. The letter is also signed by leaders of the Unite union which brought the politicians together for the initiative. Unite says tens of thousands of jobs in the sector and associated industries are on the ""brink of being lost forever"". In May, MPs were toldup to 8,000 jobscould go in the aerospace sector in Wales. Scotland has also been hit hard with more than 1,200 jobs likely to go at companies such asRolls RoyceandGE Caledonian. In Northern IrelandBombardier,Collins AerospaceandThompson Aerohave announced plans to lay off more than 1,300 staff. The political leaders said the creation of an aerospace taskforce ""would be a positive signal to the sector"". They added such a move would show ""all our governments remain committed to working together in order to preserve this sector that is hugely important to the whole of the UK"". And they stressed the need to act quickly, warning: ""Urgent intervention is now required to preserve capability and avert further damaging losses."" Rolls-Royce is expected to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide The proposed taskforce would include ""active participation"" from the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as unions and companies working in the sector. Ms Sturgeon said: ""As we approach the closure of the furlough scheme at the end of October, there is a real possibility of significant job losses across the UK. ""We have repeatedly called for the UK government to reconsider its position and to extend the scheme, especially for sectors that have been particularly hard-hit like aerospace."" She added ""sector-specific approaches"" were necessary to prevent a ""severe"" long term impact. The Scottish government has already set up an aerospace response group to help the industry address the challenges posed by the pandemic. Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of Unite, said: ""Tens of thousands of highly-skilled jobs and those supported by the aerospace sector in the supply-chain are on the brink of being lost forever. ""It's clear that many of the measures required to support the sector reside with the UK government, which is why we are collectively asking the prime minister to immediately establish a UK aerospace taskforce to co-ordinate support."" He added the situation in Scotland alone ""risks a Â£185 million blow to the economy"". A UK government spokesman said: ""The aviation and aerospace sector remains a critical part of the UK economy and we will continue to work closely with industry through the Aerospace Growth Partnership to ensure it can rebuild as the civil aviation market recovers. ""The UK government is supporting the aerospace and aviation sectors with over Â£8.5bn in grants, loans and export guarantees. ""Through major R&D investment of nearly Â£2bn to 2026, we are also developing new tech to make air travel safer and greener while creating new, well-paid green jobs for decades to come.""

"Amal Clooney has quit her role as the UK's envoy on press freedom ""in dismay"" at the government's willingness to break international law over Brexit. The human rights lawyer said it was ""lamentable"" for Boris Johnson to be contemplating overriding the Brexit agreement he signed last year. She could not tell others to honour legal obligations when the UK ""declares it does not intend to do so itself"". The PM says he does not want to use the powers in the Internal Market Bill. But he says the legislation is necessary to give the government the power to protect the UK and, particularly, Northern Ireland if trade talks fail and the EU acts ""unreasonably"". In her resignation letter, Mrs Clooney, who is married to Hollywood actor George Clooney, said she had accepted the job last year because of the UK's historic role in upholding the international legal order. NI told to start work on checkpoints at sea ports Brexit bill compromise 'not enough' - Lord Howard Why Brexit is still a big issue But she said the government's attempts to pass the Internal Market Bill, which passed its first hurdle in the Commons last week, made her position ""untenable"". She said she had decided to quit after speaking to foreign secretary Dominic Raab and getting ""no assurance that any change of position is imminent"". She added: ""It is lamentable for the UK to be speaking of its intention to violate an international treaty signed by the prime minister less than a year ago. ""It has become untenable for me, as Special Envoy, to urge other states to respect and enforce international obligations while the UK declares that it does not intend to do so itself."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says it was âthe right decision"" for the âfirst-class lawyerâ to stand down. Mrs Clooney was appointed by Jeremy Hunt, Mr Raab's predecessor, during the final months of Theresa May's government and continued in the role after Boris Johnson took over in No 10. She was the deputy chair of the high-level panel of legal experts which works with the UK and Canadian governments on their campaign to promote media freedom around the world. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who used to practice in the same barristers' chambers as Ms Clooney, said she had taken the right decision. ""I know Amal and she is a first class lawyer. I'm not surprised that she has quit because, like others, she's concluded that there is a conflict between a breach of international law - which the government seems intent on - and our reputation as a country in the world that abides by the rule of law,"" he said. Her resignation adds to a growing list of senior legal figures who have quit their roles in disquiet at the government's position. Lord Keen resigned as Advocate General for Scotlandon Wednesday, saying he found it ""increasingly difficult to reconcile"" his obligations as a lawyer with provisions in the legislation. The government's most senior legal adviser -Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the government legal department- had already resigned, as had the UK's envoy for the protection of religious freedoms, Tory MP Rehman Chishti. The EU has demanded the government removes sections of the Bill which would give the UK the power to override agreements on the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and Britain and subsidies for NI companies. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted the powers, if they were ever used, would break the UK's treaty obligations under international law in a ""specific and limited"" way. The prime minister has sought to quell a potential rebellion by Tory MPs next week by promising critics that the Commons will get a specific vote on the powers before the government can use them. But former Conservative leader Lord Howard has said the PM needs to go further, saying it was a matter of principle and he doubted whether the Lords would back the bill as it stands.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six"" The UK is ""now seeing a second wave"" of Covid-19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, adding: ""It's been inevitable we'd see it in this country."" Mr Johnson said he did not ""want to go into bigger lockdown measures"" but that tighter social distancing rules might be necessary. It is understood a new three-tiered set of restrictions is being considered. The plan would aim to avoid a national lockdown but could stop household-to-household contact. The first tier would be the level of measures currently in place in most parts of England now - with social distancing the key aspect. The second tier would involvewhat is currently being imposed in north-east of England- curfews on hospitality venues and a ban on meetings between households. The final third tier would involve stricter lockdown measures. If this plan is put into action, ""Tier two"" restrictions are expected to be imposed on a region-by-region basis, but it is thought likely that they could eventually cover almost all of the UK. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""increasingly likely"" that the nine million people in the capital will need to follow areas such as the north-east of England andcome under additional measures,external. Can a 'circuit break' halt the second Covid wave? What are the rules for meeting friends and family? Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? UK coronavirus cases up by 4,322 on Friday An account of a meeting at which the three-tier measures were discussed has been shared with the BBC. It explained the government's shielding policy was also ""being actively reviewed"" and a decision could come soon on further measures to protect the vulnerable. Any further shielding decisions are expected to take a much more tailored approach than before. With the virus expected to be more severe over the winter, officials are looking at bringing in measures that could last until the spring. Earlier, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government wasconsidering a short period of tighter rules across England that could be announced in the next week, which could involve closing hospitality venues. It comes as the UK has recorded another 4,322 confirmed Covid-19 cases. Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle warned of ""far worse things to come"" asthe UK recorded widespread growth of the virus across the country. ""Clearly when you look at what is happening, you've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in,"" the prime minister said, referring to measures introduced on Monday. He added that ""the British people have done an amazing job - they've brought that peak down by discipline"" but that ""people find it difficult to keep this up, it's difficult to maintain that discipline for a long time"". LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Speaking in Oxfordshire, Mr Johnson said the government would keep ""everything under review"" but  a second national lockdown was ""the last thing anybody wants"". ""We want to keep schools open,"" he said. ""We want to keep the economy open as far as we possibly can, we want to keep businesses going."" Mr Johnson added: ""The only way we can do that is, obviously, if people follow the guidance."" The question is no longer where we are, but where we are heading. Yes, the number of people infected, in hospital with Covid or dying from the disease are all at far lower levels than at the peak. Scientists will quibble about the exact definition of a ""second wave"", but all data points to rising numbers of infections. The government's science advisers say the number is now doubling every week. If those trends continue then infections could go from the estimated 6,000-a-day to more than 100,000 by mid-October. It is that trajectory, which is not written in stone, the government is trying to change. There are questions for politicians, from whether it should do a ""circuit-break"" to improving Test and Trace. But, with evidence suggestingonly one in five people are following the self-isolation rules,externalwhen they get sick, there are also questions for all of us. The government has also been considering what it called a ""circuit-break"" approach, which could involve re-introducing restrictions in public spaces for a period of a few weeks to suppress the spread of the virus. Schools and workplaces would stay open. Ideas suggested by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) included closing some parts of the hospitality sector. Millions of Britons are now living under stricter coronavirus measures, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan saying the capital should not wait ""for this virus to again spiral out of control before taking action"". New measures to curb the spread of the virushave been introduced across parts of the North West, Midlands and West Yorkshire. This includes Lancashire (excluding Blackpool), Merseyside and the Cheshire boroughs of Warrington and Halton. Additional restrictions are also being put in place in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire, and all parts of Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale. Some areas of West Yorkshire had already been subject to restrictions implemented at the start of August but they were eased. They are now subject tothese new rules. In total, nearly 4.7 million people will be affected by the new restrictions, which ban separate households from meeting each other at home or in private gardens. In other developments: A rapid testcan accurately diagnose a coronavirus infection within 90 minutes without needing a specialist laboratory, scientists say Personal protective equipment will be free for care homes until next March, as part ofa government coronavirus plan for NHS England this winter The R number, which measures how quickly the virus is spreading, has risen to between 1.1 and 1.4 from between 1.0 and 1.2 last week, the government said. It means on average 10 infected people will infect between 11 and 14 people, so the epidemic is growing British retail sales have continued to increase for the fourth consecutive month,boosted by spending on household goods and DIY, according to official figures London's New Year's Eve firework displaywill not be taking place this year, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told LBC Northern Ireland's health minister hasdescribed three Van Morrison songs protesting against coronavirus lockdowns as ""dangerous"" 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?
