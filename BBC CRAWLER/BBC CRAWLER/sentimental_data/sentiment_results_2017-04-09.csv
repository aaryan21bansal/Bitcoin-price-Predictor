"Masters final leaderboard (after 72 holes) -9Garcia (Spa)*, Rose (Eng);-6Schwartzel (SA);-5Kuchar (US), Pieters (Bel);-4Casey (Eng);-3Chappell (US), McIlroy (NI);-2Scott (Aus), Moore (US) Selected others: -1Fowler (US), Spieth (US);LevelKaymer (Ger);+1Couples (US), Westwood (Eng);+2Day (Aus), Mickelson (US) *winner after sudden-death play-off Spain's Sergio Garcia won his first major title at his 74th attempt with a thrilling play-off victory over England's Justin Rose at the Masters. Both players finished on nine under par after 72 holes at Augusta, setting up a sudden-death play-off on the 18th. Garcia, 37, holed a birdie putt for victory after his European Ryder Cup team-mate could only manage a bogey. Charl Schwartzel was third on six under with England's Paul Casey and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy in the top 10. Jordan Spieth, one of the pre-tournament favourites, and fellow American Rickie Fowler both fell away badly on the final day. Spieth, champion in 2015, signed for a three-over-par 75, while playing partner Fowler carded a 76 to finish tied in 11th on one under. Garcia finally won one of golf's four majors - the Open Championship, the US Open and the US PGA Championship are the other three - after 22 previous top-10 finishes. He became the third Spaniard to win the Masters - after Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal - on what would have been the 60th birthday of Ballesteros, who died in 2011. ""To join Seve and Jose - my two idols - is amazing,"" said Garcia. Is Garcia's win the perfect sporting story? Garcia pleased to emulate Ballesteros and Olazabal I will have many more chances - Rose Relive all the drama of Garcia's win at Augusta Shot one:Rose teed off first on the 18th, pushing his drive right into the trees, only for his ball to bounce back towards play and reappear in the pine needles. Garcia thumped his drive almost 300 yards down the fairway. Shot two:Rose could only punch his way out of trouble onto the fairway, while Garcia landed his approach on the green, 12 feet from the hole. Shot three:The Englishman responded by hitting his ball about 15 foot to the right of the hole - on a similar line to his putt in regulation play about 15 minutes earlier. Rose missed his par putt to the left of the hole, leaving Garcia two shots for victory and the Spaniard rolled in his first attempt, with his ball circling the cup before dropping in. Garcia dropped to his knees in celebration, and Rose instantly walked over to congratulate him as they shared a warm embrace on the green. Garcia and Rose, who started playing against each other as teenagers and have become firm friends since, went out as Sunday's final pairing after sharing the overnight lead on six under. Rose has long craved a follow-up victory to his 2013 US Open win, in order to go down in history as a multiple major champion. For Garcia, the stakes were even higher. Not only was the Spaniard aiming to win his first major, he was also trying to prove that he had the mental resilience to triumph. What followed was an intense battle filled with drama and tension. Garcia started strongly with birdies on the first and third, opening up a three-shot lead on Rose after he bogeyed the fifth. But the Englishman replied with three straight birdies to rejoin his playing partner on eight under at the turn. Garcia bogeyed the 10th to give Rose the outright lead, then appeared to lose his composure when he pulled his tee shot into the trees on the par-five 13th. He was forced to take a one-shot penalty because of an unplayable lie, but scrambled well to save par. This sparked his revival, A remarkable eagle on the par-five 15th - his first in 452 holes at Augusta - followed by a Rose birdie, meant the pair were tied on nine under with three to play. Garcia pushed a short birdie putt right on the par-three 16th after Rose had holed his to open a one-shot lead, only for the Englishman to bogey the 17th. Both players missed birdie putts on the last, Garcia from four feet, setting up the first Masters play-off between two European players, which Garcia nicked in fading light. ""It has been such a long time coming,"" said the world number 11, who will rise into the top 10 on Monday. ""I knew I was playing well. I felt the calmest I ever felt in a major."" While Garcia was being presented with the Green Jacket in the Augusta clubhouse, Rose was left rueing another near miss. The Olympic champion has not claimed a major since winning the 2013 US Open, but lifted himself into contention for a first Masters title with five birdies in the final seven holes on Saturday. But Rose, who also finished second behind Spieth in 2015, had to settle for a fifth top-10 finish at Augusta National. ""It is disappointing to come so close,"" said the world number 14. ""I felt in control until the end. ""But I'm really happy for Sergio. I'd love to be wearing the Green Jacket but if it wasn't me then I'm glad it is him."" How the top two compared in the key statistics over the four rounds World number twoMcIlroy'sambition of becoming only the sixth man to win all four majors must wait for at least another year. The 27-year-old, who has already won the Open, US Open and two US PGA Championship titles, battled back from three over par after eight holes on Thursday to finish three under after a closing 69. ""It wasn't quite good enough. I felt like I had an opportunity on Saturday to shoot something in the mid-60s which would have got me closer to the lead and I didn't quite do that,"" said McIlroy. ""I gave a decent account of myself and will come back next year and try again."" Casey,39, carded four birdies in a bogey-free front nine to move into contention at four under, but could not improve that score as he shot 68 to earn his fourth top-10 finish at Augusta. South Africa'sSchwartzel,the 2011 champion, holed five birdies in the final 10 holes to finish with a 68, while AmericanMatt Kucharaced the 16th - the only hole-in-one of the week - on his way to the day's joint best round of 67. He finished tied fourth on five under with BelgianThomas Pieters,who impressed on his Masters debut. Two-time major winnerSpiethwas hoping to banish memories oflast year's spectacular final-day collapse at the 12thby winning his second Masters. But the 23-year-old American, who was already three over for the day and well down the leaderboard, saw his challenge completely disappear on the iconic par-three when he again knocked his tee-shot into the water guarding the green. It is the first time in his four Masters appearance the 2015 champion has not finished in the top two. Spieth's playing partnerFowlerstarted one shot off the lead as he targeted his first major, only to rack up seven bogeys in a disappointing round. Fellow AmericanFred Couples,the 57-year-old who won the Masters in 1992, ended up tied 18th at one over. Ken Brown, BBC golf commentator: ""It was an electrifying final day. It was a duel of the highest quality, top sportsmanship and both Sergio and Justin take great credit. ""I think the golfing world thinks 'well, Justin has a major, it is time for Sergio to win one'. ""He thoroughly deserves it, he has been a champion golfer and in the top 20 of the world for virtually 20 years."" Garcia amazed to join Spanish idols Is Garcia's win the perfect sporting story?

"Hampshire opener Jimmy Adams hit a 72nd first-class half century Specsavers County Championship Division One, Headingley: Yorkshire 273 & 187:Ballance 55, Hodd 54 not out; Abbott 7-41 Hampshire 141 & 321-6:Adams 72, Vince 44; Bresnan 3-73 Yorkshire 5 pts, Hampshire 19 pts Hampshire won by four wickets Scorecard Hampshire chased a target of 320 on day three to complete a remarkable County Championship win at Yorkshire. Resuming on 10-0, the away side began well, Michael Carberry (41), Jimmy Adams (72) and James Vince (44) all contributing to take them to 176-3. Further runs from Rilee Rossouw (47) and Liam Dawson (37) edged them closer to their target. Tim Bresnan (3-73) struck to give hope, but Lewis McManus (30 not out) and Gareth Berg (33 not out) saw them home. Having collapsed to 75-8 in the first innings, a target of 320 - the largest total of the match - appeared a difficult ask, but Hampshire's openers made the most of some fortune to give their side a strong start. Adams was dropped by Adam Lyth at second slip on 11, while Peter Handscomb was guilty of spilling Carberry in the gully when the opener had scored just six runs. Relive Hampshire's fine run-chase against Yorkshire Carberry was eventually caught at long leg by Steven Patterson off Ben Coad's bowling and Adams was trapped lbw by Azeem Rafiq's first ball before Vince became Coad's second victim, offering a low return catch. Bresnan had Sean Ervine caught behind, and while Rossouw and Dawson put on a partnership of 57, both were dismissed by the Yorkshire seamer - Rossouw caught by Andrew Hodd and Dawson by a diving Bresnan. Hampshire rallied with a crucial stand of 58 between 22-year-old McManus and Berg, whose six off Coad assured victory for former Yorkshire and England all-rounder Craig White's side against his old club. It is a fine start to the 2017 campaign for Hampshire, who finished eighth last season and only avoided relegation from Division One due to Durham's demotion for financial troubles. Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale told BBC Radio Leeds: ""It was a good game of cricket for the neutral, wasn't it? But it's disappointing to be on the wrong end of it because I felt we had opportunities to win. ""We could have put the game to bed on Saturday afternoon. I didn't think it was a 180-odd all out pitch. We could have applied ourselves a little bit better. ""If we'd have got 220-250 and they'd have been chasing 400, it's a different game. Also, a couple of catches went down, and it's a different game at 20-2. But fair play to Hampshire, it was a good chase. Not many teams come here and chase over 300 in the fourth innings."" Hampshire coach Craig White told BBC Radio Solent: ""That was a great win. You don't win many games being 58-5 in the first innings. To claw it back and come out of that situation with a victory is pretty special, so I'm proud of the lads. ""Every win's special, but this one perhaps a little more so. Everyone was so determined. It wasn't an easy pitch. There was a little bit in it. So the way the boys worked hard and got stuck in was outstanding. ""We've had a great start, but we know in two weeks when Yorkshire come down to Hampshire, they will be like wounded animals. They will come at us hard. So we need to prepare ourselves for that.""

"Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton dominated the Chinese Grand Prix to take his first win of the year and move into a share of the championship lead. Hamilton's victory, in a race enlivened by a wet start and some terrific wheel-to-wheel battles, ties him with first-race winner Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. Vettel was second, hardening impressions that 2017 will be a fight between the two multiple champions. Red Bull's Max Verstappen moved up from 16th on the grid to finish third. China spin a 'stupid mistake' - Bottas Listen: Vettel out of position at the start Listen: Big crash for Giovinazzi Antonio Giovinazzi made it two crashes in two days after losing control of his Sauber on the start-finish straight The grand prix could have swung in favour of either Hamilton or Vettel depending on how events had played out. In the end, fate decided for Hamilton, who was able to control the race from the front throughout and respond to his pursuers, who were always kept well out of arm's length. Vettel had to fight back after losing out on strategy in a chaotic opening, which kept the shape of the race in doubt through a series of incidents and accidents. Verstappen further heightened his already burgeoning reputation as one of F1's most exciting drivers with a strong performance to challenge Hamilton early on. The Dutchman, up from 16th to seventh on the first lap, took the final podium spot, but was under pressure in the closing laps from his more measured team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who Verstappen had overtaken impressively in the early stages. Hamilton is now level for podium places with the great Alain Prost (106). Source: Forix Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas had a chastening day, spinning behind the safety car in the early stages and dropping back to 12th, from which he recovered to finish sixth, behind the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen. And there was cruel luck for Fernando Alonso, who drove a strong opening lap to have the uncompetitive McLaren-Honda up into eighth place, ran seventh for much of the race and was on course to finish there when his driveshaft failed shortly after half distance. Shanghai Master: It's Hamilton 5-1 Vettel, when it comes to wins in China (pictured here during his first win in 2008. Source: Forix) The race could have turned out very differently had it not been for a key moment on lap four. After a wet start, Hamilton led the opening lap from Vettel and Bottas but the deployment of the virtual safety car following a crash by Williams rookie Lance Stroll, involved in a collision with Force India's Sergio Perez, prompted Vettel and most of the midfield runners to pit for dry tyres on lap two. Full race results from the Chinese Grand Prix The decision dropped Vettel to sixth but with all the runners ahead of him still on the grooved intermediate tyres on a rapidly drying track. The four-time champion was now in a strong position, and poised to take the lead when Hamilton, Bottas, Ricciardo, Raikkonen and Verstappen pitted. But Hamilton and the others were saved by a crash by Sauber's Antonio Giovinazzi, the Italian losing it at the last corner, just as he had in qualifying on Saturday. That brought out the safety car and Hamilton and the rest could make their own pit stops for dry tyres without losing out. From there, Hamilton could control the race at will and was pretty much untroubled, despite a late push from Vettel. The Lewis Hamilton fan club: Shanghai division ...which includes home made flags As the safety car helped Hamilton, it hurt Vettel, who now had to battle past both Red Bulls and team-mate Raikkonen to retain the championship lead. Ricciardo began to struggle and he soon had a queue behind him, with Verstappen heading Raikkonen and Vettel. Verstappen, predictably, was the man on the move, passing his team-mate on lap 11 at the Turn Five hairpin and chasing after Hamilton. Raikkonen spent another nine laps failing to pass Ricciardo before the Finn was overtaken by team-mate Vettel at Turn Five. Two laps later, Vettel put perhaps the move of the race on Ricciardo, going all the way around the outside of Turn Five, the two banging wheels in a puff of blue smoke as they accelerated side-by-side towards the fast Turn Six, where the Ferrari finally claimed the place. Vettel chased down Verstappen, who he provoked into a mistake at the Turn 14 hairpin at the end of the long straight on lap 28, exactly half distance. A pit stop for fresh tyres from Ferrari forced Mercedes to respond but, with the two cars evenly matched, there was stalemate. Who said Vettel can't overtake? He and former team-mate Ricciardo banged wheels as the German edged past There were a number of great performances - Hamilton was sublime in the lead, Vettel excellent in attack-recovery mode, Alonso dragging his recalcitrant McLaren into the points, Carlos Sainz impressive in the Toro Rosso. But it's hard to look beyond Verstappen - 16th to seventh on the opening lap, the usual plethora of great passes, embarrassing Ricciardo in the early laps, and holding on for a podium in a car with difficult balance because of lack of track time in qualifying. Red Bull's Max Verstappen started 16th but soon worked his way through the field during a wet start ""I think this will be one of the closest [title fights] if not the closest I have experienced,"" said Hamilton. ""Ferrari have done a great job and it is great that we are both pushing."" Closest ever, Lewis? Surely it cannot get any closer than his 2008 title win, where he overtook Timo Glock on the final corner of the last lap of the last race in Brazil to win by one point Sebastian Vettel: ""The safety car came just as I was about to start to feel the dry tyres were a lot quicker but then I had a very exciting race. I was stuck in the train for a little while but then tried to chase down Lewis Hamilton. It was a good match. It was good fun."" Max Verstappen: ""It was a very challenging race but I really enjoyed it. I think I overtook nine cars in the opening lap so it was a very good race for me! ""I didn't have a lot of track time this weekend because didn't do much in qualifying so I wasn't expecting to finish on the podium having started in 16th."" Chapter three of their promising battle takes place under the lights of Bahrain next weekend, where temperatures will be a good 20C higher than on a chilly 12C day in Shanghai.

"This video can not be played Rose lights up back nine to share lead Masters third-round leaderboard -6Rose (Eng), Garcia (Spa);-5Fowler (US);-4Spieth (US), Moore (US), Hoffman (US);-3Scott (Aus);-2Schwartzel (SA);-1Westwood (Eng), Pieters (Bel) Selected others: LevelCasey (Eng), McIlroy (NI), Rahm (Spa);+1Couples (US);+2Mickelson (US);+3Day (Aus);+6Fitzpatrick (Eng);+8Fisher (Eng);+9Sullivan (Eng) England's Justin Rose jumped into a share of the lead with Spain's Sergio Garcia as the battle for the Masters intensified on day three at Augusta. Rose, 36, sunk five birdies in the last seven holes in his five-under-par 67 to join Garcia, who hit 70, on six under. Rickie Fowler finished a shot back, while Jordan Spieth carded a 68 to move level with fellow Americans Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore on four under. Lee Westwood (68) moved to one under while Rory McIlroy (71) is level par. Rose is one of four previous major winners in the top 10 going into Sunday's final round, which will be live and uninterrupted on BBC Two from 18:30 BST. Garcia, Fowler and England's Westwood are all hoping to finally land one of golf's four most prestigious tournaments. How the drama unfolded on day three of the Masters Final-round tee-times How to follow the Masters on the BBC Olympic champion Rose, 36, has not claimed a major since his maiden triumph at the 2013 US Open, but lifted himself into contention for a first Masters title with a stunning finish on Saturday. The Englishman, who has four previous top-10 finishes at the Augusta National, was level par for the round after 11, only to blitz the final seven holes. He rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt at the 17th, then a 10-footer at the last, to join Hoffman in the lead. Garcia, playing alongside the 40-year-old Californian, birdied the 15th to briefly make it a three-way tie at the top. But Hoffman, one of four to share the overnight lead after the second round, slipped behind Rose and Garcia after finding water on the par-three 16th and ending with a double bogey. ""The key for me was staying patient early in my round. For me the test was around six when I made bogey, I stayed with it and played well on the back nine. Everything clicked into gear,"" said Rose. ""Patience is the key on Sunday. This is a golf course where you have to pick your moments. That will be the game plan."" Two-time major winner Spieth is hoping to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse by winning his second Masters. And the 23-year-old Texan, who has finished second, first and tied second in his three Augusta appearances, put himself in the frame again with a nerveless third-round display. After an opening-round 75 which featured a quadruple-bogey nine on the 15th, Spieth was 10 shots adrift of leader Hoffman. No previous Masters winner has trailed by more than seven shots after 18 holes. Spieth, who recovered with a three-under 69 on Friday, started his third round with five pars, but three birdies in four holes before the turn catapulted him into contention. Further birdies at 13 and 15 moved him into outright second, only for a bogey on 16 - his first in 30 holes - to drop him back into a share for fourth. Jordan Spieth dropped four shots in one hole on Friday but has let slip just three shots in 39 holes since ""We wanted to shoot four under and thought if we did the lead would move to six or seven and I'd creep on it,"" said the 2015 champion, who is bidding to become the youngest two-time Masters winner. ""Moments present themselves on Sunday here - it is about being patient. ""I know better than anyone what can happen on a Sunday."" World number eight Fowler putted solidly on his way to a hard-fought one-under-par 71, while Moore responded to the grief of losing his grandmother earlier this week with six birdies in a three-under 69. Like Garcia, Worksop's Westwood has long been considered one of Europe's finest players, only to have an excellent career somewhat tarnished by the absence of a major title. And the 43-year-old, who was third after an opening-round 70, appeared to have scuppered his chances of ending that long wait following a five-over 77 on Friday. However, he is back with an outside chance after converting six birdies in a four-under-par 68. ""Obviously I would like to be deep in the red, but one under is pretty good,"" said Westwood, who finished tied second with Spieth last year. ""I've got half a chance if I can get a roll going on the front nine."" This video can not be played McIlroy needs 'round of my life' for title World number two McIlroy's hopes of becoming only the sixth man to win all four majors look slim. The Northern Irishman, 27, made a strong start with birdies on the second and third, only to be set back by three-putts on the fifth and seventh which cost him a bogey and double bogey. Further birdies on the eighth and 12th provided hope, but he could not add any more to close the gap on the leaders. ""I had some chances on the back nine that I could have converted,"" said the four-time major winner. ""I think I probably could have shot a 67 or 68, but I had just a few too many wasted opportunities. ""I'm going to need my best score around here, 65, to have a chance.""
