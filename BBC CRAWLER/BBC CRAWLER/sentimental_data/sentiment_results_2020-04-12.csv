"The deal represents the largest cut in oil production ever agreed Opec producers and allies have agreed a record oil deal that will slash global output by about 10% after a slump in demand caused by coronavirus lockdowns. The deal, agreed on Sunday via video conference, is the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. Opec+, made up of oil producers and allies including Russia, announced plans for the deal on 9 April, but Mexico resisted the cuts. Opec has yet to announce the deal, but individual nations have confirmed it. The only detail to have been confirmed so far is that 9.7 million barrels per day will be cut by Opec oil producers and allies. On Monday in Asia, oil rose over $1 a barrel in early trading with global benchmark Brent up 3.9% to $32.71 a barrel and US grade West Texas Intermediate up 6.1% to $24.15 a barrel. Shares in Australia jumped 3.46% led by energy exporters, but Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.35% on continued concerns of poor global demand because of the spread of the coronavirus. ""This is an unprecedented agreement because it's not just between Opec and Opec+... but also the largest supplier in the world which is the US as well as other G-20 countries which have agreed to support the agreement both in reducing production and also in using up some of the surface supply by putting it into storage,"" Sandy Fielden, director of Oil Research at research firm Morningstar, told the BBC. US President Donald Trump and Kuwait's energy minister Dr Khaled Ali Mohammed al-Fadhel tweeted the news, while Saudi Arabia's energy ministry and Russia's state news agency Tass both separately confirmed the deal on Sunday.

""By the grace of Allah, then with wise guidance, continuous efforts and continuous talks since the dawn of Friday, we now announce the completion of the historic agreement to reduce production by approximately 10 million barrels of oil per day from members of 'OPEC +' starting from 1 May 2020,"" wrote Dr al-Fadhel in a tweet.

Global oil demand is estimated to have fallen by a third as more than three billion people are locked down in their homes due to the coronavirus outbreak. Prior to that,oil prices slumped in Marchto an 18-year-low after Opec+ failed to agree cuts. Talks were complicated by disagreements between Russia and Saudi Arabia, but on 2 April oil prices surgedafter President Trump signalled that he expected the two countries to end their feud. The initial details of the deal, outlined by Opec+ on Thursday, would have seen the group and its allies cutting 10 million barrels a day or 10% of global supply from 1 May. Another five million barrels were expected to be cut by other nations outside the group such as the US, Canada, Brazil and Norway. It said the cuts would be eased to eight million barrels a day between July and December. Then they would be eased again to six million barrels between January 2021 and April 2022. Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC that the deal agreed on Sunday was ""marginally lower"", compared to the 10 million barrels per day that was originally announced on Thursday. Mexico had balked at making these production cuts, which delayed the deal being signed off. Then on Friday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said thatMr Trump had offered to make extra US cuts on his behalf, an unusual offer by the US president, who has long railed against Opec. Mr Trump said Washington would help Mexico by picking up ""some of the slack"" and being reimbursed later, but he did not detail how the arrangement would work. US backs Opec deal with cuts to boost oil price Coronavirus: Oil prices surge on hopes of a price war truce Oil plunges in Asia as producers start price war ""Now a rehashed deal placating Mexico has resurfaced to calm the market, yet, look closer and the doubts surface,"" Mr Sharma said. ""The bulk of the output cuts are predicated on Russia and Saudi Arabia cutting 2.5 million barrels per day from agreed - and somewhat inflated - levels of 11 million barrels per day. More importantly, for most of 2019, Russia displayed very poor form in complying with previously agreed Opec+ cuts. So the market is unlikely to take the announced cut at face value."" He added that forecasts for a drop in demand in the summer appear to be ""dire"", with even the most optimistic forecasts pointing to a reduction of 18.5 million barrels per day. Mr Sharma said: ""The announcement can stem the bleeding, but cannot prevent what is likely to be a dire summer for oil producers with the potential to drag oil prices below $20 (Â£16; â¬18).""

"Mortuary suppliers have told BBC News they have no stocks of standard body bags left for sale, blaming the shortage on stockpiling due to the coronavirus pandemic. New stocks from overseas cannot be sourced for many weeks, they say. The NHS says it currently has adequate stocks but health workers report having to wrap bodies in sheets. Public Health England said the virus that caused Covid-19 degraded quickly after a patient had died. And there was no specific need for body bags to be used to transport these corpses, although ""there may be other practical reasons for their use"". Barber Medical, which has the NHS contract for mortuary supplies, said availability of zipped mortuary bags was a real problem and they could not be sourced anywhere. The company has, however, increased the availability of polythene bags, known as body pouch bags, and urged any hospital or trust struggling with supplies to contact it. A major supplier to undertakers also told BBC News it could not get hold of body bags, because of stockpiling. NHS trusts and funeral directors were desperate for the bags and ""horrified"" by the official advice it was safe not to use them, it said. The bags it sells are made in China but it said it took six weeks to ship them to the UK and air freighting them was prohibitively expensive. Zipped body bags are in short supply The company has looked into making its own bags but cannot source the required plastic fibre. The supplier also said it was unable to keep up with the desperate demand from funeral directors for personal protective equipment (PPE) and the whole industry was worried about how to cope with current death rates. William Quail, managing director of mortuary supplies firm Mortuary Equipment Direct, has hired a team of people to sew between 150 and 200 body bags a day, but he said he was struggling to get the products to hospitals due to bureaucracy. He said at Â£57.50 the bags were more expensive than those made in China, which he said cost Â£9. ""Dignity is the word,"" Mr Quail said. ""I don't think Â£57 would seem very much if it was your mother or father. I understand they are more expensive but what is a body worth to treat it with respect."" On Monday, Sally Goodright, a nurse in a west London hospital, wrote on Facebook, in a post later removed: ""We ran out of body bags but still the dead were arriving from the wards."" The GMB union says some porters have been told to transport the bodies of patients in sheets. Helen O'Connor, a regional organiser at Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust, said: ""We are extremely concerned about the psychological and physical wellbeing of our hospital members who are traumatised and struggling to cope with the impact of this pandemic. ""They are on the front line, doing the type of work that would distress anyone and increasingly dealing with death."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health A spokeswoman for the trust denied there was a shortage - but did not dispute sheets were being used to wrap bodies, saying there were plenty of zippered body bags to get the hospital trust through the current period but under Public Health England guidance they were not always necessary. The guidance says: ""Body bags are not deemed necessary but may be used for other practical reasons. ""Placing a cloth or mask over the mouth of the deceased when moving them can help to prevent the release of aerosols."" BBC News also received a report from a worker at Watford General Hospital who said bedsheets were being used to wrap the dead. When the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust was asked if using bedsheets was appropriate, it responded: ""We're wrapping bodies in line with national procedures."" BBC News understands an emergency stock of thousands of body bags held by emergency services will be made available to hospitals and funeral directors. An NHS Supply Chain spokeswoman said it had an adequate stock of body bags and was expecting more to arrive soon. Industry body the British Plastics Federation said UK plastics companies were stepping in to help provide equipment in high demand - but it had not received any requests for body bags.

Drones have captured how our public spaces are changing due to Covid-19. In Yorkshire, once-gridlocked roads and motorways now run clear. Shopping streets that would normally be packed with people are hauntingly empty; beaches are often deserted except for those enjoying their daily exercise.

Fanatics - who sell US sports team merchandise - has remade itself into a gown and mask manufacturer for hospitals. Clothing companies like Gap and Hanes are making gowns and scrubs. Ford and General Motors are repurposing car fans and batteries to make ventilators. Boeing and Apple are making face shields. Luxury brands and distilleries are producing hand sanitiser. But is there a downside? The White House has been notably hands-off when it comes to establishing any co-ordinated, centralised response, says Nada Sanders, professor of supply chain management at Northeastern University. This has led to a free-for-all, as local governments and hospitals competed to buy products or find donations, scam artists emerged, and prices skyrocketed. ""Pure capitalism [can] serve as an incentive,"" said Sanders. ""I really applaud the companies, but I also find it even more frustrating because I see the chaos."" Read more here. We reported earlier that Turkish Interior Minister SÃ¼leyman Soylu was resigning over a botched curfew. Well now President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stepped in to say he refuses to accept the resignation. ""He will continue his duty,"" a spokesperson for the president said. Soylu had submitted his resignation over the announcement of a two-day curfew to stem the spread of Covid-19 that critics say led to panic and confusion. Police are investigating after personal protective equipment (PPE) was stolen from an NHS building in Manchester. They were called to the Care Homes Medical Practice in Salford - which cares for patients living in nursing and residential homes - soon before 08:00 BST on Sunday. Laptops and petty cash were also taken. A spokesperson for Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are shocked and saddened that one of our community bases has been burgled and belongings stolen, including some items of PPE equipment. ""We will support Greater Manchester Police in their ongoing inquiries."" The deal agreed by oil producing countries to cut output by nearly 10% will see a reduction of about 9.7 million barrels per day, starting from 1 May 2020. US President Donald Trump and Kuwait's energy minister Dr Khaled Ali Mohammed al-Fadhel tweeted the news, while Saudi Arabia's energy ministry and Russia's state news agency Tass both separately confirmed the deal.

Apart from wolfing down chocolate, Easter Sunday means one thing for children in the Scottish city of Edinburgh. That's right, the annual tradition of egg rolling. Not even coronavirus could stop Edinburgh's children from partaking in the fun this year. Ingenuity was required, though, as children had to come up with inventive ways to roll their eggs in the confines of their homes. Parents told the BBC their children had a cracking time.

of a two-day curfew this weekend that critics say caused panic and
confusion. SÃ¼leyman Soylu said he took full responsibility for the curfew,
which was implemented with the âgood intentionâ of stemming the spread of
coronavirus. The Turkish government said late on Friday that people
living in 31 major cities would not be allowed to leave their homes for 48 hours
from midnight. Shops were reportedly overwhelmed in the wake of the announcement,
as people rushed to buy food and other essentials before the curfew came into
effect. The abrupt announcement of the lockdown drew criticism, with
many saying it heightened the risk of spreading coronavirus as people hurriedly descended
on shops. âI acted in good faith to prevent the epidemic spreading,âSoylu, an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan, wrote on Twitter,external. âThe scenes that occurred before the lockdown began, even for a short time, are
my responsibility.â As of Sunday, Turkey has reported more than 52,000 cases of coronavirus,

""Thanks to music, streamed live, bringing together millions of clasped hands everywhere in the world, we will hug this wounded Earth's pulsing heart, this wonderful international forge that is reason for Italian pride,"" Bocelli said as the stream began. For his finale, Bocelli sang Amazing Grace outside of the cathedral, facing the empty streets of Milan.

An unauthorised Easter Mass was discovered by Paris police late on Saturday night, according to AFP news agency. Religious services are banned in France because of the coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than 14,000 people in the country. The traditional Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet Catholic church went ahead with their Mass - with about 40 people in attendance. Local residents reported hearing music to police. The priest was warned and booked - meaning he could face a 200 euros (Â£176) fine - but the worshippers were not cautioned by the police. Pope Francis broadcasted his Easter Sunday address online If you're just joining us, here is an overview of some of the main updates from around the world that we've been covering so far: Most churches in the United States were empty today - but for some of them it was business as usual. Those who have not closed their buildings say they can protect their members by checking temperatures, sanitising sanctuaries and spacing worshippers six feet apart. And in at least eight states, stay-at-home orders do not apply to religious organisations - sometimes after legal battles. Some see a ban on church services as a violation of religious liberties guaranteed by the US constitution. Read more about the debate here. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan ordered churches to shut in his state, but The Friendship Baptist Church pastor Alvin Gwynn kept his Baltimore church open. Some services in the USA found inventive ways to make sure worshippers were still involved, while obeying social distancing. Mass at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in South Orange, New Jersey was streamed live, which parishioners' photos being placed on the seats. Daytona Beach Drive-in Christian Church in Florida saw worshippers follow the service from their cars. Oil-producing countries have agreed to a deal to cut global production by almost 10% in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The price of oil has slumped this year because of the crisis. The negotiations included the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia, the United States of America and Mexico. It amounts to a worldwide reduction of about 9.7 million oil barrels every day from 1 May. It could also mark the end of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has admitted that ""more money needs to go out faster"" to businesses applying for emergency loans from the government. He said 4,200 loans, worth a total of Â£800m, had been given to firms seeking cash to survive the coronavirus crisis. However, that is just 1.4% of the 300,000 enquiries that are thought to have been made through the scheme. Read the story in full here. There are a lot of unforeseen consequences of the coronavirus lockdown - and one is more people suffering eye injuries from doing DIY. Oxford Eye Hospital said it had seen an increase in injuries and people who needed operations. The hospital saw six ""traumatised eyes"" in a week, but would usually see one no more than every two to three weeks. It urged people to wear eye protection while doing DIY or gardening. The hospital added wearing glasses instead of contact lenses would also protect the eyes and reduce the chance of spreading coronavirus. Consultant Stella Hornby said: ""Wearing glasses at the moment reduces the risk of contact lens-related complications, and reduces the need to touch your face."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The review of the lockdown measures is due this week. It was the prime minister who originally talked about the three-week timetable from when the measures were first brought in. Dominic Raab is the first Secretary of State, which means he is effectively the prime minister's deputy, and he was asked to deputise when the prime minister was admitted to intensive care. He will be in charge of the government this week as it looks to decide whether to continue with lockdown measures. Iâd say the mood music, the expectation, is that the measures will continue. Health officials and ministers have said the social-distancing measures have had an effect, but it is still time to bear down on the virus, cut transmission rates and therefore save lives. You may be wondering why the number of coronavirus-related deaths have been starkly different from country to country during the pandemic. When comparing statistics, it is important to remember that
every country has had a different experience of the pandemic for a range of factors. Johns Hopkins University, which has been collating coronavirus
data, says these factors include the relative testing regimes, demographics and
healthcare resources of each country. It says the mortality rate is âone of the most important ways to
measure the burden of Covid-19â. The university has been tracking mortality rate in the 10 worst-affected countries.,externalIt has done so in two different ways: per 100
confirmed virus cases and per 100,000 population. The data paints a bleak picture for European countries. The top three countries with the most deaths per 100,000 people
are Spain (35.5), Italy (32.2) and Belgium (29.2), the university says. Conversely, the top three countries with the most deaths per
100 confirmed virus cases are Italy (12.8%), the UK (12.4%) and Belgium (11.9%),
it says. France has reported a slight drop in the number of hospital deaths
and patients in intensive care, as its health ministry said the
countryâs coronavirus epidemic had reached a âplateauâ. The country recorded 315 additional hospital deaths in the
last 24 hours, a drop from the 353 announced on Saturday. That brings the total number of coronavirus-related deaths in
hospitals and care homes to 14,393 in France, the third highest in the world. There was another glimmer of hope, however. The net number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care
dropped for the fourth consecutive day, bringing the total down to 6,845. Franceâs health ministry said the epidemic appeared to be plateauing
but stressed caution, saying: ""We must remain vigilant."" A public health campaign in Manitoba is using a raven puppet to deliver a message in the Cree language, which is spoken by more than 100,000 indigenous people in Canada. Often government messages are not successful in remote indigenous communities because they use foreign concepts or language, researcherSteph McLachlan told Canadian broadcaster CBC,external. Funded by the Covid-19 Rapid Response Program, the new campaign uses a raven puppet to promote handwashing and social distancing. The raven is known traditionally as an environmental protector and cleaner. But the videos are also humorous, and it is hoped will reach people who have not yet heard about the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

""He launched all the other careers of British racing drivers who went on to become world champions of which he was sadly denied,"" Hill told BBC Sport. Mario Andretti, who won the World Championship in 1978, described Moss as his hero. ""Such a kind man beloved by everyone. He was a true giant in our sport and will be missed forever,"" Andretti wrote.

"Doctors say they have had an increase in patients with serious eye injuries People doing more DIY during the coronavirus lockdown has led to an increase in serious eye injuries, a hospital has said. Oxford Eye Hospital said it had seen an increase in injuries and people who needed operations. The hospital saw six ""traumatised eyes"" in a week, but would usually see one no more than every two to three weeks. Consultant Stella Hornby said she thought the rise was due to people doing DIY jobs without eye protection. The trust's clinical lead for Ophthalmology said: ""We're seeing patients with more serious eye injuries and people have needed operations to repair injuries and which could potentially result in sight loss."" People have been urged to wear goggles and safety equipment when carrying out jobs in their homes The eye hospital, based at the John Radcliffe Hospital, urged people to wear eye protection while carrying out DIY or gardening. Parents have also been advised to store household detergents and chemicals away from children. The hospital added wearing glasses instead of contact lenses would also protect the eyes and reduce the chance of spreading coronavirus.

"The Pope read his message at an empty St Peter's Basilica Pope Francis has called for global solidarity to fight the coronavirus crisis in his Easter message read to an empty St Peter's Basilica. ""This is not a time for indifference. Because the whole world is suffering and needs to be united,"" the pontiff said in a message broadcast online.

John Hutchings, one of the coordinators of the Covid-19 Mutual Aid group in Holsworthy, Torridge, told the BBC they had initially asked children to hang up an Easter drawing on their window in return for an egg. These eight volunteers have dedicated their Easter to putting smiles on children's faces But with Waitrose, Morrisons and the local Lions Club donating so many eggs, the eight-strong group of volunteers has been giving them to all children in the area.

"We have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work. On 10 May, Boris Johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes."" So what can be lifted and when? This virus remains massively contagious. Before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called R-number). And less than 5% of the UK population is estimated to have been infected. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the R-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). That has been achieved. However, it is only just below one. ""There isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"". One set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases. The aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine. This strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts. The more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life. ""At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said Dr Kucharski. ""If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with."" But even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check. ""It is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said Dr Kucharski. When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal? How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? Another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"". Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely forthe most vulnerable. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. ""If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently."" That would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure. Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus. ""Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. Dr Kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: Those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Wales has already announced that from 11 May, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day. Moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. ""I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says. There remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together. And there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? R-NUMBER:Is this the crucial number? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? There is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible. That will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. The trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. Failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop Covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul. Download theBBC News Appfor all the latest headlines.

"There are now more than 520,000 cases of Covid-19 across the country The United States has now overtaken Italy to have the highest death toll from coronavirus in the world. The latest data, compiled by Johns Hopkins University, shows more than 20,000 people in the US have now died. The grim milestone comes shortly afterthe US became the first nation to record more than 2,000 virus deaths in a single day. The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday the state's death toll appeared to be stabilising. Announcing a 24-hour figure of 783 new deaths, he noted the last several days had seen around the same number. ""That is not an all-time high, and you can see that the number is somewhat stabilising but it is stabilising at a horrific rate,"" Mr Cuomo said. ""These are just incredible numbers depicting incredible loss and pain.""

There are now at least 529,951 recorded cases of Covid-19 across the US. Dr Anthony Fauci, US infectious diseases chief, has said the country is ""starting to see the levelling off and coming down"" of cases and deaths but says mitigation efforts such as social distancing should not be pulled back yet.

"We have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work. On 10 May, Boris Johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes."" So what can be lifted and when? This virus remains massively contagious. Before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called R-number). And less than 5% of the UK population is estimated to have been infected. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the R-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). That has been achieved. However, it is only just below one. ""There isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"". One set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases. The aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine. This strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts. The more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life. ""At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said Dr Kucharski. ""If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with."" But even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check. ""It is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said Dr Kucharski. When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal? How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? Another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"". Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely forthe most vulnerable. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. ""If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently."" That would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure. Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus. ""Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. Dr Kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: Those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Wales has already announced that from 11 May, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day. Moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. ""I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says. There remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together. And there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? R-NUMBER:Is this the crucial number? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? There is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible. That will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. The trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. Failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop Covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul. Download theBBC News Appfor all the latest headlines.

"The Pope read his message at an empty St Peter's Basilica Pope Francis has called for global solidarity to fight the coronavirus crisis in his Easter message read to an empty St Peter's Basilica. ""This is not a time for indifference. Because the whole world is suffering and needs to be united,"" the pontiff said in a message broadcast online. He warned that the EU risked collapse and urged debt relief for poor nations. Around the world, services have been held in closed churches as millions of people have been told to stay at home. This video can not be played Pope Francis: ""This is not a time for indifference"" The leader of the Roman Catholic Church deliveredÂ his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message behind closed doors amid lockdown measures imposed in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. Saying this year's ""Easter of solitude"" message should be a contagion of hope, he urged political leaders to work ""for the common good"", to help people live through the crisis and eventually resume their normal lives. In pictures: Easter celebrations 'We need Easter as much as ever,' says the Queen ""This isn't a time for self-centredness because the challenge we're facing is shared by all,"" the pontiff said in a message almost entirely dominated by the effects of theoutbreak, that has killed more than 109,000 people globally.,external ""Indifference, self-centredness, division and forgetfulness are not words we want to hear at this time. We want to ban these words forever!,"" he added. Without citing any country, the pontiff also called for the relaxation of international sanctions and praised doctors, nurses and other workers who were keeping essential services running. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health The Pope, who usually delivers the message to tens of thousands of people gathered at the square outside the basilica, expressed particular concern for the future ofÂ Europe. HeÂ warned that the European Union risked collapse ifÂ it did not agree on how to help the region recover. EU nations have been divided over how to mitigate the economic impactof the pandemic, with wealthier nations including Germany and the Netherlands blocking some demands from Spain and Italy, the region's hardest hit so far.Â The pontiff said it was ""more important than ever"" that rivalries that existed before World War Two did not ""regain force"", adding: ""The European Union is presently facing an epochal challenge, on which will depend not only its future but that of the whole world."" St Peter's Square has been sealed off as a lockdown remains in place in Italy At his Easter vigil service on Saturday evening,the Pope urged people not to ""yield to fear"" over the virus, calling on them to be ""messengers of life in a time of death"". He recalled the Biblical account of a woman finding Jesus's tomb empty on the day Christians believe he rose from the dead. ""Then too, there was fear about the future and all that would need to be rebuilt. A painful memory, a hope cut short. For them, as for us, it was the darkest hour.""

"Some key medicines used in intensive care are ""in relatively short supply"", the BBC has learned. Supply of anaesthetic medicines in some areas is ""a bit stretched"", according to the Royal College of Anaesthetists. One consultant has told the BBC that supplies are ""running low"" and alternatives are already being used in intensive care in the Midlands. The government says it is ""aware there is an increase in demand for a number of intensive care drugs"". On 2 April, four leading royal colleges and health organisations asked staff to ""act immediately"" and use alternatives to some ""first line"" medications in new guidance on changes to specific anaesthetic drugs facing ""pandemic pressures"". What is an intensive care unit? What are ventilators and how do they work? Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant in the West Midlands, says his hospital is ""running low"" on propofol, a commonly used anaesthetic, and alfentanil, an opioid painkiller which is used in intensive care. Dr Ron Daniels believes there has been too much focus on ventilators ""We are also in short supply of noradrenaline, used to treat life-threateningly low blood pressure, and are now using these drugs only on people who really need them and using older drugs on people who need less intensive support."" Dr Daniels says the quality of care for all intensive care patients, not just coronavirus sufferers, will ""likely be lower"" as a result as the crisis peaks, and believes there has been too much focus on ventilators. ""With the need of ventilation comes the need for medications to help circulation and blood pressure,"" he said. ""Without this medication, doctors have no choice but to try to find substitutes,"" said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association. ""This may affect how long patients remain on ventilators, which are in short supply, as well as ultimately impacting their chances of recovery,"" he added. ""This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency."" EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Dr Julia Patterson, founder of medical campaign group EveryDoctor, says she is aware of GPs and palliative care consultants who are also concerned about shortages of diamorphine, in addition to clinicians in ICUs. She says one ICU consultant in London, who is worried about stocks of muscle relaxants and anaesthetic drugs, has told her that the NHS is working to increase stocks but the situation is ""extremely concerning"". The BBC has also been told the chief pharmaceutical officer of NHS England, Keith Ridge, has privately expressed concerns about the availability of some drugs. ""We are seeing some drugs being in relatively short supply"", said Prof Mike Grocott, vice-president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists. He says in centres he has spoken to, ""some of the drugs supply is getting a bit stretched, and therefore we may choose to use different types of drugs"", but he reassured patients that they would be safe. ""Relative shortages of different drugs - using alternative drugs in their place - is a very normal part of clinical practice,"" he said. ""We have a variety of different options that we can choose from a menu, if you like, under different circumstances."" The British Generic Manufacturers Association - which represents UK-based manufacturers and suppliers of generic medicines - says supplies are being moved to areas experiencing shortages. Its director general, Warwick Smith, said it was seeing four or five times the amount of demand for medicines. He said one manufacturer recently requested the equivalent of three years' worth of supplies to ramp up production. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are aware there is an increase in demand for a number of intensive care drugs and we are working with the pharmaceutical industry to make additional supplies available. ""We are working closely with industry, the NHS and the relevant national expert groups to ensure precautions are in place to reduce the likelihood of shortages."" Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""currently confident"" about the supply of drugs. NHS England has been approached for a response.

We'll be back on Monday morning with more of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic from the UK and across the world.

Drones have captured how our public spaces are changing due to Covid-19. In Yorkshire, once-gridlocked roads and motorways now run clear. Shopping streets that would normally be packed with people are hauntingly empty; beaches are often deserted except for those enjoying their daily exercise.

Fanatics - who sell US sports team merchandise - has remade itself into a gown and mask manufacturer for hospitals. Clothing companies like Gap and Hanes are making gowns and scrubs. Ford and General Motors are repurposing car fans and batteries to make ventilators. Boeing and Apple are making face shields. Luxury brands and distilleries are producing hand sanitiser. But is there a downside? The White House has been notably hands-off when it comes to establishing any co-ordinated, centralised response, says Nada Sanders, professor of supply chain management at Northeastern University. This has led to a free-for-all, as local governments and hospitals competed to buy products or find donations, scam artists emerged, and prices skyrocketed. ""Pure capitalism [can] serve as an incentive,"" said Sanders. ""I really applaud the companies, but I also find it even more frustrating because I see the chaos."" Read more here. We reported earlier that Turkish Interior Minister SÃ¼leyman Soylu was resigning over a botched curfew. Well now President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stepped in to say he refuses to accept the resignation. ""He will continue his duty,"" a spokesperson for the president said. Soylu had submitted his resignation over the announcement of a two-day curfew to stem the spread of Covid-19 that critics say led to panic and confusion. Police are investigating after personal protective equipment (PPE) was stolen from an NHS building in Manchester. They were called to the Care Homes Medical Practice in Salford - which cares for patients living in nursing and residential homes - soon before 08:00 BST on Sunday. Laptops and petty cash were also taken. A spokesperson for Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are shocked and saddened that one of our community bases has been burgled and belongings stolen, including some items of PPE equipment. ""We will support Greater Manchester Police in their ongoing inquiries."" The deal agreed by oil producing countries to cut output by nearly 10% will see a reduction of about 9.7 million barrels per day, starting from 1 May 2020.

Global oil demand is estimated to have fallen by a third as more than three billion people are locked down in their homes due to the coronavirus outbreak. Apart from wolfing down chocolate, Easter Sunday means one thing for children in the Scottish city of Edinburgh. That's right, the annual tradition of egg rolling. Not even coronavirus could stop Edinburgh's children from partaking in the fun this year. Ingenuity was required, though, as children had to come up with inventive ways to roll their eggs in the confines of their homes. Parents told the BBC their children had a cracking time. Read the full story to see how children rolled their eggs Reggie, 9, Smith, 8, Flynn, 5, and Bay, 3, just before they rolled their eggs down the stairs inside their house in Edinburgh The streets outside the Hagia Sophia - one of Turkey's top tourist destinations - were empty this weekend The interior minister for Turkey has resigned over the announcement
of a two-day curfew this weekend that critics say caused panic and
confusion. SÃ¼leyman Soylu said he took full responsibility for the curfew,
which was implemented with the âgood intentionâ of stemming the spread of
coronavirus. The Turkish government said late on Friday that people
living in 31 major cities would not be allowed to leave their homes for 48 hours
from midnight. Shops were reportedly overwhelmed in the wake of the announcement,
as people rushed to buy food and other essentials before the curfew came into
effect. The abrupt announcement of the lockdown drew criticism, with
many saying it heightened the risk of spreading coronavirus as people hurriedly descended
on shops. âI acted in good faith to prevent the epidemic spreading,âSoylu, an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan, wrote on Twitter,external. âThe scenes that occurred before the lockdown began, even for a short time, are
my responsibility.â As of Sunday, Turkey has reported more than 52,000 cases of coronavirus,
a number that is rising fast. Andrea Bocelli streams an Easter concert in Milan Classical star Andrea Bocelli has held an Easter concert in Milan, singing alone at the city's famous cathedral. The concert, called Music for Hope, was live-streamed on YouTube and prompted an outpouring of support and gratitude on social media as millions of people around the world celebrate Easter under lockdown. ""Thanks to music, streamed live, bringing together millions of clasped hands everywhere in the world, we will hug this wounded Earth's pulsing heart, this wonderful international forge that is reason for Italian pride,"" Bocelli said as the stream began. For his finale, Bocelli sang Amazing Grace outside of the cathedral, facing the empty streets of Milan. Clips of the performance were shared by fans, celebrities, and politicians from around the world. Actor Hugh Jackman joined thousands in thanking the singer, saying his music was ""exactly what we needed"". You can watch the full concerthere,external.  Allow Twitter content?

An unauthorised Easter Mass was discovered by Paris police late on Saturday night, according to AFP news agency. Religious services are banned in France because of the coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than 14,000 people in the country. The traditional Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet Catholic church went ahead with their Mass - with about 40 people in attendance. Local residents reported hearing music to police. The priest was warned and booked - meaning he could face a 200 euros (Â£176) fine - but the worshippers were not cautioned by the police. Pope Francis broadcasted his Easter Sunday address online If you're just joining us, here is an overview of some of the main updates from around the world that we've been covering so far: Most churches in the United States were empty today - but for some of them it was business as usual. Those who have not closed their buildings say they can protect their members by checking temperatures, sanitising sanctuaries and spacing worshippers six feet apart. And in at least eight states, stay-at-home orders do not apply to religious organisations - sometimes after legal battles. Some see a ban on church services as a violation of religious liberties guaranteed by the US constitution. Read more about the debate here. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan ordered churches to shut in his state, but The Friendship Baptist Church pastor Alvin Gwynn kept his Baltimore church open. Some services in the USA found inventive ways to make sure worshippers were still involved, while obeying social distancing. Mass at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in South Orange, New Jersey was streamed live, which parishioners' photos being placed on the seats. Daytona Beach Drive-in Christian Church in Florida saw worshippers follow the service from their cars. Oil-producing countries have agreed to a deal to cut global production by almost 10% in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The price of oil has slumped this year because of the crisis. The negotiations included the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia, the United States of America and Mexico. It amounts to a worldwide reduction of about 9.7 million oil barrels every day from 1 May. It could also mark the end of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has admitted that ""more money needs to go out faster"" to businesses applying for emergency loans from the government. He said 4,200 loans, worth a total of Â£800m, had been given to firms seeking cash to survive the coronavirus crisis. However, that is just 1.4% of the 300,000 enquiries that are thought to have been made through the scheme. Read the story in full here. There are a lot of unforeseen consequences of the coronavirus lockdown - and one is more people suffering eye injuries from doing DIY. Oxford Eye Hospital said it had seen an increase in injuries and people who needed operations. The hospital saw six ""traumatised eyes"" in a week, but would usually see one no more than every two to three weeks. It urged people to wear eye protection while doing DIY or gardening. The hospital added wearing glasses instead of contact lenses would also protect the eyes and reduce the chance of spreading coronavirus. Consultant Stella Hornby said: ""Wearing glasses at the moment reduces the risk of contact lens-related complications, and reduces the need to touch your face."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent The review of the lockdown measures is due this week. It was the prime minister who originally talked about the three-week timetable from when the measures were first brought in. Dominic Raab is the first Secretary of State, which means he is effectively the prime minister's deputy, and he was asked to deputise when the prime minister was admitted to intensive care. He will be in charge of the government this week as it looks to decide whether to continue with lockdown measures. Iâd say the mood music, the expectation, is that the measures will continue. Health officials and ministers have said the social-distancing measures have had an effect, but it is still time to bear down on the virus, cut transmission rates and therefore save lives. You may be wondering why the number of coronavirus-related deaths have been starkly different from country to country during the pandemic. When comparing statistics, it is important to remember that
every country has had a different experience of the pandemic for a range of factors. Johns Hopkins University, which has been collating coronavirus
data, says these factors include the relative testing regimes, demographics and
healthcare resources of each country. It says the mortality rate is âone of the most important ways to
measure the burden of Covid-19â. The university has been tracking mortality rate in the 10 worst-affected countries.,externalIt has done so in two different ways: per 100
confirmed virus cases and per 100,000 population. The data paints a bleak picture for European countries. The top three countries with the most deaths per 100,000 people
are Spain (35.5), Italy (32.2) and Belgium (29.2), the university says. Conversely, the top three countries with the most deaths per
100 confirmed virus cases are Italy (12.8%), the UK (12.4%) and Belgium (11.9%),
it says. France has reported a slight drop in the number of hospital deaths
and patients in intensive care, as its health ministry said the
countryâs coronavirus epidemic had reached a âplateauâ. The country recorded 315 additional hospital deaths in the
last 24 hours, a drop from the 353 announced on Saturday. That brings the total number of coronavirus-related deaths in
hospitals and care homes to 14,393 in France, the third highest in the world. There was another glimmer of hope, however. The net number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care
dropped for the fourth consecutive day, bringing the total down to 6,845. Franceâs health ministry said the epidemic appeared to be plateauing
but stressed caution, saying: ""We must remain vigilant."" A public health campaign in Manitoba is using a raven puppet to deliver a message in the Cree language, which is spoken by more than 100,000 indigenous people in Canada. Often government messages are not successful in remote indigenous communities because they use foreign concepts or language, researcherSteph McLachlan told Canadian broadcaster CBC,external. Funded by the Covid-19 Rapid Response Program, the new campaign uses a raven puppet to promote handwashing and social distancing.

We reported earlier that Turkish Interior Minister SÃ¼leyman Soylu was resigning over a botched curfew. Well now President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stepped in to say he refuses to accept the resignation. ""He will continue his duty,"" a spokesperson for the president said. Soylu had submitted his resignation over the announcement of a two-day curfew to stem the spread of Covid-19 that critics say led to panic and confusion.

of a two-day curfew this weekend that critics say caused panic and
confusion. SÃ¼leyman Soylu said he took full responsibility for the curfew,
which was implemented with the âgood intentionâ of stemming the spread of
coronavirus. The Turkish government said late on Friday that people
living in 31 major cities would not be allowed to leave their homes for 48 hours

An unauthorised Easter Mass was discovered by Paris police late on Saturday night, according to AFP news agency. Religious services are banned in France because of the coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than 14,000 people in the country. The traditional Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet Catholic church went ahead with their Mass - with about 40 people in attendance. Local residents reported hearing music to police. The priest was warned and booked - meaning he could face a 200 euros (Â£176) fine - but the worshippers were not cautioned by the police. Pope Francis broadcasted his Easter Sunday address online If you're just joining us, here is an overview of some of the main updates from around the world that we've been covering so far: Most churches in the United States were empty today - but for some of them it was business as usual. Those who have not closed their buildings say they can protect their members by checking temperatures, sanitising sanctuaries and spacing worshippers six feet apart. And in at least eight states, stay-at-home orders do not apply to religious organisations - sometimes after legal battles. Some see a ban on church services as a violation of religious liberties guaranteed by the US constitution. Read more about the debate here. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan ordered churches to shut in his state, but The Friendship Baptist Church pastor Alvin Gwynn kept his Baltimore church open. Some services in the USA found inventive ways to make sure worshippers were still involved, while obeying social distancing. Mass at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in South Orange, New Jersey was streamed live, which parishioners' photos being placed on the seats. Daytona Beach Drive-in Christian Church in Florida saw worshippers follow the service from their cars. Oil-producing countries have agreed to a deal to cut global production by almost 10% in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The price of oil has slumped this year because of the crisis. The negotiations included the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia, the United States of America and Mexico. It amounts to a worldwide reduction of about 9.7 million oil barrels every day from 1 May. It could also mark the end of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has admitted that ""more money needs to go out faster"" to businesses applying for emergency loans from the government. He said 4,200 loans, worth a total of Â£800m, had been given to firms seeking cash to survive the coronavirus crisis. However, that is just 1.4% of the 300,000 enquiries that are thought to have been made through the scheme. Read the story in full here. There are a lot of unforeseen consequences of the coronavirus lockdown - and one is more people suffering eye injuries from doing DIY. Oxford Eye Hospital said it had seen an increase in injuries and people who needed operations. The hospital saw six ""traumatised eyes"" in a week, but would usually see one no more than every two to three weeks. It urged people to wear eye protection while doing DIY or gardening. The hospital added wearing glasses instead of contact lenses would also protect the eyes and reduce the chance of spreading coronavirus. Consultant Stella Hornby said: ""Wearing glasses at the moment reduces the risk of contact lens-related complications, and reduces the need to touch your face.""

"NHS staff on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic could develop anxiety, burnout, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the BBC has been told. Psychological first aid should be provided as the UK runs the risk of a ""future mental health crisis"", the British Psychological Society said. Ministers say NHS staff can call a helpline if they are feeling stressed. But MPs say this is not enough and that the government should provide extra support to those feeling overwhelmed. The cross-party group says any support should be extended to all front-line staff such as care home staff, mortuary workers and cleaners. In a letter, MPs call for management in front-line organisations to put in place preventative measures like regular breaks, encouraging people to look after themselves and to tell people that it is ""OK to not be OK"". The MPs and British Psychological Society also say professional help from psychologists and therapists needs to be easily accessible - so trauma can be dealt with early. Front-line staff in the coronavirus crisis are routinely exposed to things the general population would never encounter - loss of patients, illness of colleagues, high levels of stress and increased exposure to Covid-19. Trauma can leave some with insomnia, feeling disorientated, with a sense of guilt or even physical symptoms like shaking, headache, loss of appetite and aches and pains. Some people could see a deterioration of their mental health or develop anxiety or PTSD. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health ""We are running the risk of a future mental health crisis and a generation of burnt-out health workers,"" said Kathryn Scott, director of policy at the British Psychological Society. ""If we act now with a plan focused on prevention and leadership we can minimise the impact of trauma on responders to Covid-19."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ''We share the concerns that this epidemic poses challenges to the mental health and wellbeing of all our health and care workers."" The spokesperson said NHS England had partnered with Headspace, UnMind and Big Health to offer ""free-to-use mental health apps for both NHS and care staff"". A Â£5m grant was also available for mental health charities to fund additional services for people who are struggling, the spokesperson said. Dr Andrew Molodynski, a consultant psychiatrist and mental health lead for the British Medical Association, said: ""Health workers are used to seeing death, but we aren't used to seeing lots and lots of people die when we can't do anything about it. ""That will cause a lot of symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma. ""I'm already seeing that in my hospital - staff are anxious and some are already off work because of the impact that has had on their mental health."" The all-party group of MPs has asked the government to encourage the NHS and care organisations to treat their staff with compassion, and signpost ways to get help. The MPs also call for a focus on psychological first aid, developed for use in disasters like hurricanes or wildfires in the US. It sees people at risk encouraged to seek help and support one another with stress before it becomes a serious permanent problem. SNP MP Lisa Cameron, who wrote the letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, said protecting the mental health of staff was ""essential"" - just like providing adequate protective equipment. Ms Cameron added: ""If we fail to act now, front-line staff and communities will be living with the psychological consequences of coronavirus for decades to come.""

"Medical staff take notes as they check people's temperature on the street as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus in Yemen. The UK will send Â£200m in aid to help developing nations battle coronavirus. The money will mean more help for refugee camps - including new hand-washing stations. International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said boosting fragile health systems overseas would help prevent a ""second wave"" of infections hitting the UK. The latest donation brings Britain's total contribution to the global effort to halt the pandemic to Â£744m. It makes the UK one of the biggest donors to the worldwide fight against the virus, according to the Department for International Development (Dfid). Britain's funding will help install new hand-washing stations and isolation and treatment centres in refugee camps, and increase access to clean water for those living in areas of armed conflict, Dfid confirmed. 'Virus means millions will be left in poverty' World Bank pledges $12bn coronavirus aid package Why coronavirus advice wonât work for millions of people Calls for debt relief for world's poorest nations There will also be extra support for Yemen, where only about 50% of health facilities are operational, due to the country's ongoing civil war. The UN has already warned richer countries that Covid-19 will ""circle back around the world"" in a second wave if they do not help poorer nations cope with the pandemic. Of the Â£200m in funding, Â£130m will go to United Nations agencies, including Â£65m for the World Health Organization (WHO), which is co-ordinating the global response to the pandemic. Another Â£50m will boost the Red Cross in difficult to reach areas such as those affected by armed conflict, and a final Â£20m will help non-government organisations, including UK charities. Ms Trevelyan said the funding would help stop a second wave of infections coming to the UK Ms Trevelyan said: ""While our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we're deploying British expertise and funding around the world to prevent a second deadly wave reaching the UK ""Coronavirus does not respect country borders so our ability to protect the British public will only be effective if we strengthen the healthcare systems of vulnerable developing countries too."" WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""We are all in this together, which means protecting health around the world will help to protect the health of people in the UK."" The UK has already committed Â£250m in aid to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to rapidly develop a coronavirus vaccine, the biggest donation of any country. The UK's latest donation comes afterUS President Donald Trump accused the WHO of being ""China-centric"" in its tackling of the pandemic, and said the US would take ""a good look"" at its financial contributions to the organisation.

John Hutchings, one of the coordinators of the Covid-19 Mutual Aid group in Holsworthy, Torridge, told the BBC they had initially asked children to hang up an Easter drawing on their window in return for an egg. These eight volunteers have dedicated their Easter to putting smiles on children's faces But with Waitrose, Morrisons and the local Lions Club donating so many eggs, the eight-strong group of volunteers has been giving them to all children in the area.

The latest data, compiled by Johns Hopkins University, shows more than 20,000 people in the US have now died. The grim milestone comes shortly afterthe US became the first nation to record more than 2,000 virus deaths in a single day. The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday the state's death toll appeared to be stabilising. Announcing a 24-hour figure of 783 new deaths, he noted the last several days had seen around the same number. ""That is not an all-time high, and you can see that the number is somewhat stabilising but it is stabilising at a horrific rate,"" Mr Cuomo said. ""These are just incredible numbers depicting incredible loss and pain.""

""But at the same time, we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now. It is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on PPE and demand for PPE are going to be exponential."" This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""The central challenge is one of distribution"" On Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was enough kit for everyone and unveiled a plan to address shortages. He said the government was looking into how NHS staff who had died with the virus had been infected - adding that some may have caught it outside of work. ""But that doesn't take away from the bravery of every single NHS worker,"" he said, adding that his ""heart goes out"" to those who have died and their families. Mr Hancock said he was ""particularly struck at the high proportion of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and people who have come to this country to work in the NHS who have died of coranavirus"". ""We should recognise their enormous contribution,"" he added. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in London and Yorkshire are at ""dangerously low levels"", according to the BMA. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said doctors were being forced into a corner and faced ""heart-breaking decisions"" over whether to carry on without proper protection. He said: ""This is an immensely difficult position to be in, but is ultimately down to the government's chronic failure to supply us with the proper equipment."" Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Has the NHS got enough PPE? A nurse at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC he felt unsafe with the level of PPE he had been given. He said shortages meant those working on wards with coronavirus patients were only being given a surgical mask and plastic apron, rather than a gown covering the whole body. Last week a nursing assistant who had been looking after coronavirus patients at the hospital died. ""We are scared because we are spreading the virus,"" he said. ""We don't deserve it and our patients even more."" The health secretary said 742 million pieces of protective gear had been delivered so far, saying: ""There's enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance. We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is."" Mr Hancock said he was not ""impugning anyone who works for the NHS"" and ""they do an amazing job"". ""But what I am reiterating, stressing, is the importance to use the right amount of PPE,"" he added. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE"" and the government ""must act"" to ensure sufficient supplies are delivered. For several weeks, the government and NHS leaders have insisted there are enough stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that the problem lay in the distribution from warehouses to the front line. Some hospitals have reported receiving higher consignments of gloves, masks, gowns and aprons. But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. Care homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. There has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. Now Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a ""herculean effort"" to get deliveries to health workers and a ""huge task"" to keep it going. He set out a series of measures to step up provision of equipment. He may be given credit for acknowledging the scale of the problem. But NHS and care staff won't take much notice of plans until they are reflected in reality on the ground. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed any suggestion that healthcare staff have been overusing PPE. RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair told the BBC no PPE was ""more precious a resource than a healthcare worker's life, a nurse's life, a doctor's life"". ""I take offence, actually, that we are saying that healthcare workers are abusing or overusing PPE,"" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that nurses were still telling her they did not have adequate supply of protective equipment. Meanwhile, the business organisation Make It British said the government had not yet taken up offers from some firms to help manufacture PPE. The group said at least 100 companies had responded to an appeal for help four weeks ago but had heard nothing since. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

Among them are a pregnant nurse who died before she could meet her daughter; a father-of-seven whose family say he was let down over a lack of personal protective equipment; and a grandmother who colleagues say was one the unsung heroes of the NHS. Many of them came to the UK from other countries to work for the NHS. Most were working on the frontline and caring for patients, while some were retired but continued to work.

"Medical staff take notes as they check people's temperature on the street as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus in Yemen. The UK will send Â£200m in aid to help developing nations battle coronavirus. The money will mean more help for refugee camps - including new hand-washing stations. International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said boosting fragile health systems overseas would help prevent a ""second wave"" of infections hitting the UK. The latest donation brings Britain's total contribution to the global effort to halt the pandemic to Â£744m. It makes the UK one of the biggest donors to the worldwide fight against the virus, according to the Department for International Development (Dfid). Britain's funding will help install new hand-washing stations and isolation and treatment centres in refugee camps, and increase access to clean water for those living in areas of armed conflict, Dfid confirmed. 'Virus means millions will be left in poverty' World Bank pledges $12bn coronavirus aid package Why coronavirus advice wonât work for millions of people Calls for debt relief for world's poorest nations There will also be extra support for Yemen, where only about 50% of health facilities are operational, due to the country's ongoing civil war. The UN has already warned richer countries that Covid-19 will ""circle back around the world"" in a second wave if they do not help poorer nations cope with the pandemic. Of the Â£200m in funding, Â£130m will go to United Nations agencies, including Â£65m for the World Health Organization (WHO), which is co-ordinating the global response to the pandemic. Another Â£50m will boost the Red Cross in difficult to reach areas such as those affected by armed conflict, and a final Â£20m will help non-government organisations, including UK charities. Ms Trevelyan said the funding would help stop a second wave of infections coming to the UK Ms Trevelyan said: ""While our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we're deploying British expertise and funding around the world to prevent a second deadly wave reaching the UK ""Coronavirus does not respect country borders so our ability to protect the British public will only be effective if we strengthen the healthcare systems of vulnerable developing countries too."" WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""We are all in this together, which means protecting health around the world will help to protect the health of people in the UK."" The UK has already committed Â£250m in aid to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to rapidly develop a coronavirus vaccine, the biggest donation of any country. The UK's latest donation comes afterUS President Donald Trump accused the WHO of being ""China-centric"" in its tackling of the pandemic, and said the US would take ""a good look"" at its financial contributions to the organisation.

"NHS staff on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic could develop anxiety, burnout, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the BBC has been told. Psychological first aid should be provided as the UK runs the risk of a ""future mental health crisis"", the British Psychological Society said. Ministers say NHS staff can call a helpline if they are feeling stressed. But MPs say this is not enough and that the government should provide extra support to those feeling overwhelmed. The cross-party group says any support should be extended to all front-line staff such as care home staff, mortuary workers and cleaners. In a letter, MPs call for management in front-line organisations to put in place preventative measures like regular breaks, encouraging people to look after themselves and to tell people that it is ""OK to not be OK"". The MPs and British Psychological Society also say professional help from psychologists and therapists needs to be easily accessible - so trauma can be dealt with early. Front-line staff in the coronavirus crisis are routinely exposed to things the general population would never encounter - loss of patients, illness of colleagues, high levels of stress and increased exposure to Covid-19. Trauma can leave some with insomnia, feeling disorientated, with a sense of guilt or even physical symptoms like shaking, headache, loss of appetite and aches and pains. Some people could see a deterioration of their mental health or develop anxiety or PTSD. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health ""We are running the risk of a future mental health crisis and a generation of burnt-out health workers,"" said Kathryn Scott, director of policy at the British Psychological Society. ""If we act now with a plan focused on prevention and leadership we can minimise the impact of trauma on responders to Covid-19."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ''We share the concerns that this epidemic poses challenges to the mental health and wellbeing of all our health and care workers."" The spokesperson said NHS England had partnered with Headspace, UnMind and Big Health to offer ""free-to-use mental health apps for both NHS and care staff"". A Â£5m grant was also available for mental health charities to fund additional services for people who are struggling, the spokesperson said. Dr Andrew Molodynski, a consultant psychiatrist and mental health lead for the British Medical Association, said: ""Health workers are used to seeing death, but we aren't used to seeing lots and lots of people die when we can't do anything about it. ""That will cause a lot of symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma. ""I'm already seeing that in my hospital - staff are anxious and some are already off work because of the impact that has had on their mental health."" The all-party group of MPs has asked the government to encourage the NHS and care organisations to treat their staff with compassion, and signpost ways to get help. The MPs also call for a focus on psychological first aid, developed for use in disasters like hurricanes or wildfires in the US. It sees people at risk encouraged to seek help and support one another with stress before it becomes a serious permanent problem. SNP MP Lisa Cameron, who wrote the letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, said protecting the mental health of staff was ""essential"" - just like providing adequate protective equipment. Ms Cameron added: ""If we fail to act now, front-line staff and communities will be living with the psychological consequences of coronavirus for decades to come.""
