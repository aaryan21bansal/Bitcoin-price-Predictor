"This video can not be played Alan can no longer walk after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2017 It's been described as one of the few remaining illnesses that is still largely a mystery - and yet it claims hundreds of lives in the UK each year. Motor neurone disease (MND) sees muscles waste away after a loss of nerve cells that control movement, speech and breathing. There is no effective treatment or cure and half of the 1,500 people diagnosed each year die within 24 months. But now, the largest clinical trial in a generation, led by a team of researchers based in Edinburgh, may offer some hope. It will test potential new treatments for MND as well as looking at whether existing treatments for other conditions could have some benefit. These are the stories of some of those involved. Alan Gray is excited by the prospect of the trial. A manager in IT with three grown-up children, Alan was diagnosed with MND in January 2017, when he was 54. The early symptoms were innocuous enough - he kept clipping the pavement as he walked, as though his foot had dropped. Three years on, Alan can no longer walk. And his home, in Denny, Stirlingshire, has had to be specially adapted for him. Alan admits the diagnosis was devastating but he remains relentlessly optimistic. ""Initially I looked at it all and it's just too overwhelming,"" he says. ""So you have to come back and say, 'Right - where are we today? What's the plan for tomorrow?' and maybe look a little bit ahead. ""I go to the gym three times a week, I get massage therapy regularly to keep the body moving, follow the physio guidance. ""Energy is a real problem because the muscles are weaker, so I have to try and manage my energy each day. ""We'll do one thing, maybe two things but not anything more."" Alan has survived so long he is no longer eligible for most clinical trials. But this new project,known as MND-Smart,external, is different - and Alan is going to be part of it. ""Hope is something that's a real positive,"" he says. ""With having a trial now, we can see something that we can get some hope and strength from. ""As participants, we can help move science forward."" At present there is only one treatment for MND that can extend life for two or three months. The new clinical trial will allow hundreds of people living with MND in the UK to take part in tests of potential treatments. While most trials focus on a single drug or treatment, the MND-Smart trial will test several at the same time. Patients taking different treatments will be compared with a single group who receive a dummy drug called a placebo. They are more likely to receive an active treatment but the trial is also designed to be flexible so researchers can change the drugs being tested as results emerge. New drugs can be added and medicines that are not effective can be dropped. It's an approach that has not been used before in MND research anywhere in the world. They will test new drugs but also medications already licensed for other conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease or anxiety and depression. Repurposing drugs like this can dramatically speed up the time it takes for effective treatments to become more widely available. Euan MacDonald is one of the longest living people with MND The trial has been developed by people with MND working with clinical-trial experts from across the UK, including University College London, the University of Warwick - and the Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, at the University of Edinburgh. The man the centre was named after was working as an investment banker in London when he was diagnosed with MND, in October 2003. Now, Mr MacDonald is one of the people who have lived longest with MND, and he has used that time to raise money as well as awareness of the disease. Like Stephen Hawking, another famously long-lived MND survivor, he uses a voice synthesiser to speak. His enthusiasm for the new project being developed by the centre that carries his name is obvious, particularly the hope offered by repurposing existing drugs. He says: ""We're all impatient to see results from the research that's happening. ""There are no guarantees but repurposing has worked for other conditions like cancer. ""Crucially, the drugs have already been approved as safe to use, so the process is shorter. ""Time is of the essence, so anything that can speed up the research process is very welcome."" This video can not be played Dr Pal will be overseeing the MND-SMART trial For those doctors, nurses and bio-medical researchers who specialise in MND, the illness must at times feel like a frustrating target. About 5,000 people are living with MND in the UK today - but with long term survival rates so low, there is a limited window in which to study why it develops and how it progresses. Consultant neurologist Dr Suvankar Pal works at Edinburgh University's Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, founded by the author J K Rowling in memory of her mother. Dr Pal, who will be overseeing the MND-Smart trial, admits it has been a challenge to find effective treatments up until now. ""That's partly because the mechanism by which the brain cells don't work properly isn't fully understood,"" he says. ""And this condition progresses very quickly, so actually trying to encourage people to participate in trials and following them through until later stages of the illness is very difficult."" Dr Pal says other studies have also been hampered by having too few people involved, meaning it has not been possible to obtain meaningful results. But the new study offers new hope. ""There here has been a lack of progress so far with discovering new therapies for motor neurone disease and I think anything that we can do to improve the quality of life and the survival of people with MND is a step forward for this condition,"" he says. Back in Denny, Alan Gray is sitting up at the breakfast bar in his kitchen with his wife, Beverley. Alan and Beverley have been focusing on making memories that will last - taking 10 holidays in the year after Alan's diagnosis. He says: ""I'm quite a strong-willed person. I've got a lot of family and friends and support, so that all helps. ""But I've also got a kind of mental toughness anyway to say, 'You know, there's no point of just kind of saying, 'Well, why me?' or any kind of denial.' ""This is the reality. So let's find something positive to do, move forward, one step at a time.""

"Liu He and Donald Trump The US and China have signed an agreement aimed at easing a trade war that has rattled markets and weighed on the global economy. Speaking in Washington, US President Donald Trump saidthe pact,externalwould be ""transformative"" for the US economy. Chinese leaders called it a ""win-win"" deal that would help foster better relations between the two countries. China has pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels and strengthen intellectual property rules. In exchange, the US has agreed to halve some of the new tariffs it has imposed on Chinese products. Five things that aren't in the US-China deal US-China trade deal: winners and losers Trade war: US-China trade battle in charts A quick guide to the US-China trade war However the majority of the border taxes remain in place, which has prompted business groups to call for further talks. ""There's a lot of work to do ahead,"" said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the US Chamber of Commerce. ""Bottom line is, they should enjoy today but not wait too long to get back to the table for phase two."" The US and China have engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war since 2018, which has led to extra import taxes being levied on more than $450bn (Â£350bn) worth of traded goods. The ongoing dispute has disrupted trade flows, dampened global economic growth and unnerved investors. At a signing ceremony in Washington, Mr Trump said the deal sets the stage for a stronger relationship between the US and China.  The event, which occurred as the Senate prepared to take up Mr Trump's impeachment, was attended by top Republican donors and business leaders. ""Together we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security,"" he said.Â ""Far beyond even this deal, it's going to lead to an even stronger world peace,"" he added. China has committed to increasing its US imports by at least $200bn over 2017 levels, boosting purchases of agriculture by $32bn, manufacturing by $78bn, energy by $52bn and services by $38bn. China has agreed to take more action against counterfeiting and make it easier for companies to pursue legal action over trade secret theft The US will maintain up to 25% tariffs on an estimated $360bn worth of Chinese goods; China, which has levied new tariffs on $100bn worth of US products, is also expected to maintain the majority of them Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who signed the deal on behalf of China, said the agreement was rooted in ""equality and mutual respect"" and defended his country's economic model in his remarks. ""China has developed a political system and a model of economic development that suits its national reality,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean that China and the US cannot work together. On the contrary, our two countries share enormous common commercial interests."" ""We hope both sides will abide by and keep the agreement in earnest."" It has been hailed by the White House as a breakthrough in a war that President Trump triggered to protect American jobs and companies from what he viewed as unfair competition from China. The weapon of choice: billions of dollars of tariffs, or extra charges, on imports. But that has hurt the very workers and businesses they were meant to protect, in both countries. For all the fanfare - and the unusual appearance of a president at the signing of a bilateral trade deal -  this is more armistice  than victory - with only a small proportion of the tariffs being reversed and relatively minor concessions granted by both sides. Tariffs remain on around two-thirds of the goods Americans buy from China Moreover, Washington's fundamental complaints about Chinese practices - from its approach to subsidising businesses to cybertheft - remain unresolved. With President Trump's  ambition to rewrite the rules of global trade yet to be achieved, some fear he may turn his firepower on Europe next - just as the UK is looking to broker an advantageous post-Brexit relationship Mr Trump has said the accord signed on Wednesday is a ""phase one"" agreement and promised that the administration will take up other issues - such as China's state subsidies - in future negotiations. The US accuses China of ""unfair"" business practices, such as providing subsidies for domestic businesses and administrative rules that have made it difficult for US firms to operate in the country. Mr Trump has defended maintaining the bulk of the tariffs, saying they will provide leverage in future talks. But US business groups and analysts expressed concern. ""While Phase One makes incremental progress, it remains to be seen whether it will deliver any meaningful relief for farmers like me,"" said Michelle Erickson-Jones, a Montana wheat farmer, who is affiliated with the lobby group Farmers for Free Trade. ""The promises of lofty purchases are encouraging but farmers like me will believe it when we see it."" Charles Kane, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said Mr Trump sees China as a useful political scapegoat, making any serious negotiation unlikely until after the November presidential election. ""He's using [the trade war] as a political weapon,"" Mr Kane said.

"British Airways' owner IAG has filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breaches state aid rules. The move comes amid a growing backlash against the government's plan to defer some of Flybe's air passenger duty payments, thought to top Â£100m. EasyJet and Ryanair said taxpayer funds should not be used to save a rival. Meanwhile, the government's proposal to cut Air Passenger Duty (APD), was attacked by the rail industry's trade body and climate campaign groups. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""Taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies, especially when they are backed by well-funded businesses."" While Ryanair said it had called for ""more robust and frequent stress tests on financially weak airlines and tour operators so the taxpayer does not have to bail them out"". The government has said the review of the tax will be consistent with its zero-carbon targets. However, in a tweet, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: ""Addressing Flybe problems by reducing APD on all domestic flights is utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment to tackle the Climate Crisis. Domestic flights need to be reduced, not made cheaper."" The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, also said any review of APD ""that encourages more people to fly domestically would limit efforts to tackle the climate crisis"". What is air passenger duty? Climate campaigners attack aviation duty proposal Three questions for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I would be devastated if it went under' Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways, said government money should not have been used Ahead of filing the state aid complaint, Willie Walsh, the outgoing chief executive of IAG, wrote to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, criticising the government's involvement in its rescue. In a letter, Mr Walsh said: ""Prior to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for tax payers to fund its operations by subsidising regional routes. ""Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline. This is a blatant misuse of public funds. ""Flybe's precarious situation makes a mockery of the promises the airline, its shareholders and Heathrow have made about the expansion of regional flights if a third runway is built."" But Downing Street has said the government is ""fully compliant"" with state aid rules. The Prime Minister's spokesman said ""there has been no state aid to Flybe,"" adding that ""any future funding will be made on strictly commercial terms."" British Airways' owner IAG's decision to make a state-aid complaint to the European Commission underlines its determination to shine a light on - and if possible, overturn - the government's assistance to Flybe. Ministers have not published the details of the arrangement, but it is understood to include a ""time-to-pay"" arrangement for the company's airline passenger duty liabilities. These arrangements are common for companies that are struggling to pay their tax, but unusual when it comes to duty payments. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh's letter to Grant Shapps points out that Flybe has wealthy backers - Virgin Atlantic is a big shareholder, and one of Virgin's main shareholders in turn is Delta Air Lines, one of the biggest and most profitable airlines in the world. These are not the kind of companies, Mr Walsh argues, that should rely on taxpayer support to keep one of their investments trading. His intervention should, of course, be seen in the light of the long and bitter commercial rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. The latter's position at Heathrow is bolstered by Flybe's feed of domestic traffic, and BA would not be unhappy if that stream of traffic was choked off. Three Cabinet ministers - Mr Shapps, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Chancellor Sajid Javid signed off on the deal that will keep Flybe operating. Although the terms of the direct assistance were not disclosed, they are understood to include forbearance on Flybe's Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments. Mr Shapps said the move was necessary to protect key routes and any rule changes would apply to all carriers. ""The actions we have taken will support and enhance regional connectivity across the UK, so local communities have the domestic transport connections they rely on,"" he said. ""Any changes implemented as a result of our reviews of air passenger duty and regional connectivity will apply to all airlines in the competitive aviation market."" State aid is assistance given by the government to companies or other organisations that has the potential to distort market competition. The aid can be in the form of direct cash grants or indirect aid - such as preferential borrowing rates or tax credits. Under EU rules, member-state governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from the European Commission. For example, in 2015 the UK government submitted plans to provide a subsidy to Drax power station to convert one of its units from coal to biomass fuel. Following an investigation, the commission ruled in favour of the scheme. But there are exceptions to the rules. For example, aid worth less than 200,000 euros (Â£175,000) over three years is exempt. Even though Brexit is due to happen on 31 January, the UK will continue to follow EU state aid rules during the11-month transition periodthat follows. IAG believes the UK government's proposal would amount to unlawful state aid as it would impact other airlines operating the same routes as Flybe, but the government disagrees. What are the EU rules about state aid? Airlines collect the duty from passengers as part of their ticket price, and then hand it over to HMRC. It is understood Flybe could be given up to three months' breathing space to pay about Â£100m worth of duty. The ministers have also agreed to review air passenger duties on domestic flights in a move attacked by environmental campaigners. Ms Leadsom defended the decision to intervene, saying that Flybe was a ""viable business"". She also said Flybe's situation was different to that faced by travel firm Thomas Cook, which collapsed last year. ""The difference... between Flybe and Thomas Cook was that in the case of Thomas Cook it had huge amounts of debt, and any taxpayer's money would simply be throwing good money after bad."" Flybe's owners - Virgin Atlantic, Cyrus Capital and Stobart Air - will inject about Â£30m of new money. In his letter, Mr Walsh pointed out that Virgin is part-owned by US carrier Delta Air Lines, which is one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines. He argues that Virgin and Delta together have the resources to rescue Flybe, and they should not be asking for taxpayer support. Mr Walsh says Flybe has been mismanaged. Flybe is already in receipt of some public money for its important Newquay-Heathrow route, which it operates under a ""public service obligation"" contract with the government. Mr Walsh said that British Airways had indicated its willingness to operate that route without assistance - in the summer only - but was excluded because of the Flybe deal. He warned the government that Flybe's Heathrow operations could, in time, be diverted to long-haul routes - which would not be in line with its policy of promoting regional connections to London. But Rob Griggs, director of policy at Airlines UK, the industry trade body, defended the deal. He said giving extra time to Flybe to pay APD was not the same as a direct injection of public funds. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), a union, also welcomed the news. ""This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe,"" said Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton. Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns Flybe - said the group had agreed to ""keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives"". ""We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Could congestion charges help solve Cardiff's pollution? A Â£2 congestion charge for drivers is being proposed in Cardiff as part of a Â£2bn, 10-year transport plan. Cardiff council plans,externalto charge non-residents in a bid to hit green targets and cut congestion as research said air quality is among the UK's worst. The charge may come in by 2024 and the charging zone is under discussion. London,externalandDurham,externalcharge motorists to drive into the centre whileBirmingham,EdinburghandManchesterhave been considering it. Council leaders believe it will be a ""supercharging"" of the Metro plans, including creating new tram-train lines, opening new stations, rapid bus routes and segregated cycle lanes. They admitted the city's transport network was ""creaking"" and no longer fit for purpose. Call to stop poor transport holding city back Congestion plans amid pollution fears New stations at Loudon Square in Butetown, in the heart of Cardiff Bay, Crwys Road and Roath Park are proposed by 2024 before adding halts at Gabalfa, Victoria Park, Velindre, Roath Dock and Splott. The crossrail tram-train service plan will be part of the wider Â£738m South Wales Metro proposal An extended Cardiff circle tram-train route is being proposed Proposals also include: New park-and-ride facilities at the east and west of Cardiff - at junction 32 and junction 33 of the M4 motorway - and another at the plannedCardiff Parkway mainline stationat St Mellons. Working with bus operators to cut fares to Â£1 - half the price of a normal single fare in the city - and smart technology will prioritise buses at traffic lights and junctions to make public transport more attractive. Bus and taxi operators will be offered incentives to use cleaner or electric engines. An integrated ticketing system - similar to the Oyster in London - for all public transport in Cardiff, including buses, trams and bikes, could also be launched. The council said it would also lobby the Welsh Government to complete the Eastern Bay link road between Eastern Avenue and Cardiff Bay.  2021Park-and-Ride at M4 J32, M4 J33 and Cardiff East 2023Cardiff Parkway and Crwys Road stations to open 2024Tram-train lines and stations open. Congestion charge starts 2025Full cycle network completed 2028More stations open. Circle and crossrail lines open The city's public transport infrastructure was built for 200,000 people but needs to cope with Cardiff's 335,000 population, as well as more than 100,000 daily commuters. ""Once commuters, shoppers and visitors are taken into account our city has a daily population of almost half a million,"" said councillor Caro Wild. ""If you look at it from the point of view of the average Cardiff resident driving within the city to work every day, struggling for their bit of road space with the 80,000 other car commuters from outside the city's boundaries then absolutely, traffic congestion, traffic pollution and a public transport system which struggles to adequately serve the people who live and work here are all issues of major concern."" This is how Wood Street in the centre of Cardiff could look Figures show 50% of people are still commuting to Cardiff in cars, with 30% walking or cycling and 20% using public transport. Prof Mark Barry, a connectivity professor at Cardiff University, said we did not need to get everyone out of their cars but to give drivers a public transport alternative, to persuade enough to switch. The figure for car commuters should be halved and up to 40% needed to be via public transport, with a further 40% walking or cycling. ""Most cars spend probably 95% of their 'lives' doing absolutely nothing,"" he said. ""This clogs up streets and ties up natural resources. Having to design our cities around what cars do when they are not moving is as bad as having to do so when they are."" Clean air plan targets cars, stoves and industry Speed limits cut pollution at traffic hotspots Will these proposals change our behaviour as the council hopes? There's a carrot and a stick. The carrot is the promise of better, more frequent and affordable public transport linking communities across the city, including some which are not joined up at the moment. The stick? A Â£2 charge every time a car owned by someone who lives outside Cardiff enters the city. That proposal will now be investigated in detail before a formal business plan is published. There will be a few years for people to think about what they will do as individuals, but behaviour can change quickly when other options are improved. Stockholm in Sweden's transport system has been looked at Cardiff council has looked to the experience of Stockholm in Sweden. There they introduced a similar charge and found within three months traffic was reduced by 35%. If that happened in Cardiff, it would be expected to improve air quality which is so poor at the moment it's assessed to be shortening lives. It would also make travel across the city faster. Is Â£2 is the best level to set the charge initially? The income from that would be ring-fenced and contribute towards the Â£2bn investment plans for public transport. But of course a higher charge, or extending the fee to Cardiff residents, would bring in funds more quickly. A balance needs to be found which generates enough money to deliver an attractive alternative to the car, but which isn't so steep that drivers refuse to change their behaviour. The 10-year plan has kick-started the debate. Cardiff had already beenwarned it is at ""a very dangerous point""due to its poor public transport links and infrastructure. The Welsh capital has not had a central bus station since 2015, with itsnew one not due to open until 2023. Cardiff Central railway station is over capacity and will get a Â£58m upgrade, while the plannedÂ£738m South Wales Metrointegrated transport network is not expected to open until at 2023 at the earliest. Health campaigners had called for a congestion charge amid growing levels of air pollution in the city and theWelsh Government has already declared a climate emergency. The plan would make it easier for buses - including faster services - to travel through the city Public Health Wales estimates air pollution results in the equivalent of more than 220 deaths each year among people aged 30 and over in the Cardiff area. A report commissioned by the councilforecast nitrogen dioxide levels,externalon one of the busiest city centre streets will breach legal limits from 2021. And a study from Birmingham University revealed air quality in Cardiff is among the worst in the UK relative to its geographical size, traffic volume and population. The move has been welcomed by clean air organisations who said it would make Cardiff ""a cleaner, safer and more attractive city."" Rapid bus routes would be created, including a circle service around the city ""This is about reducing emissions to combat climate change, improving air quality to protect our health,"" said Haf Elgar of Healthy Air Cymru. ""We must see a change in the way we think about travel and we can only do that by introducing bold interventions that will help people make the best choices for them. ""It's also promising to see that the city-wide road user charge will be supported by improved public transport and active travel infrastructure, which will play an integral role in making the transition to sustainable methods of travel much more affordable and achievable."" Adrian Field, executive director at the Cardiff Business Improvement District, said doing nothing or tinkering around the edges wasn't an option. ""We are reassured that no charge will be put in place until a business case is completed, taking all options into consideration,Â and that alternative travel options will need to be in place before a charge is introduced,"" he said.

China has committed to increasing its US imports by at least $200bn over 2017 levels, boosting purchases of agriculture by $32bn, manufacturing by $78bn, energy by $52bn and services by $38bn. China has agreed to take more action against counterfeiting and make it easier for companies to pursue legal action over trade secret theft The US will maintain up to 25% tariffs on an estimated $360bn worth of Chinese goods; China, which has levied new tariffs on $100bn worth of US products, is also expected to maintain the majority of them Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who signed the deal on behalf of China, said the agreement was rooted in ""equality and mutual respect"" and defended his country's economic model in his remarks. ""China has developed a political system and a model of economic development that suits its national reality,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean that China and the US cannot work together. On the contrary, our two countries share enormous common commercial interests."" ""We hope both sides will abide by and keep the agreement in earnest."" It has been hailed by the White House as a breakthrough in a war that President Trump triggered to protect American jobs and companies from what he viewed as unfair competition from China. The weapon of choice: billions of dollars of tariffs, or extra charges, on imports. But that has hurt the very workers and businesses they were meant to protect, in both countries. For all the fanfare - and the unusual appearance of a president at the signing of a bilateral trade deal -  this is more armistice  than victory - with only a small proportion of the tariffs being reversed and relatively minor concessions granted by both sides. Tariffs remain on around two-thirds of the goods Americans buy from China Moreover, Washington's fundamental complaints about Chinese practices - from its approach to subsidising businesses to cybertheft - remain unresolved. With President Trump's  ambition to rewrite the rules of global trade yet to be achieved, some fear he may turn his firepower on Europe next - just as the UK is looking to broker an advantageous post-Brexit relationship Mr Trump has said the accord signed on Wednesday is a ""phase one"" agreement and promised that the administration will take up other issues - such as China's state subsidies - in future negotiations. The US accuses China of ""unfair"" business practices, such as providing subsidies for domestic businesses and administrative rules that have made it difficult for US firms to operate in the country. Mr Trump has defended maintaining the bulk of the tariffs, saying they will provide leverage in future talks. But US business groups and analysts expressed concern. ""While Phase One makes incremental progress, it remains to be seen whether it will deliver any meaningful relief for farmers like me,"" said Michelle Erickson-Jones, a Montana wheat farmer, who is affiliated with the lobby group Farmers for Free Trade. ""The promises of lofty purchases are encouraging but farmers like me will believe it when we see it."" Charles Kane, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said Mr Trump sees China as a useful political scapegoat, making any serious negotiation unlikely until after the November presidential election. ""He's using [the trade war] as a political weapon,"" Mr Kane said.

"The 36-year-old student was jailed for life with a minimum of 30 years A man jailed for 136 rapes could have his sentence increased after his case was referred to the Attorney General. Reynhard Sinaga, 36, was found guilty of luring 48 men to his Manchester flat, where he filmed himself sexually assaulting and raping them. The student, described as Britain's ""most prolific rapist"", was ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. His case has been referred under the unduly lenient sentence scheme, the Attorney General's office confirmed. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had written to the Attorney General regarding the case. ""The case of Reynhard Sinaga is unprecedented in CPS history and we took a range of factors into account when bringing each trial to court,"" a spokesperson said. ""A key consideration was the likely impact on sentence of bringing further prosecutions and we are confident we did everything we could to ensure the court had adequate sentencing powers to see justice done in this case."" 'Evil sexual predator' jailed for 136 rapes The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs This video can not be played Who is Reynhard Sinaga? The BBC's Judith Moritz reports on the case Sinaga targeted at least 190 victims and was ""the most prolific rapist in British legal history"", the CPS said when he was sentenced on 6 January. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC has until 3 February to decide whether to seek a longer sentence for the Indonesian national. Sinaga, who was a post-graduate student living in Manchester, would wait for men leaving nightclubs and bars before leading them to his flat in Montana House, Princess Street. He drugged his victims before assaulting them while they were unconscious. Judge Suzanne Goddard QC said he was ""an evil serial sexual predator"" who had shown ""not a jot of remorse"" during his trials, which took place across 18 months at Manchester Crown Court. Mr Cox is due to make a decision about whether to send the case to the Court of Appeal by 3 February.

"Tony Hall said the plan ""could be hugely disruptive"" but is ""an enormous creative opportunity"" BBC director general Tony Hall has outlined a plan that will see at least two thirds of the corporation's staff based outside London by 2027. Lord Hall said a new tech hub will be opened in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, while 150 jobs will be moved to Bristol. Salford will be ""the heart"" of BBC Sounds and will be home to more digital posts and ""much more journalism"". He said creating more jobs away from the capital would help to ""promote inclusion"" and ""diversity of thinking"". Just over half of the BBC's 19,000-strong workforce is currently based outside London. That figure was around a third a decade ago. ""Our centres have become magnets for ideas and talent, new jobs and investment,"" Lord Hall told BBC staff on Wednesday. ""That's really good news. But I know we can go further. We can do so much more for this country - and we're going to - starting this year."" Lord Hall said Newcastle's new tech hub would aim to deliver ""a new generation of software engineers, designers, product developers and data scientists in the north-east of England"". The natural history unit in Bristol will expand, while the BBC Sounds curation team will move to MediaCityUK in Salford to join controller Jonathan Wall ""within weeks"", he added. They will add non-BBC podcasts to the audio app. ""For the first time, we're going to open up Sounds to new British creators wherever they are and bring the best podcasts to everyone,"" Lord Hall explained. He also announced that children will soon get a ""radically different"" experience on iPlayer, while the BBC News app will also be overhauled. He said: ""This is the beginning of what I think should be a renewed push - getting the BBC up to at least two thirds around the country, if not more, by the time our charter comes to an end in 2027. ""I know all the risks. It will take time. It would cost money. It could be hugely disruptive. But it is an enormous creative opportunity - for audiences, for talent, for the UK. ""It'll make us more relevant, more in touch with audiences, more alive to creative opportunities. That's a really exciting prospect."" At current staffing levels, the plan would see around 2,800 jobs move out of the capital. However, the BBC is currently in the middle of a drive to save Â£800m by 2022. It reached around half of that target last year. Tony Hall was speaking at BBC Wales at Central Square, Cardiff Lord Hall acknowledged that the BBC had ""been through a lot"" since he became director general in 2013, and the organisation has ""not always got it right"". He vowed to keep ""learning, talking [and] changing"" to ensure the corporation is ""the most inclusive, innovative, inspiring place to work"". Last week, presenter Samira Ahmed won the employment tribunal she brought against the corporation in a dispute over equal pay.

Both the BBC and the government came in for criticism from MPs last year after announcing free TV licences for all over-75s, would be scrapped. ""Don't be defensive about the BBC,"" Lord Hall urged staff on Wednesday, calling on them to ""demonstrate why we matter"".

"The 10 years to the end of 2019 have been confirmed as the warmest decade on record by three global agencies. According to Nasa, Noaa and the UK Met Office, last year was the second warmest in a record dating back to 1850. The past five years were the hottest in the 170-year series, with the average of each one more than 1C warmer than pre-industrial. The Met Office says that 2020 is likely to continue this warming trend. 2016 remains the warmest year on record, when temperatures were boosted by the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon. Australia's fires 'will be normal' in warmer world Arctic ice melt makes permafrost vulnerable Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Today's data doesn't come as a huge surprise, with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) signallingat the start of last Decemberthat 2019 likely marked the end of the warmest decade on record. The Met Office, which is involved in producing the HadCRUT4 temperature data, says that 2019 was 1.05C above the average for the period from 1850-1900. Last year saw two major heat waves hit Europe in June and July, with a new national record of 46C set in France on 28 June. New records were also set in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and in the UK at 38.7C. In Australia, the mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost a degree. by Roger Harrabin, Environment analyst As temperatures continue to rise, efforts to contain heating gases continue to falter as science collides with politics. The UK, for instance, fought hard to host the annual UN climate conference at the end of the year where all nations will be urged towards deeper emissions cuts. And Boris Johnson says he wants the UK to lead the world on climate change. But in the first test of his new administration he's already being accused of abandoning his principles. He's promising to consider cutting the Â£13 tax on flights in the UK because jobs and connectivity are at stake. This contradicts his official advice from the Climate Change Committee which says people need to fly less, so the cost of flying should go up, not down. This sort of uncomfortable trade-off will cause ruffles around the world in coming decades as climate change presents an increasing challenge to politics-as-usual. While the three different research agencies all have slightly different figures for the past 12 months, the WMO has carried out an analysis that uses additional data from the Copernicus climate change service and the Japan Meteorological Agency. They conclude that in 2019, the world was 1.1C warmer than in the pre-industrial period. A Nasa graphic showing the differences between 2019 global temperatures and the long-term average ""Our collective global temperature figures agree that 2019 joins the other years from 2015 as the five warmest years on record,"" said Dr Colin Morice, from the Met Office Hadley Centre. ""Each decade from the 1980s has been successively warmer than all the decades that came before. 2019 concludes the warmest 'cardinal' decade (those spanning years ending 0-9) in records that stretch back to the mid-19th century."" Researchers say carbon emissions from human activities are the main cause of the sustained temperature rise seen in recent years. ""Carbon dioxide levels are at the highest that we've ever recorded in our atmosphere, and there is a definite connection between the amount of CO2 and the temperature,"" said Prof Liz Bentley from the Royal Meteorological Society. ""We are seeing the highest global temperatures in the last decade and we will see more of that. As the CO2 continues to grow, we'll see global temperatures increasing."" Having the long term data from three different agencies with different methodologies gives them confidence in the accuracy of their findings. ""While we know that human activities are causing the globe to warm, it is important to measure this warming as accurately as possible,"" said Prof Tim Osborn, from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, which is involved in gathering the data. ""We are confident that the world has warmed by about 1C since the late nineteenth century because different methods of working out the global temperature give very similar results."" Firefighters in Spain battle blazes in 2019 during the European heatwave While the figures released by the Met Office, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and Nasa show the temperature recorded on the land and sea surfaces, the amount of warming going into the deeper ocean is also at record levels. Data published this week showed that a record amount of heat went into the oceans last year. This was the biggest increase in the last decade. While natural variability means that scientists don't expect new temperature records year-on-year, the Met Office is forecasting that 2020 will also be very hot, with the global average temperature estimated to be 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. This suggests it will be a warmer year than the one just passed.

"Greggs has signed a delivery deal with Just Eat as the market for food takeaways continues to grow. The tie-up comes after trials with other delivery firms such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo in Newcastle, London and Glasgow last year. The service will now also be launched in Birmingham and Bristol, with other UK cities to follow. The growth in the takeaway sector led to Just Eat being bought in a Â£5.9bn deal last week after a takeover battle. Greggs chief Roger Whiteside said the firm aimed to be able to deliver across the UK by the end of the year. Just Eat - which was originally founded by a group of five Danish entrepreneurs in 2000 - said the partnership with Greggs showed that firm was expanding ""beyond traditional takeaways"". It added that its customers could also order from High Street chains such as KFC, Subway and Wagamama, as well as receive pizza deliveries from selected Asda supermarkets. There is some debate around what benefits the partnership brings Just Eat, according to equities analyst Giles Thorne, given that there is no minimum order value for Greggs' low-cost goods. ""Whether it's profitable or not, we don't know. But Just Eat could justify working with a major brand on a loss-making basis in other ways,"" he said. ""This is ultimately about driving the utility of the Just Eat marketplace in the eyes of both consumers and restaurants."" He cites Uber Eats landing McDonald's for its delivery platform as a similar scenario. ""Bagging a major national brand means more people join the platform. If more people join the platform, that's a good thing for other restaurants using it too, creating an all-important 'virtuous circle'."" The size and popularity of the takeaway delivery market was demonstrated by the recent takeover battle for Just Eat between Dutch company Takeaway.com and investment firm Prosus. After several months of courting Just Eat's shareholders,Takeaway.com finally triumphed. The deal will create one of the world's largest meal delivery companies. Takeaways maybe used to be reserved for a Friday night, but recent research shows people are ordering them more often. A recent survey by KPMG suggests,externalthat two-thirds of adults in the UK enjoy them at least once a week. Typically, people in the UK order 34 takeaways a year, spending between Â£10 and Â£15 a time. Will Hawkley, global head of leisure and hospitality at KPMG, said the increased spending was down to a ""lifestyle change"". He said: ""People are just looking for more and more convenience, they're busier, working harder."" It seems the growth in food delivery apps also means customers are offered more choice. Mr Hawkley added this was a positive for those with ""specific dietary requirements that may have previously prevented them from ordering in.""

"This video can not be played Could congestion charges help solve Cardiff's pollution? A Â£2 congestion charge for drivers is being proposed in Cardiff as part of a Â£2bn, 10-year transport plan. Cardiff council plans,externalto charge non-residents in a bid to hit green targets and cut congestion as research said air quality is among the UK's worst. The charge may come in by 2024 and the charging zone is under discussion. London,externalandDurham,externalcharge motorists to drive into the centre whileBirmingham,EdinburghandManchesterhave been considering it. Council leaders believe it will be a ""supercharging"" of the Metro plans, including creating new tram-train lines, opening new stations, rapid bus routes and segregated cycle lanes. They admitted the city's transport network was ""creaking"" and no longer fit for purpose. Call to stop poor transport holding city back Congestion plans amid pollution fears New stations at Loudon Square in Butetown, in the heart of Cardiff Bay, Crwys Road and Roath Park are proposed by 2024 before adding halts at Gabalfa, Victoria Park, Velindre, Roath Dock and Splott. The crossrail tram-train service plan will be part of the wider Â£738m South Wales Metro proposal An extended Cardiff circle tram-train route is being proposed Proposals also include: New park-and-ride facilities at the east and west of Cardiff - at junction 32 and junction 33 of the M4 motorway - and another at the plannedCardiff Parkway mainline stationat St Mellons. Working with bus operators to cut fares to Â£1 - half the price of a normal single fare in the city - and smart technology will prioritise buses at traffic lights and junctions to make public transport more attractive. Bus and taxi operators will be offered incentives to use cleaner or electric engines. An integrated ticketing system - similar to the Oyster in London - for all public transport in Cardiff, including buses, trams and bikes, could also be launched. The council said it would also lobby the Welsh Government to complete the Eastern Bay link road between Eastern Avenue and Cardiff Bay.  2021Park-and-Ride at M4 J32, M4 J33 and Cardiff East 2023Cardiff Parkway and Crwys Road stations to open 2024Tram-train lines and stations open.

Circle and crossrail lines open The city's public transport infrastructure was built for 200,000 people but needs to cope with Cardiff's 335,000 population, as well as more than 100,000 daily commuters. ""Once commuters, shoppers and visitors are taken into account our city has a daily population of almost half a million,"" said councillor Caro Wild. ""If you look at it from the point of view of the average Cardiff resident driving within the city to work every day, struggling for their bit of road space with the 80,000 other car commuters from outside the city's boundaries then absolutely, traffic congestion, traffic pollution and a public transport system which struggles to adequately serve the people who live and work here are all issues of major concern."" This is how Wood Street in the centre of Cardiff could look Figures show 50% of people are still commuting to Cardiff in cars, with 30% walking or cycling and 20% using public transport. Prof Mark Barry, a connectivity professor at Cardiff University, said we did not need to get everyone out of their cars but to give drivers a public transport alternative, to persuade enough to switch. The figure for car commuters should be halved and up to 40% needed to be via public transport, with a further 40% walking or cycling. ""Most cars spend probably 95% of their 'lives' doing absolutely nothing,"" he said. ""This clogs up streets and ties up natural resources. Having to design our cities around what cars do when they are not moving is as bad as having to do so when they are."" Clean air plan targets cars, stoves and industry Speed limits cut pollution at traffic hotspots Will these proposals change our behaviour as the council hopes? There's a carrot and a stick. The carrot is the promise of better, more frequent and affordable public transport linking communities across the city, including some which are not joined up at the moment. The stick? A Â£2 charge every time a car owned by someone who lives outside Cardiff enters the city. That proposal will now be investigated in detail before a formal business plan is published. There will be a few years for people to think about what they will do as individuals, but behaviour can change quickly when other options are improved. Stockholm in Sweden's transport system has been looked at Cardiff council has looked to the experience of Stockholm in Sweden. There they introduced a similar charge and found within three months traffic was reduced by 35%. If that happened in Cardiff, it would be expected to improve air quality which is so poor at the moment it's assessed to be shortening lives. It would also make travel across the city faster. Is Â£2 is the best level to set the charge initially? The income from that would be ring-fenced and contribute towards the Â£2bn investment plans for public transport. But of course a higher charge, or extending the fee to Cardiff residents, would bring in funds more quickly. A balance needs to be found which generates enough money to deliver an attractive alternative to the car, but which isn't so steep that drivers refuse to change their behaviour. The 10-year plan has kick-started the debate. Cardiff had already beenwarned it is at ""a very dangerous point""due to its poor public transport links and infrastructure. The Welsh capital has not had a central bus station since 2015, with itsnew one not due to open until 2023. Cardiff Central railway station is over capacity and will get a Â£58m upgrade, while the plannedÂ£738m South Wales Metrointegrated transport network is not expected to open until at 2023 at the earliest. Health campaigners had called for a congestion charge amid growing levels of air pollution in the city and theWelsh Government has already declared a climate emergency. The plan would make it easier for buses - including faster services - to travel through the city Public Health Wales estimates air pollution results in the equivalent of more than 220 deaths each year among people aged 30 and over in the Cardiff area. A report commissioned by the councilforecast nitrogen dioxide levels,externalon one of the busiest city centre streets will breach legal limits from 2021. And a study from Birmingham University revealed air quality in Cardiff is among the worst in the UK relative to its geographical size, traffic volume and population. The move has been welcomed by clean air organisations who said it would make Cardiff ""a cleaner, safer and more attractive city."" Rapid bus routes would be created, including a circle service around the city ""This is about reducing emissions to combat climate change, improving air quality to protect our health,"" said Haf Elgar of Healthy Air Cymru. ""We must see a change in the way we think about travel and we can only do that by introducing bold interventions that will help people make the best choices for them. ""It's also promising to see that the city-wide road user charge will be supported by improved public transport and active travel infrastructure, which will play an integral role in making the transition to sustainable methods of travel much more affordable and achievable."" Adrian Field, executive director at the Cardiff Business Improvement District, said doing nothing or tinkering around the edges wasn't an option. ""We are reassured that no charge will be put in place until a business case is completed, taking all options into consideration,Â and that alternative travel options will need to be in place before a charge is introduced,"" he said.

"Cheaper hotel costs helped to push the inflation rate down The UK's inflation rate fell to its lowest for more than three years in December, increasing speculation that interest rates could be cut. The rate dropped to 1.3% last month,external, down from 1.5% in November, partly due to a fall in the price of women's clothes and hotel room costs. December's inflation rate was the lowest since November 2016. Analysts said it raised the chances of a rate cut, with inflation below the Bank of England's target of 2%. ""Very soft UK inflation data for December leaves the door wide open for a Bank of England rate cut on 30 January,"" said Melissa Davies, an economist at stock broker Redburn. The Bank's main interest rate is used by banks and other lenders who set borrowing costs. It affects everything from mortgages to business loans and has a big effect on the finances of individuals and companies. City traders who spend their working lives trying to anticipate moves in interest rates are convinced of it today: the Bank of England is likely to cut the official interest rate when it meets later this month. Market indicators suggest a 60% chance of it happening. Here's the thinking: at 1.3%, the official measure of consumer price inflation in the year to December was lower than expected and well below the 2% target. With the economy barely growing (even shrinking if you are prepared to rely on the official November estimate of a 0.3% contraction) there's little sign of inflationary pressure in the near future. Granted, there was a sharp rise in the price of crude oil - a barrel was up 4.9% in the month and 17.4% on the year. But in spite of that, producers were still paying slightly less for their raw materials and supplies than they were last year. The assumption has been that the November contraction was a temporary period of weakness induced by pre-election political uncertainty - and that there will be a recovery as businesses and consumers regain a new-found confidence to spend and invest. The risk the MPC will have to contend with is that that hoped-for post-election recovery does not materialise. Earlier on Wednesday, Michael Saunders, one of the rate setters on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), reiterated his view that borrowing costs should be lowered. ""It probably will be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and possibly to cut rates further, in order to reduce risks of a sustained undershoot of the 2% inflation target,"" he said. Last week, two other rate setters and Bank governor Mark Carney also suggested that rates could be cut, depending on how the economy performs. On Sunday, MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe told the Financial Timeshe would consider voting for a rate cutdepending on how the economy has performed since the December election. However, members of the MPC could take the latest inflation figure with a pinch of salt, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Half of the decline in the headline rate was driven by a sharp fall in volatile airline fares inflation,"" he said. He expects inflation to rise to 1.6% in the first three months of 2020, and this could mean enough MPC members will decide to wait rather than voting to cut rates. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for personal investing at money manager Fidelity International, said the inflation data painted a bleaker picture for the UK economy than before. ""Today's UK CPI figures simply add to the growing sense of unease many feel when considering the outlook for the UK economy, with the rate of inflation continuing to lag well below the Bank of England's target of 2%."" A cut would ease the finances of borrowers, but create a tougher environment for savers, she added.

"Police stood guard at a climate change protest by Extinction Rebellion in Edinburgh last summer The cost of a UN climate change conference in Glasgow could be ""several hundred million pounds"", police say. Up to 90,000 people - delegates, observers, heads of state and media - are expected to attend COP26, over 12 days in November. AScottish Police Authority report,externalsays it will be the largest mobilisation of police officers in the UK. Scottish ministers say they expect the UK government to cover the ""core costs"" including emergency services funding. But a spokesperson added there was a ""lack of clarity"" from Westminster over the issue. Glasgow to host UN climate change summit Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Scotland must 'walk the talk' on climate change The UK government said discussions with the Scottish government on the conference costs were ""currently ongoing"". The authority is meeting monthly with Scottish and UK government officials to plan security and minimise disruption for residents of Glasgow. Police Scotland officers monitored climate change protests Glasgow last summer Costs associated with a Nato summit in Wales in 2014 have been used to draw up the estimated cost of this year's conference. The report says: ""Taking into consideration the planning assumptions and based on previous major summits/conferences (e.g. Nato Summit Wales 2014), the initial costings demonstrate that the event will cost potentially several hundred million pounds. ""Detailed financial planning is being developed and dialogue remains ongoing with the Cabinet Office relative to the cost recovery model that will be utilised."" Police said the safety and wellbeing of conference attendees, the wider public and any protesters would be their ""paramount"" concern. Treasury to cover Trump visit police bill The COP26 will be the largest summit the UK has held, with up to 200 world leaders expected for the final weekend of talks. It will be held at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) but other venues across the city will also host functions and meetings for heads of state and other dignitaries. Costs of policing the climate change conference in Glasgow could run to ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" The SPA report also reveals the SEC will be handed over to the UN for the duration of the conference. Known as the ""blue zone"", it will become international territory, subject to international law. ""Discussions are ongoing with senior law officers and the UN to determine how Police Scotland will record and investigate any crimes which occur in the blue zone,"" the report says. It adds that COP26 attendees will peak at 15,000 on the busiest day, but the overall figure could rise to 90,000 over the period of the conference, which runs from 9-20 November. The Scottish government said it was working with the UK government, Glasgow City Council and other partners to ensure the conference was a success. ""While the UK government has committed to cover core costs, Scottish ministers expect that all costs associated with COP26 will be borne by the UK government,"" a spokesperson said. ""This includes funding for police, fire and ambulance services to both prepare for and deliver a safe, secure and successful event.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The family of Harry Dunn are ""absolutely distraught"" over comments made by the prime minister, said family spokesman Radd Seiger. Mr Dunn, 19, died after being hit by a car allegedly driven by Anne Sacoolas, who left the country for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. Boris Johnsontold the BBCthat he believed the chances of Mrs Sacoolas being extradited were ""very low"". The comments came on Harry's mother's birthday and left her ""bitterly upset"". Mr Seiger told the BBC: ""The Dunn family are absolutely on their knees and I am still trying to pick my jaw up off the floor. ""It's an outrageous set of comments to make from the leader of this country, whose job it is to represent the people."" Charlotte Charles, Harry's mother, was ""bitterly upset and confused"" and ""absolutely beside herself, on her birthday,"" said Mr Seiger. Charlotte Charles told reporters the charging decision was a ""huge step"" He said the family had agreed with government officials not to comment on the extradition process while proceedings were ongoing. ""I'm hoping Mr Johnson will reflect on the comments he made, they were unhelpful to say the least, "" he said. The family are also taking legal action against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). The claim against the FCO issued on behalf of Mr Dunn's parents - Ms Charles and Tim Dunn - alleged the granting of diplomatic immunity to Mrs Sacoolas was ""wrong in law"". New documents, seen by the PA news agency, suggest the FCO will say they did not claim Mrs Sacoolas had immunity. Northamptonshire Police have now said the force will take part in the family's claim and they will not seek to retrieve any costs. The US State Department has previously said the extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas is highly inappropriate and would be an abuse. The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Is extraditing Anne Sacoolas a realistic prospect? Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The crash happened outside RAF Croughton, where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The 42-year-old left the UK shortly after the crash on 27 August and returned to the US, prompting a justice campaign by the teenager's parents. Mrs Sacoolas was charged in December by the Crown Prosecution Service with causing death by dangerous driving and the Home Office submitted its extradition request to the US Department of Justice.

"Greggs has signed a delivery deal with Just Eat as the market for food takeaways continues to grow. The tie-up comes after trials with other delivery firms such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo in Newcastle, London and Glasgow last year. The service will now also be launched in Birmingham and Bristol, with other UK cities to follow. The growth in the takeaway sector led to Just Eat being bought in a Â£5.9bn deal last week after a takeover battle. Greggs chief Roger Whiteside said the firm aimed to be able to deliver across the UK by the end of the year. Just Eat - which was originally founded by a group of five Danish entrepreneurs in 2000 - said the partnership with Greggs showed that firm was expanding ""beyond traditional takeaways"". It added that its customers could also order from High Street chains such as KFC, Subway and Wagamama, as well as receive pizza deliveries from selected Asda supermarkets. There is some debate around what benefits the partnership brings Just Eat, according to equities analyst Giles Thorne, given that there is no minimum order value for Greggs' low-cost goods. ""Whether it's profitable or not, we don't know. But Just Eat could justify working with a major brand on a loss-making basis in other ways,"" he said. ""This is ultimately about driving the utility of the Just Eat marketplace in the eyes of both consumers and restaurants."" He cites Uber Eats landing McDonald's for its delivery platform as a similar scenario. ""Bagging a major national brand means more people join the platform. If more people join the platform, that's a good thing for other restaurants using it too, creating an all-important 'virtuous circle'."" The size and popularity of the takeaway delivery market was demonstrated by the recent takeover battle for Just Eat between Dutch company Takeaway.com and investment firm Prosus. After several months of courting Just Eat's shareholders,Takeaway.com finally triumphed. The deal will create one of the world's largest meal delivery companies. Takeaways maybe used to be reserved for a Friday night, but recent research shows people are ordering them more often. A recent survey by KPMG suggests,externalthat two-thirds of adults in the UK enjoy them at least once a week. Typically, people in the UK order 34 takeaways a year, spending between Â£10 and Â£15 a time. Will Hawkley, global head of leisure and hospitality at KPMG, said the increased spending was down to a ""lifestyle change"". He said: ""People are just looking for more and more convenience, they're busier, working harder."" It seems the growth in food delivery apps also means customers are offered more choice. Mr Hawkley added this was a positive for those with ""specific dietary requirements that may have previously prevented them from ordering in.""

"This video can not be played Footage shows missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has said the country's military should elaborate more on how it shot down a passenger plane by mistake last week. Separately, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif acknowledged that Iranians ""were lied to"" for days afterwards. He insisted that he and the president were also kept in the dark. Iran's Revolutionary Guards killed 176 people when they ""unintentionally"" shot down the Ukrainian aircraft amid escalating tensions with the US. Hours before, Iranian missiles had targeted two airbases in Iraq housing US forces. Speaking on state television on Wednesday, President Rouhani called on the military to take the next steps of the investigation with ""more coordination and monitoring"". ""The first thing is to inform people honestly. People's grief will alleviate when they know that we feel responsible for what happened and talk with them honestly,"" he said. How Iran's media responded to plane crash anger What we know about flight PS752 He urged the forces ""to explain to people what sessions and meetings were held since the moment that the incident happened"". Mr Zarif, during a televised interview while on a trip to India, said: ""I and the president did not know [what brought the plane down] and, as soon as we did, we communicated it."" Iran faces watershed moment Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' He also praised the military for being ""brave enough to claim responsibility early on"". However, critics have decried the three-day delay and said they only owned up after Western authorities claimed to have contrary evidence. University of Tehran students hold pictures of victims during a memorial after the plane crash New footage - verified by the New York Times - shows two missiles,external, fired 30 seconds apart, striking the plane. It was initially though to have been hit once. Flight PS752 was brought down after it took off from the capital, Tehran, on 8 January, when the Revolutionary Guards - a force set up to defend Iran's Islamic system - mistakenly perceived it as a threat amid escalating conflict with the US. Everyone on board died. The deaths and the apparent initial cover-up - when the act was denied and the crash site was bulldozed - have sparked protests in various Iranian cities. Iran rejects call for new 'Trump nuclear deal' Police in Tehran have been accused of using live ammunition against demonstrators. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is expected to deliver Friday prayer sermons in the capital this week for the first time since 2013, in an apparent bid to ease domestic tension. Last Wednesday, Iran launched a series of strikes on two military bases in neighbouring Iraq, which were housing US troops. It was a retaliatory move after US President Donald Trump ordered a strike in Iraq that killed top Iranian General Qasam Soleimani. This video can not be played Martin Patience explains why recent events have sparked protests on Iran's streets A few hours after the Iranian strikes, Flight PS752 crashed near Tehran in initially unclear circumstances, although Iran's authorities immediately blamed technical difficulties. Five reasons why the US-Iran crisis is not over On Thursday, various Western powers - including Canada, which had 57 citizens onboard the plane - said they had evidence that Iran's military had downed the plane. Iran reiterated its denials until Friday, when it conceded that the passenger jet was hit by its air defence systems. Mr Zarif has now personally insisted that he and President Rouhani only found out about what had really happened on that day. Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander, has said a missile operator acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a ""cruise missile"" as there had been reports that such missiles had been fired at Iran. He also claimed government officials had been alerted soon afterwards. On Tuesday, Iran's judiciary spokesman, Gholamhossein Esmaili, announced that several people had been arrested. He added that about 30 people had been detained for ""taking part in illegal gatherings"" - an apparent reference to recent anti-government protests. Also on Tuesday, President Hassan Rouhani said the investigation into the aircraft strikes would be overseen by a ""special court"" and insisted that it would be about more than just the person who ""pulled the trigger"". Iran is leading the investigation domestically and has refused to hand over recovered black-box flight recorders to manufacturer Boeing or to the US. Meanwhile,the Revolutionary Guards have also arrested the person who filmed footagethat showed the plane being shot down. The video was shared on social media soon after the crash, leading analysts to deduce that the plane was directly hit. It is believed the person being detained will face charges related to national security. However, an Iranian journalist based in London who initially posted the footage has insisted that his source is safe, and that the Iranian authorities have arrested the wrong person.

"Steyer, Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, Sanders and Klobuchar There have been seven official Democratic debates but this one had a real sense of urgency - in less than three weeks the candidates will face their first test. The primary season begins on 3 February with the Iowa caucuses, when the Democratic voters in this state will pick who they want to take on Donald Trump in November. As the six White House hopefuls took to the debate stage in Des Moines, the Republican US president they have in their sights was mocking them at a rally 400 miles east in Wisconsin. Here are some key moments from the debate - and the Trump rally. The body language between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the conclusion of the debate - when they spoke heatedly and did not shake hands - told its own story. Are voters biased against women candidates? The non-aggression pact between the two candidates could be over just as the voting is set to begin. The biggest news story in campaign politics over the past few days had been the growing tensions between the two most liberal candidates. This video can not be played Warren confronts Sanders after the debate - and doesn't shake hands Warren had alleged that Sanders told her in December 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidency - something Sanders denied. Asked about this during the debate, Sanders denied it again - saying he has long supported the idea of a woman president. Then Warren had her turn, and in a set-piece response she clearly spent time crafting, she hit a number of political targets almost in one breath. She started by essentially implying that Sanders was lying. She then pivoted her response into a shout-out for the electoral success that she and Amy Klobuchar, the other woman candidate on the stage, have had. They've won every election they've been in, she said to thunderous applause, while the three male politicians debating have lost 10 between them. She ended by pitching herself as the unity candidate with a broad coalition. ""The real danger we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull the party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of constituency,"" she said. ""We need to excite all parts of party, bring everyone in and give everyone a Democrat to believe in."" Given that Sanders has been criticised for being too divisive, Pete Buttigieg for not being able to draw significant minority backing, and Biden for a lack of enthusiastic support, it was a roundhouse kick at the three candidates vying with her at the top of the polls. Are voters biased against women candidates? Democrats draw battle lines in Iowa Due to the last week's Iran crisis, foreign policy for the first time opened the debate - and the candidates fell into two broad categories. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders called for US forces to be withdrawn from the Middle East. Warren said that US generals had been saying for years that the US was ""turning a corner"" in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but they could never detail exactly how and when the US could get out. ""We've turned the corner so many times we're going in circles in these regions,"" she quipped, before saying that the US had to stop asking the military to solve problems that could not be addressed militarily. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and - somewhat obliquely - Pete Buttigieg came down in support of extending scaled-down US deployments in Iraq. Biden warned that without US troops in the region, the Islamic State group might regain strength. ""They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organise the effort to take them down,"" he said. When the topic turned to trade, similar divides formed - with a twist. Sanders said he opposed the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement negotiated by the Trump administration, while Warren said she reluctantly supported it as a ""modest improvement"". There haven't been too many cracks between Warren and Sanders on policy, but this was one. The irony, of course, is that recent polls show that a majority of Americans - and Democrats - are in favour of trade deals. Americans tend not to vote on foreign policy issues outside of times of war or national crisis - but as last week showed, there's no telling when such a moment could arise. The key issues for 2020 Democrats Warren may have had the standout moment, but the candidate who could end up emerging the biggest beneficiary of the evening is the one who has managed to bump and grind through the months and still seems in the best position heading into primary season. If there's a real break forming between Warren and Sanders, it is nothing but good news for the former vice-president. He can keep his head down while his fellow front-runners duke it out - and keeping his head down was exactly what he did on Tuesday night. Over the course of the evening, Biden once again showed that he's never going to be a master debater. He wasn't when he was in his prime and he seems to have lost a step in recent years. Nevertheless, the smaller debate stage has benefited him. Where he tended to get lost and tired in the lengthy double-digit candidate scrums, he has been more engaged in the past two contests. When the topic turned to impeachment, he noted that Republicans have ""savaged my surviving son"" - a subtle reference to the fact that he has buried two children and a wife, a source of sorrow that could generate public sympathy if Hunter Biden gets pulled into Trump's upcoming Senate trial. After Warren had her moment, Biden got the last word before the commercial break, noting that he has ""the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race"". That was a theme he returned to when asked whether he could go toe-to-toe with Trump in a general-election debate. ""I have support across the board,"" he said, touting his support from black and working-class voters. ""I'm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all."" Then it was time for more commercials. Once again, Biden got the last word. And his competitors missed out on yet another opportunity to ding the former vice-president before the campaign moves from places like Iowa and New Hampshire to more diverse states, where the breadth of Biden's coalition could give him the upper hand. Biden's far from a lock for the nomination, but he's keeping his ship afloat - which is more than many thought after his first few rocky debates. At the rally - Holly Honderich, BBC News, Milwaukee, Wisconsin ""What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation."" President Trump made fleeting - though biting - references to his Democratic challengers on Tuesday night, speaking at a campaign rally in Milwaukee just as his opponents took the debate stage in Iowa. Bernie Sanders is ""a nasty guy"" who is ""surging"" in the polls, Trump said to jeers and boos, as he addressed a state that voted for Sanders over Hillary Clinton by a 13-point margin in the 2016 Democratic primary. Trump resorted to well-worn insults to address the other frontrunners: ""Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren"" and ""Sleepy Joe Biden"", poking fun at the former vice-president for past gaffes. And with just these short swipes, Mr Trump said more about the Democratic field than any of his supporters were prepared to offer when asked about his political opponents. Some described the Democratic field as ""fools"", buffoons"" or ""jokes"", wasting time on impeachment. But none, they said, pose any real challenge to the president. ""No one can stand up to Trump,"" Vicky Francis said as she waited in line to attend her 10th Trump rally. ""Everything he said he would do, he has done. He's speaking the truth.""

"Tony Hall said the plan ""could be hugely disruptive"" but is ""an enormous creative opportunity"" BBC director general Tony Hall has outlined a plan that will see at least two thirds of the corporation's staff based outside London by 2027. Lord Hall said a new tech hub will be opened in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, while 150 jobs will be moved to Bristol. Salford will be ""the heart"" of BBC Sounds and will be home to more digital posts and ""much more journalism"". He said creating more jobs away from the capital would help to ""promote inclusion"" and ""diversity of thinking"". Just over half of the BBC's 19,000-strong workforce is currently based outside London. That figure was around a third a decade ago. ""Our centres have become magnets for ideas and talent, new jobs and investment,"" Lord Hall told BBC staff on Wednesday. ""That's really good news. But I know we can go further. We can do so much more for this country - and we're going to - starting this year."" Lord Hall said Newcastle's new tech hub would aim to deliver ""a new generation of software engineers, designers, product developers and data scientists in the north-east of England"". The natural history unit in Bristol will expand, while the BBC Sounds curation team will move to MediaCityUK in Salford to join controller Jonathan Wall ""within weeks"", he added. They will add non-BBC podcasts to the audio app. ""For the first time, we're going to open up Sounds to new British creators wherever they are and bring the best podcasts to everyone,"" Lord Hall explained. He also announced that children will soon get a ""radically different"" experience on iPlayer, while the BBC News app will also be overhauled. He said: ""This is the beginning of what I think should be a renewed push - getting the BBC up to at least two thirds around the country, if not more, by the time our charter comes to an end in 2027. ""I know all the risks. It will take time. It would cost money. It could be hugely disruptive. But it is an enormous creative opportunity - for audiences, for talent, for the UK. ""It'll make us more relevant, more in touch with audiences, more alive to creative opportunities. That's a really exciting prospect."" At current staffing levels, the plan would see around 2,800 jobs move out of the capital. However, the BBC is currently in the middle of a drive to save Â£800m by 2022. It reached around half of that target last year. Tony Hall was speaking at BBC Wales at Central Square, Cardiff Lord Hall acknowledged that the BBC had ""been through a lot"" since he became director general in 2013, and the organisation has ""not always got it right"". He vowed to keep ""learning, talking [and] changing"" to ensure the corporation is ""the most inclusive, innovative, inspiring place to work"". Last week, presenter Samira Ahmed won the employment tribunal she brought against the corporation in a dispute over equal pay. Samira Ahmed wins BBC equal pay tribunal Johnson 'could look at' abolishing BBC licence fee BBC and government 'should save free TV licences' In December, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was worth ""looking at"" whether to abolish the licence fee. The government is considering whether failure to pay the TV licence fee should cease to be a criminal offence. Both the BBC and the government came in for criticism from MPs last year after announcing free TV licences for all over-75s, would be scrapped. ""Don't be defensive about the BBC,"" Lord Hall urged staff on Wednesday, calling on them to ""demonstrate why we matter"".

"British Airways' owner IAG has filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breaches state aid rules. The move comes amid a growing backlash against the government's plan to defer some of Flybe's air passenger duty payments, thought to top Â£100m. EasyJet and Ryanair said taxpayer funds should not be used to save a rival. Meanwhile, the government's proposal to cut Air Passenger Duty (APD), was attacked by the rail industry's trade body and climate campaign groups. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""Taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies, especially when they are backed by well-funded businesses."" While Ryanair said it had called for ""more robust and frequent stress tests on financially weak airlines and tour operators so the taxpayer does not have to bail them out"". The government has said the review of the tax will be consistent with its zero-carbon targets. However, in a tweet, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: ""Addressing Flybe problems by reducing APD on all domestic flights is utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment to tackle the Climate Crisis. Domestic flights need to be reduced, not made cheaper."" The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, also said any review of APD ""that encourages more people to fly domestically would limit efforts to tackle the climate crisis"". What is air passenger duty? Climate campaigners attack aviation duty proposal Three questions for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I would be devastated if it went under' Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways, said government money should not have been used Ahead of filing the state aid complaint, Willie Walsh, the outgoing chief executive of IAG, wrote to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, criticising the government's involvement in its rescue. In a letter, Mr Walsh said: ""Prior to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for tax payers to fund its operations by subsidising regional routes. ""Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline. This is a blatant misuse of public funds. ""Flybe's precarious situation makes a mockery of the promises the airline, its shareholders and Heathrow have made about the expansion of regional flights if a third runway is built."" But Downing Street has said the government is ""fully compliant"" with state aid rules. The Prime Minister's spokesman said ""there has been no state aid to Flybe,"" adding that ""any future funding will be made on strictly commercial terms."" British Airways' owner IAG's decision to make a state-aid complaint to the European Commission underlines its determination to shine a light on - and if possible, overturn - the government's assistance to Flybe. Ministers have not published the details of the arrangement, but it is understood to include a ""time-to-pay"" arrangement for the company's airline passenger duty liabilities. These arrangements are common for companies that are struggling to pay their tax, but unusual when it comes to duty payments. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh's letter to Grant Shapps points out that Flybe has wealthy backers - Virgin Atlantic is a big shareholder, and one of Virgin's main shareholders in turn is Delta Air Lines, one of the biggest and most profitable airlines in the world. These are not the kind of companies, Mr Walsh argues, that should rely on taxpayer support to keep one of their investments trading. His intervention should, of course, be seen in the light of the long and bitter commercial rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. The latter's position at Heathrow is bolstered by Flybe's feed of domestic traffic, and BA would not be unhappy if that stream of traffic was choked off. Three Cabinet ministers - Mr Shapps, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Chancellor Sajid Javid signed off on the deal that will keep Flybe operating. Although the terms of the direct assistance were not disclosed, they are understood to include forbearance on Flybe's Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments. Mr Shapps said the move was necessary to protect key routes and any rule changes would apply to all carriers. ""The actions we have taken will support and enhance regional connectivity across the UK, so local communities have the domestic transport connections they rely on,"" he said. ""Any changes implemented as a result of our reviews of air passenger duty and regional connectivity will apply to all airlines in the competitive aviation market."" State aid is assistance given by the government to companies or other organisations that has the potential to distort market competition. The aid can be in the form of direct cash grants or indirect aid - such as preferential borrowing rates or tax credits. Under EU rules, member-state governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from the European Commission. For example, in 2015 the UK government submitted plans to provide a subsidy to Drax power station to convert one of its units from coal to biomass fuel. Following an investigation, the commission ruled in favour of the scheme. But there are exceptions to the rules. For example, aid worth less than 200,000 euros (Â£175,000) over three years is exempt. Even though Brexit is due to happen on 31 January, the UK will continue to follow EU state aid rules during the11-month transition periodthat follows. IAG believes the UK government's proposal would amount to unlawful state aid as it would impact other airlines operating the same routes as Flybe, but the government disagrees. What are the EU rules about state aid? Airlines collect the duty from passengers as part of their ticket price, and then hand it over to HMRC. It is understood Flybe could be given up to three months' breathing space to pay about Â£100m worth of duty. The ministers have also agreed to review air passenger duties on domestic flights in a move attacked by environmental campaigners. Ms Leadsom defended the decision to intervene, saying that Flybe was a ""viable business"". She also said Flybe's situation was different to that faced by travel firm Thomas Cook, which collapsed last year. ""The difference... between Flybe and Thomas Cook was that in the case of Thomas Cook it had huge amounts of debt, and any taxpayer's money would simply be throwing good money after bad."" Flybe's owners - Virgin Atlantic, Cyrus Capital and Stobart Air - will inject about Â£30m of new money. In his letter, Mr Walsh pointed out that Virgin is part-owned by US carrier Delta Air Lines, which is one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines. He argues that Virgin and Delta together have the resources to rescue Flybe, and they should not be asking for taxpayer support. Mr Walsh says Flybe has been mismanaged. Flybe is already in receipt of some public money for its important Newquay-Heathrow route, which it operates under a ""public service obligation"" contract with the government. Mr Walsh said that British Airways had indicated its willingness to operate that route without assistance - in the summer only - but was excluded because of the Flybe deal. He warned the government that Flybe's Heathrow operations could, in time, be diverted to long-haul routes - which would not be in line with its policy of promoting regional connections to London. But Rob Griggs, director of policy at Airlines UK, the industry trade body, defended the deal. He said giving extra time to Flybe to pay APD was not the same as a direct injection of public funds. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), a union, also welcomed the news. ""This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe,"" said Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton. Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns Flybe - said the group had agreed to ""keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives"". ""We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity,"" he said.

"The government has agreed a rescue plan for troubled regional airline Flybe. Ministers agreed to work with Flybe to figure out a repayment plan for a significant tax debt that is thought to top Â£100m. Meanwhile, the firm's owners have agreed to pump more money into the loss-making airline. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the deal would keep the company operating. That will be a relief to many of the eight million passengers who fly with the airline each year. However, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways has attacked the move as a misuse of public funds. In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, a copy of which has been seen by the BBC, Willie Walsh questioned why the taxpayer is picking up the tab for the airline's mismanagement. He pointed out that one of Flybe's biggest shareholders Virgin Atlantic, is part owned by the US's Delta, one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines. Flybe services dozens of UK domestic routes that are not flown by other airlines, making it the largest carrier to fly out of some regional airports, like Newquay. ""Flybe plays a critical and unique role in the UK aviation system, supporting the development of the regions, providing essential connectivity to businesses and stimulating the growth in trade,"" the boss of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said in a statement welcoming the rescue deal.

As part of the agreement, Flybe's shareholders, which include Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group, have agreed to put more money into the business. The government has promised to review the Â£26 air passenger duty that is levied on domestic UK return fights, which has added to the airline's losses. Why Flybe matters 'I would be devastated if it went under' ""Delighted that we have reached agreement with Flybe's shareholders to keep the company operating, ensuring that UK regions remain connected,"" Ms Leadsom tweeted. ""This will be welcome news for Flybe's staff, customers and creditors and we will continue the hard work to ensure a sustainable future."" Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns  Flybe - said the group had agreed to ""keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives"". ""We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity,"" he said. The transport secretary said the government had worked closely with Flybe to ensure its planes were able to continue flying. Mr Shapps said the Department for Transport would conduct an urgent review that will seek to assess how it can improve regional connectivity and ensure airports continue to function across the country. But the prospect of cutting taxes on flying has angered climate activists who argue that it is the most carbon intensive mode of transport. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said reducing air passenger duty was ""utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment"" to tackle climate change. ""Domestic flights need to be reduced, not made cheaper,"" she wrote on Twitter. But the government has said the review of the tax will be consistent with its zero carbon targets. The British Airline Pilots Association, a union, welcomed the news. ""This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe,"" general secretary, Brian Strutton said in a statement. Flybe, which flies to 170 different destinations, has been struggling under the weight of an estimated Â£106m bill for air passenger duty as well as a slowdown in demand that has hurt the airline's finances. The carrier's boss, Mark Anderson, said: ""This is a positive outcome for the UK and will allow us to focus on delivering for our customers and planning for the future. ""Flybe is made up of an incredible team of people, serving millions of loyal customers who rely on the vital regional connectivity that we provide.""

"There is no application form for the Royal Family. No interview, no appeal, few in the way of entrances or exits. It is that strange lottery, an accident of birth. But to stay royal you have to do two things. Serve, and survive. You have to do some service. Some of it ceremonial, and often dull.  Some of it - if it involves celebrities or travel - less dull. A lot of it is woven into the civic life of the UK - openings, namings, lunches and dinners. You have to survive. You have to aid - and certainly not threaten - the survival of the House of Windsor and the British monarchy. It's not a bad life. It is a constrained life, often unchosen. In exchange for a pretty comfortable standard of living in perpetuity, you lose a lot of choice. But you must do these two things if you want to remain a royal. And it's not clear that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex really want to do either. Queen and Prince Harry to hold talks over Sussexes' future 'You can't just be a royal then decide not to be' Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement How could the Sussexes make money? In Sandringham later the players will receive a series of options, a range of possibilities. These will be based on the stated aim of Prince Harry and Meghan that they want financial independence, to take paid employment, to spend a lot more time outside the UK, to exclude the media from their lives at their discretion and to continue at least in part, a royal life, service to the Queen. Leaving aside the heady brew of contradictions detailed elsewhere, the balancing of these different aims and demands is hard enough.  Money is a big issue. But so will be the status of the court of Prince Harry and Meghan that emerges. Will it be entirely independent of the palace, of the monarchy? Will the palace retain any veto on direction or projects for the couple? Much, says one official, depends on how much royal work the prince and Meghan intend to do, and where. Meghan will be in Canada with her eight-month-old son Archie during Monday's meeting To watch Prince Harry for not very long, as I have, is to observe a man who comes alive with crowds, with love, with those who need him. But also to see a man entirely unhappy with his lot. A man who desperately wants to get away from cameras, observers, outsiders, looking and filming and exploiting him. Now the prince, who has worn the nation's uniform in combat and amongst death and injury, is openly sneered at across pages and feeds and memes. It is hardly a great national moment. Prince Harry has had a hard time, from when his mother was taken from him, a boy aged 12. It is important to remember also because it demolishes the Meghan Myth - that somehow she is the root of all today's turmoil. The Meghan Myth is nonsense, with a generous sprinkling of spite, misogyny and some racism. The prince always wanted out. And together, with her brains and understanding and love, they think they have a way. Maybe a deal comes on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But what are not up for negotiation are service and survival. Both must be observed by Prince Harry and Meghan if they are to remain royals. Perhaps Prince Harry's allergy to media coverage can be managed at those royal events and duties he attends.  Perhaps the couple will make themselves available to a significant and visible degree of service. But the style of their departure from familial obligation, their declaration of independence last week, was so abrupt and so disrespectful. The duke has gone beyond rebellious prince. Meghan, the enabler, is in Canada, with child and dogs. That degree of going rogue looks quite a lot like a direct threat to the survival of the monarchy. That is why today's meeting is hard. Maybe the two sides can strike a deal over the next day, two days, invent a new structure that officials say might be emulated for a new royal generation. But will the couple really agree to the restrictions that service and survival demand? A deal will probably be crafted - however the direction of travel is one way.

"Boris Johnson faces questions from Jeremy Corbyn and backbench MPs Labour leader criticises government's record on the NHS, citing underfunding, understaffing and growing waiting times The PM insists the government is investing and will improve care It comes after the government stepped in to save troubled airline Flybe The move has been criticised by industry rivals and environmental groups MPs will spend the rest of the day debating the Queen's Speech Peers continue to examine the Brexit bill Paul Seddon, Victoria King and Jennifer Scott BBC ParliamentFreeview channel 232 We are taking a break from the text updates for now, but you can watch the live streams for the Commons and the Lords above. The main lines wrapped up... Well, the second PMQs of the year was a fairly low-key affair. Jeremy Corbyn avoided the Flybe rescue deal entirely - despite his people criticising it afterwards. Instead, he concentrated his questions on growing waiting times in the NHS and the social care crisis - both favourite topics of his. Later today, ministers will be presenting their bill which writes into law their proposed increases in NHS funding over the next five years. But the Labour leader was keen to point out even those increases would be ""inadequate"" given the expected rise in demand. Notably, Boris Johnson did admit that hospital waiting lists were ""unacceptable"" and made a pledge to get waiting times down - a topic which is sure to run and run. He also faced an attack from SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who branded him a ""democracy denier"" for hisrejection of another Scottish independence vote. In return, the prime minister called on Mr Blackford to ""change the record,"" accusing him of being ""obsessed"" with independence to the detriment of his constituents. Again, it won't be the last we hear from the pair on this subject. A bit more from the post-PMQs briefing from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's team. Asked about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's intention to step back
as senior royals, his spokesman said: âJeremy has
commented in the past in relation to Prince Harry and Meghan about press
intrusion and its impact on people and their families."" Asked whether Mr Corbyn agreed with Prince Harryâs comments
that there had been racial undertones to criticism of Meghan, his spokesman
replied: âYes. He agrees with the broad sentiment that Harry has put forward.â Lobby reporters are revealing snippets from their post PMQs chat with Jeremy Corbyn's spokesman. Flybe may not have come up during the session itself, but asked what the Labour leader thinks of the government's intervention, the spokesman said it was ""ad hoc corporate welfare which once again benefits Richard Branson"". Mr Branson's Virgin was part of a consortium which saved the airline from collapse a year ago. House of CommonsParliament After PMQs finished, MPs had the chance to raise points of order - we mentioned Crispin Blunt's on the issue of Commons prayers a short time ago. After him, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi uses the opportunity to accuse new Tory MP for Bridgend, Jamie Wallis, of misleading the press over hisalleged linksto a website called Sugar-Daddy.net. It has emerged that the site was advertised on the website of another company, Quickie Divorce Ltd, of which he was a director before entering Parliament. Ms Antoniazzi says statements given by Mr Wallis about his links to the site are ""contradicted"" by records held by Companies House, and calls on him to apologise. This video can not be played Ann Widdecombe: 'Co-operation morphed into domination' While MPs debate the Queen's Speech in the Commons, MEPs are tackling the subject of how the European Union should work in the future. The debate has led to politicians from both sides of the Brexit debate warning the organisation to ""learn the lessons"" of the UK's exit. Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe said the EU should scale back to a ""loose alliance"" if it wants to continue. And Green Party MEP Scott Ainslie warned against it becoming ""distant, unaccountable and out of touch"". You can read more on the debate here. Allow Twitter content?

House of CommonsParliament Interim Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey asks the prime minister to review changes to bereavement support payments brought in during 2017. He says his mother received the payments after she became a widow, and many MPs thought at the time the new 18-month window for payments was too short.

She says that last year alone, more than 4,000 offences of online child abuse were recorded by police. ""It is easier to analyse our online shopping habits, but less easy to keep children safe,"" she says, asking what the government is going to do about it. Boris Johnson says he is ""very concerned about what is happening online"" and it was discussed at cabinet yesterday.

"Girls aged between 11 and 13 are increasingly being tricked and coerced into performing sexually over their own webcams, data suggests. The Internet Watch Foundation said 80% of the sexual selfies it found in its relentless trawl for images of child sexual abuse were of children this age. The charity took action on 37,000 self-generated images of children last year. About 30,000 were of adolescents. Its chief executive said the number of cases was growing at an alarming rate. Susie Hargreaves described the distribution of such images and films, often self-made in domestic settings, as a ""national crisis"". Often children were seen looking into cameras, reading messages asking them to do something and complying. The IWF said of all web pages featuring images of child sexual abuse, a third consisted of self-generated images, mostly by girls in a domestic setting. Ms Hargreaves said: ""These are images and videos of girls that have been groomed, coerced and tricked into performing sexually over webcam in what is fast becoming a national crisis. ""There has never been a more poignant time to shine a light on the uncomfortable truth we are now faced with."" Victims were getting younger, she said, as more younger children had access to webcams from their phones in their bedrooms. ""At this age, they are incredibly vulnerable,"" Ms Hargreaves said. ""They are still developing physically and they don't have the emotional maturity to understand what is going on. ""They are being flattered, told they are beautiful. They often think they are in relationship with someone."" One victim told the BBC she was talked into sending a topless photograph online to someone who claimed to be a woman recruiting models. The victim, who was 13 at the time, said: ""After I'd sent that picture, her whole demeanour towards me changed."" She says she was forced to send more photos and to share her home address - with the threat that the first image would be printed out and posted on railings near her school if she did not comply. The victim, who is now years older, said a man then came to her house, sexually assaulted her in her bedroom and took more photos. ""I didn't realise it at the time but the perpetrator that came to the house was the same person that I'd been speaking to online,"" the victim said. ""He told me from the very start that he'd printed off and put onto disk the images that had been sent online the night before, and that if I didn't do what he said, or if I told anybody, that he would distribute those."" Ms Hargreaves urged young men who might stumble across such images of under-age children as they viewed pornography online to report it and ""save many more victims of child sexual abuse"". Reporting can be done quickly, anonymously and safelyhere,external. It is the first time detail of the types of images discovered and age groups affected have been revealed. Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chief's Council lead on child protection, said: ""Work like this, which seeks to educate people about the law and encourage them to be responsible, and especially to report any sexual images and videos of under-18s, supports the reduction of crime, the removal of indecent content and, importantly, lessens the harm to victims."" Tink Palmer, of the Marie Collins Foundation, which works with the IWF over the issue, said the amount of indecent content featuring children was growing. ""All internet users need to understand that they are breaking the law if they view this material, regardless of who has taken or uploaded it,"" she said.

"Boris Johnson faces questions from Jeremy Corbyn and backbench MPs Labour leader criticises government's record on the NHS, citing underfunding, understaffing and growing waiting times The PM insists the government is investing and will improve care It comes after the government stepped in to save troubled airline Flybe The move has been criticised by industry rivals and environmental groups MPs will spend the rest of the day debating the Queen's Speech Peers continue to examine the Brexit bill Paul Seddon, Victoria King and Jennifer Scott BBC ParliamentFreeview channel 232 We are taking a break from the text updates for now, but you can watch the live streams for the Commons and the Lords above. The main lines wrapped up... Well, the second PMQs of the year was a fairly low-key affair. Jeremy Corbyn avoided the Flybe rescue deal entirely - despite his people criticising it afterwards. Instead, he concentrated his questions on growing waiting times in the NHS and the social care crisis - both favourite topics of his. Later today, ministers will be presenting their bill which writes into law their proposed increases in NHS funding over the next five years. But the Labour leader was keen to point out even those increases would be ""inadequate"" given the expected rise in demand. Notably, Boris Johnson did admit that hospital waiting lists were ""unacceptable"" and made a pledge to get waiting times down - a topic which is sure to run and run. He also faced an attack from SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who branded him a ""democracy denier"" for hisrejection of another Scottish independence vote. In return, the prime minister called on Mr Blackford to ""change the record,"" accusing him of being ""obsessed"" with independence to the detriment of his constituents. Again, it won't be the last we hear from the pair on this subject. A bit more from the post-PMQs briefing from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's team. Asked about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's intention to step back
as senior royals, his spokesman said: âJeremy has
commented in the past in relation to Prince Harry and Meghan about press
intrusion and its impact on people and their families."" Asked whether Mr Corbyn agreed with Prince Harryâs comments
that there had been racial undertones to criticism of Meghan, his spokesman
replied: âYes. He agrees with the broad sentiment that Harry has put forward.â Lobby reporters are revealing snippets from their post PMQs chat with Jeremy Corbyn's spokesman. Flybe may not have come up during the session itself, but asked what the Labour leader thinks of the government's intervention, the spokesman said it was ""ad hoc corporate welfare which once again benefits Richard Branson"". Mr Branson's Virgin was part of a consortium which saved the airline from collapse a year ago. House of CommonsParliament After PMQs finished, MPs had the chance to raise points of order - we mentioned Crispin Blunt's on the issue of Commons prayers a short time ago. After him, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi uses the opportunity to accuse new Tory MP for Bridgend, Jamie Wallis, of misleading the press over hisalleged linksto a website called Sugar-Daddy.net. It has emerged that the site was advertised on the website of another company, Quickie Divorce Ltd, of which he was a director before entering Parliament. Ms Antoniazzi says statements given by Mr Wallis about his links to the site are ""contradicted"" by records held by Companies House, and calls on him to apologise. This video can not be played Ann Widdecombe: 'Co-operation morphed into domination' While MPs debate the Queen's Speech in the Commons, MEPs are tackling the subject of how the European Union should work in the future. The debate has led to politicians from both sides of the Brexit debate warning the organisation to ""learn the lessons"" of the UK's exit. Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe said the EU should scale back to a ""loose alliance"" if it wants to continue. And Green Party MEP Scott Ainslie warned against it becoming ""distant, unaccountable and out of touch"". You can read more on the debate here. Allow Twitter content?

Today is focused on a ""green industrial revolution"" and is being opened by Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. But before she gets to the main speech, she makes a little dig at the former Speaker (and her long-time foe) John Bercow. Addressing his successor, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Mrs Leadsom says: ""Can I start by congratulating you on the superb way you have taken over the speakership?

House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Crispin Blunt makes a point of order, starting with a slight brag over how busy it is on the government benches and how hard it is to get a seat. However, he then makes a serious point about procedure in the Commons. Every day starts in the House with prayers, and Mr Blunt says to get a seat, ""those of us who don't have faith, or have a face other than that of the established church, are required to take part."" He calls on the procedural committee to look at the issue over the next Parliament so ""those who find this uncomfortable aren't placed in this position"". The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, agrees the ""the matter needs to be taken up"". House of CommonsParliament PMQs is all done and dusted after 31 minutes - someone, we think it might be Boris Johnson, is overheard saying ""my word!"" as things wrapped up so promptly. Sir Lindsay Hoyle's predecessor, John Bercow, routinely ran way, way over - an hour was pretty common. What's he talking about? Allow Twitter content?

House of CommonsParliament Interim Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey asks the prime minister to review changes to bereavement support payments brought in during 2017. He says his mother received the payments after she became a widow, and many MPs thought at the time the new 18-month window for payments was too short. Boris Johnson commits to meeting Sir Ed to discuss the matter, and says the government is committed to providing ""easily accessible support"" for bereaved families. House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Maria Miller raises the issue of child abuse in her question, saying it is ""not a thing of the past in this country"". She says that last year alone, more than 4,000 offences of online child abuse were recorded by police. ""It is easier to analyse our online shopping habits, but less easy to keep children safe,"" she says, asking what the government is going to do about it. Boris Johnson says he is ""very concerned about what is happening online"" and it was discussed at cabinet yesterday. He says the government's forthcoming white paper - policy documents - will make companies more responsible, adding he will be ""taking further action in the future to stamp out this vice"". Boris Johnson repeats his manifesto promise to end prosecutions of veterans of the Nothern Ireland Troubles âwhere there is no new evidenceâ. There have been questions about whether that could be more complex now the Stormont government is back up and running. The revival of the devolved administration requires the creation of a new Historical Investigations Unit to look at crimes from the past - it replaces the much criticised Historical Enquiries Unit. One of the criticisms levelled at the HEU was that it treated allegations involving military personnel less seriously than those involving non-state actors.

"Cheaper hotel costs helped to push the inflation rate down The UK's inflation rate fell to its lowest for more than three years in December, increasing speculation that interest rates could be cut. The rate dropped to 1.3% last month,external, down from 1.5% in November, partly due to a fall in the price of women's clothes and hotel room costs. December's inflation rate was the lowest since November 2016. Analysts said it raised the chances of a rate cut, with inflation below the Bank of England's target of 2%. ""Very soft UK inflation data for December leaves the door wide open for a Bank of England rate cut on 30 January,"" said Melissa Davies, an economist at stock broker Redburn. The Bank's main interest rate is used by banks and other lenders who set borrowing costs. It affects everything from mortgages to business loans and has a big effect on the finances of individuals and companies. City traders who spend their working lives trying to anticipate moves in interest rates are convinced of it today: the Bank of England is likely to cut the official interest rate when it meets later this month. Market indicators suggest a 60% chance of it happening. Here's the thinking: at 1.3%, the official measure of consumer price inflation in the year to December was lower than expected and well below the 2% target. With the economy barely growing (even shrinking if you are prepared to rely on the official November estimate of a 0.3% contraction) there's little sign of inflationary pressure in the near future. Granted, there was a sharp rise in the price of crude oil - a barrel was up 4.9% in the month and 17.4% on the year. But in spite of that, producers were still paying slightly less for their raw materials and supplies than they were last year. The assumption has been that the November contraction was a temporary period of weakness induced by pre-election political uncertainty - and that there will be a recovery as businesses and consumers regain a new-found confidence to spend and invest. The risk the MPC will have to contend with is that that hoped-for post-election recovery does not materialise. Earlier on Wednesday, Michael Saunders, one of the rate setters on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), reiterated his view that borrowing costs should be lowered. ""It probably will be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and possibly to cut rates further, in order to reduce risks of a sustained undershoot of the 2% inflation target,"" he said. Last week, two other rate setters and Bank governor Mark Carney also suggested that rates could be cut, depending on how the economy performs. On Sunday, MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe told the Financial Timeshe would consider voting for a rate cutdepending on how the economy has performed since the December election. However, members of the MPC could take the latest inflation figure with a pinch of salt, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Half of the decline in the headline rate was driven by a sharp fall in volatile airline fares inflation,"" he said. He expects inflation to rise to 1.6% in the first three months of 2020, and this could mean enough MPC members will decide to wait rather than voting to cut rates. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for personal investing at money manager Fidelity International, said the inflation data painted a bleaker picture for the UK economy than before. ""Today's UK CPI figures simply add to the growing sense of unease many feel when considering the outlook for the UK economy, with the rate of inflation continuing to lag well below the Bank of England's target of 2%."" A cut would ease the finances of borrowers, but create a tougher environment for savers, she added.

"Steyer, Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, Sanders and Klobuchar There have been seven official Democratic debates but this one had a real sense of urgency - in less than three weeks the candidates will face their first test. The primary season begins on 3 February with the Iowa caucuses, when the Democratic voters in this state will pick who they want to take on Donald Trump in November. As the six White House hopefuls took to the debate stage in Des Moines, the Republican US president they have in their sights was mocking them at a rally 400 miles east in Wisconsin. Here are some key moments from the debate - and the Trump rally. The body language between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the conclusion of the debate - when they spoke heatedly and did not shake hands - told its own story. Are voters biased against women candidates? The non-aggression pact between the two candidates could be over just as the voting is set to begin. The biggest news story in campaign politics over the past few days had been the growing tensions between the two most liberal candidates. This video can not be played Warren confronts Sanders after the debate - and doesn't shake hands Warren had alleged that Sanders told her in December 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidency - something Sanders denied. Asked about this during the debate, Sanders denied it again - saying he has long supported the idea of a woman president. Then Warren had her turn, and in a set-piece response she clearly spent time crafting, she hit a number of political targets almost in one breath. She started by essentially implying that Sanders was lying. She then pivoted her response into a shout-out for the electoral success that she and Amy Klobuchar, the other woman candidate on the stage, have had. They've won every election they've been in, she said to thunderous applause, while the three male politicians debating have lost 10 between them. She ended by pitching herself as the unity candidate with a broad coalition. ""The real danger we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull the party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of constituency,"" she said. ""We need to excite all parts of party, bring everyone in and give everyone a Democrat to believe in."" Given that Sanders has been criticised for being too divisive, Pete Buttigieg for not being able to draw significant minority backing, and Biden for a lack of enthusiastic support, it was a roundhouse kick at the three candidates vying with her at the top of the polls. Are voters biased against women candidates? Democrats draw battle lines in Iowa Due to the last week's Iran crisis, foreign policy for the first time opened the debate - and the candidates fell into two broad categories. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders called for US forces to be withdrawn from the Middle East. Warren said that US generals had been saying for years that the US was ""turning a corner"" in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but they could never detail exactly how and when the US could get out. ""We've turned the corner so many times we're going in circles in these regions,"" she quipped, before saying that the US had to stop asking the military to solve problems that could not be addressed militarily. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and - somewhat obliquely - Pete Buttigieg came down in support of extending scaled-down US deployments in Iraq. Biden warned that without US troops in the region, the Islamic State group might regain strength. ""They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organise the effort to take them down,"" he said. When the topic turned to trade, similar divides formed - with a twist. Sanders said he opposed the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement negotiated by the Trump administration, while Warren said she reluctantly supported it as a ""modest improvement"". There haven't been too many cracks between Warren and Sanders on policy, but this was one. The irony, of course, is that recent polls show that a majority of Americans - and Democrats - are in favour of trade deals. Americans tend not to vote on foreign policy issues outside of times of war or national crisis - but as last week showed, there's no telling when such a moment could arise. The key issues for 2020 Democrats Warren may have had the standout moment, but the candidate who could end up emerging the biggest beneficiary of the evening is the one who has managed to bump and grind through the months and still seems in the best position heading into primary season. If there's a real break forming between Warren and Sanders, it is nothing but good news for the former vice-president. He can keep his head down while his fellow front-runners duke it out - and keeping his head down was exactly what he did on Tuesday night. Over the course of the evening, Biden once again showed that he's never going to be a master debater. He wasn't when he was in his prime and he seems to have lost a step in recent years. Nevertheless, the smaller debate stage has benefited him. Where he tended to get lost and tired in the lengthy double-digit candidate scrums, he has been more engaged in the past two contests. When the topic turned to impeachment, he noted that Republicans have ""savaged my surviving son"" - a subtle reference to the fact that he has buried two children and a wife, a source of sorrow that could generate public sympathy if Hunter Biden gets pulled into Trump's upcoming Senate trial. After Warren had her moment, Biden got the last word before the commercial break, noting that he has ""the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race"". That was a theme he returned to when asked whether he could go toe-to-toe with Trump in a general-election debate. ""I have support across the board,"" he said, touting his support from black and working-class voters. ""I'm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all."" Then it was time for more commercials. Once again, Biden got the last word. And his competitors missed out on yet another opportunity to ding the former vice-president before the campaign moves from places like Iowa and New Hampshire to more diverse states, where the breadth of Biden's coalition could give him the upper hand. Biden's far from a lock for the nomination, but he's keeping his ship afloat - which is more than many thought after his first few rocky debates. At the rally - Holly Honderich, BBC News, Milwaukee, Wisconsin ""What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation."" President Trump made fleeting - though biting - references to his Democratic challengers on Tuesday night, speaking at a campaign rally in Milwaukee just as his opponents took the debate stage in Iowa. Bernie Sanders is ""a nasty guy"" who is ""surging"" in the polls, Trump said to jeers and boos, as he addressed a state that voted for Sanders over Hillary Clinton by a 13-point margin in the 2016 Democratic primary. Trump resorted to well-worn insults to address the other frontrunners: ""Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren"" and ""Sleepy Joe Biden"", poking fun at the former vice-president for past gaffes. And with just these short swipes, Mr Trump said more about the Democratic field than any of his supporters were prepared to offer when asked about his political opponents. Some described the Democratic field as ""fools"", buffoons"" or ""jokes"", wasting time on impeachment. But none, they said, pose any real challenge to the president. ""No one can stand up to Trump,"" Vicky Francis said as she waited in line to attend her 10th Trump rally. ""Everything he said he would do, he has done. He's speaking the truth.""

"Boeing has reported its worst annual orders in at least two decades - as it remains in crisis over its 737 Max model. The company also said deliveries of its planes slumped to an 11-year low last year. It means the US firm has lost its title as the world's biggest plane maker to European rival Airbus. The 737 Max has been grounded since March after two crashes in which 346 people were killed. Boeing said net orders after cancellations for 2019 totalled just 54 planes. That compares with 893 the previous year. At the same time deliveries fell by 53% to 380 planes, the lowest number since 2007. What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing 737 Max: The battle over blame New Boeing chief: 'I'm confident in the future' The company last month halted production of what had been its best-selling commercial airliner. The grounding of the 737 Max means it is impossible for the firm to deliver the planes to customers. In comparison, Boeing's main rival Airbus said earlier this month that it delivered a record 863 planes in 2019 and racked up a net 768 orders after cancellations. 29 October 2018:A 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air crashes after leaving Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board 31 January 2019:Boeing reports an order of 5,011 Max planes from 79 customers 10 March 2019:A 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashes, killing all 157 people on board 14 March 2019:Boeing grounds entire 737 Max aircraft fleet A bright spot for the Chicago-based plane maker was a record number of deliveries of 787 Dreamliners in the last three months of 2019. The company delivered 45 of the wide-body passenger jets, which first went into service in 2011. Boeing's new chief executive David Calhoun took the helm of the manufacturer on Monday. Mr Calhoun said he is ""confident in the future"" of the firm, telling staff his ""primary focus"" will be returning the 737 Max to the skies. He replaced Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired last month, in a move the company's board said was necessary to ""restore confidence"" in Boeing. The aviation industry is also feeling the pressure over fears of a global economic slowdown and the US-China trade war.

"British Airways' owner IAG has filed a complaint to the EU arguing Flybe's rescue breaches state aid rules. The move comes amid a growing backlash against the government's plan to defer some of Flybe's air passenger duty payments, thought to top Â£100m. EasyJet and Ryanair said taxpayer funds should not be used to save a rival. Meanwhile, the government's proposal to cut Air Passenger Duty (APD), was attacked by the rail industry's trade body and climate campaign groups. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""Taxpayers should not be used to bail out individual companies, especially when they are backed by well-funded businesses."" While Ryanair said it had called for ""more robust and frequent stress tests on financially weak airlines and tour operators so the taxpayer does not have to bail them out"". The government has said the review of the tax will be consistent with its zero-carbon targets. However, in a tweet, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: ""Addressing Flybe problems by reducing APD on all domestic flights is utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment to tackle the Climate Crisis. Domestic flights need to be reduced, not made cheaper."" The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, also said any review of APD ""that encourages more people to fly domestically would limit efforts to tackle the climate crisis"". What is air passenger duty? Climate campaigners attack aviation duty proposal Three questions for Flybe Why Flybe matters 'I would be devastated if it went under' Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways, said government money should not have been used Ahead of filing the state aid complaint, Willie Walsh, the outgoing chief executive of IAG, wrote to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, criticising the government's involvement in its rescue. In a letter, Mr Walsh said: ""Prior to the acquisition of Flybe by the consortium which includes Virgin/Delta, Flybe argued for tax payers to fund its operations by subsidising regional routes. ""Virgin/Delta now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline. This is a blatant misuse of public funds. ""Flybe's precarious situation makes a mockery of the promises the airline, its shareholders and Heathrow have made about the expansion of regional flights if a third runway is built."" But Downing Street has said the government is ""fully compliant"" with state aid rules. The Prime Minister's spokesman said ""there has been no state aid to Flybe,"" adding that ""any future funding will be made on strictly commercial terms."" British Airways' owner IAG's decision to make a state-aid complaint to the European Commission underlines its determination to shine a light on - and if possible, overturn - the government's assistance to Flybe. Ministers have not published the details of the arrangement, but it is understood to include a ""time-to-pay"" arrangement for the company's airline passenger duty liabilities. These arrangements are common for companies that are struggling to pay their tax, but unusual when it comes to duty payments. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh's letter to Grant Shapps points out that Flybe has wealthy backers - Virgin Atlantic is a big shareholder, and one of Virgin's main shareholders in turn is Delta Air Lines, one of the biggest and most profitable airlines in the world. These are not the kind of companies, Mr Walsh argues, that should rely on taxpayer support to keep one of their investments trading. His intervention should, of course, be seen in the light of the long and bitter commercial rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. The latter's position at Heathrow is bolstered by Flybe's feed of domestic traffic, and BA would not be unhappy if that stream of traffic was choked off. Three Cabinet ministers - Mr Shapps, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Chancellor Sajid Javid signed off on the deal that will keep Flybe operating. Although the terms of the direct assistance were not disclosed, they are understood to include forbearance on Flybe's Air Passenger Duty (APD) payments. Mr Shapps said the move was necessary to protect key routes and any rule changes would apply to all carriers. ""The actions we have taken will support and enhance regional connectivity across the UK, so local communities have the domestic transport connections they rely on,"" he said. ""Any changes implemented as a result of our reviews of air passenger duty and regional connectivity will apply to all airlines in the competitive aviation market."" State aid is assistance given by the government to companies or other organisations that has the potential to distort market competition. The aid can be in the form of direct cash grants or indirect aid - such as preferential borrowing rates or tax credits. Under EU rules, member-state governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from the European Commission. For example, in 2015 the UK government submitted plans to provide a subsidy to Drax power station to convert one of its units from coal to biomass fuel. Following an investigation, the commission ruled in favour of the scheme. But there are exceptions to the rules. For example, aid worth less than 200,000 euros (Â£175,000) over three years is exempt. Even though Brexit is due to happen on 31 January, the UK will continue to follow EU state aid rules during the11-month transition periodthat follows. IAG believes the UK government's proposal would amount to unlawful state aid as it would impact other airlines operating the same routes as Flybe, but the government disagrees. What are the EU rules about state aid? Airlines collect the duty from passengers as part of their ticket price, and then hand it over to HMRC. It is understood Flybe could be given up to three months' breathing space to pay about Â£100m worth of duty. The ministers have also agreed to review air passenger duties on domestic flights in a move attacked by environmental campaigners. Ms Leadsom defended the decision to intervene, saying that Flybe was a ""viable business"". She also said Flybe's situation was different to that faced by travel firm Thomas Cook, which collapsed last year. ""The difference... between Flybe and Thomas Cook was that in the case of Thomas Cook it had huge amounts of debt, and any taxpayer's money would simply be throwing good money after bad."" Flybe's owners - Virgin Atlantic, Cyrus Capital and Stobart Air - will inject about Â£30m of new money. In his letter, Mr Walsh pointed out that Virgin is part-owned by US carrier Delta Air Lines, which is one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines. He argues that Virgin and Delta together have the resources to rescue Flybe, and they should not be asking for taxpayer support. Mr Walsh says Flybe has been mismanaged. Flybe is already in receipt of some public money for its important Newquay-Heathrow route, which it operates under a ""public service obligation"" contract with the government. Mr Walsh said that British Airways had indicated its willingness to operate that route without assistance - in the summer only - but was excluded because of the Flybe deal. He warned the government that Flybe's Heathrow operations could, in time, be diverted to long-haul routes - which would not be in line with its policy of promoting regional connections to London. But Rob Griggs, director of policy at Airlines UK, the industry trade body, defended the deal. He said giving extra time to Flybe to pay APD was not the same as a direct injection of public funds. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), a union, also welcomed the news. ""This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe,"" said Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton. Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns Flybe - said the group had agreed to ""keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives"". ""We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity,"" he said.

"Steyer, Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, Sanders and Klobuchar There have been seven official Democratic debates but this one had a real sense of urgency - in less than three weeks the candidates will face their first test. The primary season begins on 3 February with the Iowa caucuses, when the Democratic voters in this state will pick who they want to take on Donald Trump in November. As the six White House hopefuls took to the debate stage in Des Moines, the Republican US president they have in their sights was mocking them at a rally 400 miles east in Wisconsin. Here are some key moments from the debate - and the Trump rally. The body language between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the conclusion of the debate - when they spoke heatedly and did not shake hands - told its own story. Are voters biased against women candidates? The non-aggression pact between the two candidates could be over just as the voting is set to begin. The biggest news story in campaign politics over the past few days had been the growing tensions between the two most liberal candidates. This video can not be played Warren confronts Sanders after the debate - and doesn't shake hands Warren had alleged that Sanders told her in December 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidency - something Sanders denied. Asked about this during the debate, Sanders denied it again - saying he has long supported the idea of a woman president. Then Warren had her turn, and in a set-piece response she clearly spent time crafting, she hit a number of political targets almost in one breath. She started by essentially implying that Sanders was lying. She then pivoted her response into a shout-out for the electoral success that she and Amy Klobuchar, the other woman candidate on the stage, have had. They've won every election they've been in, she said to thunderous applause, while the three male politicians debating have lost 10 between them. She ended by pitching herself as the unity candidate with a broad coalition. ""The real danger we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull the party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of constituency,"" she said. ""We need to excite all parts of party, bring everyone in and give everyone a Democrat to believe in."" Given that Sanders has been criticised for being too divisive, Pete Buttigieg for not being able to draw significant minority backing, and Biden for a lack of enthusiastic support, it was a roundhouse kick at the three candidates vying with her at the top of the polls. Are voters biased against women candidates? Democrats draw battle lines in Iowa Due to the last week's Iran crisis, foreign policy for the first time opened the debate - and the candidates fell into two broad categories. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders called for US forces to be withdrawn from the Middle East. Warren said that US generals had been saying for years that the US was ""turning a corner"" in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but they could never detail exactly how and when the US could get out. ""We've turned the corner so many times we're going in circles in these regions,"" she quipped, before saying that the US had to stop asking the military to solve problems that could not be addressed militarily. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and - somewhat obliquely - Pete Buttigieg came down in support of extending scaled-down US deployments in Iraq. Biden warned that without US troops in the region, the Islamic State group might regain strength. ""They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organise the effort to take them down,"" he said. When the topic turned to trade, similar divides formed - with a twist. Sanders said he opposed the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement negotiated by the Trump administration, while Warren said she reluctantly supported it as a ""modest improvement"". There haven't been too many cracks between Warren and Sanders on policy, but this was one. The irony, of course, is that recent polls show that a majority of Americans - and Democrats - are in favour of trade deals. Americans tend not to vote on foreign policy issues outside of times of war or national crisis - but as last week showed, there's no telling when such a moment could arise. The key issues for 2020 Democrats Warren may have had the standout moment, but the candidate who could end up emerging the biggest beneficiary of the evening is the one who has managed to bump and grind through the months and still seems in the best position heading into primary season. If there's a real break forming between Warren and Sanders, it is nothing but good news for the former vice-president. He can keep his head down while his fellow front-runners duke it out - and keeping his head down was exactly what he did on Tuesday night. Over the course of the evening, Biden once again showed that he's never going to be a master debater. He wasn't when he was in his prime and he seems to have lost a step in recent years. Nevertheless, the smaller debate stage has benefited him. Where he tended to get lost and tired in the lengthy double-digit candidate scrums, he has been more engaged in the past two contests. When the topic turned to impeachment, he noted that Republicans have ""savaged my surviving son"" - a subtle reference to the fact that he has buried two children and a wife, a source of sorrow that could generate public sympathy if Hunter Biden gets pulled into Trump's upcoming Senate trial. After Warren had her moment, Biden got the last word before the commercial break, noting that he has ""the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race"". That was a theme he returned to when asked whether he could go toe-to-toe with Trump in a general-election debate. ""I have support across the board,"" he said, touting his support from black and working-class voters. ""I'm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all."" Then it was time for more commercials. Once again, Biden got the last word. And his competitors missed out on yet another opportunity to ding the former vice-president before the campaign moves from places like Iowa and New Hampshire to more diverse states, where the breadth of Biden's coalition could give him the upper hand. Biden's far from a lock for the nomination, but he's keeping his ship afloat - which is more than many thought after his first few rocky debates. At the rally - Holly Honderich, BBC News, Milwaukee, Wisconsin ""What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation."" President Trump made fleeting - though biting - references to his Democratic challengers on Tuesday night, speaking at a campaign rally in Milwaukee just as his opponents took the debate stage in Iowa. Bernie Sanders is ""a nasty guy"" who is ""surging"" in the polls, Trump said to jeers and boos, as he addressed a state that voted for Sanders over Hillary Clinton by a 13-point margin in the 2016 Democratic primary. Trump resorted to well-worn insults to address the other frontrunners: ""Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren"" and ""Sleepy Joe Biden"", poking fun at the former vice-president for past gaffes. And with just these short swipes, Mr Trump said more about the Democratic field than any of his supporters were prepared to offer when asked about his political opponents. Some described the Democratic field as ""fools"", buffoons"" or ""jokes"", wasting time on impeachment. But none, they said, pose any real challenge to the president. ""No one can stand up to Trump,"" Vicky Francis said as she waited in line to attend her 10th Trump rally. ""Everything he said he would do, he has done. He's speaking the truth.""

"Girls aged between 11 and 13 are increasingly being tricked and coerced into performing sexually over their own webcams, data suggests. The Internet Watch Foundation said 80% of the sexual selfies it found in its relentless trawl for images of child sexual abuse were of children this age. The charity took action on 37,000 self-generated images of children last year. About 30,000 were of adolescents. Its chief executive said the number of cases was growing at an alarming rate. Susie Hargreaves described the distribution of such images and films, often self-made in domestic settings, as a ""national crisis"". Often children were seen looking into cameras, reading messages asking them to do something and complying. The IWF said of all web pages featuring images of child sexual abuse, a third consisted of self-generated images, mostly by girls in a domestic setting. Ms Hargreaves said: ""These are images and videos of girls that have been groomed, coerced and tricked into performing sexually over webcam in what is fast becoming a national crisis. ""There has never been a more poignant time to shine a light on the uncomfortable truth we are now faced with."" Victims were getting younger, she said, as more younger children had access to webcams from their phones in their bedrooms. ""At this age, they are incredibly vulnerable,"" Ms Hargreaves said. ""They are still developing physically and they don't have the emotional maturity to understand what is going on. ""They are being flattered, told they are beautiful. They often think they are in relationship with someone."" One victim told the BBC she was talked into sending a topless photograph online to someone who claimed to be a woman recruiting models. The victim, who was 13 at the time, said: ""After I'd sent that picture, her whole demeanour towards me changed."" She says she was forced to send more photos and to share her home address - with the threat that the first image would be printed out and posted on railings near her school if she did not comply. The victim, who is now years older, said a man then came to her house, sexually assaulted her in her bedroom and took more photos. ""I didn't realise it at the time but the perpetrator that came to the house was the same person that I'd been speaking to online,"" the victim said. ""He told me from the very start that he'd printed off and put onto disk the images that had been sent online the night before, and that if I didn't do what he said, or if I told anybody, that he would distribute those."" Ms Hargreaves urged young men who might stumble across such images of under-age children as they viewed pornography online to report it and ""save many more victims of child sexual abuse"". Reporting can be done quickly, anonymously and safelyhere,external. It is the first time detail of the types of images discovered and age groups affected have been revealed. Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chief's Council lead on child protection, said: ""Work like this, which seeks to educate people about the law and encourage them to be responsible, and especially to report any sexual images and videos of under-18s, supports the reduction of crime, the removal of indecent content and, importantly, lessens the harm to victims."" Tink Palmer, of the Marie Collins Foundation, which works with the IWF over the issue, said the amount of indecent content featuring children was growing. ""All internet users need to understand that they are breaking the law if they view this material, regardless of who has taken or uploaded it,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Footage shows missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Iran says it has arrested the person who filmed the footage showing a Ukrainian passenger plane being shot down by a missile. It is believed the person being detained will face charges related to national security. Flight PS752 was brought down after it took off from Tehran on Wednesday last week, killing all 176 people on board. Iran has said it was shot down by accident and announced the arrest of several people over the incident. President Hassan Rouhani said his country's investigation would be overseen by a ""special court"". ""This will not be a regular and usual case. The whole world will be watching this court,"" he said in a speech. Mr Rouhani also stressed that the ""tragic event"" should not be blamed on one individual. Mr Rouhani described the downing of the plane as an unforgiveable error ""It's not only the person who pulled the trigger, but also others who are responsible,"" he said. Iran faces watershed moment Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' What we know about flight PS752 Iran initially denied that the aircraft was hit by a missile, but later conceded that the passenger jet was hit by its air defence systems. When the video was shared on social media, it led analysts to say it showed the plane was hit by a missile. Iranian media reported that Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards had taken a person who posted a video last week of the missile striking the plane into custody. But an Iranian journalist based in London who initially posted the footage has insisted that his source is safe, and that the Iranian authorities have arrested the wrong person.

Earlier on Tuesday, Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said that several people had been detained over the downing of the plane. He added that about 30 people had been arrested for ""taking part in illegal gatherings"" - an apparent reference to recent anti-government protests. Separately the New York Times said security camera footage showed two missiles,externalwere fired at the plane, more than 20 seconds apart. The paper said this would explain why the plane's transponder seemed to have stopped working before the missile strike - it had been disabled by the first missile. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC on Tuesday that he was ""glad"" Iran had acknowledged making a ""terrible mistake"" in shooting down the plane. This video can not be played PM on US-Iran tensions: ""Let's dial this thing down"" ""It's good that they've apologised. The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down,"" he added. Mr Johnson said the next step for Iran was to ""repatriate in a dignified way"" the bodies of the passengers and crew of flight PS752, who included three Britons. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said on Monday that five of the countries that had citizens on board the airliner - Canada, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden and an unnamed country - would meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. He said the ""grieving nations"" would work out what steps to take individually and collectively to ""bring the perpetrators to justice and how we can repay those families who have suffered"". Canada, which lost 57 citizens, will meanwhile play a more active role than international rules require in the investigation into the shooting down of the airliner, according to Kathy Fox, the head of its Transportation Safety Board (TSB).

"Police stood guard at a climate change protest by Extinction Rebellion in Edinburgh last summer The cost of a UN climate change conference in Glasgow could be ""several hundred million pounds"", police say. Up to 90,000 people - delegates, observers, heads of state and media - are expected to attend COP26, over 12 days in November. AScottish Police Authority report,externalsays it will be the largest mobilisation of police officers in the UK. Scottish ministers say they expect the UK government to cover the ""core costs"" including emergency services funding. But a spokesperson added there was a ""lack of clarity"" from Westminster over the issue. Glasgow to host UN climate change summit Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Scotland must 'walk the talk' on climate change The UK government said discussions with the Scottish government on the conference costs were ""currently ongoing"". The authority is meeting monthly with Scottish and UK government officials to plan security and minimise disruption for residents of Glasgow. Police Scotland officers monitored climate change protests Glasgow last summer Costs associated with a Nato summit in Wales in 2014 have been used to draw up the estimated cost of this year's conference. The report says: ""Taking into consideration the planning assumptions and based on previous major summits/conferences (e.g. Nato Summit Wales 2014), the initial costings demonstrate that the event will cost potentially several hundred million pounds. ""Detailed financial planning is being developed and dialogue remains ongoing with the Cabinet Office relative to the cost recovery model that will be utilised."" Police said the safety and wellbeing of conference attendees, the wider public and any protesters would be their ""paramount"" concern. Treasury to cover Trump visit police bill The COP26 will be the largest summit the UK has held, with up to 200 world leaders expected for the final weekend of talks. It will be held at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) but other venues across the city will also host functions and meetings for heads of state and other dignitaries. Costs of policing the climate change conference in Glasgow could run to ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" The SPA report also reveals the SEC will be handed over to the UN for the duration of the conference. Known as the ""blue zone"", it will become international territory, subject to international law. ""Discussions are ongoing with senior law officers and the UN to determine how Police Scotland will record and investigate any crimes which occur in the blue zone,"" the report says. It adds that COP26 attendees will peak at 15,000 on the busiest day, but the overall figure could rise to 90,000 over the period of the conference, which runs from 9-20 November. The Scottish government said it was working with the UK government, Glasgow City Council and other partners to ensure the conference was a success. ""While the UK government has committed to cover core costs, Scottish ministers expect that all costs associated with COP26 will be borne by the UK government,"" a spokesperson said.

"Steyer, Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, Sanders and Klobuchar There have been seven official Democratic debates but this one had a real sense of urgency - in less than three weeks the candidates will face their first test. The primary season begins on 3 February with the Iowa caucuses, when the Democratic voters in this state will pick who they want to take on Donald Trump in November. As the six White House hopefuls took to the debate stage in Des Moines, the Republican US president they have in their sights was mocking them at a rally 400 miles east in Wisconsin. Here are some key moments from the debate - and the Trump rally. The body language between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the conclusion of the debate - when they spoke heatedly and did not shake hands - told its own story. Are voters biased against women candidates? The non-aggression pact between the two candidates could be over just as the voting is set to begin. The biggest news story in campaign politics over the past few days had been the growing tensions between the two most liberal candidates. This video can not be played Warren confronts Sanders after the debate - and doesn't shake hands Warren had alleged that Sanders told her in December 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidency - something Sanders denied. Asked about this during the debate, Sanders denied it again - saying he has long supported the idea of a woman president. Then Warren had her turn, and in a set-piece response she clearly spent time crafting, she hit a number of political targets almost in one breath. She started by essentially implying that Sanders was lying. She then pivoted her response into a shout-out for the electoral success that she and Amy Klobuchar, the other woman candidate on the stage, have had. They've won every election they've been in, she said to thunderous applause, while the three male politicians debating have lost 10 between them. She ended by pitching herself as the unity candidate with a broad coalition. ""The real danger we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull the party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of constituency,"" she said. ""We need to excite all parts of party, bring everyone in and give everyone a Democrat to believe in."" Given that Sanders has been criticised for being too divisive, Pete Buttigieg for not being able to draw significant minority backing, and Biden for a lack of enthusiastic support, it was a roundhouse kick at the three candidates vying with her at the top of the polls. Are voters biased against women candidates? Democrats draw battle lines in Iowa Due to the last week's Iran crisis, foreign policy for the first time opened the debate - and the candidates fell into two broad categories. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders called for US forces to be withdrawn from the Middle East. Warren said that US generals had been saying for years that the US was ""turning a corner"" in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but they could never detail exactly how and when the US could get out. ""We've turned the corner so many times we're going in circles in these regions,"" she quipped, before saying that the US had to stop asking the military to solve problems that could not be addressed militarily. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and - somewhat obliquely - Pete Buttigieg came down in support of extending scaled-down US deployments in Iraq. Biden warned that without US troops in the region, the Islamic State group might regain strength. ""They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organise the effort to take them down,"" he said. When the topic turned to trade, similar divides formed - with a twist. Sanders said he opposed the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement negotiated by the Trump administration, while Warren said she reluctantly supported it as a ""modest improvement"". There haven't been too many cracks between Warren and Sanders on policy, but this was one. The irony, of course, is that recent polls show that a majority of Americans - and Democrats - are in favour of trade deals. Americans tend not to vote on foreign policy issues outside of times of war or national crisis - but as last week showed, there's no telling when such a moment could arise. The key issues for 2020 Democrats Warren may have had the standout moment, but the candidate who could end up emerging the biggest beneficiary of the evening is the one who has managed to bump and grind through the months and still seems in the best position heading into primary season. If there's a real break forming between Warren and Sanders, it is nothing but good news for the former vice-president. He can keep his head down while his fellow front-runners duke it out - and keeping his head down was exactly what he did on Tuesday night. Over the course of the evening, Biden once again showed that he's never going to be a master debater. He wasn't when he was in his prime and he seems to have lost a step in recent years. Nevertheless, the smaller debate stage has benefited him. Where he tended to get lost and tired in the lengthy double-digit candidate scrums, he has been more engaged in the past two contests. When the topic turned to impeachment, he noted that Republicans have ""savaged my surviving son"" - a subtle reference to the fact that he has buried two children and a wife, a source of sorrow that could generate public sympathy if Hunter Biden gets pulled into Trump's upcoming Senate trial. After Warren had her moment, Biden got the last word before the commercial break, noting that he has ""the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race"". That was a theme he returned to when asked whether he could go toe-to-toe with Trump in a general-election debate. ""I have support across the board,"" he said, touting his support from black and working-class voters. ""I'm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all."" Then it was time for more commercials. Once again, Biden got the last word. And his competitors missed out on yet another opportunity to ding the former vice-president before the campaign moves from places like Iowa and New Hampshire to more diverse states, where the breadth of Biden's coalition could give him the upper hand. Biden's far from a lock for the nomination, but he's keeping his ship afloat - which is more than many thought after his first few rocky debates. At the rally - Holly Honderich, BBC News, Milwaukee, Wisconsin ""What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation."" President Trump made fleeting - though biting - references to his Democratic challengers on Tuesday night, speaking at a campaign rally in Milwaukee just as his opponents took the debate stage in Iowa. Bernie Sanders is ""a nasty guy"" who is ""surging"" in the polls, Trump said to jeers and boos, as he addressed a state that voted for Sanders over Hillary Clinton by a 13-point margin in the 2016 Democratic primary. Trump resorted to well-worn insults to address the other frontrunners: ""Elizabeth 'Pocahontas' Warren"" and ""Sleepy Joe Biden"", poking fun at the former vice-president for past gaffes. And with just these short swipes, Mr Trump said more about the Democratic field than any of his supporters were prepared to offer when asked about his political opponents. Some described the Democratic field as ""fools"", buffoons"" or ""jokes"", wasting time on impeachment. But none, they said, pose any real challenge to the president.

"This video can not be played Footage shows missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Iran says it has arrested the person who filmed the footage showing a Ukrainian passenger plane being shot down by a missile. It is believed the person being detained will face charges related to national security. Flight PS752 was brought down after it took off from Tehran on Wednesday last week, killing all 176 people on board. Iran has said it was shot down by accident and announced the arrest of several people over the incident. President Hassan Rouhani said his country's investigation would be overseen by a ""special court"". ""This will not be a regular and usual case. The whole world will be watching this court,"" he said in a speech. Mr Rouhani also stressed that the ""tragic event"" should not be blamed on one individual. Mr Rouhani described the downing of the plane as an unforgiveable error ""It's not only the person who pulled the trigger, but also others who are responsible,"" he said. Iran faces watershed moment Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' What we know about flight PS752 Iran initially denied that the aircraft was hit by a missile, but later conceded that the passenger jet was hit by its air defence systems. When the video was shared on social media, it led analysts to say it showed the plane was hit by a missile. Iranian media reported that Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards had taken a person who posted a video last week of the missile striking the plane into custody. But an Iranian journalist based in London who initially posted the footage has insisted that his source is safe, and that the Iranian authorities have arrested the wrong person.

Earlier on Tuesday, Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said that several people had been detained over the downing of the plane. He added that about 30 people had been arrested for ""taking part in illegal gatherings"" - an apparent reference to recent anti-government protests. Separately the New York Times said security camera footage showed two missiles,externalwere fired at the plane, more than 20 seconds apart. The paper said this would explain why the plane's transponder seemed to have stopped working before the missile strike - it had been disabled by the first missile. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC on Tuesday that he was ""glad"" Iran had acknowledged making a ""terrible mistake"" in shooting down the plane. This video can not be played PM on US-Iran tensions: ""Let's dial this thing down"" ""It's good that they've apologised. The most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down,"" he added. Mr Johnson said the next step for Iran was to ""repatriate in a dignified way"" the bodies of the passengers and crew of flight PS752, who included three Britons. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said on Monday that five of the countries that had citizens on board the airliner - Canada, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Sweden and an unnamed country - would meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. He said the ""grieving nations"" would work out what steps to take individually and collectively to ""bring the perpetrators to justice and how we can repay those families who have suffered"".

"Police stood guard at a climate change protest by Extinction Rebellion in Edinburgh last summer The cost of a UN climate change conference in Glasgow could be ""several hundred million pounds"", police say. Up to 90,000 people - delegates, observers, heads of state and media - are expected to attend COP26, over 12 days in November. AScottish Police Authority report,externalsays it will be the largest mobilisation of police officers in the UK. Scottish ministers say they expect the UK government to cover the ""core costs"" including emergency services funding. But a spokesperson added there was a ""lack of clarity"" from Westminster over the issue. Glasgow to host UN climate change summit Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks Scotland must 'walk the talk' on climate change The UK government said discussions with the Scottish government on the conference costs were ""currently ongoing"". The authority is meeting monthly with Scottish and UK government officials to plan security and minimise disruption for residents of Glasgow. Police Scotland officers monitored climate change protests Glasgow last summer Costs associated with a Nato summit in Wales in 2014 have been used to draw up the estimated cost of this year's conference. The report says: ""Taking into consideration the planning assumptions and based on previous major summits/conferences (e.g. Nato Summit Wales 2014), the initial costings demonstrate that the event will cost potentially several hundred million pounds. ""Detailed financial planning is being developed and dialogue remains ongoing with the Cabinet Office relative to the cost recovery model that will be utilised."" Police said the safety and wellbeing of conference attendees, the wider public and any protesters would be their ""paramount"" concern. Treasury to cover Trump visit police bill The COP26 will be the largest summit the UK has held, with up to 200 world leaders expected for the final weekend of talks. It will be held at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) but other venues across the city will also host functions and meetings for heads of state and other dignitaries. Costs of policing the climate change conference in Glasgow could run to ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" The SPA report also reveals the SEC will be handed over to the UN for the duration of the conference. Known as the ""blue zone"", it will become international territory, subject to international law. ""Discussions are ongoing with senior law officers and the UN to determine how Police Scotland will record and investigate any crimes which occur in the blue zone,"" the report says. It adds that COP26 attendees will peak at 15,000 on the busiest day, but the overall figure could rise to 90,000 over the period of the conference, which runs from 9-20 November. The Scottish government said it was working with the UK government, Glasgow City Council and other partners to ensure the conference was a success. ""While the UK government has committed to cover core costs, Scottish ministers expect that all costs associated with COP26 will be borne by the UK government,"" a spokesperson said. ""This includes funding for police, fire and ambulance services to both prepare for and deliver a safe, secure and successful event. We continue to push the UK government on the lack of clarity on this key issue.""

"Discussing pay at work can be a touchy subject. Whether it is the moment in a job interview when the topic of money is raised, or a request for an advance at the end of an expensive month, it is rarely a comfortable conversation. But for almost one in five workers, having a conversation about their salary with a colleague could be more than uncomfortable, it could get them fired, according to a study. A survey by the Trades Union Congress suggests that 18% of workers had been told that they were not allowed to discuss pay with their colleagues ""Pay secrecy clauses are a get out of jail free card for bad bosses,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""They stop workers from challenging unfair pay, allow top executives to hoard profits and encourage discrimination against women and disabled people."" âMy boss lets me set my own salaryâ Would you ask your colleagues what they earn? Half of workers asked said they did not know what senior managers in their organisation earned. And 53% said they were not given information about other people's pay. Fewer than one five said their workplace had a transparent pay policy. ""Talking about pay can feel a bit uncomfortable, but more openness about wages is essential to building fairer workplaces,"" Ms O'Grady said. Tracy Jordan, an HR professional, told the BBC she would rather not know what her colleagues are earning. She has worked in teams that all know or have access to information about how much each person is paid. ""I personally have found it's better not looking and not knowing,"" she said. ""Even if you feel you are paid a fair wage, there will always be someone that you perceive is doing a lesser job and is earning more."" ""Rather than feeling perpetually dissatisfied, I think ignorance can be bliss."" However, Joseph Bunkle, a data analyst, said that approach only benefits bosses. ""Wouldn't it feel bad knowing you're being paid less than a colleague for the same job because you felt like 'it's just not something I like to discuss'?"" Romey Watters, who works in digital marketing, thinks there is a generational divide between those who are willing to discuss their salary and those who are not. ""I think younger people tend to be more transparent with sharing details about their salaries, perhaps because things like buying a house seem more unobtainable and the retirement age is increasing,"" she told the BBC. ""I also think that companies sometimes encourage a culture of employees not disclosing what they earn as it could highlight a problem they want to avoid dealing with."" âMy boss lets me set my own salaryâ Would you ask your colleagues what they earn?

"Girls aged between 11 and 13 are increasingly being tricked and coerced into performing sexually over their own webcams, data suggests. The Internet Watch Foundation said 80% of the sexual selfies it found in its relentless trawl for images of child sexual abuse were of children this age. The charity took action on 37,000 self-generated images of children last year. About 30,000 were of adolescents. Its chief executive said the number of cases was growing at an alarming rate. Susie Hargreaves described the distribution of such images and films, often self-made in domestic settings, as a ""national crisis"". Often children were seen looking into cameras, reading messages asking them to do something and complying. The IWF said of all web pages featuring images of child sexual abuse, a third consisted of self-generated images, mostly by girls in a domestic setting. Ms Hargreaves said: ""These are images and videos of girls that have been groomed, coerced and tricked into performing sexually over webcam in what is fast becoming a national crisis. ""There has never been a more poignant time to shine a light on the uncomfortable truth we are now faced with."" Victims were getting younger, she said, as more younger children had access to webcams from their phones in their bedrooms. ""At this age, they are incredibly vulnerable,"" Ms Hargreaves said. ""They are still developing physically and they don't have the emotional maturity to understand what is going on. ""They are being flattered, told they are beautiful. They often think they are in relationship with someone."" One victim told the BBC she was talked into sending a topless photograph online to someone who claimed to be a woman recruiting models. The victim, who was 13 at the time, said: ""After I'd sent that picture, her whole demeanour towards me changed."" She says she was forced to send more photos and to share her home address - with the threat that the first image would be printed out and posted on railings near her school if she did not comply. The victim, who is now years older, said a man then came to her house, sexually assaulted her in her bedroom and took more photos. ""I didn't realise it at the time but the perpetrator that came to the house was the same person that I'd been speaking to online,"" the victim said. ""He told me from the very start that he'd printed off and put onto disk the images that had been sent online the night before, and that if I didn't do what he said, or if I told anybody, that he would distribute those."" Ms Hargreaves urged young men who might stumble across such images of under-age children as they viewed pornography online to report it and ""save many more victims of child sexual abuse"". Reporting can be done quickly, anonymously and safelyhere,external. It is the first time detail of the types of images discovered and age groups affected have been revealed. Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chief's Council lead on child protection, said: ""Work like this, which seeks to educate people about the law and encourage them to be responsible, and especially to report any sexual images and videos of under-18s, supports the reduction of crime, the removal of indecent content and, importantly, lessens the harm to victims."" Tink Palmer, of the Marie Collins Foundation, which works with the IWF over the issue, said the amount of indecent content featuring children was growing. ""All internet users need to understand that they are breaking the law if they view this material, regardless of who has taken or uploaded it,"" she said.
