"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Schools to stay closed until mid-February at least Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that transmission of the virus appeared to be declining but was still too high to ease restrictions. But she hopes schools will be able to at least begin a phased return to the classroom in the middle of next month. The level four restrictions have been in place since Boxing Day. Meanwhile the islands of Barra and Vatersay are being moved into the top level of restrictions due to a ""significant outbreak"" there. Live reaction as Scottish lockdown extended Scotland's GPs 'frustrated' with vaccine supply Islands to enter lockdown after Barra outbreak Where are the latest cases? The current restrictions, which have closed non-essential shops and seen a ""stay at home"" message put down in law, had been due to expire at the end of this month. But Scottish government ministers agreed they should be extended after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that lockdown was ""beginning to have an impact"" on the number of new infections, but said Scotland remained in a ""very precarious position"". She added: ""We need to be realistic that any improvement we are seeing is down, at this stage, to the fact that we are staying at home and reducing our interactions. ""Any relaxation of lockdown while case numbers, even though they might be declining, nevertheless remain very high, could quickly send the situation into reverse."" The vast majority of Scottish pupils have been home learning since the Christmas holiday The announcement came as 1,165 new cases of Covid-19 were registered in Scotland, representing 11.1% of tests carried out. A total of 1,989 people are in hospital with the virus while a further 71 deaths of people who recently tested positive have been logged. Ms Sturgeon said there was ""real and severe"" pressure on health services, with around 30% more patients in hospital than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020, and that this was ""almost certain to rise for a further period yet"". School buildings and nurseries have been closed to most pupils since the start of term, with all but the children of some key workers and vulnerable pupils learning from home. Not only will schools remain closed to most pupils until at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point. The first minister has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean? The groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children and those in P7 getting ready to move to high school. For others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer. Both the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 Feb. By that week, first doses of vaccine should have been offered to all over 80s in Scotland as well as frontline NHS and social care staff and care home residents. With only 15-20% of the over 80s reached so far, opposition parties think the programme is slipping behind schedule, which the first minister denies. Ms Sturgeon said she knew how ""challenging and stressful"" home schooling was for families, but said community transmission was ""too high"" to allow a safe return to classrooms. She said: ""If it is at all possible, as I very much hope it will be, to begin even a phased return to in-school learning in mid-February, we will. ""But I also have to be straight with families and say that it is simply too early to be sure about whether and to what extent this will be possible."" Statistics released on Monday showed that Scotland had vaccinated 6% of its adult population so far - the same percentage as Wales, but lower than the 8% that have been vaccinated in England and 8.7% in Northern Ireland. England has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said approximately 100,000 people were being vaccinated per week in Scotland, and that health teams were ""on track"" to expand this to 400,000 per week by the end of February. Statistics have suggested the vaccination programme in Scotland is currently lagging behind England More than 90% of care home residents have now been given a first dose, along with 70% of care home staff and 70% of all frontline health and care workers. The first minister said the focus on care homes - where it is ""time consuming and labour intensive"" to give out jabs -  was ""why overall figures are at this stage lower than in England"", where more over-80s have received the vaccine. She said the ""pace of progress in the over-80s group is also now picking up"", and that the government remained on track to hit its target of completing everyone on the priority list by early May. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the Scottish government were ""lagging behind their own targets"" on vaccination, saying the focus on care homes ""doesn't explain how slowly the vaccine is reaching GP surgeries and the public"". She read out a series of letters from elderly people who had not been contacted about getting a jab, saying they were ""anxious they don't get left behind"". Ms Sturgeon said she would not apologise for ""prioritising the most vulnerable first"", saying all four UK nations were ""working to the same targets"". Scottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie asked if Ms Sturgeon was confident the government could hit its ""critical"" targets, saying GPs were stillcomplaining about ""patchy"" distribution of vaccines. The first minister replied that her government would hit its goals, saying it was ""always the intention"" to increase the pace of vaccination as infrastructure and supplies became available. This would see care home residents, healthcare staff and all over-80s get a first dose by the start of February, with over-70s and those deemed ""extremely vulnerable"" by mid-February and all over-65s by the beginning of March.

"This video can not be played Trump gives his farewell address US President Donald Trump has made his farewell address before leaving office, saying: ""We did what we came to do - and so much more."" In a video posted on YouTube,external, he said he took on ""the tough battles, the hardest fights... because that's what you elected me to do"". Mr Trump has still not fully accepted the result of last November's election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Mr Biden will be sworn in as president on Wednesday. In his final hours in office, Mr Trump has issueddozens of pardons and commutations,externalfor peopleincluding Steve Bannon, his former advisor, who is facing fraud charges. On the eve of his inauguration, Mr Biden led a national tribute to the 400,000 Americans who have died of Covid-19. At sundown on Tuesday, 400 lights were illuminated in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC to honour those who have lost their lives to the disease. The lights are the federal government's first official tribute to those who have died in the pandemic The last two weeks of Mr Trump's term have been dominated by the fallout from the deadly riot on Capitol Hill, when a mob of his supporters stormed Congress, seeking to overturn the election result. ""Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated,"" Mr Trump said in his video, in which he did not acknowledge his successor by name. The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol The people who still believe Trump won Mr Trump himself has been impeached for ""incitement of insurrection"" over the attack and will face trial in the Senate after he leaves office. If convicted, he could be barred from standing for public office. He is the first president in US history to be impeached twice. At his first trial, he was cleared on charges relating to dealings with Ukraine by the majority from his own Republican Party. The politically motivated violence has overshadowed the growing toll from the coronavirus pandemic, in whichmore than 400,000 Americans have died and 24 million have been infected,external. In his message, Mr Trump said his administration built ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"". US stock markets have rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index up 42% in 2020, and the wider S&P 500 up 15%. However, the rest of the economy is facing more of a struggle. Employers cut jobs in December, ending a string of job gains. Retail sales have dropped in recent months, while jobless claims rise. ""Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn't about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation,"" Mr Trump said. He leaves office with an approval rating of 34%, the lowest of his presidency. Donald Trump, in his 20-minute pre-recorded farewell speech, said his administration did what it came to do and more. One can debate the significance of his accomplishments - whether 400 miles (640km) of rebuilt border wall, tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, confirmed judges, trade wars and modest Mid-East diplomatic agreements amount to much in the way of substantive achievement. But at least in one way, his boast is certainly true. Trump ran for president in 2016 to shake up the existing political order. He campaigned as an outsider giving voice to those who distrusted the establishment and felt the system no longer worked for them. ""I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that's what you elected me to do,"" he said. The unrest and resentment that Trump rode to the White House crested and crashed on the US Capitol two weeks ago, leaving behind wreckage - literal and metaphorical - that will take time and effort to clear. After four years of shattered norms and traditions, of turning expectations of presidential behaviour on their head, Trump leaves US government changed - fundamentally and, perhaps, irreversibly. That, at least, was a promise made and a promise kept. Mr Biden and his wife Jill Biden left their home state of Delaware on Tuesday to return to Washington, where the incoming president served as a senator for 36 years before becoming vice-president to Barack Obama from 2008 to 2016. ""When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,"" he said in an emotional farewell speech. This video can not be played ""When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart"" On Wednesday, he will go to the White House and then the Capitol for his inauguration at 12:00 (17:00 GMT). This will be an inauguration like no other: Washington is under heavy security after the Capitol riots, with thousands of reserve soldiers from the National Guard deployed and metal fences around the White House. Only a limited number of people will be allowed on to the National Mall to witness his swearing in - contrasting to the hundreds of thousands who usually attend. The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Among those staying away will be Mr Trump. He flies to Florida on Wednesday morning - the first president to skip his successor's inauguration since Andrew Johnson in 1869. Mr Trump had tried to organise a military send-off for himself, according to local media. But two senior officialstold Defense One,externalthat no such farewell was being planned for the commander-in-chief. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

"Theresa May has accused her successor Boris Johnson of ""abandoning"" the UK's moral leadership on the world stage. The ex-prime minister said Mr Johnson's decision to cut the overseas aid budget below 0.7% of national income had reduced the UK's global ""credibility"". She wrote in the Daily Mail,externalthe UK had to ""live up to its values"" and would be judged by its actions not its rhetoric. Mr Johnson said the UK was ""embarking on a quite phenomenal year"" of global leadership. Questioned about Mrs May's comments by the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's very important the prime minister of the UK has the best possible relationship with the president of the United States. ""That's part of the job description."" Trump leaves White House for final time May 'cannot support' government's Brexit bill Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budget He cited the UK's hosting ofa global vaccine summit, the upcoming COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, as well as theG7 summit of leading industrial nations, in Cornwall, and his pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 as examples of the UK's global leadership. Mr Blackford called on the PM to reverse ""his cruel policy of cutting international aid for the world's poorest"". This video can not be played The SNP Westminster leader called in the PM to reverse his ""cruel"" international aid policy Later on Wednesday, Joe Biden will be inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States, succeeding Donald Trump. In advance of the event, Mr Johnson  said he looked forward to working ""hand-in-hand"" with the new administration and that post-Covid challenges could only be tackled by ""international co-operation"". But, in an article in the Daily Mail, Mrs May suggested Mr Johnson had squandered international goodwill by choosing not to meet the longstanding UN target of spending 0.7% of income on international development. The government says it cannot meet the figure - enshrined in UK law - this year because of the strain placed on the public finances by the pandemic. Theresa May has made these criticisms - on overseas aid and the threat by the government to override international law - before. Quite often she gets a dig in when she stands up in the House of Commons. But packaging it all up in this way, on this day, is, in the words of one of her close former advisers, ""quite punchy"". The government would rather focus on the relationship it is going to forge with the new US president. Ministers feel they have quite a lot in common with Joe Biden when it comes to working together on the world stage, fighting climate change and co-operating on global security. Mrs May also criticised Mr Johnson's support for legislation which could have allowed the UK to go back on parts of its Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, had it been passed. Controversial clauses were ultimately removed from the Internal Market Bill in December, after the UK and EU reached an agreement. But Mr Johnson's threat to break international law was criticised in Europe and the US - where Mr Biden warned it could imperil peace in Northern Ireland. Mrs May said the UK was ""well placed to play a decisive role in shaping this more co-operative world but to lead we must live up to our values"". ""Other countries listen to what we say not simply because of who we are, but because of what we do. The world does not owe us a prominent place on its stage,"" she added. ""Whatever the rhetoric we deploy, it is our actions which count. So, we should do nothing which signals a retreat from our global commitments."" Mrs May suggested the end of the Trump presidency could be a catalyst for a change in world politics Mrs May, who had a sometimes strained relationship with Mr Trump, said Mr Biden's election presented the UK with a ""golden opportunity"" for Western democracies to reverse the trend towards ""absolutism"" - and a ""few strongmen facing off against each other"" - in global affairs. The UK holds the presidency of the G7 this year and hosts the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Mr Johnson said he looked forward to welcoming Mr Biden to the UK at least twice in 2021. ""In our fight against Covid and across climate change, defence, security, and in promoting and defending democracy, our goals are the same and our nations will work hand-in-hand to achieve them,"" he added.

"US tariffs have hit the Scotch whisky industry hard The UK and US have failed to do a much hoped for ""mini-deal"" over trade in the last days of the Trump administration. There were hopes the US would lift tariffs on imports of Scotch whisky and cashmere imposed last year as part of the Boeing-Airbus trade dispute. But those duties will now stay in place while President-elect Biden awaits confirmation of his trade team. The talks were revealed in a BBC interview with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in December. At the time he said he was hopeful that he and his UK counterpart, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, could ""get some kind of an agreement out"". But the BBC understands that a broad offer from the US was rejected last week by the UK after concerns were expressed by the Business Department about the impact on Airbus' business in the UK. Since 2019, the EU and US have both imposed tariffs on each others' goods amid a long-running trade dispute between the planemakers Boeing and Airbus. The tariffs centre on a long-running dispute between Boeing and Airbus Earlier last month the UK's Trade Department announced it would unilaterally break from the EU's position of levying tariffs on imports of Boeing aeroplanes, after the end of the Brexit transition period. It was, said Ms Truss, an attempt to create goodwill to solve the 16-year old dispute. But the UK aerospace industry was furious with what it saw as the governmentreneging on promises made in early 2020 to support Airbus in the dispute, even after Brexit. These concerns were the main block to a deal, but the chaos in Washington DC over the past week also played a part. UK lacks 'authority' to impose tariffs in plane row Scotch exports on the rocks The US was also looking for tariffs on its exports of bourbon to the UK - part of a separate trade dispute over steel - to be settled. A government source said: ""Ultimately we came close to resolving an intractable 16-year dispute, but didn't quite get there. Any deal must be balanced and work for the whole UK and all of UK industry."" They added: ""No one has fought harder on this than Liz, and she's going to continue pushing it with the Biden administration. She absolutely understands the pain of affected businesses and is determined to get these tariffs lifted and support jobs."" The source said the government had pursued a ""clear de-escalation strategy"" with the Trump administration over the dispute which meant it had avoided being hit with further US tariffs, unlike the EU. Ms Truss still hopes to settle the dispute quickly and has committed to meet Katherine Tai, the new US Trade Representative, in Washington DC as soon as she assumes office, the source added. Karen Betts, head of the Scotch Whisky Association, said her industry was ""very frustrated"" a deal was not reached. ""There is deep disappointment across the Scotch whisky industry that distillers are still paying the price for an aerospace dispute that has nothing to do with us. ""The tariff on single malt Scotch whisky, now in place for 15 months, has caused us to lose over Â£450m in exports to the US, and our losses continue to mount.""

Pence has only met once with President Trump since 6 January, when pro-Trump rioters at the US Capitol repeatedly chanted: ""Hang Mike Pence!"" As we reported earlier, he will not attend Trump's farewell ceremony tomorrow morning and will instead be present at the inauguration ceremony for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The vice president and his wife - First Lady Karen Pence - will then fly home to Indiana. It remains unclear whether he intends to run for office again. Reality Check Trump also said in his farewell video, as he has done on many occasions, that his
administration ""built the greatest economy in the history of the world"". The US
economy has certainly done well under Trump prior to the coronavirus
pandemic, but there have been periods under previous administrations when it
did significantly better. In his
first three years in office, Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%.
This was slightly higher than the final three years of the Obama era. However,
there have been many periods when the growth of GDP â the value of goods and
services in the economy â was a lot higher. In 2020 the
economy saw the largest contraction on record because of the effects of the
pandemic. It rebounded by 33% in the third quarter of the year, itself a record
for a quarterly increase, but this did not bring economic activity back to
pre-pandemic levels. Numbers for
the final quarter are yet to be published. Read more. Reality Check President Trump said in his speech that âwe achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americansâ. The African American and Hispanic American unemployment rate hit 5.2% and 4% respectively in August and 2019 - the lowest rates recorded since the US Labor Department started collecting these statistics in the 1970s. The unemployment rate has recently spiked sharply for both groups because of the huge impact of the pandemic on the US economy. And this has disproportionately affected African Americans and Hispanics - their unemployment rates are 3.2% and 2.6% higher respectively than the overall figure. Asian American unemployment is currently 5.9%. It reached a record low of 2.1% in June 2019, but these records only date back to 2003. Read more. Reality Check In his farewell video address, President Trump said: âWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.â That's not right for tax cuts in general - previous ones have been larger. It is right for corporation tax. We investigated this claim in 2018 shortly after Congress passed sweeping tax reform legislation. According to tax specialists, the cuts were big but not the biggest. The Committee for a Responsible Budget looked at the numbers and reported that President Trump's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history, compared to the overall size of the economy. If you adjust the analysis for inflation, President Trump's tax cuts rank fourth overall. However, tax experts also assessed Mr Trump's cut in corporation tax from 35% to 21%. Most said in absolute terms it was the biggest corporate tax cut in history. Read more. Reality Check In President Trumpâs farewell speech he said: âWe proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into placeâ¦ with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.â It was a one of his major pledges in the run-up to the 2016 election. As of 4 January 2021, a total of 452 miles (757km) of barrier has been built since he took office. However, the vast majority of this new wall replaced existing structures on the border. Only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there was none before. Of this 47 miles is whatâs called primary wall, and 33 miles is secondary wall that reinforces the initial barrier. President-elect Joe Biden said he would not build ""another foot"" of the wall. Read more. Donald Trump is already awaiting his second impeachment trial by the Senate once he leaves office. A sideshow to all this is that he now faces possible expulsion from the Screen Actors Guild. SAG-AFTRA, the union which represents working performers, said on Tuesday its national board found Trump had probably violated its rules over his alleged incitement of the Capitol riot. The board has requested his expulsion and the issue will now be heard by the body's disciplinary committee. ""The charges specifically cite Trumpâs role in inciting the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, and in sustaining a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are SAG-AFTRA members,"" the statement said. According to the AP news agency, the former Apprentice star has been a member of the Screen Actors Guild since 1989. He has also made cameo appearances in films and TV series including Home Alone 2. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump, in his 20-minute pre-recorded farewell speech, said his administration did what it came to do and more. One can debate the significance of his accomplishments â whether 400 miles of rebuilt border wall, tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, confirmed judges, trade wars and modest Mideast diplomatic agreements amount to much in the way of substantive achievement.

hope, of light and of glory to all the world."" Here's what else he had to say: On his final full day in office, outgoing president Donald Trump delivered a farewell speech from the White House. Currently locked out of his personal social media accounts, Trump struck a concilatory yet defiant tone in the video released via the government's official social media accounts. ""We did what we came here to do - and so much more,"" he said. ""I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices â because thatâs what you elected me to do."" He warned that ""the greatest danger"" now facing the country was ""a loss of confidence in our national greatness"". The 45th president ran through actions taken by his administration - from ""stand[ing] up to China like never before"" to ""a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East"". He added: ""I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars."" Referring to the riot at the US Capitol on 6 January, he said: ""All Americans were horrified by the assault on the Capitol... It can never be tolerated."" Trump acknowledged that a new administration would take office, but said: ""I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning."" Allow YouTube content?

The pink seesaws were placed through sections of the wall and allowed people in both countries to play together.

According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, the country has now reported 400,022 fatalities, and more than 24 million cases. This is more deaths and cases than reported by any other country in the world. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are due to lead an event in Washington later today to honour those killed by Covid-19. The president-elect has pledged to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days in office. The Democrat received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine last month, saying he was getting the jab to show Americans it is ""safe to take"". Donald Trump has been criticised by health experts for his handling of the pandemic. But the White House defended the administration, highlighting Operation Warp Speed, the programme to develop and distribute vaccines. âWe grieve every single life lost to this pandemic, and thanks to the presidentâs leadership, Operation Warp Speed has led to the development of multiple safe and effective vaccines in record time, something many said would never happen,â White House spokesman Judd Deere said, according to AP news agency.  Thousands of troops have been deployed ahead of the inauguration A dozen members of the US National Guard have been removed from security efforts to protect tomorrow's inauguration, according to US media reports. The Associated Press news agency, which initially reported the number, said that all of the members had been found to have links with right-wing groups or to have posted extremist views online. However, a Pentagon spokesman quoted by Reuters news agency said that not all were removed due to ties to extremist groups, while NBC news said that some of the guardsmen were ruled out due to ""'more routine' vetting issues"". Security in Washington DC has been bolstered since the Capitol riot on 6 January, which left five people dead. More than 25,000 members of the National Guards are expected to be involved in tomorrow's ceremony - more than three times the number present during Donald Trump's inauguration. Find out more about how security threats and Covid-19 have changed the ceremonyhere. The US has become the first country to surpass 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths. Security has been ramped up in Washington DC in preparation for an inauguration like no other. Some 25,000 National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced due to the pandemic and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Alun Davies, Paul Davies and Darren Millar have all issued apologies A group of politicians drank alcohol on Welsh Parliament premises, days after a ban on serving it in pubs took effect. Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies and Darren Millar were seen drinking together in early December. Senedd authorities said they were investigating an ""incident"" which ""may have been contrary to public health regulations"". LabourMember of the SeneddAlun Davies was also involved. He and two Tories deny breaking rules. ""A member has been suspended from the privileges of Senedd Labour Group membership while an investigation takes place into this alleged incident,"" a spokesman for the group said. A ban on the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premisescame into force in Wales at 18:00 GMT on 4 December, although hospitality businesses can sell alcohol to take away after 18:00. On 8 December, a group of Members of the Senedd and staff drank alcohol in the Ty Hywel building in Cardiff Bay that houses the Senedd's offices. Catering company, Charlton House, has the licence for serving alcohol on Senedd premises. The Welsh Government confirmed the alcohol ban applies to the person running the licensed premises, rather than customers. A ban on serving drinks in pubs and bars came in four days before the meeting Charlton House said it was ""aware of an alleged breach of public health regulations at the Senedd estate"" and took its ""responsibilities and obligations to restrictions and public health regulations across the UK very seriously"". ""We are currently undertaking a full investigation into this matter,"" the firm added. Plaid Cymru Senedd member Helen Mary Jones said Labour had ""taken the right step in terms of suspending their member while they investigate, and I think the Conservatives have got to do the same thing"". ""We've been passing legislation in the Senedd this last nine months, expecting really difficult things from our constituents, in terms of restricting their social contact, things that make people very unhappy because we have to,"" she said. ""Whether or not the letter of the regulations has been broken, in my view the spirit clearly has."" Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said it was ""important that everybody follows the rules"". ""I don't know the details of what may or may not have happened down there, I'm sure that will come out in the fullness of time,"" he toldBBC Wales Live. Senedd authorities say they are seeking to ""establish an accurate account of what took place"" A statement on behalf of Paul Davies, Darren Millar and Welsh Conservative chief of staff Paul Smith, who was also at the meeting, said they were ""profoundly sorry"". ""While we did not break the rules, we recognise that what was part of a day's work would not be seen to be following the spirit of them, especially given the tough time the country has been going through,"" the statement said. In his statement, Labour's Alun Davies said: ""I am very sorry if my actions have given the impression that I am in any way not committed to upholding the regulations which I have consistently supported throughout the last year."" He said the purpose of the meeting ""was to seek to persuade the Welsh Conservatives to support my proposal for a Welsh Hearts Bill, which the Senedd endorsed on 21 October, and to make a commitment to enact this life-saving legislation in their manifesto for May's election"". Alun Davies added: ""The Senedd Commission has already confirmed to me that I did not breach the coronavirus regulations on the consumption of either food or alcohol that were in force at that time."" A spokesman for the Senedd Commission said: ""We are aware of an incident on the Senedd estate last month which may have been contrary to public health regulations in force at the time. ""The Senedd Commission takes the public health regulations in Wales very seriously and is currently investigating the matter in order to establish an accurate account of what took place and to determine whether action may be required.""

"Suchavadee Foley said she had felt offended and demeaned by the incident A Starbucks branch in Dublin has been ordered to pay compensation to a customer of Thai heritage after an employee drew ""slanty"" eyes on her cup. Atercin Liffey Unlimited, trading as Starbucks Tallaght, has to pay Suchavadee Foley â¬12,000 (Â£10,680). The incident happened on 12 January 2020 when Ms Foley went into the outlet to buy a matcha tea latte. The Workplace Relations Commission found Ms Foley was racially harassed under the Equal Status Act. Ms Foley attempted to give a shortened version of her name at the counter as she made her order so it could be written on the cup. Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) adjudication officer Kevin Baneham said it was not disputed that a Starbucks employee drew an image of a smile and what was referred to in the hearing as ""slanty"" eyes on the cup as a way of marking it as Ms Foley's cup. He said it was ""clear that the visual depiction relates to her race"" and it was ""as offensive and as unimaginative as a 19th Century Punch cartoon"". Ms Foley told the hearing she felt offended and demeaned by the incident. She said she had been racially abused and it was not a friendly event. Ms Foley said she was Irish, and she and her parents had moved to Ireland from Thailand when she was five or six. In his judgement, Mr Baneham said that instead of Ms Foley's name being used on her cup, ""a physical descriptor was used, in this case her eyes"". ""This was not a drawing of the complainant, but a sketch of one part of her and one clearly associated with race,"" he added. Mr Baneham accepted the employee ""did not intend to humiliate her or make her feel uncomfortable"" and that ""this was a mistake on her [the employee's] part and one that she regrets"". The employee, who is from Brazil and gave evidence through an interpreter, said she had drawn a smiley face on the cup ""as she thought the complainant was glamorous"". She had been working at the branch for about a month when the incident happened and said she had been ""trained to be nice"". The employee said she no longer drew on cups, unless a child was looking for a birthday-related drawing. Making its case, the branch said CCTV footage showed the incident had been ""benign"" and the ""complainant had not been treated less favourably and others would have drawings composed of them"". It was also argued the branch had taken ""reasonably practicable"" steps to prevent employees committing prohibited conduct. A spokeswoman for Starbucks said it was ""deeply sorry"". ""We have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind at Starbucks,"" she said. ""We accept the adjudicator's conclusion that our partner did not intend to harass this customer and we have retrained the team at this store to ensure this does not take place again.""

"Joe Exotic is currently serving a 22 year jail sentence The new owners of an Oklahoma zoo featured in the hit Netflix documentary Tiger King have been ordered to surrender all tiger cubs and their mothers to the federal government. The case was filed against Jeff and Lauren Lowe, owners of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. They are accused of violating the Endangered Species Act and the Animal Welfare Act. Mr Lowe is the former business partner of Joe Exotic, star of the hit show. Exotic, real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage, is currently serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a contract killing plot and animal abuse. Does the US have a pet tiger problem? ""The Lowes have showed a shocking disregard for both the health and welfare of their animals, as well as the law,"" said the acting assistant attorney general Jonathan D Brightbill of the Justice Department's environment and natural resources division. Both Jeff and Lauren Lowe appeared in Tiger King. The court found that the pair's ""failure to provide safe conditions, proper nutrition, and timely veterinary care resulted in harm to a number of animals, including the death of two tiger cubs less than a week apart"". The court rejected claims by the Lowes that they were not ""exhibitors"" under the Animal Welfare Act as the zoo was still under construction. Joe Exotic has formally requested a pardon from US President Donald Trump, who is expected to pardon dozens of people in his final hours in office.

"A further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now above 90,000. A total of 4,266,577 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Another 33,355 positive Covid cases have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January. It is the lowest number of daily cases seen since 27 December - before the start of England's third nationwide lockdown. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""Whilst there are some early signs that show our sacrifices are working, we must continue to strictly abide by the measures in place."" She said reducing contact with others and staying at home will lead to ""a fall in the number of infections over time"". Covid antibodies in 1 in 10 people in December Health secretary self-isolating after Covid alert The figures come as new estimates from the Office for National Statistics showabout one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodiesin December - roughly double the October figure. The rising number of deaths was to be expected, sadly, after the surge in cases during December. And it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even higher than this. Today's numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays in registering deaths over the weekend tends to lead to higher figures being reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day. To put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half of that. But there are two rays of hope in the daily update. Firstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 for a third day in a row. Just two weeks ago we saw a few days above 60,000. That means in the coming weeks we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths. The number of vaccinations also continues to rise. It seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. But each increase at least takes us one step closer to getting on top of the virus. Meanwhile, NHS England said 400 military personnel were now assisting in hospitals in London and the Midlands, as wards face ""unprecedented pressure"". On Monday, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said it would be ""some time"" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals. Widower says pregnant women 'neglected in pandemic' Covid 'can affect anybody,' warn patient's family And in other developments, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has saidhe is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app .that he had been in close contact with somebody who tested positive.

Tuesday's figure brings the total number of deaths recorded during the pandemic in the UK to 91,470. These government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, butthere are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths. Another method is to count all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate. That figure has now officially reached 95,829, although that is only measured up to 8 January.

"About 16,000 vaccinations are currently being carried out a day in Scotland Opposition parties have voiced concerns about vaccine supplies after ""frustrated"" GPs said they were still waiting for deliveries. At Holyrood on Tuesday, the first minister was pressed on why the rollout was going ""so slowly"" and on whether there was a problem with distribution. Dr Andrew Buist, of BMA Scotland, told the BBC that patients were getting anxious and practices could not plan. Nicola Sturgeon said there were ongoing challenges but targets would be met. Dr Buist claimed that as of Monday, the Scottish government had taken receipt of more than 700,000 vaccines - but only used 264,991. He said: ""The work force is there and that's why it's so incredibly frustrating when the patients want the vaccine, we're very keen to give it to our patients but we just don't have the vaccine in our fridge."" This video can not be played Dr Andrew Buist told the BBC on Sunday that the delivery of the Covid vaccine to GP practices across Scotland had so far been inconsistent Dr Buist spoke also about""inconsistencies"" across the GP network, saying some practices had supplies but others had none. The government said it was listening to Dr Buist's concerns and every GP in Scotland would receive, in writing, more detail about the ""mechanism of supply, ordering and delivery, with suggested solutions"". Opposition party members questioned Ms Sturgeon about the vaccination programme after she had delivered a statement to parliament sayinglockdown would continue until ""at least"" mid-February. Scottish Conservatives MSP Ruth Davidson said anxious constituents feared being ""left behind"" and called for an explanation on why over 400,000 vaccines had ""yet to reach patients"". The first minister said the January target of delivering 100,000 vaccines per week had been ""exceeded"". She also reiterated that she had not been able to discuss supply figures because the UK government had ""thrown a hissy fit"" after plans werepublished then removed from the Scottish government website. Vaccine plan removed from government website Ms Sturgeon told the chamber: ""They don't want us to be open about supply for reasons of commercial confidentiality and while I don't necessarily agree with the reasoning behind that, we have agreed with their request. ""We vaccinate as quickly as we possibly can and that will continue to be the case as we go through the different groups in our vaccination programme."" Ms Sturgeon said the following targets would be met: Start of February: Vaccine offered to all over 80s, care home residents, care home staff, frontline health and care workers Mid February: All over 70s and those clinically extremely vulnerable Start of March: All over 65s Early May: All on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority list, including over 50s and younger people with underlying health conditions Nicola Sturgeon was questioned about vaccine supply after her statement to parliament about the lockdown Interim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie also asked when the 400,000 remaining vaccines would be distributed to GPs, reiterating that supply had been ""patchy"". Ms Sturgeon replied that as per earlier JCVI advice, the Scottish government had been holding back 50% of doses in order to complete the second round of vaccinations within three weeks. The UK's vaccination strategy changed in recent weeks,leaving a 12-week gapbetween doses. Ms Sturgeon added: ""They are now flowing through the system now advice has changed."" Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he had heard from GPs in his own constituency of Fife who had been forced to cancel vaccine appointments because they had run out of injections. He pressed the first minister on whether there was a problem with Scotland's distribution system. All governments have ""big challenges"" in terms of vaccine allocation because of supply flow, responded Ms Sturgeon. She added: ""I don't underestimate ongoing challenges but I don't think it would be right to say the programme is not progressing well."" On Monday Ms Sturgeon said vaccinating over-80s in the community was now picking up pace, with the target being to have them all given the first dose by 5 February. However, Dr Buist questioned whether Scotland would receive enough supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine to meet the target of offering vaccines to all over 70s and 80s by the middle of February. Instead, he proposed that GPs should be allowed to use the Pfizer vaccine - which has to be stored in industrial freezers and has limits on the number of times it can be transported. Has Scotland been slower to vaccinate over-80s? 'Patchy supply' hampering vaccine rollout He said: ""Once it's defrosted it can be used over five days. They do come in boxes of 975 doses and I am also aware that GPs in NHS Highland have already been using it. ""It is quite possible to use Pfizer in practice. Of course we absolutely want to minimise any wastage but with good planning we can do that."" National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC there was no ""medical or clinical"" reason GPs could not use the Pfizer jab, but it would be ""much harder logistically"". ""The potential would be that we would waste a lot - because they don't have industrial freezers with which to store it,"" he said. ""Once it is defrosted you have to use it fast. And you can't transport it long distances - you can only transport it two six hours journeys. We don't want to send them 195 vials and they use four."" A Scottish government spokesman said the country's chief pharmaceutical officer had contacted Dr Buist to discuss with him the ongoing concerns. In addition all GPs would be receiving a letter explaining in more detail ""the mechanism of supply, ordering and delivery, with suggested solutions at local board level that can also assist them"". The spokesman added: ""GPs have a significant role to play in delivering the vaccine - and we thank them for their hard work. ""We are in regular contact with boards to ensure GPs have the most up to date information on when supply is available and what our expectations are for them, providing as much detail as we can while rightly allowing our teams to focus on the task of delivering the biggest vaccination programme ever seen in Scotland. ""We too want to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible and are continually working hard to see if distribution can be made faster in any respect.""

"An Instagram post said the alleged baby shower was a ""lovely surprise"" A rail company has begun an internal investigation after staff allegedly held a surprise baby shower in a closed Patisserie Valerie bakery at London's Marylebone station during lockdown. Chiltern Railways workers told BBC News up to 20 colleagues, including some who were on shift, attended the gathering. They claim some party-goers then had positive Covid tests, forcing most of the team to self-isolate. Chiltern said ""appropriate action"" would be taken after its investigation. Members of Chiltern Railways customer services staff based at the station told BBC News that about 30 people had been invited to the baby shower on the afternoon of 23 November - both via WhatsApp before the alleged gathering, and face to face on the day of the event. A national coronavirus lockdown was in place in England in November, so people were banned from meeting anyone indoors who was not part of their household. Fines 'increasingly likely' for rule-breakers Transport workers call for better protection What are the lockdown rules? One worker, David [not his real name], said he declined an invitation to the event but walked past the bakery later in his shift to see about 20 colleagues gathered inside. He said he was ""shocked and alarmed"" to see people hugging each other, with most of them not wearing masks. Photos of the alleged gathering, seen by the BBC, show a table inside a Patisserie Valerie outlet covered with dozens of cupcakes, mince pies, crisps and sandwiches, bunting saying ""it's a boy!"" and handmade flags reading ""happy baby shower"". One photo appears to show a group of eight colleagues posing in front of the table of party food, without socially distancing from one another. Some images were shared on Instagram on 23 November with the caption: ""What a lovely surprise being thrown a baby shower at work today!"" A Patisserie Valerie spokesman said the company had not been informed of any such event and that none of its team members had access to the Marylebone station cafe, which has remained closed since March due to Covid restrictions. He added it was normal for a member of station staff to have keys to the premises for ""security reasons"". David and another colleague claimed three people who allegedly attended the event tested positive over the following four days. The positive tests meant 16 members of staff out of the team of about 26 people had to self-isolate for 14 days, David said. He said colleagues who lived with, or cared for, vulnerable people were ""petrified"" to hear there had been a staff outbreak, with some ""scared to go home"" for fear of endangering loved ones. David added that he had been caring for his elderly grandmother so self-isolation was ""a real nightmare"" as he had to arrange alternative care for her. Chiltern Railways confirmed a ""small number"" of workers tested positive for Covid or had to self-isolate in the 14-day period after 23 November, but a spokeswoman said ""none of the staff who were alleged to have attended [the baby shower] tested positive"". She said Chiltern Railways was investigating and was ""making every effort"" to maintain a Covid-secure environment for staff and customers. Chiltern Railways staff members congratulated their colleague using information boards at the station In an email seen by the BBC, which was sent to Chiltern Railways employees on 24 November, a manager said one team member had tested positive and added: ""It is disappointing that social distancing measures do not appear to have been followed and I will be investigating this further."" David's colleague Peter (not his real name) said he was one of about 10 team members who had to work while the rest of the team was self-isolating. Peter said the outbreak left those at work feeling ""stretched"" and ""raised the anxiety levels of everyone"" as they worried they might have caught Covid as a result of having worked alongside the alleged party's attendees. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? ""A lot of us don't want to be at work during this time, for obvious reasons. We're doing a job where we do come into contact with a lot of people - it's stressful enough with your own family, who are a bit worried about you going in to work at a train station and asking if you're getting the proper protection,"" Peter said. He added he felt ""demoralised"" to hear about the alleged party when he spends his shifts encouraging customers to wear masks and socially distance. The Department for Transport said it had been made aware of the incident and had contacted Chiltern Railways for a ""full explanation"". A spokesman for the Office of Rail and Road - which protects the interests of rail and road users - said it had investigated ""an issue relating to Covid-19 concerns"" and had taken action, jointly with Westminster City Council, to ""ensure Chiltern Railways tightens its risk assessment for workers and to revise working arrangements"".

"The publication of a letter from the Duchess of Sussex to her father was a ""triple-barrelled invasion"" of her privacy, the High Court has been told. Meghan is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online over articles that reproduced parts of the private handwritten letter. She claims her privacy and copyright were breached by the newspaper group. Her lawyers are asking for summary judgement - a dismissal of Associated Newspapers' defence instead of a trial. Meghan's lawyers argue Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) has ""no prospect"" of defending the privacy and copyright claims being brought against them. They claim the publication of extracts from the private, handwritten letter to Thomas Markle was ""self-evidently... highly intrusive"". Meghan, 39, sent the letter to her father in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie. The five articles, published in February 2019, were a ""triple-barrelled invasion"" of the duchess's privacy, correspondence and family, the lawyers claim. Mr Markle said in a witness statement provided to the remote hearing, which started on Tuesday, that he wanted the letter published to ""set the record straight"" about his relationship with his daughter - but one of Meghan's lawyers described this claim as ""ridiculous"". Meghan is seeking damages from the newspaper group for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over the articles. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now live in the US with their son Her lawyers told the court the letter was written in sorrow rather than anger and was an attempt to get her father to stop talking to the press. But the newspaper group said in its response to the court that Meghan had written the letter ""with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point"" in order to ""defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter"". In written submissions, the newspaper group's barrister Antony White said ""she must, at the very least, have appreciated that her father might choose to disclose it"" and pointed out that the Kensington Palace communications team had been shown the letter before it was sent. ""No truly private letter from daughter to father would require any input from the Kensington Palace communications team,"" said Mr White. But Meghan's lawyers also pointed out the articles themselves had emphasised the private nature of the correspondence - and dismissed any argument that it was in the public interest for the newspaper to reproduce the letter, saying the public interest was at the ""very end of the bottom end of the scale"". Justin Rushbrooke, representing the duchess, described the handwritten letter as ""a heartfelt plea from an anguished daughter to her father"". He said the ""contents and character of the letter were intrinsically private, personal and sensitive in nature"" and that Meghan ""had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the contents of the letter"". The effect of publishing the letter was ""self-evidently likely to be devastating for the claimant"", said Mr Rushbrooke. The barrister argued that, even if ANL was justified in publishing parts of the letter, ""on any view the defendant published far more by way of extracts from the letter than could have been justified in the public interest"". Mr White said that the newspaper group would argue that Meghan's status as a member of the royal family was relevant to the case. In response to that point, Mr Rushbrooke said: ""Yes, she is in some senses a public figure, but that does not reduce her expectation of privacy in relation to information of this kind."" In Thomas Markle's evidence, he said the letter ""signalled the end"" of his relationship with his daughter, and instead of a reconciliation attempt, the letter was a ""criticism"" of him. He said that he had to ""defend himself"" against an article in People magazine. It carried an interview with a ""long-time friend"" of his daughter, who suggested Meghan sent the letter to repair her relationship with her father - something he claimed was false. The People article, he claimed, made him appear ""dishonest, exploitative, publicity-seeking, uncaring and cold-hearted"". He said he had ""never intended to talk publicly about Meg's letter"" until he read the People magazine piece which, he claimed, suggested he was ""to blame for the end of the relationship"". The full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court this month, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021. This interim remote hearing - to consider the request for summary judgement - is due to last two days. Mr Justice Warby, who is hearing the case, is expected to reserve his judgement to a later date.

"US tariffs have hit the Scotch whisky industry hard The UK and US have failed to do a much hoped for ""mini-deal"" over trade in the last days of the Trump administration. There were hopes the US would lift tariffs on imports of Scotch whisky and cashmere imposed last year as part of the Boeing-Airbus trade dispute. But those duties will now stay in place while President-elect Biden awaits confirmation of his trade team. The talks were revealed in a BBC interview with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in December. At the time he said he was hopeful that he and his UK counterpart, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, could ""get some kind of an agreement out"". But the BBC understands that a broad offer from the US was rejected last week by the UK after concerns were expressed by the Business Department about the impact on Airbus' business in the UK. Since 2019, the EU and US have both imposed tariffs on each others' goods amid a long-running trade dispute between the planemakers Boeing and Airbus. The tariffs centre on a long-running dispute between Boeing and Airbus Earlier last month the UK's Trade Department announced it would unilaterally break from the EU's position of levying tariffs on imports of Boeing aeroplanes, after the end of the Brexit transition period. It was, said Ms Truss, an attempt to create goodwill to solve the 16-year old dispute. But the UK aerospace industry was furious with what it saw as the governmentreneging on promises made in early 2020 to support Airbus in the dispute, even after Brexit. These concerns were the main block to a deal, but the chaos in Washington DC over the past week also played a part. UK lacks 'authority' to impose tariffs in plane row Scotch exports on the rocks The US was also looking for tariffs on its exports of bourbon to the UK - part of a separate trade dispute over steel - to be settled. A government source said: ""Ultimately we came close to resolving an intractable 16-year dispute, but didn't quite get there. Any deal must be balanced and work for the whole UK and all of UK industry."" They added: ""No one has fought harder on this than Liz, and she's going to continue pushing it with the Biden administration. She absolutely understands the pain of affected businesses and is determined to get these tariffs lifted and support jobs."" The source said the government had pursued a ""clear de-escalation strategy"" with the Trump administration over the dispute which meant it had avoided being hit with further US tariffs, unlike the EU. Ms Truss still hopes to settle the dispute quickly and has committed to meet Katherine Tai, the new US Trade Representative, in Washington DC as soon as she assumes office, the source added. Karen Betts, head of the Scotch Whisky Association, said her industry was ""very frustrated"" a deal was not reached. ""There is deep disappointment across the Scotch whisky industry that distillers are still paying the price for an aerospace dispute that has nothing to do with us. ""The tariff on single malt Scotch whisky, now in place for 15 months, has caused us to lose over Â£450m in exports to the US, and our losses continue to mount.""

"New legislation has been passed to protect Scottish shop workers from abuse from customers. The Protection of Workers Bill will make it a new specific offence to assault, abuse or threaten staff. Incidents involving an age-restricted product, such as alcohol or cigarettes, could be treated more seriously. The MSP behind the bill, Labour's Daniel Johnson, said attacks on retail workers had increased during the Covid pandemic. Abused shop workers given bodycams Shop staff 'attacked with axes, needles, machetes' Retailers call for action on shop violence He told Holyrood: ""Shop staff have been spat at for asking customers to socially distance, and stock has been smashed in retaliation for item limits being imposed. ""Violence, threats and abuse should not be just part of anyone's job."" Mr Johnson said that staff requesting age ID could be a ""trigger factor"" in many incidents of abuse. The new legislation will also cover people working in bars, restaurants and hotels, and those delivering items bought online who may have to ask for proof of age. The bill was supported by all parties at Holyrood, despite the government initially arguing that its provisions were already covered by existing criminal laws. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Servicetold MSPs,externalthat further legislation was not needed, noting that ""violence, threats and abuse against retail workers, or indeed any other person, are prosecuted every day in the courts in Scotland using offences which are commonly understood"". Police Scotland meanwhile said there would be ""no significant change in how we go about our business"" as a result of it. Community safety minister Ash Denham said that while there was a ""wide range of existing criminal laws"" currently in place to protect staff, the new legislation could ""make the general public think more about their behaviour when they interact with retail workers"". The Scottish Conservatives also backed the bill, although they argued that thepresumption against short sentencesin Scotland meant anyone convicted under the new law would ultimately not be jailed. Paul Gerrard, public affairs director for the Co-Op, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethat the retailer had seen a 450% rise in violent incidents in the last few years. ""It is a huge problem,"" he said. ""We've seen an explosion in violence and abuse toward my colleagues. ""Now across 350 stores in Scotland we have someone attacked every day. And 10 colleagues are threatened or abused every day. ""Increasingly we have seen knives, syringes and axes all used against shopworkers."" Shop workers should be trained to help abuse victims Bid to get more protection for shop staff Mr Gerrard added that previous incidents were centred on shoplifting or age-restricted sales, but staff were now facing more abuse around enforcing Covid shopping rules. The new legislation was passed by 118 votes to 0 in the Scottish Parliament. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) is now urging the UK government to introduce similar legislation to protect retail staff in England - something Labour MP Alex Norris is pursuing at Westminster. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said: ""It is a great result for our members in Scotland, who will now have the protection of the law that they deserve. ""So we are looking for MPs to support key workers across the retail sector and help turn around the UK government's opposition.""

"China says its facilities for Uighurs are for vocational education China has committed genocide in its repression of the Uighurs and other mainly Muslim peoples, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. President-elect Joe Biden's choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said he agrees with the finding. Rights groups believe that China detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". BBC investigations suggest that Uighurs are being used as forced labour. Tensions with China have been a defining feature of Donald Trump's term, from trade policies to the coronavirus pandemic. Who are the Uighurs? Chinaâs âtaintedâ cotton Uighur model sends rare video from Chinese detention ""I believe this genocide is ongoing,external, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese party-state,"" Mr Pompeo said in a statement on Monday, his last day in office as part of Donald Trump's administration. China reacted angrily, dismissing the statement as ""outrageous lies"". ""We see this so-called determination as a piece of waste paper,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. ""We hope the new US administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment of Xinjiang issues."" While the Pompeo statement puts pressure on China, it does not automatically introduce any fresh penalties. Mr Blinken was asked at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday if he agreed with Mr Pompeo's announcement, to which he answered: ""That would be my judgment as well."" He added: ""On the Uighurs I think we're very much in agreement. And the forcing of men, women and children into concentration camps, trying to, in effect, re-educate them to be adherents to the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide."" Mr Biden's team made a similar argument last August, saying the Uighurs had suffered ""unspeakable oppression... at the hands of China's authoritarian government"". This video can not be played The video Uighur model Merdan Ghappar filmed inside China's detention system last year Analysis by the BBC Chinese service On its very last day, the Trump administration has delivered its final ""gift"" to China, in the form of a parting shot. This is by far the strongest condemnation by any country regarding China's actions in its north-western region of Xinjiang. The EU, the UK and Australia, which have repeatedly criticised the human rights situation in Xinjiang, may consider following suit. It could lead to unprecedented international pressure facing China, but would that change Beijing's behaviour? Today's Beijing is emboldened by the consolidation of political power, positive economic growth amid a pandemic, and to some degree, political chaos in Washington. A Chinese state media representative quickly hit back that the US has ""committed genocide"" of Americans with its botched handling of the pandemic. For many countries including the US, economic ties with China have become too substantial to be entirely cut off. Between human rights and economic interests, the balancing act towards China is getting increasingly difficult. Although the Biden team had referred to the suppression against Uighurs as ""genocide"", Xinjiang may not have been one of its priority issues. But the new administration will now be compelled to announce a concrete policy position on Xinjiang. It's clear that the tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington will not finish with Mr Trump's term in the White House. China says it is fighting ""three evil forces"" of separatism, terrorism, and extremism in the far western region of Xinjiang, where most of the 11 million Uighurs live. It says its ""training measures"" in Xinjiang are necessary to combat these. Xinjiang has seen a large influx of settlers from China's ethnic Han majority. Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in the territory from the 1990s, flaring into violence on occasion, but in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent. Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. The Chinese government says the measures are necessary to combat separatist violence in the region, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uighurs. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate the Uighur culture, by forcing Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. Last week, Mr Trump's administration banned the import of cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region of China, where the majority of Uighurs live. Xinjiang accounts for nearly a fifth of world cotton production,external, the US estimates. China has been widely accused of using detention camps in Xinjiang for forced labour, particularly in the cotton industry. An investigation by the BBC in 2019 suggested thatchildren in Xinjiang were being systematically separated from their familiesin an effort to isolate them from their Muslim communities. Recent research saysChina has forced Uighur women to be sterilisedor fitted with contraceptive devices in an apparent attempt to limit the size of the Uighur population. China denies this and has accused the media of ""cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues"". Who are the Uyghurs?

But he promised there would be no dilution of workers' rights. Measures under consideration include relaxing the working time directive which enshrines a 48-hour week. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned the government wanted to take a ""wrecking ball"" to hard-won rights. Earlier this week Mr Kwarteng said he wanted to ""protect and enhance"" labour law after the Financial Times reported that some rules could be weakened. The minister later told business leaders the UK had an opportunity to reform regulation derived from EU law, but would not deliberately antagonise the EU - its biggest trading partner - immediately after the Brexit deal. UK not going to do anything to make EU 'go crazy' Minister denies plan to scrap some workers' rights Confirming the review on Tuesday, Mr Kwarteng told MPs there would be no ""bonfire of rights"". ""I think the view was that we wanted to look at the whole range of issues relating to our EU membership and examine what we wanted to keep, if you like,"" he said. But he said ""the idea that we are trying to whittle down standards, that's not at all plausible or true"". Appearing before MPs, the business secretary said: ""I'm very struck as I look at EU economies how many EU countries - I think it's about 17 or 18 - have essentially opted out of the working time directive. ""So even by just following that we are way above the average European standard and I want to maintain that. I think we can be a high-wage, high-employment economy, a very successful economy, and that's what we should be aiming for."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Miliband said that after denying the FT's report, Mr Kwarteng had now ""let the cat out of the bag"" in admitting the government was conducting a review. He warned that opting out of the 48-hour week would harm workers in key sectors like the NHS, road haulage and airlines from working excessive hours. ""A government committed to maintaining existing protections would not be reviewing whether they should be unpicked. This exposes that the government's priorities for Britain are totally wrong."" Drew Hendry, the SNP's business spokesman, echoed the criticism, accusing the government of planning an ""assault"" on workers' rights. Meanwhile the boss of the UK's biggest recruitment firm, Reed, told the BBC's Today programme that there was ""no wish"" among employers to see ""a so-called bonfire of workers' rights. ""They must be protected because fair treatment is the bedrock of good workplace relations,"" James Reed said. The chairman of the firm said the government should instead focus on lower-paid workers and measures that could be taken to improve unemployment, which is set to rise further into mid-2021. ""I would suggest two things are looked at before any EU rules: The apprenticeship levy, which is clearly failing... and also National Insurance on jobs. It's a tax on jobs - how can that be improved? Especially to help the low-paid back into work."" Under the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, the UK has agreed to conditions that maintain fair competition, or a level playing field, between the two sides. However, the EU's ambassador to the UK, Joao Vale de Almeida, said Brussels could retaliate if Boris Johnson's government went too far in with deregulation. ""It will be for us to judge the extent to which it violates this principle of 'level playing field' and if that is the case there are mechanisms in the treaty, in the agreement, that allow us to discuss and eventually to come to an understanding,"" he said on Tuesday. ""If no understanding there are retaliation measures that can be applied on both sides.""

"Protests against China's alleged abuse of the Muslim Uighur community The government has narrowly seen off a rebellion by 33 Tory MPs, who want to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to be committing genocide. MPs voted by 319 to 308 to remove an amendment to the Trade Bill which would have forced ministers to withdraw from deals with nations the UK High Court ruled guilty of mass killings. It comes amid condemnation of China's treatment of the Uighur people. The rebels believe they have enough support to secure another vote soon. Among those to defy the government were ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, former cabinet ministers David Davis and Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. The rebellion is one of the largest on an issue not related to the Covid-19 pandemic during Boris Johnson's time as prime minister. The government has a Commons majority of 80 but this was whittled down to just 11 as prominent ex-ministers such as Tobias Ellwood, Caroline Nokes and Nusrat Ghani, as well as a number of MPs first elected last year, sided with the opposition. MPs have been debating proposals, tabled by cross-bench peer Lord Alton, to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide, a decision currently left to the jurisdiction of international courts. Rebel MPs pressure government over genocide clause Who are the Uighurs? UK accuses China of 'gross' abuses against Uighurs The proposals, also backed by Labour, would mean that ministers would have to revoke post-Brexit trade deals with countries that were ruled to be carrying out systematic mass killings. The issue is expected to resurface when the Trade Bill returns to the House of Lords. Earlier on Tuesday, Conservative rebels, led by former leader Iain Duncan Smith, were unable to force a vote on a separate amendment they had proposed. Every speaker in today's debate - from the front and back benches - said genocide was abhorrent. The worst of crimes. There was united criticism of China's brutal treatment of the Uighurs too. But the question Parliament has been wrestling with is whether the High Court should have the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. And if they did judge a country has been carrying out mass killings, should the High Court be able to compel the government to revoke any trade treaty it has with that country? Ministers insist it should be the job of elected governments, not judges, to determine trade policy. But opposition parties and a large cohort of Tory backbenchers argue it's essential the High Court can rule on genocide and ensure the UK's new trade-making freedom has an obligation to uphold human rights too. This also is an argument about where power lies after Brexit and what role Parliament should have in shaping trade policy after decades in the EU. But BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said that by securing large, but not overwhelming, support for Lord Alton's amendment in the Commons, the rebels hope the government will accept Mr Duncan Smith's own amendment - which would give the Commons the right to debate whether trade deals can be halted if genocide is proven. The debate came as the US government formally declaredthat China was committing genocide in its repression of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang. The UK government has been critical of China's treatment of the Uighurs and last week announced measures to cut UK business links with forced labour camps in the region. But some MPs suspect the government is pulling its punches to avoid antagonising Beijing. Mr Duncan Smith said the debate was ""all about simply shining a light of hope to all those out there who have failed to get their day in court and failed to be treated properly"". ""If this country doesn't stand up for that then I want to know what would it ever stand up for again?,"" he added. But Trade Minister Greg Hands said it was unprecedented and unacceptable to give the courts powers to revoke trade deals agreed by elected governments. And he argued that no one would benefit from the proposal because the UK currently had no free trade deal with China.

"China says its facilities for Uighurs are for vocational education China has committed genocide in its repression of the Uighurs and other mainly Muslim peoples, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. President-elect Joe Biden's choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said he agrees with the finding. Rights groups believe that China detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". BBC investigations suggest that Uighurs are being used as forced labour. Tensions with China have been a defining feature of Donald Trump's term, from trade policies to the coronavirus pandemic. Who are the Uighurs? Chinaâs âtaintedâ cotton Uighur model sends rare video from Chinese detention ""I believe this genocide is ongoing,external, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese party-state,"" Mr Pompeo said in a statement on Monday, his last day in office as part of Donald Trump's administration. China reacted angrily, dismissing the statement as ""outrageous lies"". ""We see this so-called determination as a piece of waste paper,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. ""We hope the new US administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment of Xinjiang issues."" While the Pompeo statement puts pressure on China, it does not automatically introduce any fresh penalties. Mr Blinken was asked at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday if he agreed with Mr Pompeo's announcement, to which he answered: ""That would be my judgment as well."" He added: ""On the Uighurs I think we're very much in agreement. And the forcing of men, women and children into concentration camps, trying to, in effect, re-educate them to be adherents to the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide."" Mr Biden's team made a similar argument last August, saying the Uighurs had suffered ""unspeakable oppression... at the hands of China's authoritarian government"". This video can not be played The video Uighur model Merdan Ghappar filmed inside China's detention system last year Analysis by the BBC Chinese service On its very last day, the Trump administration has delivered its final ""gift"" to China, in the form of a parting shot. This is by far the strongest condemnation by any country regarding China's actions in its north-western region of Xinjiang. The EU, the UK and Australia, which have repeatedly criticised the human rights situation in Xinjiang, may consider following suit. It could lead to unprecedented international pressure facing China, but would that change Beijing's behaviour? Today's Beijing is emboldened by the consolidation of political power, positive economic growth amid a pandemic, and to some degree, political chaos in Washington. A Chinese state media representative quickly hit back that the US has ""committed genocide"" of Americans with its botched handling of the pandemic. For many countries including the US, economic ties with China have become too substantial to be entirely cut off. Between human rights and economic interests, the balancing act towards China is getting increasingly difficult. Although the Biden team had referred to the suppression against Uighurs as ""genocide"", Xinjiang may not have been one of its priority issues. But the new administration will now be compelled to announce a concrete policy position on Xinjiang. It's clear that the tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington will not finish with Mr Trump's term in the White House. China says it is fighting ""three evil forces"" of separatism, terrorism, and extremism in the far western region of Xinjiang, where most of the 11 million Uighurs live. It says its ""training measures"" in Xinjiang are necessary to combat these. Xinjiang has seen a large influx of settlers from China's ethnic Han majority. Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in the territory from the 1990s, flaring into violence on occasion, but in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent. Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. The Chinese government says the measures are necessary to combat separatist violence in the region, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uighurs. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate the Uighur culture, by forcing Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol. Last week, Mr Trump's administration banned the import of cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region of China, where the majority of Uighurs live. Xinjiang accounts for nearly a fifth of world cotton production,external, the US estimates. China has been widely accused of using detention camps in Xinjiang for forced labour, particularly in the cotton industry. An investigation by the BBC in 2019 suggested thatchildren in Xinjiang were being systematically separated from their familiesin an effort to isolate them from their Muslim communities. Recent research saysChina has forced Uighur women to be sterilisedor fitted with contraceptive devices in an apparent attempt to limit the size of the Uighur population. China denies this and has accused the media of ""cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues"". Who are the Uyghurs?

"Britain's climate change leadership is being undercut by a government decision to allow a new coal mine in Cumbria, MPs have warned. The UK is hosting a UN climate summit in November, where it will urge other nations to phase out fossil fuels. The MPs say the government's decision to allow a new colliery at home will make it harder to secure a deal. The Woodhouse mine was approved by Cumbria County Council because it will create jobs in an area of high unemployment. The planning minister Robert Jenrick could have overruled it, but said the issue was best decided at a local level. That verdict was derided by environmentalists, who pointed out that climate change from fossil fuel burning is a global problem. Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change Green body gives verdict on UK's climate policies Africa's green transition 'unlikely' this decade Alok Sharma, who is leading theCOP26climate summit and who co-ordinates UK policies on climate change, was asked by the Commons business select committee whether the mine approval was ""an embarrassment"". He replied: ""I take your point"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the committee there was a ""slight tension"" between approving the mine, near Whitehaven, and broader attempts to clean up the economy. But he said ministers decided to allow the pit because it will produce coking coal for steel-making, which otherwise would have to be imported. He said: ""There's a slight tension between the decision to open this mine and our avowed intention to take coal off the gridâ¦ there was a debate in the government about what we could do about this, but this was a local planning decision. ""If we don't have sources of coking coal in the UK we would be importing those anyway"". This appears to run counter to advice from the Climate Change Committee which has said all coal - including coking coal - should be phased out by 2035. Doubts have been raised about investors in the mine being left with a ""stranded asset"" if the pit is forced to close on climate grounds. The mine approval is even more poignant because the UK founded the 'Powering Past Coal Alliance"" - a global club to persuade nations to leave coal in the ground. A source close to the Alliance secretariat told BBC News that staff were enraged by the decision. They believed the decision had been made to help secure so-called ""Red Wall"" votes in areas which previously voted Labour . Mohamed Adow, from a pressure group, Powershift Africa, told BBC News: ""It is quite bizarre that the UK government, in the year it hosts the biggest global climate talks since the signing of the Paris Agreement, has approved a new coal mine."" The young campaigner Greta Thunberg said the decision showed pledges to achieve net zero emissions targets by 2050 ""basically mean nothing"". Darren Jones, chair of the business committee, told BBC News it would be hard for the UK to persuade countries like Poland to abandon coal whilst building a mine. He argued that the government should have found another way to bring jobs to Cumbria. He said: ""Carbon-intensive industries are looking to the government for leadership on the transition to a green future. ""Backing coal at home doesn't look in line with the recent Energy White Paper and certainly makes our efforts to secure international agreement on ambitious decarbonisation harder to achieve."" The Environmental Audit Committee Chairman, Philip Dunne, told BBC News: ""If the UK is to achieve its ambition to be an environmental world leader, the government must offer clear guidance on how we can take every industry to net-zero, and offer a pipeline of investable projects. ""The steel sector needs to develop alternatives to importing coking coal. This could also support the next generation of green jobs - which are urgently needed."" The cross-bench peer Baroness Worthington told BBC News: ""This decision is real laziness of thinking from the government. Just think of signal it sends to all those countries who want to cling on to coal. ""The government doesn't yet have a cohesive strategy that makes sense. It's crazy. Absolute madness.""

Kirby and Victoria Bisset. France has reported 23,608 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, according to health ministry data. The figure is up from 3,736 on Monday and from 19,752 last Tuesday. A further 656 Covid deaths in hospitals were also recorded - up from 403 on Monday. The number of people in intensive care rose by 26 to 2,839, while the total number of patients hospitalised for the disease was down 52 over 24 hours at 25,567. As Brazil started rolling out vaccinations, some Rio de Janeiro residents were able to receive their first injection at one of the world's most famous landmarks. Medical staff administered the jabs at the foot of the Christ the Redeemer statue on Monday eveningafter regulator Anvisa gave the green light to vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac. Brazil has the world's second-highest death toll from Covid-19 and infections are rising again across the country. Over 8.5 million cases have been recorded and more than 210,000 people have died since the pandemic began. Military personnel have already helped at vaccination and testing centres Four-hundred military personnel are now working alongside doctors and nurses in hospitals across London and the Midlands, NHS England has said. They are a mix of combat medical technicians and soldiers performing general duties, including helping on wards, operating as family liaisons between clinical teams and patients' relatives, as well as taking on estates and porter duties. It comes as hospitals across the UK struggle to cope with the number of patients coming in, with 10 hospital trustsacross England reportingthey had no spare adult critical care beds. You canread more hereabout military personnel being drafted in to help hospitals in Shropshire. They will fill in for healthcare assistants at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, who are either sick, shielding or self-isolating. As we mentioned earlier, the total number of vaccinations given in the UK has reached 4,266,577, up to and including 18 January. This means the UK currently has a seven-day average of 262,133 doses. A higher rate of 383,337 doses per day is needed to reach the target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people by mid-February. So far, south-west England has the highest percentage of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine - 7.6%. London has the lowest percentage when compared to the UK's nations and regions - 4.3% of the city's population has received a first jab. Wales could receive a larger share of coronavirus vaccines in future because of its older population, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He told the Welsh Parliament that ""actions are being taken"" by the UK Government to make sure Wales' higher median age is taken into account. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Wales has the highest proportion of older people in the UK, ranking highest with the number of over-65s and over-85s. Drakeford said the Welsh Government was focused on ""making the fastest and most efficient use of every drop of vaccine that comes here in Wales"", and they were ""on track"" to vaccinate the four priority groups by mid-February. As we reported earlier, a further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test -the highest number reported in a single day since the pandemic began. And another 33,355 positive Covid cases in the UK have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January. The statistics suggest that UK daily cases have begun to fall, but the number of deaths are on an upward trend. The number of patients in hospital across the UK is also still rising. However, with decreasing daily cases, we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths, our health correspondent Nick Triggle says. A temporary mortuary is being set up in Hampshire to provide extra capacity, following an increase in deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic. The new facility is being set up in Winklebury, Basingstoke, and will become operational on Thursday to support the four major NHS hospital mortuaries across the county. John Coughlan, chief executive of Hampshire County Council, said: ""While our hospitals and funeral sector are currently coping, we are regrettably seeing significant pressures within the system. ""We have therefore decided that it is prudent now to open the temporary mortuary to ensure that we are able to carefully manage and respond to any increase in demand for additional capacity. ""I would like to reassure the families and friends of those who may be accommodated temporarily at this facility that their loved ones will be afforded every possible care, dignity and respect, and that we have been liaising closely with faith leaders to ensure required customs and practices are observed.""  Up to 2,000 people working in roles in the Covid-19 vaccine supply chain will be offered jabs, the UK government says. This is to help ensure the UK gets the doses it needs to protect the most vulnerable. It follows a plea from AstraZeneca to protect workers involved with the manufacture of its vaccine, to ensure the supply chain runs smoothly. Staff working for Pfizer and AstraZeneca involved in crucial supply chain roles in the UK will be among those eligible for the vaccine, the Department for Health and Social Care said. A total of 3,424 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were admitted to hospitals in England on 17 January, NHS England has said. This is a 4% reduction on last week's figure on 10 January. Admissions peaked in the first wave of the virus at 3,099 on 1 April 2020. NHS England said all regions had recorded a week-on-week decrease in daily admissions, apart from the Midlands (up 12%), south-west England (up 1%) and north-east England/Yorkshire (no change). Scotland extended its lockdown this afternoon - the mainland and most of the islands remain in those most severe restrictions. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added the islands of Barra and Vatersay to the top tier of restrictions. Otherwise the Scottish places still in level three are Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles); and the following islands within Argyll and Bute: Coll, Colonsay, Erraid, Gometra, Iona, Islay, Jura, Mull, Oronsay, Tiree, and Ulva; Finally, all highland
authority islands remain in level 3 â except for Skye which comes within the national restrictions Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is aiming for school pupils to return to the classroom Scotland's lockdown has been extended for at least another two weeks. Not only willschools remain closed to most pupilsuntil at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return for pupils, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean? The groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children, and those in the final year of primary school getting ready to move to high school. For others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer. Both the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 February. Emirates and Etihad have announced that they will be among the first airlines in the world to test a mobile app for passengers to record their coronavirus test results and vaccine records. The two companies, which are both based in the UAE, said in separate statements on Tuesday that they were working together with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to test the IATA Travel Pass in the first quarter of 2021. The app will initially be tested on limited routes in the first quarter of this year, with Emirates offering the app to passengers from Dubai to verify their coronavirus test results before travel. The app will also provide information about travel and entry restrictions across various countries. It will also let labs and test centres ""securely send test results or vaccination certificates to passengers"" Emirates' said. Many countries and a number of airlines currently require passengers to provide a negative PCR result in the days before departure. The pandemic has negatively affected airlines across the world, withfigures from Eurocontrol showing that UK flights were down 82% yesterday,externalcompared to the equivalent day in 2019. HSBC has announced it is to close 82 branches in the UK between April and September this year, claiming customers are turning to digital banking. The company said the coronavirus pandemic ""emphasised the need for the changes"" it was making. It said the number of customers using branches had fallen by a third in the past five years, and 90% of all customer contact was over the phone, internet or smartphone, in addition to contacts on social media. Managers said they did not expect to make any redundancies, with staff moved to nearby branches instead. HSBC will have 511 remaining branches across the country.

The US has administered 12.28m Covid-19 vaccine doses so far,according to figures from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,external. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Today's rising number of UK deaths was to be expected, sadly, after
the surge in cases during December. And it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even
higher than this. Todayâs numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays
registering deaths over the weekend tend to lead to higher figures being
reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day. To put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half
that. But there are two chinks of light in the daily update. Firstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 - for a third day
in a row. At the turn of the year it was touching 60,000 new
diagnoses. That means, in the coming weeks, we should start to see fewer
hospitalisations and, eventually, deaths. The number of vaccinations also continues to rise. It seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. But each increase at least takes us one step closer to
getting on top of the virus. Celia HattonBBC Asia Pacific Regional Editor Taiwanese soldiers take part in a Lunar New Year military exercise in Hsinchu A major festival to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year in Taiwan has been cancelled after four new coronavirus cases were discovered. A giant, undulating light sculpture had already been constructed in this year's host city, Hsinchu, to welcome hundreds of thousands of expected visitors. But now Taiwanese health officials are worried about a relatively small outbreak of Covid-19 on the island. Taiwan is one of the only places in the world which managed to keep the spread of the virus under control for most of last year, without imposing severe lockdown restrictions. However, the discovery of four locally-transmitted cases in one day - the biggest daily rise in eleven months - has lead officials to conclude that the lantern festival cannot go ahead. Taiwan has been one of the most successful places in the world in dealing with Covid-19.Read more about how it's been dealing with the virus here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Nearly 240,000 laptops and tablets have been sent to schools and councils in England since the start of the year, according to an update on the governmentâs scheme to help disadvantaged children learn from home. The Department for Education promised 1.3m devices to schools at a cost of Â£400m. A total of 801,324 devices have been dispatched as of 17 January, with 20,000 laptops or tablets being delivered every day. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson hailed the scheme as âone of the worldâs largest procurements of laptops and tabletsâ, saying it had âhappened despite intense global demandâ. But head teachersâ union leader Geoff Barton said âthe frustration is that we are nearly a year into the crisis, and deep into a second period of restricted school opening, and it has still not been fully resolvedâ. Labourâs shadow education minister Wes Streeting said the governmentâs scheme âfalls well shortâ. Birmingham and Lancashire rank highest among local authorities, having both received in excess of 10,000 devices. Anne Longfield, childrenâs commissioner for England, welcomed the âprogressâ but added âthere are many children who are still not able to learn from home properlyâ. In the last half hour, we reported that a further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - the highest daily figure since the pandemic began.

"Protests against China's alleged abuse of the Muslim Uighur community The government has narrowly seen off a rebellion by 33 Tory MPs, who want to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to be committing genocide. MPs voted by 319 to 308 to remove an amendment to the Trade Bill which would have forced ministers to withdraw from deals with nations the UK High Court ruled guilty of mass killings. It comes amid condemnation of China's treatment of the Uighur people. The rebels believe they have enough support to secure another vote soon. Among those to defy the government were ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, former cabinet ministers David Davis and Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. The rebellion is one of the largest on an issue not related to the Covid-19 pandemic during Boris Johnson's time as prime minister. The government has a Commons majority of 80 but this was whittled down to just 11 as prominent ex-ministers such as Tobias Ellwood, Caroline Nokes and Nusrat Ghani, as well as a number of MPs first elected last year, sided with the opposition. MPs have been debating proposals, tabled by cross-bench peer Lord Alton, to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide, a decision currently left to the jurisdiction of international courts. Rebel MPs pressure government over genocide clause Who are the Uighurs? UK accuses China of 'gross' abuses against Uighurs The proposals, also backed by Labour, would mean that ministers would have to revoke post-Brexit trade deals with countries that were ruled to be carrying out systematic mass killings. The issue is expected to resurface when the Trade Bill returns to the House of Lords. Earlier on Tuesday, Conservative rebels, led by former leader Iain Duncan Smith, were unable to force a vote on a separate amendment they had proposed. Every speaker in today's debate - from the front and back benches - said genocide was abhorrent. The worst of crimes. There was united criticism of China's brutal treatment of the Uighurs too. But the question Parliament has been wrestling with is whether the High Court should have the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. And if they did judge a country has been carrying out mass killings, should the High Court be able to compel the government to revoke any trade treaty it has with that country? Ministers insist it should be the job of elected governments, not judges, to determine trade policy. But opposition parties and a large cohort of Tory backbenchers argue it's essential the High Court can rule on genocide and ensure the UK's new trade-making freedom has an obligation to uphold human rights too. This also is an argument about where power lies after Brexit and what role Parliament should have in shaping trade policy after decades in the EU. But BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said that by securing large, but not overwhelming, support for Lord Alton's amendment in the Commons, the rebels hope the government will accept Mr Duncan Smith's own amendment - which would give the Commons the right to debate whether trade deals can be halted if genocide is proven. The debate came as the US government formally declaredthat China was committing genocide in its repression of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang. The UK government has been critical of China's treatment of the Uighurs and last week announced measures to cut UK business links with forced labour camps in the region. But some MPs suspect the government is pulling its punches to avoid antagonising Beijing. Mr Duncan Smith said the debate was ""all about simply shining a light of hope to all those out there who have failed to get their day in court and failed to be treated properly"". ""If this country doesn't stand up for that then I want to know what would it ever stand up for again?,"" he added. But Trade Minister Greg Hands said it was unprecedented and unacceptable to give the courts powers to revoke trade deals agreed by elected governments. And he argued that no one would benefit from the proposal because the UK currently had no free trade deal with China.

"The publication of a letter from the Duchess of Sussex to her father was a ""triple-barrelled invasion"" of her privacy, the High Court has been told. Meghan is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online over articles that reproduced parts of the private handwritten letter. She claims her privacy and copyright were breached by the newspaper group. Her lawyers are asking for summary judgement - a dismissal of Associated Newspapers' defence instead of a trial. Meghan's lawyers argue Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) has ""no prospect"" of defending the privacy and copyright claims being brought against them. They claim the publication of extracts from the private, handwritten letter to Thomas Markle was ""self-evidently... highly intrusive"". Meghan, 39, sent the letter to her father in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie. The five articles, published in February 2019, were a ""triple-barrelled invasion"" of the duchess's privacy, correspondence and family, the lawyers claim. Mr Markle said in a witness statement provided to the remote hearing, which started on Tuesday, that he wanted the letter published to ""set the record straight"" about his relationship with his daughter - but one of Meghan's lawyers described this claim as ""ridiculous"". Meghan is seeking damages from the newspaper group for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over the articles. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now live in the US with their son Her lawyers told the court the letter was written in sorrow rather than anger and was an attempt to get her father to stop talking to the press. But the newspaper group said in its response to the court that Meghan had written the letter ""with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point"" in order to ""defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter"". In written submissions, the newspaper group's barrister Antony White said ""she must, at the very least, have appreciated that her father might choose to disclose it"" and pointed out that the Kensington Palace communications team had been shown the letter before it was sent. ""No truly private letter from daughter to father would require any input from the Kensington Palace communications team,"" said Mr White. But Meghan's lawyers also pointed out the articles themselves had emphasised the private nature of the correspondence - and dismissed any argument that it was in the public interest for the newspaper to reproduce the letter, saying the public interest was at the ""very end of the bottom end of the scale"". Justin Rushbrooke, representing the duchess, described the handwritten letter as ""a heartfelt plea from an anguished daughter to her father"". He said the ""contents and character of the letter were intrinsically private, personal and sensitive in nature"" and that Meghan ""had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the contents of the letter"". The effect of publishing the letter was ""self-evidently likely to be devastating for the claimant"", said Mr Rushbrooke. The barrister argued that, even if ANL was justified in publishing parts of the letter, ""on any view the defendant published far more by way of extracts from the letter than could have been justified in the public interest"". Mr White said that the newspaper group would argue that Meghan's status as a member of the royal family was relevant to the case. In response to that point, Mr Rushbrooke said: ""Yes, she is in some senses a public figure, but that does not reduce her expectation of privacy in relation to information of this kind."" In Thomas Markle's evidence, he said the letter ""signalled the end"" of his relationship with his daughter, and instead of a reconciliation attempt, the letter was a ""criticism"" of him. He said that he had to ""defend himself"" against an article in People magazine. It carried an interview with a ""long-time friend"" of his daughter, who suggested Meghan sent the letter to repair her relationship with her father - something he claimed was false. The People article, he claimed, made him appear ""dishonest, exploitative, publicity-seeking, uncaring and cold-hearted"". He said he had ""never intended to talk publicly about Meg's letter"" until he read the People magazine piece which, he claimed, suggested he was ""to blame for the end of the relationship"". The full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court this month, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021. This interim remote hearing - to consider the request for summary judgement - is due to last two days. Mr Justice Warby, who is hearing the case, is expected to reserve his judgement to a later date.

"Nicola Sturgeon says although there are ""cautious grounds for optimism"" on case numbers, lockdown measures will remain in place People in mainland Scotland and some islands - which now includes Barra and Vatersay - will live under the strictest level four rules Since December 26 only essential shops have been allowed to open; all hospitality is closed and gyms and hairdressers are also shut All Scottish schools had been closed to most pupils and that will remain the case until at least mid-February There have been a further 1,165 new positive cases and 71 newly reported deaths. Positive hospital patient numbers climb to 1,989 and of those people150 are in ICU The Covid-19 vaccination programme is under way and 284,582 people have received the first of two injections. Of those men and women, 3,886 have had their second jab Opposition parties voice their concerns in parliament about the speed of the vaccination programme They quote Dr Andrew Buist, of BMA Scotland, who told the BBC patients are getting anxious and GP practices are struggling to plan because of ""bumpy"" vaccine supply Ms Sturgeon says that despite different approaches by the four nations, Scotland will meet its mid-February target BBC Scotland News  That's all from us here on the live page today. Please take care and stay safe.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) believes the lockdown extension was ""understandable"" but its Scotland leader says the economic damage it will cause ""cannot be
underestimated"".   âThe Scottish government must now redouble efforts to get business support to the firms that need it as quickly as possible. Similarly, the UK government must look at extending the successful Job Retention Scheme to the end of June to protect jobs and livelihoods at risk. And both governments must work together on fuelling the much-needed economic recovery.â Tracy Black, CBI Scotland director News of the extended lockdown has not been welcomed by business leaders. Last month, the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) estimated that each week of lockdown meant non-essential stores missing out on Â£135m of lost sales. Since then, garden centres and homeware shops have been compelled to close too, and the government has placed curbs on retailersâ click and collect services. The SRC says today's extension is a further blow to non-food stores who have already borne
a lot during the pandemic. It said Scottish
stores were set to miss out on almost Â£950m of lost revenues during the
current lockdown period. The extended lockdown will serve to make it harder for some retailers to emerge from this crisis. Even when we do eventually emerge from enforced hibernation the stark reality is that shops will be unable to trade at capacity due to physical distancing restrictions and caps on the number of customers in stores. This means that Aprilâs abrupt âreverse cliff edgeâ - which is set to see a 100% re-instatement of business rates â is simply not sustainable.

He asks the first minister if she is going to admit she has a problem with distribution. Ms Sturgeon replies with a short ""No"". She says there is a challenge in drawing down the allocation of vaccines and transporting them to Scotland for further distribution. She repeats that she is not allowed to discuss the numbers of vaccines available and says there is also a restriction with the Pfizer vaccine. She says the Scottish government is prioritising the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for GP surgeries while the Pfizer product was used in care homes. She adds that it would be wrong to say the programme was not progressing well and that pace would continue to increase. Patrick Harvie says his party has been clear that full reopening of schools can only happen when it is safe to do so. The Scottish Green Party co-leader adds that school staff, pupils and parents want to know what additional measures the government is putting in place to ensure safety. He says supported isolation remains a priority on which both governments must improve their performance. The first minister replies that the most important thing to get schools back safely is to supress the levels of community transmission. All the important mitigation steps must be in place, she adds. The first minister says lateral flow testing in schools is being looked at, as is PCR testing. She adds that the self-isolating support grant is being looked at in terms of widening access to it.  Labour interim leader Jackie Baillie is next up and welcomes the use of the Army to help the vaccination rollout. She asks if the first minister is confident of meeting vaccination targets. She also asks about the ""patchy"" distribution among GP surgeries and asks for a timescale on the GP supply. Ms Sturgeon says she is confident targets will be met by the start of February. She also makes the point that the JCVI initially advised the Scottish government to hold back half of the doses to do second jabs but that those are now ""flowing through the system"". Ms Sturgeon says she will be ""brutally blunt"" and says the Scottish government published detailed estimates of supply last week but that the UK government had a ""hissy fit"" about it doing that. She says her government was asked, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, to take the publication down. She says she did not agree with the reasoning behind it, but that she complied. They don't want us to be open about supply. Yet what we have is the UK government briefing and spinning misleading figures on supply. They have to be clear about which approach they want us to take. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister Ruth Davidson leads the opposition response for the Scottish Conservatives. She brings up the impact on parents and pupils of school closures. She says the best way out of it is the vaccine programme, but says vaccines are slow to reach GP surgeries, and then, the public. She reads letters from concerned constituents who are awaiting the jab, or invitations to attend for the vaccine. She asks for an explanation from the first minister on the hold-up of vaccine supply, and after reports the NHS Louisa Jordan was closed on Sunday, asks when the vaccine will be available over seven days. The first minister says there was a ""pharmacy issue"" at NHS Louisa Jordan and that from now on the operation will be over seven days. She reiterates that the most vulnerable were protected first and says 90% of  care home residents have been vaccinated - higher than numbers in England. The first minister says that in January, 100,000 vaccines were expected to be completed and they have achieved and increased that, working towards 400,000 a week. She adds that the four nations are working to a different order but are following the same targets. Stay at Home. Protect the NHS. Save lives."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister As the first minister's statement draws to a close she asks everyone to ""please stick to the letter â and also the spirit â of the lockdown"". She says we should be thinking every day about how we can reduce our interactions
as far as we can, to remove as many opportunities as possible for the virus to
spread. She says the restrictions are working and she asks people to ""please, stick with it"". Here's a reminder of the restrictions and guidance: 1. Scottish government:Coronavirus (COVID-19): what you can and cannot do,external From Tuesday 5 January, mainland Scotland moved from Level 4 to a temporary lockdown, with new guidanceto stay at home,externalexcept for essential purposes. Some islands remain atLevel 3,external. 2.Postcode checker,externalfor Covid restrictions by protection level in areas of Scotland 3.NHS Inform,external The latest from NHS Scotland and the Scottish government, including social distancing, face covering and stay-at-home advice. The first minister says going out to exercise should be just that, not going out to socialise in a park or on a beach. ""So please - stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,"" she says. She calls on people to work from home if they can and to follow the FACTS advice. The first minister says: ""There will be a continued need for all of us to play our part in suppressing
transmission in the ways we have been doing for the last few months. ""Obviously, I hope this will not entail the strictest form of lockdown for
too much longer, but some mitigations - for example, physical distancing,
hygiene, face coverings, possibly travel limitations - are likely to be
necessary for some time yet."" She adds: ""We
do now have hope, more so than at any time since the start of this pandemic, of
a path to much greater domestic normality - something that all of us crave. ""For now, progressing along that path requires continued discipline and sacrifice."" The first minister says: ""We then aim to complete first doses for everyone who is over 65 by the
start of March, and to give first doses to everyone on the JCVI priority list
by early May. ""That means presiding officer that in around three monthsâ time, around three million people in
total will have received at least the first dose of the vaccine - this is, of
course, the majority of the adult population and includes everyone over the age
of 50, and many younger people with an underlying health condition. ""The rest of the adult population will follow after that just as quickly
as supplies allow."" ""Our pace of progress in the over-80s group is also now picking up,"" says Ms Sturgeon. ""We estimate that between 15% and 20% have already had the first dose and
we are on track for all over-80s - and everyone else in JCVI groups 1 & 2 -
to have been offered the first dose by the start of February. ""By the middle of February, we expect to have completed first doses for
all over-70s, and for all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable."" The first minister adds: ""People in these groups will start to receive appointments for February
in the coming days."" Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland education correspondent It
had become clear that schools would not be reopening on 1 February. The
situation will be reviewed on 2 February and the first minister says she hopes
a phased return from the middle of next month will be possible. One
question may be whether primary school children could go back full time while
secondaries move from remote to blended learning. But
if this doesn't happen and so-called ""remote learning"" continues after
mid-February it is likely to prove controversial. Ultimately
though, the decision on reopening schools will be based on the progress in the
fight against coronavirus. And it is
certainly clear that the return to the classroom will be one of the top
priorities. Shops or hairdressers certainly won't reopen before schools. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99814177
"About one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in December, roughly double the October figure, data has shown. Estimates from the Office for National Statistics suggest between 8% of people in Northern Ireland and 12% of people in England showed signs of past Covid infection. In October, antibody positivity ranged from 2% to 7% around the UK. And 6,586 Covid deaths wereregistered in the UK in the week to 8 January,external. That brings the total registered so far close to 96,000. Nearly a quarter of deaths were people living in care homes - a disproportionate impact on a group of people which accounts for less than 1% of the population. Back in July, though, care home residents accounted for 40% of deaths. The ONS regularly tests a representative sample of the population, both for current infection and for antibodies indicating a past infection. People taking part in the survey are tested whether or not they have had symptoms. This is used to estimate how common both the virus and antibodies are in the population as a whole. Antibodies are proteins in the blood which fight off specific infections. They are developed if somebody catches an infection and their body fights it off, or if they have been vaccinated. Yorkshire and the Humber topped the chart with 17% of people having positive antibodies, followed by London. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School, said: ""This study shows that infection with the Sars-Cov-2 virus is much more widespread in the UK than previously realised, with around 1 in 10 people estimated to have been infected by December 2020. ""The implications are that infection rates increased significantly between November and December."" Having Covid may 'protect for at least 5 months' Can you catch Covid twice? But Scotland had a considerably smaller growth in antibodies than the rest of the UK, rising from 7% to 9% of the population. In December: One in eight (12%) people in England had antibodies, up from 7% One in 10 (10%) people in Wales had antibodies, up from 4% One in 11 (9%) people in Scotland had antibodies, up from 7% One in 13 (8%) people in Northern Ireland had antibodies, up from 2% The fact that more people show signs of having at least some protection against Covid-19 is consistent with the dramatic rise in infections during that period. But we know that antibodies from natural infection can fade. In England, the ONS said, positive antibody tests equated to 5.4 million people aged over 16 having signs of past infection. That does not tell you the total number of people infected, however, but acts as a snapshot in time. In London, about 16% of people had antibodies in December, up from 11% in October. But at the last peak in May, an estimated 15% of the population had antibodies. This proportion fell, as detectable antibodies recede with time. Exactly what this means for someone's likelihood to become infected again, however, is not fully known. It also remains to be seen how long vaccines will protect people for, before they need a booster jab. But Public Health England data suggests natural immunity provides at least five months' protection on average, and vaccines often give better protection than natural immunity. More than 4 million people in the UK have been given their first dose of the vaccine. Prof Janet Lord, director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, urged caution among those who have already been vaccinated. Asked whether people who have received the jab can hug their children, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I would certainly advise not to do that at the moment because, as you probably know, with the vaccines they take several weeks before they are maximally effective. ""It's really important that people stay on their guard even if they've had that first vaccination.""

"Women and black academics remain under-represented at professor level Only 155 out of more than 23,000 university professors in the UK are black, according to official figures. It remains below 1%, the same as for the past five years, and is an increase of only 50 posts despite the number of professorships rising by more than 3,000 in that time. At this senior academic level, women hold 28% of professorships, up from 23% five years ago. ""The pace of change is glacial,"" said lecturers' union leader Jo Grady. ""Universities must do more to ensure a more representative mix of staff at a senior level and stop this terrible waste of talent,"" said Dr Grady, general secretary of the UCU university union. The figures on black professors were ""disappointing"" and ""inexplicable"", said Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, ""given the symbolic importance of education as the foundation of our values."" ""Around a quarter of British postgraduates are from ethnic minorities, there is clearly no shortage of qualified black and minority academics seeking elevation to senior teaching and research roles in our universities,"" said Dr Begum. She called on vice chancellors to take action over a problem they can ""literally discern with their own eyes every single day they are on campus"". Universities accused of 'complacency' over racism Unconscious bias training to be scrapped by ministers 'I don't want to  be the only black history professor' The annual figures, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, provide a breakdown of the UK's academic workforce - and show while there has been a focus on widening access for students, there are still few black academic staff. At the level of professor, the number of black professors rose from 105 to 155 between 2014-15 to 2019-20. But new higher education providers included in the figures meant an additional 3,200 staff at professor grade, with the proportion of black professors only increasing marginally from 0.5% to 0.7% over five years. This compared to 7% of professors who are Asian and 89% white in the figures for 2019-20. Kehinde Andrews, professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, said that rather than universities being ""progressive dreamlands"", the ""make-up of professors is the perfect reflection of the narrow Eurocentric views still produced by universities"". ""I have seen very few genuine attempts to address the issues of racism at any level across the sector,"" said Prof Andrews. Among all academic staff, 2% are black, 10% are Asian, 75% are white,  with the remainder under categories of ""mixed"", ""other or not known"". There is still a significant gender gap in professorships, among a group that is also heavily skewed to older age groups, with most in their fifties, sixties and above. Five years ago, more than 4,500 professors were women, which has risen to 6,300 - from 23% to 28% of these senior posts. This is despite women representing 46% of all academic staff. Baroness Amos, who was the UK's first black female university head, has previously warned of ""deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome"" in the recruitment of senior staff in higher education. Universities UK said ""the evidence is clear that black and minority ethnic staff continue to be under-represented"" at these senior academic levels. ""More needs to be done to address this inequality which exists within higher education, which mirrors inequalities evident in wider UK society and which will require an unequivocal commitment to change,"" said the universities' organisation.

The storm blanketed a stretch of the Tohoku Expressway in Miyagi prefecture at around noon (03:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Some 200 people have been caught up in the pile-up and rescuers are currently at the scene, officials said. Japan has been hit by severe snow storms in recent weeks with some parts of the country seeing double the average expected snowfall. Images from the expressway in the north of the country show the sheer scale of the pile-up. One person died and at least 10 were injured after the vehicles collided Authorities had already enforced a 50km/h (31mph) speed limit on the road due to visibility.

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

"It is not known when the artwork was taken as no one reported it missing A 500-year-old painting has been discovered in a flat in Italy and returned to a museum - where staff were unaware it had even been stolen. The copy of Salvator Mundi, which is believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci, was found in a bedroom cupboard in Naples on Saturday. This copy is thought to have been painted by one of da Vinci's students. The 36-year-old owner of the flat was arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen goods, police said. ""The painting was found on Saturday thanks to a brilliant and diligent police operation,"" Naples prosecutor Giovanni Melillo told the AFP news agency. Leonardo da Vinci goes 'immersive' Louvre in Paris opens long-awaited exhibition Inside the 'earlier' Mona Lisa mystery The artwork is usually part of the Doma Museum collection at the San Domenico Maggiore church in the city. But Mr Melillo said officials were not aware it had been stolen because ""the room where the painting is kept has not been open for three months"" due to the coronavirus pandemic. It is not known when the artwork was taken as no one had reported it missing, butthe museum said it was in its possession as recently as last January,external. Some experts believe Leonardo's student Giacomo Alibrandi may have painted the artwork Police are now investigating the circumstances of the theft, but there was no sign of a break-in at the museum. ""It is plausible that it was a commissioned theft by an organisation working in the international art trade,"" Mr Melillo said. It is not known who painted the artwork, but some experts believe Leonardo's student Giacomo Alibrandi may have done so in the early 1500s. It shows Christ with one hand raised, with the other holding a glass sphere. And to add to the mystery - whether or not the original painting is an authentic Leonardo da Vinci is disputed. Leonardo died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence.

Efforts to restore it have also resulted in abrasions. This did not detract buyers, however, and the painting became the most expensive ever sold whenit was auctioned for a record $450m (Â£341m) in 2017.

"This video can not be played Health workers can book an appointment at seven vaccination centres in operation across NI Doctors have insisted there is no postcode lottery when it comes to rolling out the coronavirus vaccines. Northern Ireland's vaccination plan means all those over 80 should receive their first dose by the end of January. More than 154,000 doses of a vaccine have now been administered, health officials said. Dr Frances O'Hagan, deputy chairwoman of NI's GP committee, said practices had their own rollout plans but she expected them to meet official targets. ""As soon as we get the vaccine, we will get it to you,"" she told BBC News NI. ""But please, please wait until we contact you."" ""We tailor our programmes to our individual patients and to our geography and to our surroundings. ""It's not actually a postcode lottery. It's the best way of doing it because we know what suits our patients."" What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? Dr O'Hagan said she had not heard reports of some practices holding back vaccines until they received bigger amounts to allow for a larger number of vaccinations to be done. She said rolling out the programme was a logistical challenge which fell on top of an already heavy workload but the jab would be given out in a ""safe and timely"" fashion. Sinn FÃ©in MP Ãrfhlaith Begley said doctors in her West Tyrone constituency were working above and beyond to administer the vaccine to as many people as possible. ""But unfortunately I am hearing that some GPs cannot access supplies of the vaccine,"" she said. ""There does appear to be, and it is a consistent message from GPs in my own constituency, a feeling the distribution of the vaccine has been unequal to date."" Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has welcomed a further delivery of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine into Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning. In atweet,external, Robin Swann said: ""We now have the supply to complete all our over 80s and when that group is finished, there will be enough to start into the over 75 programme."" Patricia Donnelly, the head of NI's vaccination programme said there had been 154,436 doses of the vaccine administered here, with 132,857 of those being first doses. On Tuesday, she said three quarters of care home residents had already received both doses. ""With the arrival of additional vaccine today, which have been issued this afternoon and tomorrow to GPs, there will be enough to complete the over 80 population and to commence in the over 70 population,"" she added. A further 24 virus-related deaths and 713 more Covid-19 cases were reported in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. It brings the total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health to 1,649. There are currently 842 people in hospital with the virus, 70 people in intensive care units (ICU) and 57 being ventilated. In the Republic of Ireland, a further 93 Covid-19 related deaths were reported on Tuesday, bringing the country's death toll to 2,708. A further 2,001 positive cases were also recorded in the latest figures from the Republic's Department of Health. Northern Ireland's rate of Covid-19 infection is now below one and has been at that level for a couple of weeks, according to the chief medical officer. However, Dr Michael McBride warned the reproduction (R) number for hospital transmission remains above one. What is the R number and why does it matter? Dr McBride said new variants of the virus had made the job of curtailing the spread even more difficult, and warned he did not foresee any relaxation of restrictions any time soon. ""We need to ensure that we have as many people who remain at risk of severe disease vaccinated and prioritised with the first dose as possible before we consider significant relaxations in the current restrictions,"" he said. Meanwhile concerns have been raised that ""social media myths"" are encouraging some care home staff to reject the Covid vaccine. Pauline Shepherd, from the Independent Health and Care Providers, said young women were especially vulnerable to misinformation about the vaccine and fertility. Last week, the Department of Health said there had been an uptake level of about 80% among care home staff. ""We are very keen obviously that everyone takes the vaccine, that is really the only way that we are going to get through this,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. ""Obviously there are myths going around on social media about the vaccine and some are opting not to take it. ""Particularly younger females seem to have the view through social media that it may impact fertility"". A consultant anaesthetist says there is a ""reluctance"" among members of the black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to take Covid-19 vaccines There are currently 139 confirmed Covid-19 outbreaks in NI's 483 care homes. The Public Health Agency (PHA) and Department of Health were now exploring how ""to dispel the myths"", Ms Shepherd added. Dr Mukesh Chugh, a consultant anaesthetist at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, said there had been a ""reluctance"" among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people to take Covid-19 vaccines. Dr Chugh says this is because of ""anti-vaccine messages"" posted across various social media platforms and messenger apps ""targeted at certain ethnic and religious groups"". ""I encourage them not to believe the messages they are getting on WhatsApp - these are not scientific messages,"" he said. ""Believe the scientific research."" On Tuesday, Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said a number of groups of key workers should be given priority access to vaccinations. Prioritisation was decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments on immunisation. Edwin Poots said meat plant workers should be among those given priority vaccine access Asked if he supported prioritisation for food workers in meat plants, Mr Poots told the assembly he did and had raised it with the executive. ""It's been identified as an essential service - those people working in them are there in cold, wet conditions where we have had a number of outbreaks,"" he said. ""We should seek to introduce those people somewhat earlier than is currently the case - I will continue to endeavour to press that case."" He said other groups of workers who should be prioritised included ""teachers and police officers"". What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan?

"Women and black academics remain under-represented at professor level Only 155 out of more than 23,000 university professors in the UK are black, according to official figures. It remains below 1%, the same as for the past five years, and is an increase of only 50 posts despite the number of professorships rising by more than 3,000 in that time. At this senior academic level, women hold 28% of professorships, up from 23% five years ago. ""The pace of change is glacial,"" said lecturers' union leader Jo Grady. ""Universities must do more to ensure a more representative mix of staff at a senior level and stop this terrible waste of talent,"" said Dr Grady, general secretary of the UCU university union. The figures on black professors were ""disappointing"" and ""inexplicable"", said Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, ""given the symbolic importance of education as the foundation of our values."" ""Around a quarter of British postgraduates are from ethnic minorities, there is clearly no shortage of qualified black and minority academics seeking elevation to senior teaching and research roles in our universities,"" said Dr Begum. She called on vice chancellors to take action over a problem they can ""literally discern with their own eyes every single day they are on campus"". Universities accused of 'complacency' over racism Unconscious bias training to be scrapped by ministers 'I don't want to  be the only black history professor' The annual figures, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, provide a breakdown of the UK's academic workforce - and show while there has been a focus on widening access for students, there are still few black academic staff. At the level of professor, the number of black professors rose from 105 to 155 between 2014-15 to 2019-20. But new higher education providers included in the figures meant an additional 3,200 staff at professor grade, with the proportion of black professors only increasing marginally from 0.5% to 0.7% over five years. This compared to 7% of professors who are Asian and 89% white in the figures for 2019-20. Kehinde Andrews, professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, said that rather than universities being ""progressive dreamlands"", the ""make-up of professors is the perfect reflection of the narrow Eurocentric views still produced by universities"". ""I have seen very few genuine attempts to address the issues of racism at any level across the sector,"" said Prof Andrews. Among all academic staff, 2% are black, 10% are Asian, 75% are white,  with the remainder under categories of ""mixed"", ""other or not known"". There is still a significant gender gap in professorships, among a group that is also heavily skewed to older age groups, with most in their fifties, sixties and above. Five years ago, more than 4,500 professors were women, which has risen to 6,300 - from 23% to 28% of these senior posts. This is despite women representing 46% of all academic staff. Baroness Amos, who was the UK's first black female university head, has previously warned of ""deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome"" in the recruitment of senior staff in higher education. Universities UK said ""the evidence is clear that black and minority ethnic staff continue to be under-represented"" at these senior academic levels. ""More needs to be done to address this inequality which exists within higher education, which mirrors inequalities evident in wider UK society and which will require an unequivocal commitment to change,"" said the universities' organisation.

"The publication of a letter from the Duchess of Sussex to her father was a ""triple-barrelled invasion"" of her privacy, the High Court has been told. Meghan is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online over articles that reproduced parts of the private handwritten letter. She claims her privacy and copyright were breached by the newspaper group. Her lawyers are asking for summary judgement - a dismissal of Associated Newspapers' defence instead of a trial. Meghan's lawyers argue Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) has ""no prospect"" of defending the privacy and copyright claims being brought against them. They claim the publication of extracts from the private, handwritten letter to Thomas Markle was ""self-evidently... highly intrusive"". Meghan, 39, sent the letter to her father in August 2018, following her marriage to Prince Harry in May that year, which Mr Markle did not attend. The couple are now living in the US with their son Archie. The five articles, published in February 2019, were a ""triple-barrelled invasion"" of the duchess's privacy, correspondence and family, the lawyers claim. Mr Markle said in a witness statement provided to the remote hearing, which started on Tuesday, that he wanted the letter published to ""set the record straight"" about his relationship with his daughter - but one of Meghan's lawyers described this claim as ""ridiculous"". Meghan is seeking damages from the newspaper group for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act over the articles. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now live in the US with their son Her lawyers told the court the letter was written in sorrow rather than anger and was an attempt to get her father to stop talking to the press. But the newspaper group said in its response to the court that Meghan had written the letter ""with a view to it being disclosed publicly at some future point"" in order to ""defend her against charges of being an uncaring or unloving daughter"". In written submissions, the newspaper group's barrister Antony White said ""she must, at the very least, have appreciated that her father might choose to disclose it"" and pointed out that the Kensington Palace communications team had been shown the letter before it was sent. ""No truly private letter from daughter to father would require any input from the Kensington Palace communications team,"" said Mr White. But Meghan's lawyers also pointed out the articles themselves had emphasised the private nature of the correspondence - and dismissed any argument that it was in the public interest for the newspaper to reproduce the letter, saying the public interest was at the ""very end of the bottom end of the scale"". Justin Rushbrooke, representing the duchess, described the handwritten letter as ""a heartfelt plea from an anguished daughter to her father"". He said the ""contents and character of the letter were intrinsically private, personal and sensitive in nature"" and that Meghan ""had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the contents of the letter"". The effect of publishing the letter was ""self-evidently likely to be devastating for the claimant"", said Mr Rushbrooke. The barrister argued that, even if ANL was justified in publishing parts of the letter, ""on any view the defendant published far more by way of extracts from the letter than could have been justified in the public interest"". Mr White said that the newspaper group would argue that Meghan's status as a member of the royal family was relevant to the case. In response to that point, Mr Rushbrooke said: ""Yes, she is in some senses a public figure, but that does not reduce her expectation of privacy in relation to information of this kind."" In Thomas Markle's evidence, he said the letter ""signalled the end"" of his relationship with his daughter, and instead of a reconciliation attempt, the letter was a ""criticism"" of him. He said that he had to ""defend himself"" against an article in People magazine. It carried an interview with a ""long-time friend"" of his daughter, who suggested Meghan sent the letter to repair her relationship with her father - something he claimed was false. The People article, he claimed, made him appear ""dishonest, exploitative, publicity-seeking, uncaring and cold-hearted"". He said he had ""never intended to talk publicly about Meg's letter"" until he read the People magazine piece which, he claimed, suggested he was ""to blame for the end of the relationship"". The full trial of the duchess's claim had been due to be heard at the High Court this month, but last year the case was adjourned until autumn 2021. This interim remote hearing - to consider the request for summary judgement - is due to last two days. Mr Justice Warby, who is hearing the case, is expected to reserve his judgement to a later date.

"Pupils are currently learning remotely from home Schools in England may reopen region by region after half term, the government's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said. Speaking to the Commons education committee, Dr Harries suggested there would be different rates of infection across the country when lockdown ends. This would mean a ""differential application"" of restrictive measures would be required, she said. Schools were closed at the start of January to stem the spread of Covid-19. Although schools remain open to vulnerable children and those of keyworkers, all others are due to learn remotely from home until after the February half term holiday. But the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested they may not return fully then. A Department for Education spokesperson said the department was continuing to keep plans for the return to school under review and that it would inform schools, parents and pupils of the plans ahead of February half term. Committee chairman Robert Halfon said he suspected schools would be closed for quite ""a few weeks yet"", but there has been no formal confirmation of this. Medical and science advisers were warning the government before Christmas that the NHS would not be able to manage the number of Covid-19 cases if schools remained open. When will schools reopen? How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) The new, more transmissible variant of the virus had been increasing exponentially in London and the south-east before Christmas. But in some parts of the north  and north-east saw rates of increase were reducing. Dr Harries said: ""It is highly likely that when we come out of this national lockdown we will not have consistent patterns of infection in our communities across the country. ""And therefore, as we had prior to the national lockdown, it may well be possible that we need to have some differential application."" But Dr Harries said schools would be at the top of the priority to ensure that the balance of education and wellbeing were ""right at the forefront"" of consideration. This video can not be played Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries says schools in England might reopen ''region by region'' Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Although the government intends that schools will fully reopen after the February half-term holiday, it is clearly in the balance when this happens and whether there will be any sort of regional approach. ""We expect that it will depend on coronavirus infection rates and the pressure on the NHS, and that the government will make a call on this issue nearer the time. ""What is important is that when schools fully reopen, everything possible is done to keep them open and to keep disruption to a minimum. ""This is why we are calling for education staff to be prioritised for vaccinations as soon as possible, and for schools to be given more support in the use of rapid turnaround mass testing."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said if the government was planning to stagger opening of schools by region, it needed to ""provide clarity sooner rather than later"". ""This will give vital time to prepare for a smoother reopening of schools and business,"" he said. On calls for vaccination of teachers, Dr Harries suggested the safe re-opening of schools did not depend on this. But members of the committee suggested education would be less disrupted by teachers needing to go home and isolate when infected. The vaccination programme had been worked out in order of vulnerability to the disease, she stressed. And Dr Harries added that although pupils could and did transmit the virus, she did not have evidence of them being ""a significant driver"" of ""large-scale community infections"".

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

"Women and black academics remain under-represented at professor level Only 155 out of more than 23,000 university professors in the UK are black, according to official figures. It remains below 1%, the same as for the past five years, and is an increase of only 50 posts despite the number of professorships rising by more than 3,000 in that time. At this senior academic level, women hold 28% of professorships, up from 23% five years ago. ""The pace of change is glacial,"" said lecturers' union leader Jo Grady. ""Universities must do more to ensure a more representative mix of staff at a senior level and stop this terrible waste of talent,"" said Dr Grady, general secretary of the UCU university union. The figures on black professors were ""disappointing"" and ""inexplicable"", said Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, ""given the symbolic importance of education as the foundation of our values."" ""Around a quarter of British postgraduates are from ethnic minorities, there is clearly no shortage of qualified black and minority academics seeking elevation to senior teaching and research roles in our universities,"" said Dr Begum. She called on vice chancellors to take action over a problem they can ""literally discern with their own eyes every single day they are on campus"". Universities accused of 'complacency' over racism Unconscious bias training to be scrapped by ministers 'I don't want to  be the only black history professor' The annual figures, published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, provide a breakdown of the UK's academic workforce - and show while there has been a focus on widening access for students, there are still few black academic staff. At the level of professor, the number of black professors rose from 105 to 155 between 2014-15 to 2019-20. But new higher education providers included in the figures meant an additional 3,200 staff at professor grade, with the proportion of black professors only increasing marginally from 0.5% to 0.7% over five years. This compared to 7% of professors who are Asian and 89% white in the figures for 2019-20. Kehinde Andrews, professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, said that rather than universities being ""progressive dreamlands"", the ""make-up of professors is the perfect reflection of the narrow Eurocentric views still produced by universities"". ""I have seen very few genuine attempts to address the issues of racism at any level across the sector,"" said Prof Andrews. Among all academic staff, 2% are black, 10% are Asian, 75% are white,  with the remainder under categories of ""mixed"", ""other or not known"". There is still a significant gender gap in professorships, among a group that is also heavily skewed to older age groups, with most in their fifties, sixties and above. Five years ago, more than 4,500 professors were women, which has risen to 6,300 - from 23% to 28% of these senior posts. This is despite women representing 46% of all academic staff. Baroness Amos, who was the UK's first black female university head, has previously warned of ""deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome"" in the recruitment of senior staff in higher education. Universities UK said ""the evidence is clear that black and minority ethnic staff continue to be under-represented"" at these senior academic levels. ""More needs to be done to address this inequality which exists within higher education, which mirrors inequalities evident in wider UK society and which will require an unequivocal commitment to change,"" said the universities' organisation.

His boss may be unable to tweet, but Vice-President Mike Pence has taken to Twitter to bid adieu to Washington. He and Second Lady Karen Pence plan to return to his hometown of Columbus, Indiana, on Wednesday,according to the Indy Star,external. He graduated from high school in the city and his mother still lives there.

Pence has only met once with President Trump since 6 January, when pro-Trump rioters at the US Capitol repeatedly chanted: ""Hang Mike Pence!"" As we reported earlier, he will not attend Trump's farewell ceremony tomorrow morning and will instead be present at the inauguration ceremony for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The vice president and his wife - First Lady Karen Pence - will then fly home to Indiana. It remains unclear whether he intends to run for office again. Reality Check Trump also said in his farewell video, as he has done on many occasions, that his
administration ""built the greatest economy in the history of the world"". The US
economy has certainly done well under Trump prior to the coronavirus
pandemic, but there have been periods under previous administrations when it
did significantly better. In his
first three years in office, Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%.
This was slightly higher than the final three years of the Obama era. However,
there have been many periods when the growth of GDP â the value of goods and
services in the economy â was a lot higher. In 2020 the
economy saw the largest contraction on record because of the effects of the
pandemic. It rebounded by 33% in the third quarter of the year, itself a record
for a quarterly increase, but this did not bring economic activity back to
pre-pandemic levels. Numbers for
the final quarter are yet to be published. Read more. Reality Check President Trump said in his speech that âwe achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americansâ. The African American and Hispanic American unemployment rate hit 5.2% and 4% respectively in August and 2019 - the lowest rates recorded since the US Labor Department started collecting these statistics in the 1970s. The unemployment rate has recently spiked sharply for both groups because of the huge impact of the pandemic on the US economy. And this has disproportionately affected African Americans and Hispanics - their unemployment rates are 3.2% and 2.6% higher respectively than the overall figure. Asian American unemployment is currently 5.9%. It reached a record low of 2.1% in June 2019, but these records only date back to 2003. Read more. Reality Check In his farewell video address, President Trump said: âWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.â That's not right for tax cuts in general - previous ones have been larger. It is right for corporation tax. We investigated this claim in 2018 shortly after Congress passed sweeping tax reform legislation. According to tax specialists, the cuts were big but not the biggest. The Committee for a Responsible Budget looked at the numbers and reported that President Trump's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history, compared to the overall size of the economy. If you adjust the analysis for inflation, President Trump's tax cuts rank fourth overall. However, tax experts also assessed Mr Trump's cut in corporation tax from 35% to 21%. Most said in absolute terms it was the biggest corporate tax cut in history. Read more. Reality Check In President Trumpâs farewell speech he said: âWe proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into placeâ¦ with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.â It was a one of his major pledges in the run-up to the 2016 election. As of 4 January 2021, a total of 452 miles (757km) of barrier has been built since he took office. However, the vast majority of this new wall replaced existing structures on the border. Only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there was none before. Of this 47 miles is whatâs called primary wall, and 33 miles is secondary wall that reinforces the initial barrier. President-elect Joe Biden said he would not build ""another foot"" of the wall. Read more. Donald Trump is already awaiting his second impeachment trial by the Senate once he leaves office. A sideshow to all this is that he now faces possible expulsion from the Screen Actors Guild. SAG-AFTRA, the union which represents working performers, said on Tuesday its national board found Trump had probably violated its rules over his alleged incitement of the Capitol riot. The board has requested his expulsion and the issue will now be heard by the body's disciplinary committee. ""The charges specifically cite Trumpâs role in inciting the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, and in sustaining a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are SAG-AFTRA members,"" the statement said. According to the AP news agency, the former Apprentice star has been a member of the Screen Actors Guild since 1989. He has also made cameo appearances in films and TV series including Home Alone 2. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump, in his 20-minute pre-recorded farewell speech, said his administration did what it came to do and more. One can debate the significance of his accomplishments â whether 400 miles of rebuilt border wall, tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, confirmed judges, trade wars and modest Mideast diplomatic agreements amount to much in the way of substantive achievement. But at least in one way, his boast is certainly true. Trump ran for president in 2016 to shake up the existing political order. He campaigned as an outsider giving voice to those who distrusted the establishment and felt the system no longer worked for them. âI took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because thatâs what you elected me to do,â he said. The unrest and resentment that Trump rode to the White House crested and crashed on the US Capitol two weeks ago, leaving behind wreckage â literal and metaphorical â that will take time and effort to clear. After four years of shattered norms and traditions, of turning expectations of presidential behaviour on their head, Trump leaves US government changed â fundamentally and, perhaps, irreversibly. That, at least, was a promise made and a promise kept. This video can not be played Trump farewell: 'We did what we came here to do' Joe Biden has landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, after bidding farewell to his home state of Delaware. He earlier shared a video on social media of him and his wife Jill boarding the flight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we have mentioned, Biden is due to attend an event this evening honouring those who have died as a result of coronavirus and will spend the night at the presidential guest house Blair House. A Catholic, he is expected to attend Mass at the Cathedral of St Matthew the Apostle in Washington DC on Wednesday morning with the four congressional leaders - Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy - before being sworn in as president. ""America is not a timid nation of tame
souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree,"" he said. He adds: ""We are - and must always be - a land of
hope, of light and of glory to all the world."" Here's what else he had to say: On his final full day in office, outgoing president Donald Trump delivered a farewell speech from the White House. Currently locked out of his personal social media accounts, Trump struck a concilatory yet defiant tone in the video released via the government's official social media accounts. ""We did what we came here to do - and so much more,"" he said. ""I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices â because thatâs what you elected me to do."" He warned that ""the greatest danger"" now facing the country was ""a loss of confidence in our national greatness"". The 45th president ran through actions taken by his administration - from ""stand[ing] up to China like never before"" to ""a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East"". He added: ""I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars."" Referring to the riot at the US Capitol on 6 January, he said: ""All Americans were horrified by the assault on the Capitol... It can never be tolerated."" Trump acknowledged that a new administration would take office, but said: ""I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning."" Allow YouTube content?

A seesaw installation at the US-Mexico border wall has won the 2020 Beazley Design of the Year award, which is run by London's Design Museum. The pink seesaws were placed through sections of the wall and allowed people in both countries to play together. They were installed by Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello at the Anapra zone in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. They were only in place for 20 minutes, but video footage of people using them quickly went viral. You can see more pictures of the seesaws here As we mentioned earlier, the death toll from coronavirus in the US has passed 400,000. According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, the country has now reported 400,022 fatalities, and more than 24 million cases. This is more deaths and cases than reported by any other country in the world. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are due to lead an event in Washington later today to honour those killed by Covid-19. The president-elect has pledged to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days in office. The Democrat received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine last month, saying he was getting the jab to show Americans it is ""safe to take"". Donald Trump has been criticised by health experts for his handling of the pandemic. But the White House defended the administration, highlighting Operation Warp Speed, the programme to develop and distribute vaccines. âWe grieve every single life lost to this pandemic, and thanks to the presidentâs leadership, Operation Warp Speed has led to the development of multiple safe and effective vaccines in record time, something many said would never happen,â White House spokesman Judd Deere said, according to AP news agency.  Thousands of troops have been deployed ahead of the inauguration A dozen members of the US National Guard have been removed from security efforts to protect tomorrow's inauguration, according to US media reports. The Associated Press news agency, which initially reported the number, said that all of the members had been found to have links with right-wing groups or to have posted extremist views online. However, a Pentagon spokesman quoted by Reuters news agency said that not all were removed due to ties to extremist groups, while NBC news said that some of the guardsmen were ruled out due to ""'more routine' vetting issues"". Security in Washington DC has been bolstered since the Capitol riot on 6 January, which left five people dead. More than 25,000 members of the National Guards are expected to be involved in tomorrow's ceremony - more than three times the number present during Donald Trump's inauguration. Find out more about how security threats and Covid-19 have changed the ceremonyhere. The US has become the first country to surpass 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths. Security has been ramped up in Washington DC in preparation for an inauguration like no other. Some 25,000 National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced due to the pandemic and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Alun Davies, Paul Davies and Darren Millar have all issued apologies A group of politicians drank alcohol on Welsh Parliament premises, days after a ban on serving it in pubs took effect. Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies and Darren Millar were seen drinking together in early December. Senedd authorities said they were investigating an ""incident"" which ""may have been contrary to public health regulations"". LabourMember of the SeneddAlun Davies was also involved. He and two Tories deny breaking rules. ""A member has been suspended from the privileges of Senedd Labour Group membership while an investigation takes place into this alleged incident,"" a spokesman for the group said. A ban on the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premisescame into force in Wales at 18:00 GMT on 4 December, although hospitality businesses can sell alcohol to take away after 18:00. On 8 December, a group of Members of the Senedd and staff drank alcohol in the Ty Hywel building in Cardiff Bay that houses the Senedd's offices.

The Welsh Government confirmed the alcohol ban applies to the person running the licensed premises, rather than customers.

"The death happened in the alpine resort of Verbier, in Switzerland A British man has been killed in an avalanche in the Swiss Alps, police have said. The man was among 10 people swept away at the alpine resort of Verbier, to the east of Geneva, on Monday morning. Police said the skier, who has not been named, lived in Verbier and died at the scene. One person was flown to hospital with serious injuries, while eight others were uninjured, local police said. A police spokesman said: ""The avalanche occurred outside the piste between the Verbier ski area and 'Les Attelas'. ""At around 10:20, a skier was driving down a corridor below the 'Attelas' area. ""A snow drift came loose and carried the skier as well as another person who had been further down at the time."" An investigation has been launched. The Foreign Office said it was offering support to the British man's family and was in contact with the authorities in Switzerland. The death comes after several days of heavy snowfall across Switzerland, which led to the death of another skier who was killed in an avalanche while skiing in Gstaad. It takes the total deaths due to avalanches in the country to seven since last weekend. More than 200British skiers left the popular Verbier resortin December after Switzerland imposed a coronavirus quarantine following the discovery of a new variant of the virus.

""While we did not break the rules, we recognise that what was part of a day's work would not be seen to be following the spirit of them, especially given the tough time the country has been going through,"" the statement said. In his statement, Labour's Alun Davies said: ""I am very sorry if my actions have given the impression that I am in any way not committed to upholding the regulations which I have consistently supported throughout the last year."" He said the purpose of the meeting ""was to seek to persuade the Welsh Conservatives to support my proposal for a Welsh Hearts Bill, which the Senedd endorsed on 21 October, and to make a commitment to enact this life-saving legislation in their manifesto for May's election"". Alun Davies added: ""The Senedd Commission has already confirmed to me that I did not breach the coronavirus regulations on the consumption of either food or alcohol that were in force at that time."" A spokesman for the Senedd Commission said: ""We are aware of an incident on the Senedd estate last month which may have been contrary to public health regulations in force at the time. ""The Senedd Commission takes the public health regulations in Wales very seriously and is currently investigating the matter in order to establish an accurate account of what took place and to determine whether action may be required.""

Pence has only met once with President Trump since 6 January, when pro-Trump rioters at the US Capitol repeatedly chanted: ""Hang Mike Pence!"" As we reported earlier, he will not attend Trump's farewell ceremony tomorrow morning and will instead be present at the inauguration ceremony for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The vice president and his wife - First Lady Karen Pence - will then fly home to Indiana. It remains unclear whether he intends to run for office again. Reality Check Trump also said in his farewell video, as he has done on many occasions, that his
administration ""built the greatest economy in the history of the world"". The US
economy has certainly done well under Trump prior to the coronavirus
pandemic, but there have been periods under previous administrations when it
did significantly better. In his
first three years in office, Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%.
This was slightly higher than the final three years of the Obama era. However,
there have been many periods when the growth of GDP â the value of goods and
services in the economy â was a lot higher. In 2020 the
economy saw the largest contraction on record because of the effects of the
pandemic. It rebounded by 33% in the third quarter of the year, itself a record
for a quarterly increase, but this did not bring economic activity back to
pre-pandemic levels. Numbers for
the final quarter are yet to be published. Read more. Reality Check President Trump said in his speech that âwe achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americansâ. The African American and Hispanic American unemployment rate hit 5.2% and 4% respectively in August and 2019 - the lowest rates recorded since the US Labor Department started collecting these statistics in the 1970s. The unemployment rate has recently spiked sharply for both groups because of the huge impact of the pandemic on the US economy. And this has disproportionately affected African Americans and Hispanics - their unemployment rates are 3.2% and 2.6% higher respectively than the overall figure. Asian American unemployment is currently 5.9%. It reached a record low of 2.1% in June 2019, but these records only date back to 2003. Read more. Reality Check In his farewell video address, President Trump said: âWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.â That's not right for tax cuts in general - previous ones have been larger. It is right for corporation tax. We investigated this claim in 2018 shortly after Congress passed sweeping tax reform legislation. According to tax specialists, the cuts were big but not the biggest. The Committee for a Responsible Budget looked at the numbers and reported that President Trump's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history, compared to the overall size of the economy. If you adjust the analysis for inflation, President Trump's tax cuts rank fourth overall. However, tax experts also assessed Mr Trump's cut in corporation tax from 35% to 21%. Most said in absolute terms it was the biggest corporate tax cut in history. Read more. Reality Check In President Trumpâs farewell speech he said: âWe proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into placeâ¦ with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.â It was a one of his major pledges in the run-up to the 2016 election. As of 4 January 2021, a total of 452 miles (757km) of barrier has been built since he took office. However, the vast majority of this new wall replaced existing structures on the border. Only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there was none before. Of this 47 miles is whatâs called primary wall, and 33 miles is secondary wall that reinforces the initial barrier. President-elect Joe Biden said he would not build ""another foot"" of the wall. Read more. Donald Trump is already awaiting his second impeachment trial by the Senate once he leaves office. A sideshow to all this is that he now faces possible expulsion from the Screen Actors Guild. SAG-AFTRA, the union which represents working performers, said on Tuesday its national board found Trump had probably violated its rules over his alleged incitement of the Capitol riot. The board has requested his expulsion and the issue will now be heard by the body's disciplinary committee. ""The charges specifically cite Trumpâs role in inciting the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, and in sustaining a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are SAG-AFTRA members,"" the statement said. According to the AP news agency, the former Apprentice star has been a member of the Screen Actors Guild since 1989. He has also made cameo appearances in films and TV series including Home Alone 2. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump, in his 20-minute pre-recorded farewell speech, said his administration did what it came to do and more. One can debate the significance of his accomplishments â whether 400 miles of rebuilt border wall, tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, confirmed judges, trade wars and modest Mideast diplomatic agreements amount to much in the way of substantive achievement. But at least in one way, his boast is certainly true. Trump ran for president in 2016 to shake up the existing political order. He campaigned as an outsider giving voice to those who distrusted the establishment and felt the system no longer worked for them. âI took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because thatâs what you elected me to do,â he said. The unrest and resentment that Trump rode to the White House crested and crashed on the US Capitol two weeks ago, leaving behind wreckage â literal and metaphorical â that will take time and effort to clear. After four years of shattered norms and traditions, of turning expectations of presidential behaviour on their head, Trump leaves US government changed â fundamentally and, perhaps, irreversibly. That, at least, was a promise made and a promise kept.

As we have mentioned, Biden is due to attend an event this evening honouring those who have died as a result of coronavirus and will spend the night at the presidential guest house Blair House. A Catholic, he is expected to attend Mass at the Cathedral of St Matthew the Apostle in Washington DC on Wednesday morning with the four congressional leaders - Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy - before being sworn in as president. ""America is not a timid nation of tame
souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree,"" he said. He adds: ""We are - and must always be - a land of
hope, of light and of glory to all the world."" Here's what else he had to say: On his final full day in office, outgoing president Donald Trump delivered a farewell speech from the White House. Currently locked out of his personal social media accounts, Trump struck a concilatory yet defiant tone in the video released via the government's official social media accounts. ""We did what we came here to do - and so much more,"" he said. ""I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices â because thatâs what you elected me to do."" He warned that ""the greatest danger"" now facing the country was ""a loss of confidence in our national greatness"". The 45th president ran through actions taken by his administration - from ""stand[ing] up to China like never before"" to ""a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East"". He added: ""I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars."" Referring to the riot at the US Capitol on 6 January, he said: ""All Americans were horrified by the assault on the Capitol... It can never be tolerated."" Trump acknowledged that a new administration would take office, but said: ""I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning."" Allow YouTube content?

A seesaw installation at the US-Mexico border wall has won the 2020 Beazley Design of the Year award, which is run by London's Design Museum. The pink seesaws were placed through sections of the wall and allowed people in both countries to play together. They were installed by Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello at the Anapra zone in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. They were only in place for 20 minutes, but video footage of people using them quickly went viral. You can see more pictures of the seesaws here As we mentioned earlier, the death toll from coronavirus in the US has passed 400,000. According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, the country has now reported 400,022 fatalities, and more than 24 million cases. This is more deaths and cases than reported by any other country in the world. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are due to lead an event in Washington later today to honour those killed by Covid-19. The president-elect has pledged to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days in office. The Democrat received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine last month, saying he was getting the jab to show Americans it is ""safe to take"". Donald Trump has been criticised by health experts for his handling of the pandemic. But the White House defended the administration, highlighting Operation Warp Speed, the programme to develop and distribute vaccines. âWe grieve every single life lost to this pandemic, and thanks to the presidentâs leadership, Operation Warp Speed has led to the development of multiple safe and effective vaccines in record time, something many said would never happen,â White House spokesman Judd Deere said, according to AP news agency.  Thousands of troops have been deployed ahead of the inauguration A dozen members of the US National Guard have been removed from security efforts to protect tomorrow's inauguration, according to US media reports. The Associated Press news agency, which initially reported the number, said that all of the members had been found to have links with right-wing groups or to have posted extremist views online. However, a Pentagon spokesman quoted by Reuters news agency said that not all were removed due to ties to extremist groups, while NBC news said that some of the guardsmen were ruled out due to ""'more routine' vetting issues"". Security in Washington DC has been bolstered since the Capitol riot on 6 January, which left five people dead. More than 25,000 members of the National Guards are expected to be involved in tomorrow's ceremony - more than three times the number present during Donald Trump's inauguration. Find out more about how security threats and Covid-19 have changed the ceremonyhere. The US has become the first country to surpass 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths. Security has been ramped up in Washington DC in preparation for an inauguration like no other. Some 25,000 National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced due to the pandemic and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"In Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, residents have prepared their homes and businesses ahead of the heavy rain Emergency services in the north of England are preparing for widespread flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency has warned of a ""volatile situation"" as heavy rain combines with melting snow, while police in South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester declared major incidents. An amber rain warning is in place for Yorkshire, the North West, East Midlands and the east of England. A yellow rain warning was issued for the rest of the country. Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey said the force had declared a major incident to ensure it was ""as prepared as possible"". ""The safety of the public is our number one priority and we're continuing to work alongside partner agencies across the region,"" he said. Flood warning as Wales braced for Storm Christoph A government spokesperson said it had provided additional advice to local agencies to help them manage any evacuations and shelter provision in a Covid-secure way. ""The government has robust plans in place to support any areas affected by extreme weather this winter,"" they added. Sandbags were laid in at-risk areas, with up to 70mm (2.75in) of rain due. In isolated spots, particularly in the northern Peak District and parts of the southern Pennines, 200mm (7.87in) could be possible. Northern Rail said buses were being used instead of trains on services between Bolton and Blackburn due to flooding at Darwen. Some motorists attempted to drive through floodwater on Derby Road in Hathern, Leicestershire In the amber warning area, the Met Office said there was a ""danger to life"" due to fast-flowing or deep floodwater, and told some communities they might be ""cut off"" by flooded roads. It also predicted delays and cancellations to public transport, with the amber warning in place until 12:00 GMT on Thursday. BBC Weather Ros Jones, mayor of Doncaster, said key risk areas had been inspected over the past 36 hours, with the delivery of sandbags continuing on Tuesday. ""I do not want people to panic, but flooding is possible so please be prepared,"" she said. Residents of Fishlake, South Yorkshire, which saw severe flooding hit 160 homes and businesses in November 2019, said they felt much better prepared this time round. Flood warden and parish councillor Peter Trimingham said the arrival of sandbags had been a welcome sight. ""It gives us confidence,"" he said. Residents in Fishlake, near Doncaster, say they are better prepared than when flooding hit in 2019 Mr Trimingham added: ""We're absolutely hoping it doesn't rise to the same level. But, if it does, we're reasonably comfortable we've still got a chance because the Environment Agency have done tremendous work here along with Doncaster Council."" He said new defences had been built and their team of flood wardens had been expanded to 22 people. On Yarlborough Terrace in Bentley, Doncaster, many residents were out of their homes for months after the 2019 floods. Anna Booth, 37, who was forced to live in a caravan on her drive, said residents were worried about it happening again. ""Being in the pandemic doesn't help either. Morale's a bit down but I think we'll all pull together again like last time,"" she said. ""It breaks your heart, it's really sad, but we can't stop the weather."" This video can not be played Storm Christoph hits the UK The Environment Agency issued more than30 flood warnings,external, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, covering parts of Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Merseyside, Staffordshire and Northamptonshire as of 03:00 GMT on Wednesday. There are also more than 150 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, issued across northern England, the Midlands and the east. River levels in the Ouse, which flows through York in North Yorkshire, are high before the arrival of Storm Christoph Catherine Wright, acting executive director for flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, said: ""That rain is falling on very wet ground and so we are very concerned that it's a very volatile situation and we are expecting significant flooding to occur on the back of that weather."" She said the agency would be working with local authorities to help with evacuation efforts should a severe flood warning be issued, adding: ""If you do need to evacuate then that is allowed within the Covid rules."" Work took place on Tuesday morning to increase defences near the River Ouse Discussing the different levels of flood warnings, she said: ""If you receive a flood alert, please pack valuables like medicines and insurance documents in a bag ready to go. ""If you receive a flood warning, please move valuables and precious possessions upstairs and be ready to turn off gas, electricity and water. ""If you receive a severe flood warning, which means you will be evacuated, please listen out and take heed of the advice from the local emergency services."" Sandbags have been used to help defend homes in Fishlake, Doncaster, which suffered devastating floods in November 2019 Barry Greenwood, from the Upper Calder Valley Flood Prevention Group in West Yorkshire, has been ""sick"" with worry. ""I went round after the last [flood], people were there with their heads in their hands, thinking 'what am I going to do now?',"" he said. Flood sirens were sounded in Walsden on Tuesday evening after a flood warning was issued for the area. In atweet,external, Calderdale Council asked residents to put their flood plan into action and move valuables to a safe place. ""River levels across the Upper River Calder have risen and are now approaching levels where we expect properties to flood,"" it warned. Earlier it had said staff were on standby to respond overnight. The amber rain warning is in place until Thursday, with yellow warnings covering most of the UK coming in over the next three days A yellow rain alert is also in place for Wales, Northern Ireland, central and northern England and southern Scotland on Tuesday. This yellow warning extends to the rest of England from Wednesday, with a yellow alert for snow and ice in north east Scotland. Highways England advised drivers to take extra care on motorways and major A roads, while the RAC breakdown service said motorists should only drive if absolutely necessary.

"Coronavirus is a completely new infection in people. Nobody had immunity at the start of the pandemic - and knowing more about immunity is crucial for understanding what happens next. Our immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts. The first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as theinnate immune responseand includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells. But this system is not specific to coronavirus. It will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus. Instead you need theadaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it - and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? This takes time - studies suggestit takes about 10 days,externalto start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop thestrongest immune response,external. If the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future. It's not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response. Understanding of the role of T-cells is still developing, buta recent study foundpeople testing negative for coronavirus antibodies may still have some immunity. For every person testing positive for antibodies, it was found two had T-cells which identify and destroy infected cells. ""They look rather durable and are being made in almost all exposed people,"" said Prof Danny Altmann from Imperial College London. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? The immune system's memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others. Measles is highly memorable - one bout should give lifelong immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter. The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts. But a recent studyled by Public Health England (PHE) shows most people who have had the virus are protected from catching it again for at least five months (the duration of the analysis so far). Some are reinfected, however, and, even if asymptomatic, can then harbour high levels of the virus in their noses and mouths, which can be passed on to others. PHE will continue to monitor the people in this study, who are all healthcare workers, to see how long immunity lasts. Other clues may come from studies involving other coronaviruses. Four produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients couldbe re-infected within a year,external. Research at King's College London,externalalso suggested levels of antibodies that kill coronavirus waned over the three month study. But even if antibodies disappear, then the cells that manufacture them, called B cells, may still be around. B cells for Spanish Flu have beenfound in people 90 years,externalafter that pandemic. If the same is true with Covid, then a second infection would be milder than the first. It is also not understood what happens to T cells in the long term. But T cells against the original Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)have been found 17 years later.,external Immunity could affect vaccine research Maybe. The jury is still out on the field of ""cross-reactivity"" but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection. Laboratory tests show the T cells some people made to fight Sars or common cold coronaviruses can also react against the new coronavirus. How common this is and how much protection it gives is still unknown. Therewere early reports,externalof people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time. But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. PHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. Researchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. Scientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different. Experts say re-infection isn't surprising, but it's likely to be rare, and larger studies are needed to understand why this might happen. This is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization isnervous about countries using immunity passports,externalas a way out of lockdown. The idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms. But while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in Chinashowed 30% had very low levels,externalof these neutralising antibodies. That is why the World Health Organization says ""that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery"". Another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. Everyone's immune system is unique - some may mount more successful defensive responses than others. And people must continue to follow the current guidance as some may become reinfected and pass the virus on to others, PHE says. People who have already had Covid-19 should still have a vaccine when offered one, officials say. Dr Julian Tang, at the University of Leicester, says:""Having the vaccine after recovering from Covid-19 is not an issue... and will likely boost the natural immunity. ""We also see this with the seasonal flu vaccine."" PHE scientists will also monitor the immunity of the participants in itsSiren study,externalwho go on to have vaccines. It matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often. Immunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous. Understanding immunity better could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. If it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how the vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot. And the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. These are all big questions we still lack answers to.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app. The West Suffolk MP said self-isolation was ""perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing"" and urged others to do the same if contacted. In a tweet, Mr Hancock said he would be working from home until Sunday, adding ""we all have a part to play in getting this virus under control"". He contracted coronavirus in March 2020 andsuffered ""mild symptoms"". What are the rules if I'm asked to self-isolate? Inside NHS Test and Trace UK-bound travellers now need negative test for entry Mr Hancock said he learned from the app he had been ""in close contact with somebody who's tested positive"" and so self-isolating was ""how we break the chains of transmission"". ""So you must follow these rules like I'm going to,"" he said. ""I've got to work from home for the next six days, and together, by doing this, by following this, and all the other panoply of rules that we've had to put in place, we can get through this and beat this virus."" Mr Hancock said he was alerted by the app on Monday night, having earlier led a Downing Street press conference alongside NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis and Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins. The NHS app tells a person if they have been in close contact with someone who has later tested positive for coronavirus and tells them to isolate for 10 full days from their last contact. While it is not clear from Mr Hancock's statement if his isolation ends on Sunday or Monday, his period of quarantine suggests he was last in contact with the person who was infected on Wednesday or Thursday.

Downing Street confirmed that Mr Hancock would not receive the vaccine early because he is leading the pandemic response. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The PM and the rest of the cabinet will take the vaccine when it's their turn to do so based on the priority lists that have been published. ""We don't think it's right that the PM or other members of cabinet take the vaccine in place of somebody who is at higher clinical risk."" In March, the health secretary revealed he had tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had confirmed he too had the virus. While the health secretary recovered fairly swiftly, and was able to work from home during his illness,Mr Johnson required hospital treatment.

Self-isolation, which means staying at home and not leaving, is a legal requirement for anybody who has Covid symptoms, has tested positive for the virus, lives with someone who has symptoms, has arrived from abroad or has been contacted by NHS Test and Trace. In December, the self-isolation period required was cut from 14 days to 10 days. Using Bluetooth technology the NHS app makes contact between mobile phoneswhen they are near each other, if an owner of a phone later tests positive for the virus and shares that with the app, alerts are sent to anyone who is deemed to have been a close contact.

"Vaughan Gething insisted the vaccine was not being withheld in Wales Wales' health minister has insisted there is an ""increasing urgency and an increasing pace of delivery"" of vaccinations in the country. Vaughan Gething told BBC 5 live the first minister had ""clarified""remarks made on Mondaythat there was no point rushing to use all available vaccines. Former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb had said Mark Drakeford's comments were ""astonishing"". Mr Gething said on Tuesday the vaccine was not being withheld. He said the challenge was ""having enough infrastructure to deliver the Pfizer jab without wasting it"". ""Less than 1% of that vaccine is not being delivered, that's a very, very high level of efficiency,"" Mr Gething said. ""So we're able to roll out the vaccine in a way that we can deliver more and more of it. This week, we'll deliver even more of our Pfizer vaccine than last week."" He told BBC Radio Wales ""big progress"" was being made in delivering the vaccine and the NHS ""won't let people down"". On Tuesday, Public Health Wales said 161,932 people had received their first vaccine, up 10,195 from the previous day's figures. This is around 5.1% of the Welsh population, roughly the same rate for first doses as the vaccinations in Scotland. Both are still behind England (6.5%) and Northern Ireland (7%) Mr Gething said he could understand why ""an unsettling effect"" may have resulted from the way Mr Drakeford's interview ""was presented"". ""We are going as fast as possible,"" he said. Covid vaccine: Health minister denies jabs being held back Covid in Wales: GPs warned about delay to vaccine batch Covid vaccine: When, where and how will I get my jab? Some swabs used in sampling for Covid-19 have been taken out of circulation after concerns they may have led to false positive test results. NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership is investigating its supply chain to establish how many of the swabs have been distributed and how many are still in stores, the Welsh Government said. In a statement issued on Tuesday evening, Mr Gething said the swabs were used to sample for Covid-19 in hospital settings, at health board-run community testing units and some mobile testing units. ""As soon as this problem was discovered, all microbiology labs and testing centres in Wales were notified so that the affected swabs could be taken out of circulation,"" he said. Mr Gething said the issue was identified on Friday by Public Health Wales (PHW) laboratory staff. ""The issue detected may have affected the accuracy of a small proportion of test results leading to false positives,"" he said. ""However, based on what we currently know, Public Health Wales is confident that this does not affect the overall epidemiological picture."" He said NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership was working with PHW, health boards, the manufacturer of the swabs COPAN and the UK supplier/distributor Thermo Fisher Scientific to ""identify and isolate the swabs potentially affected to prevent their ongoing use"". He said the swabs have been isolated as a ""precaution while further investigations are undertaken"". ""More and more people are being protected - we are at the point where by the end of this week seven in 10 care home residents and staff should be protected, seven in 10 over-80s in Wales should be protected with their first shot. ""We're making really big progress with protecting our staff with their first vaccine. We're doing a really good job at increasing the pace. This is a race against the virus and to recover as much as possible of normal life."" The NHS ""won't let people down"", he said. Mr Gething told the Senedd on Tuesday afternoon that more than ""60,000 Pfizer jabs have been released this week to NHS Wales to make sure they're put into people's arms"". Andrew RT Davies said Mr Gething was trying to clear up the ""mess"" made by the first minister Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies was ""sadly"" not reassured by the health minister. He said Mr Gething was trying to clear up the ""mess"" made by the first minister. ""In some respects the first minister didn't make a mess,"" he said. ""He spoke honestly about what Welsh Government policy is at the moment."" Mr Davies said he did not accept Mr Gething's defence that things were being done as quickly as they could. With ""whole swathes of the economy shut down"", the vaccine was ""no good in the bottle"", he said. ""It surely is a sprint and it is a sprint to get this vaccine out as quickly as possible to offer people protection against the virus,"" Mr Davies added. He said ""we all want to see success"". Rhun ap Iorwerth said the vaccine needed to be delivered ""as quickly as possible"" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said confidence in the system was ""very important"". ""We have this very confusing couple of days where the first minister says categorically they are holding the vaccine back and then, in a few hours, no, we are not holding the vaccine back. ""That kind of lack of clarity breeds confusion."" Vaccine needed to be delivered ""as quickly as possible,"" he added. Given the criticism that the vaccination effort in Wales has been slow off the blocks, it would be a disaster if the Welsh Government ended up missing its official milestone of vaccinating the top four priority groups - including the over 70s - by about Valentine's Day in mid-February. But if the effort continues at the speed it is now, that target won't be reached until mid-March. We have estimated that to reach that target, way more than 20,000 first doses need to be given a day - almost double the current rate. It would be even more than that if the Welsh Government wants to build in some wriggle room to accommodate any potential disruption in supply. But the health minister insists Wales is on track to meet that commitment and the programme will quickly speed up. In an effort to demonstrate what's achievable, Vaughan Gething said he was confident that  70% of over-80s and 70% of care home residents and staff will have been given their first jab by the end of the weekend. During a period of intense scrutiny by the public and his political rivals, this is a pledge that simply has to be delivered. Daniel Altman, a professor of immunology at Imperial College, London, said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was ""unique"" because it had to be stored at -70C. ""These things are challenging but they're not insurmountable,"" he said. ""I watch what's happening in Wales with great interest to see if the numbers really can be caught up. That's the way to beat this and get transmission down."" Bronwen Rashad, of the Wye Valley, Monmouthshire, said her 78 and 81-year-old parents had not yet received vaccine appointments. ""The Welsh Government have done brilliantly with everything else, I don't why with the vaccine it has gone wrong,"" she said. She said the situation was causing ""a lot of anxiety."" ""My dad is really quite stressed about it,"" she said. ""Friends who have parents of a similar age in England have got their vaccine."" Vaccination clinics are being run at Cardiff's All Nations Church ESCAPE WITH HAYLEY PEARCE:Topics that make the group chat go off ELIS JAMES CHEWS OVER THE WEEK'S FOOTBALL:Elis, Danny and Iwan discuss Stoke's seven Welsh players Dr Rebecca Towner, a GP at Whitchurch Road Surgery in Cardiff, said staff were ""really excited to be able to deliver"" the vaccine, with the first clinic held last Friday at the nearby All Nations Church. ""We managed to do the over 90s, which went really well,"" she said. ""We have only got a limited number of vaccines initially. We are hoping the supply will increase."" She said some patients were ""really anxious to get their vaccine as soon as possible"". ""We are having to be fair across the whole of Cardiff. There are 10 huge practices over the north of Cardiff that are part of the cluster we are in. ""We are trying to make sure there isn't any sort of postcode lottery, and that no demographic group is being disadvantaged in any way."" Dr Keith Reid, executive director of public health at Swansea Bay University Health Board, said the rate of vaccinations was increasing in the area. ""The rate-limiting step at the moment is the flow of vaccine,"" he said. ""We are working with pharmaceutical colleagues in Welsh Government to understand how vaccine will be coming down the line towards us so that we can prioritise our clinics against that, and make sure we have people coming in when we have vaccine.""

"A further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means the total number of deaths by that measure is now above 90,000. A total of 4,266,577 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Another 33,355 positive Covid cases have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January. It is the lowest number of daily cases seen since 27 December - before the start of England's third nationwide lockdown. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""Whilst there are some early signs that show our sacrifices are working, we must continue to strictly abide by the measures in place."" She said reducing contact with others and staying at home will lead to ""a fall in the number of infections over time"". Covid antibodies in 1 in 10 people in December Health secretary self-isolating after Covid alert The figures come as new estimates from the Office for National Statistics showabout one in 10 people across the UK tested positive for Covid-19 antibodiesin December - roughly double the October figure. The rising number of deaths was to be expected, sadly, after the surge in cases during December. And it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even higher than this. Today's numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays in registering deaths over the weekend tends to lead to higher figures being reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day. To put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half of that. But there are two rays of hope in the daily update. Firstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 for a third day in a row. Just two weeks ago we saw a few days above 60,000. That means in the coming weeks we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths. The number of vaccinations also continues to rise. It seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. But each increase at least takes us one step closer to getting on top of the virus. Meanwhile, NHS England said 400 military personnel were now assisting in hospitals in London and the Midlands, as wards face ""unprecedented pressure"". On Monday, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said it would be ""some time"" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals.

Tuesday's figure brings the total number of deaths recorded during the pandemic in the UK to 91,470. These government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, butthere are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths. Another method is to count all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate. That figure has now officially reached 95,829, although that is only measured up to 8 January.

"A refusal to accept cash is ""creeping into the wider UK economy"", an expert has said, after a survey suggested coronavirus had hastened a shift towards a cashless society. Consumer group Which? said that 34% of people asked said they had been unable to pay with cash at least once since March when trying to buy something. Grocery stores, pubs and restaurants were most likely to refuse. Natalie Ceeney, who wrote a report on the issue, called for ministers to act. ""The figures show that it's not simply the odd coffee shop going cashless, but this is creeping into the wider economy,"" said Ms Ceeney, who wrote theAccess to Cash Review,external. ""We can't just blame individual businesses - many are going cashless because they can't easily bank cash takings because their local branch is closed or some distance away. The government needs to urgently legislate to protect the viability of cash - as it promised to do so last year. Time is running out."" Goodbye ATMs. How local shops offer access to cash Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash' Which? said the lack of cash access was a problem for those who relied on notes and coins - such as people with certain health conditions or without computer access.

Money editor, said: ""We have repeatedly warned about the consequences that coronavirus will have on what was an already fragile cash system, but nowhere near enough action has been taken by the government or the regulator to understand the scale of this issue."" The Treasury has proposed giving the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, control of overseeing future access to cash and has thrown its weight behind the idea of cashback in shops, without the requirement to buy anything. David Fagleman, director at financial consultancy Enryo, said: ""Our own research shows that despite a decline in use for day-to-day purchases, nearly three-quarters of people think the move to a cashless society is happening too fast and risks leaving some people, particularly the vulnerable, behind.""

"In Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, residents have prepared their homes and businesses ahead of the heavy rain Emergency services in the north of England are preparing for widespread flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency has warned of a ""volatile situation"" as heavy rain combines with melting snow, while police in South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester declared major incidents. An amber rain warning is in place for Yorkshire, the North West, East Midlands and the east of England. A yellow rain warning was issued for the rest of the country. Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey said the force had declared a major incident to ensure it was ""as prepared as possible"". ""The safety of the public is our number one priority and we're continuing to work alongside partner agencies across the region,"" he said. Flood warning as Wales braced for Storm Christoph A government spokesperson said it had provided additional advice to local agencies to help them manage any evacuations and shelter provision in a Covid-secure way. ""The government has robust plans in place to support any areas affected by extreme weather this winter,"" they added. Sandbags were laid in at-risk areas, with up to 70mm (2.75in) of rain due. In isolated spots, particularly in the northern Peak District and parts of the southern Pennines, 200mm (7.87in) could be possible. Northern Rail said buses were being used instead of trains on services between Bolton and Blackburn due to flooding at Darwen. Some motorists attempted to drive through floodwater on Derby Road in Hathern, Leicestershire In the amber warning area, the Met Office said there was a ""danger to life"" due to fast-flowing or deep floodwater, and told some communities they might be ""cut off"" by flooded roads. It also predicted delays and cancellations to public transport, with the amber warning in place until 12:00 GMT on Thursday. BBC Weather Ros Jones, mayor of Doncaster, said key risk areas had been inspected over the past 36 hours, with the delivery of sandbags continuing on Tuesday. ""I do not want people to panic, but flooding is possible so please be prepared,"" she said. Residents of Fishlake, South Yorkshire, which saw severe flooding hit 160 homes and businesses in November 2019, said they felt much better prepared this time round. Flood warden and parish councillor Peter Trimingham said the arrival of sandbags had been a welcome sight. ""It gives us confidence,"" he said. Residents in Fishlake, near Doncaster, say they are better prepared than when flooding hit in 2019 Mr Trimingham added: ""We're absolutely hoping it doesn't rise to the same level. But, if it does, we're reasonably comfortable we've still got a chance because the Environment Agency have done tremendous work here along with Doncaster Council."" He said new defences had been built and their team of flood wardens had been expanded to 22 people. On Yarlborough Terrace in Bentley, Doncaster, many residents were out of their homes for months after the 2019 floods. Anna Booth, 37, who was forced to live in a caravan on her drive, said residents were worried about it happening again. ""Being in the pandemic doesn't help either. Morale's a bit down but I think we'll all pull together again like last time,"" she said. ""It breaks your heart, it's really sad, but we can't stop the weather."" This video can not be played Storm Christoph hits the UK The Environment Agency issued more than30 flood warnings,external, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, covering parts of Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Merseyside, Staffordshire and Northamptonshire as of 03:00 GMT on Wednesday. There are also more than 150 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, issued across northern England, the Midlands and the east. River levels in the Ouse, which flows through York in North Yorkshire, are high before the arrival of Storm Christoph Catherine Wright, acting executive director for flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, said: ""That rain is falling on very wet ground and so we are very concerned that it's a very volatile situation and we are expecting significant flooding to occur on the back of that weather."" She said the agency would be working with local authorities to help with evacuation efforts should a severe flood warning be issued, adding: ""If you do need to evacuate then that is allowed within the Covid rules."" Work took place on Tuesday morning to increase defences near the River Ouse Discussing the different levels of flood warnings, she said: ""If you receive a flood alert, please pack valuables like medicines and insurance documents in a bag ready to go. ""If you receive a flood warning, please move valuables and precious possessions upstairs and be ready to turn off gas, electricity and water. ""If you receive a severe flood warning, which means you will be evacuated, please listen out and take heed of the advice from the local emergency services."" Sandbags have been used to help defend homes in Fishlake, Doncaster, which suffered devastating floods in November 2019 Barry Greenwood, from the Upper Calder Valley Flood Prevention Group in West Yorkshire, has been ""sick"" with worry. ""I went round after the last [flood], people were there with their heads in their hands, thinking 'what am I going to do now?',"" he said. Flood sirens were sounded in Walsden on Tuesday evening after a flood warning was issued for the area. In atweet,external, Calderdale Council asked residents to put their flood plan into action and move valuables to a safe place. ""River levels across the Upper River Calder have risen and are now approaching levels where we expect properties to flood,"" it warned. Earlier it had said staff were on standby to respond overnight. The amber rain warning is in place until Thursday, with yellow warnings covering most of the UK coming in over the next three days A yellow rain alert is also in place for Wales, Northern Ireland, central and northern England and southern Scotland on Tuesday. This yellow warning extends to the rest of England from Wednesday, with a yellow alert for snow and ice in north east Scotland. Highways England advised drivers to take extra care on motorways and major A roads, while the RAC breakdown service said motorists should only drive if absolutely necessary.

The NHS app tells a person if they have been in close contact with someone who has later tested positive for coronavirus and tells them to isolate for 10 full days from their last contact. While it is not clear from Mr Hancock's statement if his isolation ends on Sunday or Monday, his period of quarantine suggests he was last in contact with the person who was infected on Wednesday or Thursday.

Downing Street confirmed that Mr Hancock would not receive the vaccine early because he is leading the pandemic response. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The PM and the rest of the cabinet will take the vaccine when it's their turn to do so based on the priority lists that have been published. ""We don't think it's right that the PM or other members of cabinet take the vaccine in place of somebody who is at higher clinical risk."" In March, the health secretary revealed he had tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had confirmed he too had the virus. While the health secretary recovered fairly swiftly, and was able to work from home during his illness,Mr Johnson required hospital treatment.

Self-isolation, which means staying at home and not leaving, is a legal requirement for anybody who has Covid symptoms, has tested positive for the virus, lives with someone who has symptoms, has arrived from abroad or has been contacted by NHS Test and Trace. In December, the self-isolation period required was cut from 14 days to 10 days. Using Bluetooth technology the NHS app makes contact between mobile phoneswhen they are near each other, if an owner of a phone later tests positive for the virus and shares that with the app, alerts are sent to anyone who is deemed to have been a close contact.

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

"Dr Arpan Mehta led the research at Edinburgh University's Euan MacDonald Centre Scientists are a step closer to being able to reverse the damage caused by motor neurone disease (MND). University of Edinburgh experts have found a problem with MND patients' nerve cells which could be repaired by repurposing drugs approved for other diseases. The study,externalhas been welcomed by charities including the foundation set up by Scots rugby legend Doddie Weir. My Name'5 Doddie foundation described it as ""a very exciting breakthrough"". More than 1,500 people are diagnosed with the degenerative condition in the UK every year. There is no known cure and more than half die within two years of diagnosis. MND: The search for new treatments Doddie Weir joins 'biggest ever' MND drug trial Lockdown with MND and a new baby but I feel great The research found that the damage to nerve cells caused by MND could be repaired by improving the energy levels in mitochondria - the power supply to the motor neurons. They discovered in human stem cell models of MND, the axon - the long part of the motor neuron cell that connects to the muscle - was shorter than in healthy cells. And the movement of the mitochondria, which travel up and down the axons, was impaired The scientists showed that this was caused by a defective energy supply from the mitochondria and that by boosting the mitochondria, the axon reverted back to normal. Dr Arpan Mehta, who led the study at Euan MacDonald Centre for MND research said: ""The importance of the axon in motor nerve cells cannot be overstated. ""Our data provides hope that by restoring the cell's energy source we can protect the axons and their connection to muscle from degeneration. ""Work is already under way to identify existing licensed drugs that can boost the mitochondria and repair the motor neurons. This will then pave the way to test them in clinical trials."" The research centre was established by Euan MacDonald, who was 29 years old when he was diagnosed with MND in 2003 Craig Stockton, the chief executive of MND Scotland, said the ""exciting"" results of the research were another piece of the puzzle to finding an effective treatment for the degenerative condition. ""We look forward to seeing if these positive results can be replicated for patients,"" he said. ""Once researchers have identified a drug they believe could have the desired effect, this treatment could then be fast-tracked for human trials using the pioneering MND-SMART clinical trial platform - into which MND Scotland has invested Â£1.5m. ""Researchers, clinicians, charities and supporters are all working hard to take us closer to finding a cure and by joining together we'll get to that day even sooner."" The researchers used stem cells taken from people with the C9orf72 gene mutation that causes both MND and frontotemporal dementia. They used the stem cells to generate motor neuron cells in the lab. The study also used human post-mortem spinal cord tissue from people with MND. Although the research focused on the people with the commonest genetic cause of MND, the researchers said they were hopeful the results would also apply to other forms of the disease. The results of the study are now being used to look for existing drugs that boost mitochondrial function. The study was funded by the Medical Research Council, Motor Neurone Disease Association, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, UK Dementia Research Institute and Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.

"HSBC is to close 82 branches in the UK between April and September this year, claiming customers are turning to digital banking. The company will have 511 branches across the country following the closure programme. Managers said they did not expect to make any redundancies, with staff moved to nearby branches instead. Coronavirus and changing customer habits have altered the way we bank, but there are concerns over closures. Campaigners say that local branches provide a lifeline for those who need access to cash and face-to-face services, and allow small businesses to bank without too much disruption to their own trade. HSBC said all but one of the branches earmarked for closure were within one mile of a Post Office, where these day-to-day  transactions could be carried out. It said - even stripping out the effects of the pandemic - the number of customers using branches had fallen by a third in the past five years, and 90% of all customer contact was over the phone, internet or smartphone, in addition to contacts on social media. Jackie Uhi, HSBC UK's head of network, said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has emphasised the need for the changes that we are making. ""It hasn't pushed us in a different direction but reinforces the things that we were focusing on before and has crystallised our thinking. This is a strategic direction that we need to take to have a branch network fit for the future."" This would include changing some branches to concentrate on cash access, as well as the use of ""pop-up"" branches in some areas by the end of the year. It means some remaining branches will offer fewer services.

"Protests against China's alleged abuse of the Muslim Uighur community The government is facing a rebellion over the Trade Bill, and opposition proposals to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. Rebel Tory MPs want to allow Parliament to debate ending trade deals with countries responsible for genocide. The government says trade policy should not be set by the courts. But some MPs think the proposal would be a good way of targeting China and its treatment of the Uighur people. On Tuesday, America's top diplomat Mike Pompeo, in his last day in the role, said the US had determined that China's persecution of the Muslim group and other minorities in Xinjiang province represented genocide and crimes against humanity under international law. The UK has repeatedly condemned the actions of the Chinese authorities but stopped short of describing them as genocide - saying only international courts should determine this. Uighur model sends rare video from Chinese detention Will the UK refuse trade deals over human rights? And ministers also argue that trade deals are matters for governments, not the courts, to decide upon. The MPs' amendment to the Trade Bill is a watered-down version of an earlier proposal from the House of Lords, which would force the government to withdraw from any free trade agreement with any country found guilty of genocide by the High Court of England and Wales. The new proposal is signed by 10 Conservative MPs, one of whom described their amendment as ""tidier"" than the Lords version and designed to attract more support. Speaking in the Commons, Sir Edward Leigh asked ""is there any way we can acknowledge that genocide is taking place in a discussion on a trade deal"". In response, International Trade minister Greg Hands said ministers were prepared to have further discussions but not within the scope of the current legislation. He told MPs the government was ""answerable to Parliament, not the courts"" and the Lords version would have led to an ""unacceptable erosion"" of its authority. The UK, he added, had ""no plans"" to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with China due to concerns about its human rights record, particularlyits persecution of the Muslim Uighurcommunity. Nusrat Ghani urged ministers to consider the ""compromise"" proposal, which she said recognised the ""separation of powers"" between the executive, Parliament and the courts. The Conservative ex-minister said the UK should ""never let economic concerns trump ethical ones by dealing with genocidal states"". ""Why would we want to use our newfound freedom to trade with states that commit and profit from genocide? Britain is better than that."" Speaking to Politics Live, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it is currently ""impossible"" for international courts to rule on whether there has been genocide, as other countries can block hearings in the UN. He argued it is therefore important to allow British courts to make the judgement. The MP insisted he is not ""anti-China"" but said the Chinese government need to be ""reasonable and behave in a way that is acceptable"" if it wanted to be part of global trading organisations. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour would be supporting the new amendment arguing that the government ""does not consider human rights abuses enough before signing up to trade deals"". This is an interesting story in its own right because of the issues involved but it's also a neat metaphor for Brexit. The government has taken back control of trade policy from the EU but is already having to share it with the House of Lords, Tory MPs and potentially with the High Court. During the passage of the Trade Bill, the government also had to beef up the powers of the Trade and Agriculture Commission - an independent body of experts - in response to lobbying from farmers who were worried about the dilution of food standards. Soon trade disputes with other countries will partly be overseen by the new Trade Remedies Authority, another organisation that reports to ministers but is independent of them. And of course, everything has to be compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, anyway. The government has control of trade. It's just not total.

He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

Pence has only met once with President Trump since 6 January, when pro-Trump rioters at the US Capitol repeatedly chanted: ""Hang Mike Pence!"" As we reported earlier, he will not attend Trump's farewell ceremony tomorrow morning and will instead be present at the inauguration ceremony for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The vice president and his wife - First Lady Karen Pence - will then fly home to Indiana. It remains unclear whether he intends to run for office again. Reality Check Trump also said in his farewell video, as he has done on many occasions, that his
administration ""built the greatest economy in the history of the world"". The US
economy has certainly done well under Trump prior to the coronavirus
pandemic, but there have been periods under previous administrations when it
did significantly better. In his
first three years in office, Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%.
This was slightly higher than the final three years of the Obama era. However,
there have been many periods when the growth of GDP â the value of goods and
services in the economy â was a lot higher. In 2020 the
economy saw the largest contraction on record because of the effects of the
pandemic. It rebounded by 33% in the third quarter of the year, itself a record
for a quarterly increase, but this did not bring economic activity back to
pre-pandemic levels. Numbers for
the final quarter are yet to be published. Read more. Reality Check President Trump said in his speech that âwe achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americansâ. The African American and Hispanic American unemployment rate hit 5.2% and 4% respectively in August and 2019 - the lowest rates recorded since the US Labor Department started collecting these statistics in the 1970s. The unemployment rate has recently spiked sharply for both groups because of the huge impact of the pandemic on the US economy. And this has disproportionately affected African Americans and Hispanics - their unemployment rates are 3.2% and 2.6% higher respectively than the overall figure. Asian American unemployment is currently 5.9%. It reached a record low of 2.1% in June 2019, but these records only date back to 2003. Read more. Reality Check In his farewell video address, President Trump said: âWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.â That's not right for tax cuts in general - previous ones have been larger. It is right for corporation tax. We investigated this claim in 2018 shortly after Congress passed sweeping tax reform legislation. According to tax specialists, the cuts were big but not the biggest. The Committee for a Responsible Budget looked at the numbers and reported that President Trump's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history, compared to the overall size of the economy. If you adjust the analysis for inflation, President Trump's tax cuts rank fourth overall. However, tax experts also assessed Mr Trump's cut in corporation tax from 35% to 21%. Most said in absolute terms it was the biggest corporate tax cut in history. Read more. Reality Check In President Trumpâs farewell speech he said: âWe proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into placeâ¦ with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.â It was a one of his major pledges in the run-up to the 2016 election. As of 4 January 2021, a total of 452 miles (757km) of barrier has been built since he took office. However, the vast majority of this new wall replaced existing structures on the border. Only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there was none before. Of this 47 miles is whatâs called primary wall, and 33 miles is secondary wall that reinforces the initial barrier. President-elect Joe Biden said he would not build ""another foot"" of the wall. Read more. Donald Trump is already awaiting his second impeachment trial by the Senate once he leaves office. A sideshow to all this is that he now faces possible expulsion from the Screen Actors Guild. SAG-AFTRA, the union which represents working performers, said on Tuesday its national board found Trump had probably violated its rules over his alleged incitement of the Capitol riot. The board has requested his expulsion and the issue will now be heard by the body's disciplinary committee. ""The charges specifically cite Trumpâs role in inciting the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, and in sustaining a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are SAG-AFTRA members,"" the statement said. According to the AP news agency, the former Apprentice star has been a member of the Screen Actors Guild since 1989. He has also made cameo appearances in films and TV series including Home Alone 2. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump, in his 20-minute pre-recorded farewell speech, said his administration did what it came to do and more. One can debate the significance of his accomplishments â whether 400 miles of rebuilt border wall, tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, confirmed judges, trade wars and modest Mideast diplomatic agreements amount to much in the way of substantive achievement. But at least in one way, his boast is certainly true. Trump ran for president in 2016 to shake up the existing political order. He campaigned as an outsider giving voice to those who distrusted the establishment and felt the system no longer worked for them. âI took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because thatâs what you elected me to do,â he said. The unrest and resentment that Trump rode to the White House crested and crashed on the US Capitol two weeks ago, leaving behind wreckage â literal and metaphorical â that will take time and effort to clear. After four years of shattered norms and traditions, of turning expectations of presidential behaviour on their head, Trump leaves US government changed â fundamentally and, perhaps, irreversibly. That, at least, was a promise made and a promise kept. This video can not be played Trump farewell: 'We did what we came here to do' Joe Biden has landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, after bidding farewell to his home state of Delaware.

A Catholic, he is expected to attend Mass at the Cathedral of St Matthew the Apostle in Washington DC on Wednesday morning with the four congressional leaders - Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy - before being sworn in as president. ""America is not a timid nation of tame
souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree,"" he said. He adds: ""We are - and must always be - a land of
hope, of light and of glory to all the world."" Here's what else he had to say: On his final full day in office, outgoing president Donald Trump delivered a farewell speech from the White House. Currently locked out of his personal social media accounts, Trump struck a concilatory yet defiant tone in the video released via the government's official social media accounts. ""We did what we came here to do - and so much more,"" he said. ""I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices â because thatâs what you elected me to do."" He warned that ""the greatest danger"" now facing the country was ""a loss of confidence in our national greatness"". The 45th president ran through actions taken by his administration - from ""stand[ing] up to China like never before"" to ""a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East"". He added: ""I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars."" Referring to the riot at the US Capitol on 6 January, he said: ""All Americans were horrified by the assault on the Capitol... It can never be tolerated."" Trump acknowledged that a new administration would take office, but said: ""I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning."" Allow YouTube content?

A seesaw installation at the US-Mexico border wall has won the 2020 Beazley Design of the Year award, which is run by London's Design Museum. The pink seesaws were placed through sections of the wall and allowed people in both countries to play together. They were installed by Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello at the Anapra zone in Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. They were only in place for 20 minutes, but video footage of people using them quickly went viral. You can see more pictures of the seesaws here As we mentioned earlier, the death toll from coronavirus in the US has passed 400,000. According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, the country has now reported 400,022 fatalities, and more than 24 million cases. This is more deaths and cases than reported by any other country in the world. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are due to lead an event in Washington later today to honour those killed by Covid-19. The president-elect has pledged to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days in office. The Democrat received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine last month, saying he was getting the jab to show Americans it is ""safe to take"". Donald Trump has been criticised by health experts for his handling of the pandemic. But the White House defended the administration, highlighting Operation Warp Speed, the programme to develop and distribute vaccines. âWe grieve every single life lost to this pandemic, and thanks to the presidentâs leadership, Operation Warp Speed has led to the development of multiple safe and effective vaccines in record time, something many said would never happen,â White House spokesman Judd Deere said, according to AP news agency.  Thousands of troops have been deployed ahead of the inauguration A dozen members of the US National Guard have been removed from security efforts to protect tomorrow's inauguration, according to US media reports. The Associated Press news agency, which initially reported the number, said that all of the members had been found to have links with right-wing groups or to have posted extremist views online. However, a Pentagon spokesman quoted by Reuters news agency said that not all were removed due to ties to extremist groups, while NBC news said that some of the guardsmen were ruled out due to ""'more routine' vetting issues"". Security in Washington DC has been bolstered since the Capitol riot on 6 January, which left five people dead. More than 25,000 members of the National Guards are expected to be involved in tomorrow's ceremony - more than three times the number present during Donald Trump's inauguration. Find out more about how security threats and Covid-19 have changed the ceremonyhere. The US has become the first country to surpass 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths. Security has been ramped up in Washington DC in preparation for an inauguration like no other. Some 25,000 National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead.

"Nicola Sturgeon is to announce later whether Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown is to continue past the end of January. The first minister said Tuesday's statement at Holyrood would concern the ""duration"" of restrictions rather than whether any new ones would be imposed. Minsters will also decide at a cabinet meeting whether schools will be allowed to re-open in full from 1 February. Education Secretary John Swinney has suggested it would be a ""tall order"" for pupils to return to classrooms. Ms Sturgeon said on Monday that she did not want to ""raise parents' expectations"", saying transmission of the virus ""is still higher than we would want it to be"". Covid in Scotland: FM gives update on lockdown The whole Scottish mainland and several islands have been in a strict lockdown since early January, with a ""stay at home"" message in force. This was initially due to run until February, but this will be reviewed by ministers on Tuesday morning with a view to having the restrictions last longer. While Ms Sturgeon has warned that the government would consider further measures if necessary, she said ""it is the duration rather than the content of restrictions that we will be looking at"" on Tuesday. The outcome of this review will then be announced to MSPs in a statement at Holyrood in the afternoon. Nicola Sturgeon will announce the result of the latest review in a Holyrood statement The review will also cover the situation in schools, with the majority learning remotely from home and only some children of key workers and vulnerable pupils being allowed into school buildings. On Monday, the first minister said she did not want to ""raise expectations"" about classes returning to normal, but added that she was ""not going to make any assumptions"" ahead of the cabinet meeting. She said: ""I am not going to raise parents' expectations, you can see from the numbers we are seeing some positive signs in the numbers that lockdown is starting to stabilise things and tip them into decline, but transmission is still higher than we would want it to be. ""We want to get schools back as quickly as we possibly can, it is not in the interests of kids to be out of school for any longer than is absolutely necessary, but community transmission has always been a key factor in these decisions."" This echoed comments from Mr Swinney, who had previously said it would be ""a tall order"" for schools to fully re-open with ""the virus still at a very high level in general within society"". I am expecting continuity rather than change from today's announcement on coronavirus restrictions. The continuation of the current lockdown and presumably the extension of remote learning for most school pupils into the February break at least. Both decisions are likely to be reviewed again next month. But it's not clear if the first minister will feel able to suggest a target date for restrictions to ease. Cabinet will also be giving special attention to theserious Covid outbreak on Barraand considering if the level three restrictions that apply in the Western Isles remain appropriate. While there are signs the pace at which the current wave of coronavirus is spreading is starting to slow, evidence of much greater suppression will be required before the stay at home lockdown in place across mainland Scotland is lifted. The review comes less than a week afterrestrictions in Scotland were tightened, with some click and collect services ordered to close and outdoor alcohol consumption banned. The entire Scottish mainland has been in the top level of restrictions - level four - since Boxing Day, with level three measures in place in Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and some islands in Argyll and Bute and the Highlands. Scots are subject to a legal requirement not to leave home for anything other than essential purposes, such as shopping for essentials, exercise and caring responsibilities. The number of new cases reported each day on average has begun to fall, but the number of people in hospital with the virus continues to rise and is now ""significantly"" above that seen in the first wave in 2020. Ms Sturgeon said the ""position overall is very precarious, very concerning in terms of the level of transmission"", but said there were ""some early signs to be optimistic that measures are having an effect"". The first minister will take questions from opposition leaders following her statement. The Scottish Conservatives have voiced concerns that Covid-19 vaccines are not being rolled out quickly enough, saying the Scottish government are ""trailing their own targets"". Statistics released on Monday showed that Scotland has vaccinated 264,991 people so far - 6% of its adult population. This is lower than the figure for England, where 8% of the adult population - 3,520,056 people - have been vaccinated, and Northern Ireland, which has the highest vaccination rate in the UK at 8.7%. Wales has a similar figure to Scotland at 6%. England has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland. However, Ms Sturgeon has insisted that all parts of the UK are ""working to the same targets"" to vaccinate priority groups, and said her government is ""on track"" to hit them subject to supplies arriving. This would see care home residents, healthcare staff and all over-80s get a first dose by the start of February, with over-70s and those deemed ""extremely vulnerable"" by mid-February and all over-65s by the beginning of March. By that time the government aims to be vaccinating up to 400,000 people a week on average, with all priority groups getting a first jab by early May and the rest of the adult population in line thereafter.

"About 16,000 vaccinations are currently being carried out a day in Scotland Opposition parties have voiced concerns about vaccine supplies after ""frustrated"" GPs said they were still waiting for deliveries. At Holyrood on Tuesday, the first minister was pressed on why the rollout was going ""so slowly"" and on whether there was a problem with distribution. Dr Andrew Buist, of BMA Scotland, told the BBC that patients were getting anxious and practices could not plan. Nicola Sturgeon said there were ongoing challenges but targets would be met. Dr Buist claimed that as of Monday, the Scottish government had taken receipt of more than 700,000 vaccines - but only used 264,991. He said: ""The work force is there and that's why it's so incredibly frustrating when the patients want the vaccine, we're very keen to give it to our patients but we just don't have the vaccine in our fridge."" This video can not be played Dr Andrew Buist told the BBC on Sunday that the delivery of the Covid vaccine to GP practices across Scotland had so far been inconsistent Dr Buist spoke also about""inconsistencies"" across the GP network, saying some practices had supplies but others had none. The government said it was listening to Dr Buist's concerns and every GP in Scotland would receive, in writing, more detail about the ""mechanism of supply, ordering and delivery, with suggested solutions"". Opposition party members questioned Ms Sturgeon about the vaccination programme after she had delivered a statement to parliament sayinglockdown would continue until ""at least"" mid-February. Scottish Conservatives MSP Ruth Davidson said anxious constituents feared being ""left behind"" and called for an explanation on why over 400,000 vaccines had ""yet to reach patients"". The first minister said the January target of delivering 100,000 vaccines per week had been ""exceeded"". She also reiterated that she had not been able to discuss supply figures because the UK government had ""thrown a hissy fit"" after plans werepublished then removed from the Scottish government website. Vaccine plan removed from government website Ms Sturgeon told the chamber: ""They don't want us to be open about supply for reasons of commercial confidentiality and while I don't necessarily agree with the reasoning behind that, we have agreed with their request. ""We vaccinate as quickly as we possibly can and that will continue to be the case as we go through the different groups in our vaccination programme."" Ms Sturgeon said the following targets would be met: Start of February: Vaccine offered to all over 80s, care home residents, care home staff, frontline health and care workers Mid February: All over 70s and those clinically extremely vulnerable Start of March: All over 65s Early May: All on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority list, including over 50s and younger people with underlying health conditions Nicola Sturgeon was questioned about vaccine supply after her statement to parliament about the lockdown Interim Scottish Labour leader Jackie Baillie also asked when the 400,000 remaining vaccines would be distributed to GPs, reiterating that supply had been ""patchy"". Ms Sturgeon replied that as per earlier JCVI advice, the Scottish government had been holding back 50% of doses in order to complete the second round of vaccinations within three weeks. The UK's vaccination strategy changed in recent weeks,leaving a 12-week gapbetween doses. Ms Sturgeon added: ""They are now flowing through the system now advice has changed."" Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he had heard from GPs in his own constituency of Fife who had been forced to cancel vaccine appointments because they had run out of injections. He pressed the first minister on whether there was a problem with Scotland's distribution system. All governments have ""big challenges"" in terms of vaccine allocation because of supply flow, responded Ms Sturgeon. She added: ""I don't underestimate ongoing challenges but I don't think it would be right to say the programme is not progressing well."" On Monday Ms Sturgeon said vaccinating over-80s in the community was now picking up pace, with the target being to have them all given the first dose by 5 February. However, Dr Buist questioned whether Scotland would receive enough supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine to meet the target of offering vaccines to all over 70s and 80s by the middle of February. Instead, he proposed that GPs should be allowed to use the Pfizer vaccine - which has to be stored in industrial freezers and has limits on the number of times it can be transported. Has Scotland been slower to vaccinate over-80s? 'Patchy supply' hampering vaccine rollout He said: ""Once it's defrosted it can be used over five days. They do come in boxes of 975 doses and I am also aware that GPs in NHS Highland have already been using it. ""It is quite possible to use Pfizer in practice. Of course we absolutely want to minimise any wastage but with good planning we can do that."" National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch told the BBC there was no ""medical or clinical"" reason GPs could not use the Pfizer jab, but it would be ""much harder logistically"". ""The potential would be that we would waste a lot - because they don't have industrial freezers with which to store it,"" he said. ""Once it is defrosted you have to use it fast. And you can't transport it long distances - you can only transport it two six hours journeys. We don't want to send them 195 vials and they use four."" A Scottish government spokesman said the country's chief pharmaceutical officer had contacted Dr Buist to discuss with him the ongoing concerns. In addition all GPs would be receiving a letter explaining in more detail ""the mechanism of supply, ordering and delivery, with suggested solutions at local board level that can also assist them"". The spokesman added: ""GPs have a significant role to play in delivering the vaccine - and we thank them for their hard work. ""We are in regular contact with boards to ensure GPs have the most up to date information on when supply is available and what our expectations are for them, providing as much detail as we can while rightly allowing our teams to focus on the task of delivering the biggest vaccination programme ever seen in Scotland. ""We too want to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible and are continually working hard to see if distribution can be made faster in any respect.""

"Nicola Sturgeon says although there are ""cautious grounds for optimism"" on case numbers, lockdown measures will remain in place People in mainland Scotland and some islands - which now includes Barra and Vatersay - will live under the strictest level four rules Since December 26 only essential shops have been allowed to open; all hospitality is closed and gyms and hairdressers are also shut All Scottish schools had been closed to most pupils and that will remain the case until at least mid-February There have been a further 1,165 new positive cases and 71 newly reported deaths. Positive hospital patient numbers climb to 1,989 and of those people150 are in ICU The Covid-19 vaccination programme is under way and 284,582 people have received the first of two injections. Of those men and women, 3,886 have had their second jab Opposition parties voice their concerns in parliament about the speed of the vaccination programme They quote Dr Andrew Buist, of BMA Scotland, who told the BBC patients are getting anxious and GP practices are struggling to plan because of ""bumpy"" vaccine supply Ms Sturgeon says that despite different approaches by the four nations, Scotland will meet its mid-February target BBC Scotland News  That's all from us here on the live page today. Please take care and stay safe.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) believes the lockdown extension was ""understandable"" but its Scotland leader says the economic damage it will cause ""cannot be
underestimated"".   âThe Scottish government must now redouble efforts to get business support to the firms that need it as quickly as possible. Similarly, the UK government must look at extending the successful Job Retention Scheme to the end of June to protect jobs and livelihoods at risk. And both governments must work together on fuelling the much-needed economic recovery.â Tracy Black, CBI Scotland director News of the extended lockdown has not been welcomed by business leaders. Last month, the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) estimated that each week of lockdown meant non-essential stores missing out on Â£135m of lost sales. Since then, garden centres and homeware shops have been compelled to close too, and the government has placed curbs on retailersâ click and collect services. The SRC says today's extension is a further blow to non-food stores who have already borne
a lot during the pandemic. It said Scottish
stores were set to miss out on almost Â£950m of lost revenues during the
current lockdown period. The extended lockdown will serve to make it harder for some retailers to emerge from this crisis. Even when we do eventually emerge from enforced hibernation the stark reality is that shops will be unable to trade at capacity due to physical distancing restrictions and caps on the number of customers in stores. This means that Aprilâs abrupt âreverse cliff edgeâ - which is set to see a 100% re-instatement of business rates â is simply not sustainable.

Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie is also focused on the vaccine. He says GP practices in Fife have cancelled vaccine appointments because there have run out of the vaccine. He asks the first minister if she is going to admit she has a problem with distribution. Ms Sturgeon replies with a short ""No"". She says there is a challenge in drawing down the allocation of vaccines and transporting them to Scotland for further distribution. She repeats that she is not allowed to discuss the numbers of vaccines available and says there is also a restriction with the Pfizer vaccine. She says the Scottish government is prioritising the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for GP surgeries while the Pfizer product was used in care homes. She adds that it would be wrong to say the programme was not progressing well and that pace would continue to increase. Patrick Harvie says his party has been clear that full reopening of schools can only happen when it is safe to do so. The Scottish Green Party co-leader adds that school staff, pupils and parents want to know what additional measures the government is putting in place to ensure safety. He says supported isolation remains a priority on which both governments must improve their performance. The first minister replies that the most important thing to get schools back safely is to supress the levels of community transmission. All the important mitigation steps must be in place, she adds. The first minister says lateral flow testing in schools is being looked at, as is PCR testing. She adds that the self-isolating support grant is being looked at in terms of widening access to it.  Labour interim leader Jackie Baillie is next up and welcomes the use of the Army to help the vaccination rollout. She asks if the first minister is confident of meeting vaccination targets. She also asks about the ""patchy"" distribution among GP surgeries and asks for a timescale on the GP supply. Ms Sturgeon says she is confident targets will be met by the start of February. She also makes the point that the JCVI initially advised the Scottish government to hold back half of the doses to do second jabs but that those are now ""flowing through the system"". Ms Sturgeon says she will be ""brutally blunt"" and says the Scottish government published detailed estimates of supply last week but that the UK government had a ""hissy fit"" about it doing that. She says her government was asked, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, to take the publication down. She says she did not agree with the reasoning behind it, but that she complied. They don't want us to be open about supply. Yet what we have is the UK government briefing and spinning misleading figures on supply. They have to be clear about which approach they want us to take. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister Ruth Davidson leads the opposition response for the Scottish Conservatives. She brings up the impact on parents and pupils of school closures. She says the best way out of it is the vaccine programme, but says vaccines are slow to reach GP surgeries, and then, the public. She reads letters from concerned constituents who are awaiting the jab, or invitations to attend for the vaccine. She asks for an explanation from the first minister on the hold-up of vaccine supply, and after reports the NHS Louisa Jordan was closed on Sunday, asks when the vaccine will be available over seven days. The first minister says there was a ""pharmacy issue"" at NHS Louisa Jordan and that from now on the operation will be over seven days. She reiterates that the most vulnerable were protected first and says 90% of  care home residents have been vaccinated - higher than numbers in England. The first minister says that in January, 100,000 vaccines were expected to be completed and they have achieved and increased that, working towards 400,000 a week. She adds that the four nations are working to a different order but are following the same targets. Stay at Home. Protect the NHS. Save lives."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister As the first minister's statement draws to a close she asks everyone to ""please stick to the letter â and also the spirit â of the lockdown"". She says we should be thinking every day about how we can reduce our interactions
as far as we can, to remove as many opportunities as possible for the virus to
spread. She says the restrictions are working and she asks people to ""please, stick with it"". Here's a reminder of the restrictions and guidance: 1. Scottish government:Coronavirus (COVID-19): what you can and cannot do,external From Tuesday 5 January, mainland Scotland moved from Level 4 to a temporary lockdown, with new guidanceto stay at home,externalexcept for essential purposes. Some islands remain atLevel 3,external. 2.Postcode checker,externalfor Covid restrictions by protection level in areas of Scotland 3.NHS Inform,external The latest from NHS Scotland and the Scottish government, including social distancing, face covering and stay-at-home advice. The first minister says going out to exercise should be just that, not going out to socialise in a park or on a beach. ""So please - stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,"" she says. She calls on people to work from home if they can and to follow the FACTS advice. The first minister says: ""There will be a continued need for all of us to play our part in suppressing
transmission in the ways we have been doing for the last few months. ""Obviously, I hope this will not entail the strictest form of lockdown for
too much longer, but some mitigations - for example, physical distancing,
hygiene, face coverings, possibly travel limitations - are likely to be
necessary for some time yet."" She adds: ""We
do now have hope, more so than at any time since the start of this pandemic, of
a path to much greater domestic normality - something that all of us crave. ""For now, progressing along that path requires continued discipline and sacrifice."" The first minister says: ""We then aim to complete first doses for everyone who is over 65 by the
start of March, and to give first doses to everyone on the JCVI priority list
by early May. ""That means presiding officer that in around three monthsâ time, around three million people in
total will have received at least the first dose of the vaccine - this is, of
course, the majority of the adult population and includes everyone over the age
of 50, and many younger people with an underlying health condition. ""The rest of the adult population will follow after that just as quickly
as supplies allow."" ""Our pace of progress in the over-80s group is also now picking up,"" says Ms Sturgeon. ""We estimate that between 15% and 20% have already had the first dose and
we are on track for all over-80s - and everyone else in JCVI groups 1 & 2 -
to have been offered the first dose by the start of February. ""By the middle of February, we expect to have completed first doses for
all over-70s, and for all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable."" The first minister adds: ""People in these groups will start to receive appointments for February
in the coming days."" Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland education correspondent It
had become clear that schools would not be reopening on 1 February. The
situation will be reviewed on 2 February and the first minister says she hopes
a phased return from the middle of next month will be possible. One
question may be whether primary school children could go back full time while
secondaries move from remote to blended learning. But
if this doesn't happen and so-called ""remote learning"" continues after
mid-February it is likely to prove controversial. Ultimately
though, the decision on reopening schools will be based on the progress in the
fight against coronavirus. And it is
certainly clear that the return to the classroom will be one of the top
priorities. Shops or hairdressers certainly won't reopen before schools. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Schools to stay closed until mid-February at least Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that transmission of the virus appeared to be declining but was still too high to ease restrictions. But she hopes schools will be able to at least begin a phased return to the classroom in the middle of next month. The level four restrictions have been in place since Boxing Day. Meanwhile the islands of Barra and Vatersay are being moved into the top level of restrictions due to a ""significant outbreak"" there. Live reaction as Scottish lockdown extended Scotland's GPs 'frustrated' with vaccine supply Islands to enter lockdown after Barra outbreak Where are the latest cases? The current restrictions, which have closed non-essential shops and seen a ""stay at home"" message put down in law, had been due to expire at the end of this month. But Scottish government ministers agreed they should be extended after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that lockdown was ""beginning to have an impact"" on the number of new infections, but said Scotland remained in a ""very precarious position"". She added: ""We need to be realistic that any improvement we are seeing is down, at this stage, to the fact that we are staying at home and reducing our interactions. ""Any relaxation of lockdown while case numbers, even though they might be declining, nevertheless remain very high, could quickly send the situation into reverse."" The vast majority of Scottish pupils have been home learning since the Christmas holiday The announcement came as 1,165 new cases of Covid-19 were registered in Scotland, representing 11.1% of tests carried out. A total of 1,989 people are in hospital with the virus while a further 71 deaths of people who recently tested positive have been logged. Ms Sturgeon said there was ""real and severe"" pressure on health services, with around 30% more patients in hospital than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020, and that this was ""almost certain to rise for a further period yet"". School buildings and nurseries have been closed to most pupils since the start of term, with all but the children of some key workers and vulnerable pupils learning from home. Not only will schools remain closed to most pupils until at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point. The first minister has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean? The groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children and those in P7 getting ready to move to high school. For others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer. Both the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 Feb. By that week, first doses of vaccine should have been offered to all over 80s in Scotland as well as frontline NHS and social care staff and care home residents. With only 15-20% of the over 80s reached so far, opposition parties think the programme is slipping behind schedule, which the first minister denies. Ms Sturgeon said she knew how ""challenging and stressful"" home schooling was for families, but said community transmission was ""too high"" to allow a safe return to classrooms. She said: ""If it is at all possible, as I very much hope it will be, to begin even a phased return to in-school learning in mid-February, we will. ""But I also have to be straight with families and say that it is simply too early to be sure about whether and to what extent this will be possible."" Statistics released on Monday showed that Scotland had vaccinated 6% of its adult population so far - the same percentage as Wales, but lower than the 8% that have been vaccinated in England and 8.7% in Northern Ireland. England has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said approximately 100,000 people were being vaccinated per week in Scotland, and that health teams were ""on track"" to expand this to 400,000 per week by the end of February. Statistics have suggested the vaccination programme in Scotland is currently lagging behind England More than 90% of care home residents have now been given a first dose, along with 70% of care home staff and 70% of all frontline health and care workers. The first minister said the focus on care homes - where it is ""time consuming and labour intensive"" to give out jabs -  was ""why overall figures are at this stage lower than in England"", where more over-80s have received the vaccine. She said the ""pace of progress in the over-80s group is also now picking up"", and that the government remained on track to hit its target of completing everyone on the priority list by early May. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the Scottish government were ""lagging behind their own targets"" on vaccination, saying the focus on care homes ""doesn't explain how slowly the vaccine is reaching GP surgeries and the public"".

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Schools to stay closed until mid-February at least Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown has been extended until at least the middle of February, with most school pupils to continue learning from home. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that transmission of the virus appeared to be declining but was still too high to ease restrictions. But she hopes schools will be able to at least begin a phased return to the classroom in the middle of next month. The level four restrictions have been in place since Boxing Day. Meanwhile the islands of Barra and Vatersay are being moved into the top level of restrictions due to a ""significant outbreak"" there. Live reaction as Scottish lockdown extended Scotland's GPs 'frustrated' with vaccine supply Islands to enter lockdown after Barra outbreak Where are the latest cases? The current restrictions, which have closed non-essential shops and seen a ""stay at home"" message put down in law, had been due to expire at the end of this month. But Scottish government ministers agreed they should be extended after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that lockdown was ""beginning to have an impact"" on the number of new infections, but said Scotland remained in a ""very precarious position"". She added: ""We need to be realistic that any improvement we are seeing is down, at this stage, to the fact that we are staying at home and reducing our interactions. ""Any relaxation of lockdown while case numbers, even though they might be declining, nevertheless remain very high, could quickly send the situation into reverse."" The vast majority of Scottish pupils have been home learning since the Christmas holiday The announcement came as 1,165 new cases of Covid-19 were registered in Scotland, representing 11.1% of tests carried out. A total of 1,989 people are in hospital with the virus while a further 71 deaths of people who recently tested positive have been logged. Ms Sturgeon said there was ""real and severe"" pressure on health services, with around 30% more patients in hospital than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020, and that this was ""almost certain to rise for a further period yet"". School buildings and nurseries have been closed to most pupils since the start of term, with all but the children of some key workers and vulnerable pupils learning from home. Not only will schools remain closed to most pupils until at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point. The first minister has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean? The groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children and those in P7 getting ready to move to high school. For others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer. Both the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 Feb. By that week, first doses of vaccine should have been offered to all over 80s in Scotland as well as frontline NHS and social care staff and care home residents. With only 15-20% of the over 80s reached so far, opposition parties think the programme is slipping behind schedule, which the first minister denies. Ms Sturgeon said she knew how ""challenging and stressful"" home schooling was for families, but said community transmission was ""too high"" to allow a safe return to classrooms. She said: ""If it is at all possible, as I very much hope it will be, to begin even a phased return to in-school learning in mid-February, we will. ""But I also have to be straight with families and say that it is simply too early to be sure about whether and to what extent this will be possible."" Statistics released on Monday showed that Scotland had vaccinated 6% of its adult population so far - the same percentage as Wales, but lower than the 8% that have been vaccinated in England and 8.7% in Northern Ireland. England has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said approximately 100,000 people were being vaccinated per week in Scotland, and that health teams were ""on track"" to expand this to 400,000 per week by the end of February. Statistics have suggested the vaccination programme in Scotland is currently lagging behind England More than 90% of care home residents have now been given a first dose, along with 70% of care home staff and 70% of all frontline health and care workers. The first minister said the focus on care homes - where it is ""time consuming and labour intensive"" to give out jabs -  was ""why overall figures are at this stage lower than in England"", where more over-80s have received the vaccine. She said the ""pace of progress in the over-80s group is also now picking up"", and that the government remained on track to hit its target of completing everyone on the priority list by early May. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the Scottish government were ""lagging behind their own targets"" on vaccination, saying the focus on care homes ""doesn't explain how slowly the vaccine is reaching GP surgeries and the public"". She read out a series of letters from elderly people who had not been contacted about getting a jab, saying they were ""anxious they don't get left behind"". Ms Sturgeon said she would not apologise for ""prioritising the most vulnerable first"", saying all four UK nations were ""working to the same targets"".

"Protests against China's alleged abuse of the Muslim Uighur community The government is facing a rebellion over the Trade Bill, and opposition proposals to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. Rebel Tory MPs want to allow Parliament to debate ending trade deals with countries responsible for genocide. The government says trade policy should not be set by the courts. But some MPs think the proposal would be a good way of targeting China and its treatment of the Uighur people. On Tuesday, America's top diplomat Mike Pompeo, in his last day in the role, said the US had determined that China's persecution of the Muslim group and other minorities in Xinjiang province represented genocide and crimes against humanity under international law. The UK has repeatedly condemned the actions of the Chinese authorities but stopped short of describing them as genocide - saying only international courts should determine this. Uighur model sends rare video from Chinese detention Will the UK refuse trade deals over human rights? And ministers also argue that trade deals are matters for governments, not the courts, to decide upon. The MPs' amendment to the Trade Bill is a watered-down version of an earlier proposal from the House of Lords, which would force the government to withdraw from any free trade agreement with any country found guilty of genocide by the High Court of England and Wales. The new proposal is signed by 10 Conservative MPs, one of whom described their amendment as ""tidier"" than the Lords version and designed to attract more support. Speaking in the Commons, Sir Edward Leigh asked ""is there any way we can acknowledge that genocide is taking place in a discussion on a trade deal"". In response, International Trade minister Greg Hands said ministers were prepared to have further discussions but not within the scope of the current legislation. He told MPs the government was ""answerable to Parliament, not the courts"" and the Lords version would have led to an ""unacceptable erosion"" of its authority. The UK, he added, had ""no plans"" to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with China due to concerns about its human rights record, particularlyits persecution of the Muslim Uighurcommunity. Nusrat Ghani urged ministers to consider the ""compromise"" proposal, which she said recognised the ""separation of powers"" between the executive, Parliament and the courts. The Conservative ex-minister said the UK should ""never let economic concerns trump ethical ones by dealing with genocidal states"". ""Why would we want to use our newfound freedom to trade with states that commit and profit from genocide? Britain is better than that."" Speaking to Politics Live, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it is currently ""impossible"" for international courts to rule on whether there has been genocide, as other countries can block hearings in the UN. He argued it is therefore important to allow British courts to make the judgement. The MP insisted he is not ""anti-China"" but said the Chinese government need to be ""reasonable and behave in a way that is acceptable"" if it wanted to be part of global trading organisations. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour would be supporting the new amendment arguing that the government ""does not consider human rights abuses enough before signing up to trade deals"". This is an interesting story in its own right because of the issues involved but it's also a neat metaphor for Brexit. The government has taken back control of trade policy from the EU but is already having to share it with the House of Lords, Tory MPs and potentially with the High Court. During the passage of the Trade Bill, the government also had to beef up the powers of the Trade and Agriculture Commission - an independent body of experts - in response to lobbying from farmers who were worried about the dilution of food standards. Soon trade disputes with other countries will partly be overseen by the new Trade Remedies Authority, another organisation that reports to ministers but is independent of them. And of course, everything has to be compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, anyway. The government has control of trade. It's just not total.

"Vaughan Gething insisted the vaccine was not being withheld in Wales Wales' health minister has insisted there is an ""increasing urgency and an increasing pace of delivery"" of vaccinations in the country. Vaughan Gething told BBC 5 live the first minister had ""clarified""remarks made on Mondaythat there was no point rushing to use all available vaccines. Former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb had said Mark Drakeford's comments were ""astonishing"". Mr Gething said on Tuesday the vaccine was not being withheld. He said the challenge was ""having enough infrastructure to deliver the Pfizer jab without wasting it"". ""Less than 1% of that vaccine is not being delivered, that's a very, very high level of efficiency,"" Mr Gething said. ""So we're able to roll out the vaccine in a way that we can deliver more and more of it. This week, we'll deliver even more of our Pfizer vaccine than last week."" He told BBC Radio Wales ""big progress"" was being made in delivering the vaccine and the NHS ""won't let people down"". On Tuesday, Public Health Wales said 161,932 people had received their first vaccine, up 10,195 from the previous day's figures. This is around 5.1% of the Welsh population, roughly the same rate for first doses as the vaccinations in Scotland. Both are still behind England (6.5%) and Northern Ireland (7%) Mr Gething said he could understand why ""an unsettling effect"" may have resulted from the way Mr Drakeford's interview ""was presented"". ""We are going as fast as possible,"" he said. Covid vaccine: Health minister denies jabs being held back Covid in Wales: GPs warned about delay to vaccine batch Covid vaccine: When, where and how will I get my jab? Some swabs used in sampling for Covid-19 have been taken out of circulation after concerns they may have led to false positive test results. NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership is investigating its supply chain to establish how many of the swabs have been distributed and how many are still in stores, the Welsh Government said. In a statement issued on Tuesday evening, Mr Gething said the swabs were used to sample for Covid-19 in hospital settings, at health board-run community testing units and some mobile testing units. ""As soon as this problem was discovered, all microbiology labs and testing centres in Wales were notified so that the affected swabs could be taken out of circulation,"" he said. Mr Gething said the issue was identified on Friday by Public Health Wales (PHW) laboratory staff. ""The issue detected may have affected the accuracy of a small proportion of test results leading to false positives,"" he said. ""However, based on what we currently know, Public Health Wales is confident that this does not affect the overall epidemiological picture."" He said NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership was working with PHW, health boards, the manufacturer of the swabs COPAN and the UK supplier/distributor Thermo Fisher Scientific to ""identify and isolate the swabs potentially affected to prevent their ongoing use"". He said the swabs have been isolated as a ""precaution while further investigations are undertaken"". ""More and more people are being protected - we are at the point where by the end of this week seven in 10 care home residents and staff should be protected, seven in 10 over-80s in Wales should be protected with their first shot. ""We're making really big progress with protecting our staff with their first vaccine. We're doing a really good job at increasing the pace. This is a race against the virus and to recover as much as possible of normal life."" The NHS ""won't let people down"", he said. Mr Gething told the Senedd on Tuesday afternoon that more than ""60,000 Pfizer jabs have been released this week to NHS Wales to make sure they're put into people's arms"". Andrew RT Davies said Mr Gething was trying to clear up the ""mess"" made by the first minister Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies was ""sadly"" not reassured by the health minister. He said Mr Gething was trying to clear up the ""mess"" made by the first minister. ""In some respects the first minister didn't make a mess,"" he said. ""He spoke honestly about what Welsh Government policy is at the moment."" Mr Davies said he did not accept Mr Gething's defence that things were being done as quickly as they could. With ""whole swathes of the economy shut down"", the vaccine was ""no good in the bottle"", he said. ""It surely is a sprint and it is a sprint to get this vaccine out as quickly as possible to offer people protection against the virus,"" Mr Davies added. He said ""we all want to see success"". Rhun ap Iorwerth said the vaccine needed to be delivered ""as quickly as possible"" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said confidence in the system was ""very important"". ""We have this very confusing couple of days where the first minister says categorically they are holding the vaccine back and then, in a few hours, no, we are not holding the vaccine back. ""That kind of lack of clarity breeds confusion."" Vaccine needed to be delivered ""as quickly as possible,"" he added. Given the criticism that the vaccination effort in Wales has been slow off the blocks, it would be a disaster if the Welsh Government ended up missing its official milestone of vaccinating the top four priority groups - including the over 70s - by about Valentine's Day in mid-February. But if the effort continues at the speed it is now, that target won't be reached until mid-March. We have estimated that to reach that target, way more than 20,000 first doses need to be given a day - almost double the current rate. It would be even more than that if the Welsh Government wants to build in some wriggle room to accommodate any potential disruption in supply. But the health minister insists Wales is on track to meet that commitment and the programme will quickly speed up. In an effort to demonstrate what's achievable, Vaughan Gething said he was confident that  70% of over-80s and 70% of care home residents and staff will have been given their first jab by the end of the weekend. During a period of intense scrutiny by the public and his political rivals, this is a pledge that simply has to be delivered. Daniel Altman, a professor of immunology at Imperial College, London, said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was ""unique"" because it had to be stored at -70C. ""These things are challenging but they're not insurmountable,"" he said. ""I watch what's happening in Wales with great interest to see if the numbers really can be caught up. That's the way to beat this and get transmission down."" Bronwen Rashad, of the Wye Valley, Monmouthshire, said her 78 and 81-year-old parents had not yet received vaccine appointments. ""The Welsh Government have done brilliantly with everything else, I don't why with the vaccine it has gone wrong,"" she said. She said the situation was causing ""a lot of anxiety."" ""My dad is really quite stressed about it,"" she said. ""Friends who have parents of a similar age in England have got their vaccine."" Vaccination clinics are being run at Cardiff's All Nations Church ESCAPE WITH HAYLEY PEARCE:Topics that make the group chat go off ELIS JAMES CHEWS OVER THE WEEK'S FOOTBALL:Elis, Danny and Iwan discuss Stoke's seven Welsh players Dr Rebecca Towner, a GP at Whitchurch Road Surgery in Cardiff, said staff were ""really excited to be able to deliver"" the vaccine, with the first clinic held last Friday at the nearby All Nations Church. ""We managed to do the over 90s, which went really well,"" she said. ""We have only got a limited number of vaccines initially. We are hoping the supply will increase."" She said some patients were ""really anxious to get their vaccine as soon as possible"". ""We are having to be fair across the whole of Cardiff. There are 10 huge practices over the north of Cardiff that are part of the cluster we are in. ""We are trying to make sure there isn't any sort of postcode lottery, and that no demographic group is being disadvantaged in any way."" Dr Keith Reid, executive director of public health at Swansea Bay University Health Board, said the rate of vaccinations was increasing in the area. ""The rate-limiting step at the moment is the flow of vaccine,"" he said. ""We are working with pharmaceutical colleagues in Welsh Government to understand how vaccine will be coming down the line towards us so that we can prioritise our clinics against that, and make sure we have people coming in when we have vaccine.""

"Pupils are currently learning remotely from home Schools in England may reopen region by region after half term, the government's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said. Speaking to the Commons education committee, Dr Harries suggested there would be different rates of infection across the country when lockdown ends. This would mean a ""differential application"" of restrictive measures would be required, she said. Schools were closed at the start of January to stem the spread of Covid-19. Although schools remain open to vulnerable children and those of keyworkers, all others are due to learn remotely from home until after the February half term holiday. But the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested they may not return fully then. A Department for Education spokesperson said the department was continuing to keep plans for the return to school under review and that it would inform schools, parents and pupils of the plans ahead of February half term. Committee chairman Robert Halfon said he suspected schools would be closed for quite ""a few weeks yet"", but there has been no formal confirmation of this. Medical and science advisers were warning the government before Christmas that the NHS would not be able to manage the number of Covid-19 cases if schools remained open. When will schools reopen? How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) The new, more transmissible variant of the virus had been increasing exponentially in London and the south-east before Christmas. But in some parts of the north  and north-east saw rates of increase were reducing. Dr Harries said: ""It is highly likely that when we come out of this national lockdown we will not have consistent patterns of infection in our communities across the country. ""And therefore, as we had prior to the national lockdown, it may well be possible that we need to have some differential application."" But Dr Harries said schools would be at the top of the priority to ensure that the balance of education and wellbeing were ""right at the forefront"" of consideration. This video can not be played Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries says schools in England might reopen ''region by region'' Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Although the government intends that schools will fully reopen after the February half-term holiday, it is clearly in the balance when this happens and whether there will be any sort of regional approach. ""We expect that it will depend on coronavirus infection rates and the pressure on the NHS, and that the government will make a call on this issue nearer the time. ""What is important is that when schools fully reopen, everything possible is done to keep them open and to keep disruption to a minimum. ""This is why we are calling for education staff to be prioritised for vaccinations as soon as possible, and for schools to be given more support in the use of rapid turnaround mass testing."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said if the government was planning to stagger opening of schools by region, it needed to ""provide clarity sooner rather than later"". ""This will give vital time to prepare for a smoother reopening of schools and business,"" he said. On calls for vaccination of teachers, Dr Harries suggested the safe re-opening of schools did not depend on this. But members of the committee suggested education would be less disrupted by teachers needing to go home and isolate when infected. The vaccination programme had been worked out in order of vulnerability to the disease, she stressed. And Dr Harries added that although pupils could and did transmit the virus, she did not have evidence of them being ""a significant driver"" of ""large-scale community infections"".

"Dr Arpan Mehta led the research at Edinburgh University's Euan MacDonald Centre Scientists are a step closer to being able to reverse the damage caused by motor neurone disease (MND). University of Edinburgh experts have found a problem with MND patients' nerve cells which could be repaired by repurposing drugs approved for other diseases. The study,externalhas been welcomed by charities including the foundation set up by Scots rugby legend Doddie Weir. My Name'5 Doddie foundation described it as ""a very exciting breakthrough"". More than 1,500 people are diagnosed with the degenerative condition in the UK every year. There is no known cure and more than half die within two years of diagnosis. MND: The search for new treatments Doddie Weir joins 'biggest ever' MND drug trial Lockdown with MND and a new baby but I feel great The research found that the damage to nerve cells caused by MND could be repaired by improving the energy levels in mitochondria - the power supply to the motor neurons. They discovered in human stem cell models of MND, the axon - the long part of the motor neuron cell that connects to the muscle - was shorter than in healthy cells. And the movement of the mitochondria, which travel up and down the axons, was impaired The scientists showed that this was caused by a defective energy supply from the mitochondria and that by boosting the mitochondria, the axon reverted back to normal. Dr Arpan Mehta, who led the study at Euan MacDonald Centre for MND research said: ""The importance of the axon in motor nerve cells cannot be overstated. ""Our data provides hope that by restoring the cell's energy source we can protect the axons and their connection to muscle from degeneration. ""Work is already under way to identify existing licensed drugs that can boost the mitochondria and repair the motor neurons. This will then pave the way to test them in clinical trials."" The research centre was established by Euan MacDonald, who was 29 years old when he was diagnosed with MND in 2003 Craig Stockton, the chief executive of MND Scotland, said the ""exciting"" results of the research were another piece of the puzzle to finding an effective treatment for the degenerative condition. ""We look forward to seeing if these positive results can be replicated for patients,"" he said. ""Once researchers have identified a drug they believe could have the desired effect, this treatment could then be fast-tracked for human trials using the pioneering MND-SMART clinical trial platform - into which MND Scotland has invested Â£1.5m. ""Researchers, clinicians, charities and supporters are all working hard to take us closer to finding a cure and by joining together we'll get to that day even sooner."" The researchers used stem cells taken from people with the C9orf72 gene mutation that causes both MND and frontotemporal dementia. They used the stem cells to generate motor neuron cells in the lab. The study also used human post-mortem spinal cord tissue from people with MND. Although the research focused on the people with the commonest genetic cause of MND, the researchers said they were hopeful the results would also apply to other forms of the disease. The results of the study are now being used to look for existing drugs that boost mitochondrial function. The study was funded by the Medical Research Council, Motor Neurone Disease Association, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, UK Dementia Research Institute and Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.

"This video can not be played Expertâs report finds eight-year-old Saffie ""could have been saved"" if treated properly for her injuries A man has described how he tried to help the youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack as she lay badly injured after the explosion. Paul Reid, 46, was the first person to reach eight-year-old Saffie-Rose Roussos after the bomb was detonated. He said she asked for her mum and said he tried to keep her awake by talking about the Ariana Grande gig. It comes aftera new report found Saffie could have survivedif she had received better medical help. Twenty-two people were murdered and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in the arena foyer as fans left the concert on 22 May 2017. Mr Reid, who was selling posters at the concert, told the BBC he ran into the foyer seconds after the bomb went off. ""There was a big bang and I could see up on to the foyer, and there was smoke and you could hear things pinging off the wall,"" he said. ""I still had the posters in my hand. It was mad because it was like I wasn't there, like I was watching myself. ""People were just screaming and running in every direction you could think of."" Saffie-Rose Roussos was the youngest victim of the Manchester Arena bombing Mr Reid said he tried to help two other people before he noticed Saffie lying on the floor. ""She was still conscious. I asked her her name and I thought she said Sophie,"" he said. ""She just got a little bit upset. She asked me for her mum and I said not to worry, we're going to find her in a minute. ""And I sat there trying to keep her calm. I had to talk to her about the concert, and did she enjoy it. ""All the time I was sat there, I just thought hundreds of people are just going to come running in here and help us. And, well, hardly anybody came in."" Help given to youngest arena victim to be examined Manchester attack: The victims The road to the Manchester Arena bombing The public inquiry into the attack, which started in September, began to examine the emergency response to the atrocity on Monday. Mr Reid said he began watching the inquiry but said some details given in the opening days did not marry up with his recollection of what happened, and he switched it off. He told the BBC after a while another person came to help, but after cutting away some of Saffie's clothing they left and went to the aid of someone else. ""I gave her [Saffie] a sip of water, because in all this madness there's somebody handing water out,"" he said. ""So you can imagine in the foyer now, all this is going on and there's a man walking about with water."" Paul Reid said he was still haunted by what happened that night Mr Reid said a police officer suggested moving Saffie out of the foyer, but with no stretchers to lift her they had to use a piece of plastic hoarding. ""The policeman came and said 'she's got to go, I'll take her in my car',"" he added. ""There was a plastic sheet under somebody's leg who was injured, I started pulling the sheet from under his leg. We put her on it and I started to carry her out, but the board was slippy."" He said they could not get the makeshift stretcher into the officer's car, so they flagged down an ambulance. Mr Reid said he then returned to the foyer, where he went back to the man who he had taken the hoarding from. ""He had a gash in his stomach, and a paramedic was sitting there holding something against his stomach,"" he said. ""I held his hand. He had a Liverpool accent so I talked to him about football to take his mind off things, and my mind off things."" Mr Reid said he was still haunted by what happened that night. ""It's like yesterday. I can still smell the smoke in that foyer. Still hear the alarms when I go to sleep, when I close my eyes,"" he said. ""I'm first aid trained, but the most I'd done is put a plaster on. ""To step in that foyer, it was carnage. It was a war zone."" Saffie's parents have said they would not have expected member of the public to have known how to treat her injuries. Her father Andrew Roussos told the BBC: ""There was a member of the public with her, I can't expect him to tourniquet her, splint her legs and so on. ""But the medically trained people that were with her, and were with her throughout and didn't apply basic first aid to give Saffie a chance."" The inquiry has previously heard it is important to acknowledge the enormous pressure which those who responded that night came under.

"Pupils are currently learning remotely from home Schools in England may reopen region by region after half term, the government's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said. Speaking to the Commons education committee, Dr Harries suggested there would be different rates of infection across the country when lockdown ends. This would mean a ""differential application"" of restrictive measures would be required, she said. Schools were closed at the start of January to stem the spread of Covid-19. Although schools remain open to vulnerable children and those of keyworkers, all others are due to learn remotely from home until after the February half term holiday. But the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested they may not return fully then. A Department for Education spokesperson said the department was continuing to keep plans for the return to school under review and that it would inform schools, parents and pupils of the plans ahead of February half term. Committee chairman Robert Halfon said he suspected schools would be closed for quite ""a few weeks yet"", but there has been no formal confirmation of this. Medical and science advisers were warning the government before Christmas that the NHS would not be able to manage the number of Covid-19 cases if schools remained open. When will schools reopen?

"A court sketch from a major trial at the Old Bailey shows some of the measures that have been put in place to allow justice to continue Four criminal justice watchdogs for England and Wales have warned they have ""grave concerns"" about the impact of court backlogs caused by the pandemic. The inspectorates for policing, prisons, probation and prosecutions say issues it has caused could damage the criminal justice system for years. It comes after figures revealed the backlog in the crown courts has reached 54,000 unheard cases. That means some crimes from last year will not go before a jury before 2022. The inspectorates say the unprecedented situation in the courts is having a ripple effect across all of criminal justice. Court work slowed and, in the case of jury trials, stopped during the first part of the pandemic, when the lockdown advised people to stay at home, except for certain circumstances. While it has now crept back up, with social distancing measures in place, the watchdogs warn continuing delays will increase the likelihood of damage to the entire justice system. Justin Russell, the chief inspector of probation, said: ""Crown courts deal with the most serious cases, so this backlog concerns us all. The Covid-19 pandemic has meant severe delays and numerous cancellations throughout 2020, and this has had a negative impact on everyone involved. ""Delays mean victims must wait longer for cases to be heard. Some will withdraw support for prosecutions because they have lost faith in the process. ""Witnesses will find it difficult to recall events that took place many months ago, and prosecutors waste significant periods of time preparing for cases that do not go ahead."" MPs will question Mr Russell and the other chief inspectors on their conclusionslater on Tuesday,external. In their report, the inspectors also found: The total criminal courts backlog is more than 457,000 - some 100,000 more than it was before the pandemic struck the UK The vast majority of those cases are less serious crimes that are dealt with in the magistrates' courts and that waiting list is beginning to shorten As the crown court backlog grew, so did the number of prisoners on remand awaiting a trial. They now represent more than 15% of the prison population Restrictions to limit coronavirus in jails severely curtailed education programmes - including for young offenders - despite their essential role in rehabilitation About 65% of the Crown Court backlog - 27,700 cases - are believed to be trials. Delays worsened from the beginning of the UK pandemic because trials could not be safely held in court buildings, which often have very cramped conditions. Today, there are 410 courtrooms able to hear cases across 79 Crown Courts. Of those, only 290 are deemed safe to hold jury trials. That does not mean that all are able to be used at any one time. This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession At the Old Bailey, one large trial is taking up two courtrooms connected by a video link to meet Public Health England guidelines. The jurors are spread out and separated by plastic glass screens between each of them. Even then, trials can be delayed. The recent prosecution of men accused of smuggling Vietnamese migrants who died in a lorry was stopped twice as a juror had to isolate. Mr Justice Edis, the senior judge who has worked on the arrangements, has praised court staff for the solutions they have found, including using portable buildings in car parks as Covid-safe jury rooms. ""We are now running fewer courtrooms than we could run in normal times if we had the funding to run all our courtrooms at the same time,"" he told the BBC. Justice but no popcorn: Edinburgh's Odeon cinema used for a pilot remote courtroom for jurors in Scotland's separate legal system ""But the limits on capacity are not only funding. Limits on capacity are the physical capacity of the buildings, the size of the cells, the size of our docks and critically, the number of staff... Capacity in terms of physical court space, is probably about as good as it's going to get."" While the court recovery plan has seen trials resume, some experts are predicting delays will still get worse. Crest Advisory, a crime and justice consultancy, argued last year that the governmentneeds to double capacity. Detectives, lawyers and judges all know that the longer it takes a trial to be heard, the more likely something is to go wrong. Mr Justice Edis says that witnesses can simply forget what happened. And that concern, borne out of experience, is why one of the most important legal maxims is that ""justice delayed is justice denied"". Diana Fawcett, chief executive of Victim Support, said the watchdogs' report is damning for the prospects of anyone waiting for justice. ""For years, even before the pandemic, we knew first-hand from victims that the system wasn't working. Some victims face years of waiting while others have been told to pursue civil routes, for example applying for non-molestation orders. Defendants distanced: Four of the accused in a recent Old Bailey trial One woman supported by the charity was the victim of domestic violence in the summer of 2019 - and she'd expected the trial to be in spring 2020. The case now won't be heard until spring 2022 - and the impact has been enormous. In an open letter about her experiences, she said: ""The nightmares have increased in frequency and it is becoming very difficult to be able to enjoy anything,"" she wrote. ""I am so desperate to move on... I feel utterly powerless to do anything about it."" How has the justice system responded to the pandemic? BBC Radio 4's File on 4 hears stories from inside prisons where lawyers fear delays are creating miscarriages of justice. Listen toLocked Up in Lockdown on BBC Sounds. The Ministry of Justice insists that its courts recovery programme is having an effect. ""These efforts have allowed us to rapidly increase the use of video technology, establish 36 Nightingale courtrooms and prioritise urgent cases to protect the public,"" said a government spokesman. ""In recognition of the scale of the challenge we face, the government is investing Â£450m to boost recovery in the courts and deliver swifter justice, and this is already yielding results - the magistrates' backlog continues to fall and Crown Court cases reached pre-pandemic levels last month."" But shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""This damning report shows why the incompetent Conservative government cannot be trusted with the justice system, which it left vulnerable even before the pandemic began.

"Dr Arpan Mehta led the research at Edinburgh University's Euan MacDonald Centre Scientists are a step closer to being able to reverse the damage caused by motor neurone disease (MND). University of Edinburgh experts have found a problem with MND patients' nerve cells which could be repaired by repurposing drugs approved for other diseases. The study,externalhas been welcomed by charities including the foundation set up by Scots rugby legend Doddie Weir. My Name'5 Doddie foundation described it as ""a very exciting breakthrough"". More than 1,500 people are diagnosed with the degenerative condition in the UK every year. There is no known cure and more than half die within two years of diagnosis. MND: The search for new treatments Doddie Weir joins 'biggest ever' MND drug trial Lockdown with MND and a new baby but I feel great The research found that the damage to nerve cells caused by MND could be repaired by improving the energy levels in mitochondria - the power supply to the motor neurons. They discovered in human stem cell models of MND, the axon - the long part of the motor neuron cell that connects to the muscle - was shorter than in healthy cells. And the movement of the mitochondria, which travel up and down the axons, was impaired The scientists showed that this was caused by a defective energy supply from the mitochondria and that by boosting the mitochondria, the axon reverted back to normal. Dr Arpan Mehta, who led the study at Euan MacDonald Centre for MND research said: ""The importance of the axon in motor nerve cells cannot be overstated. ""Our data provides hope that by restoring the cell's energy source we can protect the axons and their connection to muscle from degeneration. ""Work is already under way to identify existing licensed drugs that can boost the mitochondria and repair the motor neurons. This will then pave the way to test them in clinical trials."" The research centre was established by Euan MacDonald, who was 29 years old when he was diagnosed with MND in 2003 Craig Stockton, the chief executive of MND Scotland, said the ""exciting"" results of the research were another piece of the puzzle to finding an effective treatment for the degenerative condition. ""We look forward to seeing if these positive results can be replicated for patients,"" he said. ""Once researchers have identified a drug they believe could have the desired effect, this treatment could then be fast-tracked for human trials using the pioneering MND-SMART clinical trial platform - into which MND Scotland has invested Â£1.5m. ""Researchers, clinicians, charities and supporters are all working hard to take us closer to finding a cure and by joining together we'll get to that day even sooner."" The researchers used stem cells taken from people with the C9orf72 gene mutation that causes both MND and frontotemporal dementia. They used the stem cells to generate motor neuron cells in the lab. The study also used human post-mortem spinal cord tissue from people with MND. Although the research focused on the people with the commonest genetic cause of MND, the researchers said they were hopeful the results would also apply to other forms of the disease. The results of the study are now being used to look for existing drugs that boost mitochondrial function. The study was funded by the Medical Research Council, Motor Neurone Disease Association, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, UK Dementia Research Institute and Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.

"Cillian Murphy stars in Peaky Blinders, a drama which follows Tommy Shelby and his family Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight has confirmed the hit BBC crime drama will conclude with a film following the show's final TV series. On Monday, Knight said the upcoming sixth series would be the last but teased that ""the story will continue in another form"". He has now confirmed to Deadline:,external""My plan from the beginning was to end Peaky with a movie. ""This is what is going to happen,"" he added. He explained that ""Covid had changed our plans"" but did not elaborate. Helen McCrory, who plays Polly, is the Shelby family matriarch The final BBC TV series has resumed filming after being hit by Covid-related production delays. On Monday, Knight described the show as being ""back with a bang"" and warned fans that the mobsters would face ""extreme jeopardy"" in the sixth season. Knight had previously planned fora seven-season runof the drama, which is set in post-World War One Birmingham. ""My ambition is to make it a story of a family between two wars,"" he said in 2018 ahead of season five. ""I've wanted to end it with the first air raid siren in Birmingham in 1939. It'll take three more series to reach that point."" It now looks like the film might be replacing his plan for series seven. Knight, an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, previously revealed he had been ""approached"" to take the Shelby crime family universe to the big-screen. Sam Claflin as Tommy's political rival Oswald Mosley was a central figure in series five The sixth series of the show, which follows Tommy Shelby and his family, will see Anthony Byrne return as director and Nick Goding produce. Tommy Bulfin, executive producer for the BBC, said he was ""very excited"" filming had begun and promised a ""truly remarkable... fitting send-off that will delight fans"". He added he was ""so grateful to everyone for all their hard work to make it happen"". The production team have developed comprehensive safety protocols to ensure that the series will be produced responsibly and in accordance with government guidelines during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

"A court sketch from a major trial at the Old Bailey shows some of the measures that have been put in place to allow justice to continue Four criminal justice watchdogs for England and Wales have warned they have ""grave concerns"" about the impact of court backlogs caused by the pandemic. The inspectorates for policing, prisons, probation and prosecutions say issues it has caused could damage the criminal justice system for years. It comes after figures revealed the backlog in the crown courts has reached 54,000 unheard cases. That means some crimes from last year will not go before a jury before 2022. The inspectorates say the unprecedented situation in the courts is having a ripple effect across all of criminal justice. Court work slowed and, in the case of jury trials, stopped during the first part of the pandemic, when the lockdown advised people to stay at home, except for certain circumstances. While it has now crept back up, with social distancing measures in place, the watchdogs warn continuing delays will increase the likelihood of damage to the entire justice system. Justin Russell, the chief inspector of probation, said: ""Crown courts deal with the most serious cases, so this backlog concerns us all. The Covid-19 pandemic has meant severe delays and numerous cancellations throughout 2020, and this has had a negative impact on everyone involved. ""Delays mean victims must wait longer for cases to be heard. Some will withdraw support for prosecutions because they have lost faith in the process. ""Witnesses will find it difficult to recall events that took place many months ago, and prosecutors waste significant periods of time preparing for cases that do not go ahead."" MPs will question Mr Russell and the other chief inspectors on their conclusionslater on Tuesday,external. In their report, the inspectors also found: The total criminal courts backlog is more than 457,000 - some 100,000 more than it was before the pandemic struck the UK The vast majority of those cases are less serious crimes that are dealt with in the magistrates' courts and that waiting list is beginning to shorten As the crown court backlog grew, so did the number of prisoners on remand awaiting a trial. They now represent more than 15% of the prison population Restrictions to limit coronavirus in jails severely curtailed education programmes - including for young offenders - despite their essential role in rehabilitation About 65% of the Crown Court backlog - 27,700 cases - are believed to be trials. Delays worsened from the beginning of the UK pandemic because trials could not be safely held in court buildings, which often have very cramped conditions. Today, there are 410 courtrooms able to hear cases across 79 Crown Courts. Of those, only 290 are deemed safe to hold jury trials. That does not mean that all are able to be used at any one time. This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession At the Old Bailey, one large trial is taking up two courtrooms connected by a video link to meet Public Health England guidelines. The jurors are spread out and separated by plastic glass screens between each of them. Even then, trials can be delayed. The recent prosecution of men accused of smuggling Vietnamese migrants who died in a lorry was stopped twice as a juror had to isolate. Mr Justice Edis, the senior judge who has worked on the arrangements, has praised court staff for the solutions they have found, including using portable buildings in car parks as Covid-safe jury rooms. ""We are now running fewer courtrooms than we could run in normal times if we had the funding to run all our courtrooms at the same time,"" he told the BBC. Justice but no popcorn: Edinburgh's Odeon cinema used for a pilot remote courtroom for jurors in Scotland's separate legal system ""But the limits on capacity are not only funding. Limits on capacity are the physical capacity of the buildings, the size of the cells, the size of our docks and critically, the number of staff... Capacity in terms of physical court space, is probably about as good as it's going to get."" While the court recovery plan has seen trials resume, some experts are predicting delays will still get worse. Crest Advisory, a crime and justice consultancy, argued last year that the governmentneeds to double capacity. Detectives, lawyers and judges all know that the longer it takes a trial to be heard, the more likely something is to go wrong. Mr Justice Edis says that witnesses can simply forget what happened. And that concern, borne out of experience, is why one of the most important legal maxims is that ""justice delayed is justice denied"". Diana Fawcett, chief executive of Victim Support, said the watchdogs' report is damning for the prospects of anyone waiting for justice. ""For years, even before the pandemic, we knew first-hand from victims that the system wasn't working. Some victims face years of waiting while others have been told to pursue civil routes, for example applying for non-molestation orders. Defendants distanced: Four of the accused in a recent Old Bailey trial One woman supported by the charity was the victim of domestic violence in the summer of 2019 - and she'd expected the trial to be in spring 2020. The case now won't be heard until spring 2022 - and the impact has been enormous. In an open letter about her experiences, she said: ""The nightmares have increased in frequency and it is becoming very difficult to be able to enjoy anything,"" she wrote. ""I am so desperate to move on... I feel utterly powerless to do anything about it."" How has the justice system responded to the pandemic? BBC Radio 4's File on 4 hears stories from inside prisons where lawyers fear delays are creating miscarriages of justice. Listen toLocked Up in Lockdown on BBC Sounds. The Ministry of Justice insists that its courts recovery programme is having an effect. ""These efforts have allowed us to rapidly increase the use of video technology, establish 36 Nightingale courtrooms and prioritise urgent cases to protect the public,"" said a government spokesman. ""In recognition of the scale of the challenge we face, the government is investing Â£450m to boost recovery in the courts and deliver swifter justice, and this is already yielding results - the magistrates' backlog continues to fall and Crown Court cases reached pre-pandemic levels last month."" But shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""This damning report shows why the incompetent Conservative government cannot be trusted with the justice system, which it left vulnerable even before the pandemic began. ""Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, the Ministry of Justice has dithered and delayed.""

"Jane works as an administrator for a private healthcare firm in Oxfordshire, a job she is expected to do from the office, even in lockdown. However, since she caught Covid-19 at work before Christmas, she has chosen to work from home because she feels safer - something that is causing problems with her boss. ""The office is so small and it is impossible to socially distance,"" she tells the BBC. ""My boss also didn't follow guidelines when I got ill and no one was told to isolate. It was so irresponsible."" Jane argues that her job, which is computer and phone-based, can be done easily from home. She feels that she is only following government guidelines. Concerns over bosses breaking Covid safety rules Can my boss force me to go to work? Plumbing firm to make workers get vaccinations However, she says her boss wants her to come back in and she cannot hold out much longer: ""I have a mortgage to pay, I can't risk losing my home."" Under current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so, including in areas such as healthcare. But there are concerns that bosses are breaking Covid safety rules, with the head of the UK's unions calling for tougher enforcement. Between 6 and 14 January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 3,934 complaints relating to coronavirus and took enforcement action in 81 cases. That usually meant a verbal or written warning however, with only one company facing tougher action. Policing can be a problem as well, as some workers fear reprisals if they speak up. George says he works in the office of a construction firm where social distancing rules ""are ignored or undermined"". He is torn about whether to complain. He and 10 close colleagues could all do their jobs easily from home - and did so during the first lockdown - but that is not an option this time, even though half of them are over 60, with two people in the high-risk category. ""I was given a template letter saying we are unable to work from home, despite all of us having done so easily for six months prior,"" he tells the BBC. ""There's only one way to report this internally and doing that clearly flags you for redundancy."" He says the situation forces you to ""weigh up having a job in the pandemic, or standing up for what you think is right"". Under current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so. They should only travel to their workplace if they cannot do their job remotely. This includes,externalhealthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers. For workplaces that remain open in England, employers must ""carry out an appropriate Covid-19 risk assessment"" to develop a ""specific"" strategy to stop the virus's spread. In England, guidelines set out strict measures,externalwhich employers must follow, such as minimising the number of unnecessary visits to the office, frequent cleaning of workspaces and ensuring that staff observe 2m (6ft) social distancing wherever possible. There is similar guidance for employers across a range of sectors inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Read more from our Explainers team here. The HSE, which has done 33,000 site visits since March, told the BBC it continued to ""scale up"" its checks on employers. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) wants the government to strengthen enforcement and give the HSE more resources. Some say nothing will change, unless the government changes the rules to ensure only people doing essential work go in. John (not his real name) from Gloucester is part of a team installing smart meters in people's homes for SSE, the energy company owned by Ovo. He tells the BBC he doesn't feel safe doing the job, which requires him to go into five or six people's homes each day, usually for several hours at a time. And while he accepts his job cannot be done from home, he thinks energy suppliers should only be doing essential emergency work as they did during the first lockdown, not installing smart meters which are largely about improving energy efficiency. ""We all know the quickest way to spread a virus is contact,"" he tells the BBC, adding that he thinks staff like him should be furloughed. ""They have given us face coverings and gloves, but NHS staff wear high grade PPE and yet they are still dying."" An SSE spokeswoman said the safety and wellbeing of staff was its ""primary focus"" and that the firm was open to discussing furlough options with staff. ""We have created rigorous protocols for working in homes including the opportunity for both the engineer or customer to cancel an appointment, or abort a job, if they do not feel comfortable,"" she said. Steve, who spent the last three months working at a fulfilment warehouse in Stoke-on-Trent, says he was shocked by the disregard for coronavirus rules at the site. He said social distancing was ""non-existent"", with people working ""side by side"", but when he complained the managers did nothing. ""They were more interested in getting the product out,"" he adds. However, he felt he had no choice but to keep working, even when he learned that someone in the warehouse canteen had come down with Covid. A spokesman for the government says it has worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to produce ""comprehensive Covid-secure guidance"", so that businesses permitted to remain open can do so safely: ""This is kept under review as our understanding of the virus develops.""

"Boris Johnson will be glad Donald Trump has not been re-elected for a second term as US president, ex-Civil Service head Lord Sedwill has suggested. Writing in the Daily Mail, Lord Sedwill said those who believed Boris Johnson would have preferred Mr Trump to win again were ""mistaken."" He said he ""would not have been to the benefit"" of British or European security, trade or environment issues. Downing Street said Mr Johnson looked forward to working with Joe Biden. Boris Johnson's public reflections on Donald Trump have varied considerably. This month he said Mr Trump was ""completely wrong"" to cast doubt on the US election and encourage supporters to storm the Capitol. And in 2015, when he was Mayor of London, Mr Johnson accused him of ""stupefying ignorance"" over his comments about violence in the city. But after Mr Trump's victory in the US election in 2016, then Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson said there was a ""lot to be positive about"", and while running for the Conservative leadership in 2019, he said the President had ""many good qualities"".

But BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Lord Sedwill's remarks would not be unhelpful to Downing Street as any perception in Washington that Mr Johnson was like Mr Trump becomes a liability with the arrival of President Biden. In his Daily Mail article,,externalLord Sedwill, who was the UK's most senior civil servant until he stood down in September, said there was ""relief in Western capitals"" that normal diplomatic relationships will be restored once Mr Biden is inaugurated on Wednesday.

"More than a third of patients waited longer than two hours for a mental health assessment in Belfast Trust emergency departments between 2017 and 2020 Mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with some people in crisis waiting more than eight hours for an assessment. Health trusts aim to assess such patients at ED within two hours, but miss that target 20% of the time. Health officials said access to mental health services is a key priority. But they accepted availability of those services has been hit by extra pressures caused by the pandemic. ""Covid-19 has undoubtedly impacted on the availability of services and led to pressures across the HSC, including mental health,"" said NI's Director of Social Care and Children, Marie Roulston. The two-hour waiting time was set by the Health and Social Care Board to try to ensure that those who were in need of an urgent mental health assessment did not have lengthy waits in emergency departments. While the number of people using emergency departments dropped in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the percentage of those waiting more than two hours for mental health assessment remained largely the same. People were identified as needing a referral for a specialist mental health assessment at Northern Ireland emergency departments more than 42,000 times between January 2017 and September 2020. On more than 8,000 of these occasions, the patients had to wait for more than two hours before being seen. The findings were obtained by BBC News NI through a series of Freedom of Information requests to health trusts. The figures were obtained through a series of FOI requests The Belfast Trust had the highest percentage of those not seen within two hours, with more than a third of patients waiting longer than two hours for a mental health assessment. More than 70 of those patients waited for longer than eight hours, while some had to wait as long as 12 hours. The Belfast Trust said it aimed to see individuals presenting to ED ""within the target timescale, however, at times demand outstrips our capacity to meet this"". This video can not be played BBC News NI speaks to one Belfast teenager who waited eight hours in an emergency department while having a mental health crisis Aidan McMeekin is 18 and lives in Belfast. His mental health suffered after he was expelled from school. He said: ""It got to the point where I was actually begging to my mum: 'I don't want to be here anymore, please just let me go.'"" Soon after, Aidan was taken to the emergency department of Belfast's Mater Hospital, where, he said, he waited for eight hours before receiving a mental health assessment. An investigation by BBC News NI has also found that mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with people like Aidan waiting eight hours and over for for an assessment. After losing one of his close friends to suicide, Aidan's attitude changed. ""I saw first-hand how it has destroyed their families and I want to make sure that me or no-one I know goes down that route."" He added: ""I could have been just a statistic. People say you're forever young, but you're also forever dead."" If you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there area  list of organisations that may be able to help at BBC Action Line. Aidan has been working with Quakers NI to share his story and raise awareness of mental health issues among young people in Northern Ireland. Although the Belfast and Western Trust had the highest percentage of patients waiting for at least two hours, both these trusts also had smaller number of patients attending ED for mental health assessments. In recent years, new pilot community crisis intervention services have been rolled out in Londonderry and Belfast, which can be used by patients within these trust catchment areas. All five trusts told BBC News NI that while they were working hard to meet targets, this was not always possible. A spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said: ""This can be challenging at times due to the overall growth in demand for mental health assessments, including an increase in referrals from our emergency departments. ""In addition, the region's long-standing workforce pressures impact on our capacity to respond to referrals within target, although we are continuously working with commissioners to further develop our mental health early liaison provision."" In recent years, some emergency departments have appointed mental health liaison officials, whilethe department of health has also approved funding for a new perinatal mental health service. Health officials say delays to ED mental health assessments can be caused by a number of factors, including: The person may need medical treatment before being assessed They may be intoxicated due to the effect of alcohol or drugs Staff shortages In December 2020, Health Minister Robin Swann launched a public consultation on a 10-year Mental Health Strategy for Northern Ireland. It called for investment in a regional mental health crisis service to help reduce waiting times at emergency departments for mental health patients. Prof Siobhan O'Neill says behind the statistics are 'real people' While Northern Ireland's suicide rate may be lower than previously thought aftera review found some drug-related deaths, originally recorded as suicide, were accidental, the region's mental health champion said that behind the statistics were individuals ""in their darkest hours, facing devastating waits"".

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

On Monday, Knight described the show as being ""back with a bang"" and warned fans that the mobsters would face ""extreme jeopardy"" in the sixth season. Knight had previously planned fora seven-season runof the drama, which is set in post-World War One Birmingham. ""My ambition is to make it a story of a family between two wars,"" he said in 2018 ahead of season five. ""I've wanted to end it with the first air raid siren in Birmingham in 1939. It'll take three more series to reach that point."" It now looks like the film might be replacing his plan for series seven.

"This video can not be played ""Do I put people at risk because I need to pay bills, or struggle financially?"" A man denied a Â£500 grant after being told to isolate by the NHS phone app has said it was a ""kick in the teeth."" In Wales, theself-isolation support scheme,externalfor low-earners is still not available to people who are notified by the app. Taxi driver David Miller lost 10 days of work by isolating and had no grant. The Welsh Government said it was working with councils to ""identify what other alternatives, including manual solutions, can be put in place"". 'I've relied on parents to keep my family afloat' Can I go on furlough to look after my children? Criticism over Wales self-isolation payment delay Theself-isolation support scheme,externalis intended to help with loss of earnings for those told to self-isolate who cannot work from home. In Wales it is also for parents and carers on low incomes with children who are self-isolating. In December it was reported that the NHS Track and Trace app for Wales and England had beenupdated to allow people notified that they must isolate to claim the Â£500. But while users in England notified by the app can claim the payments after going through an identity-verification process, people in Wales cannot. Mr Miller, from Pembroke, received a notification on the NHS app on Boxing Day telling him to self-isolate for 10 days. As a recipient of housing benefit he should have been able to claim the Â£500 grant to offset his loss of earnings. But when he applied via his local authority he was told they could not pay him. David's wife Greta is retired so their only income during the isolation period was her state pension and his statutory sick pay ""It was a kick in the teeth really. I've had no help since the pandemic started, financially, from the government. ""They ask you to self-isolate to protect others and then you get no financial support so you have got to make a choice of shall I go out and put people at risk because I need to pay my bills or should I struggle financially and stay home? ""My choice is listen to the app, stay at home, self- isolate."" But Mr Miller thinks without the financial support, others are not making the same choice ""I have a lot of friends in the taxi trade who wouldn't download the app because of that. ""I know people will not adhere to it, I know that for a fact because I've spoken to them. ""They can't do it financially."" LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs A mother-of-two from Carmarthenshire, who didn't want to be named, toldBBC Wales Liveshe lied to her doctor to get a sicknote after missing out on the Â£500 grant. She had to stay home to look after her son who had been told to isolate, meaning she would lose nearly Â£500 in wages. She wasn't eligible for the grant as she is not on benefits, and she would have had to take unpaid leave if she did not have a doctor's note. ""It's horrible. I still feel really guilty about it now, but needs must. ""When you have to feed your children you do what you have to do."" The Welsh Government has told Wales Live more than 5,000 payments have been made since the scheme's launch. During that period around 300,000 positive cases and close contacts were identified by the Test, Trace, Protect system. The charity Resolution Foundation said the figures and its own research showed the payment was ""not reaching enough people"". It has called for a bigger scheme that would operate in a similar way to the job retention furlough programme. Maja Gustafsson, from the foundation, said: ""Not supporting the people who fall ill or risk spreading the virus further is going to be devastating for everyone. ""Investing in people so that they can do the right thing will be money well spent."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Unfortunately, making the necessary changes to enable people to apply for self-isolation payments after being told by the app to self-isolate could take a little while to deliver for Welsh app users. ""We are urgently working with local authorities to identify what other alternatives, including manual solutions, can be put in place as soon as possible, to ensure people told to self-isolate via the app are able to apply for the Â£500 self-isolation payment if they are eligible.""

"Many think the courts system needs to invest more in technology When Louise Westra and her partner decided to adopt a child in November 2018, they were aware of the long process that was ahead of them, but they were not to know that the coronavirus pandemic would hold them back from completing the adoption of their son. On 27 March, their petition was due in court. As lockdown had taken effect, telephone conferencing would be used instead of going to court. However, after the phone call, Ms Westra received an email from her solicitor explaining that the papers had not been served to the biological parents of the child. This continued every month after lockdown, as it wasn't possible for the papers to be physically served. ""It's farcical because one of them is the biological father who lives with the biological mother who has had her petition but the biological father hasn't and they live in the same premises,"" Ms Westra says. Serving papers has to be completed by post via Royal Mail or in some cases lawyers would instruct a process server to physically take the papers and hand them to the person. ""It sounds very archaic but if [the person] won't take them by hand, the processor can drop the papers near them and tell them what the document contains and that's technically counted as full service,"" says Rebecca Ranson, a solicitor for Maguire Family Law. Unless a judge approves it, emailing or any other forms of digital communication are not considered valid - even though the majority of people in the UK have access to email and the internet. It is this kind of process, in need of a digital upgrade, that is frustrating for Ms Westra. Louise Westra got stuck in a ""farcical"" legal loop Ms Westra's case is one of many that have been delayed. The number of outstanding Crown court cases was 43,676 on 26 July, and the entire backlog across magistrates' and Crown courts is more than 560,000. The Commons Justice Committee has announced an inquiry into how these delays could be addressed. The reality, however, is that there was already a huge backlog back in December, and Covid-19 has just exacerbated an existing problem. Cases like Ms Westra's have been affected by the pandemic, but many lawyers believe that the legal system could have been better prepared through technology investment over the years. ""We've got people being held for longer than they otherwise would be, and for every person in custody waiting for trial or waiting on bail for trial, there are witnesses, and complainants and their families awaiting a resolution. Whether it's the lack of technology links in prison, using Skype and improvising ornot having enough Nightingale courts- it all boils down to a lack of investment,"" says Joanna Hardy, a London-based barrister. More Technology of Business,external How photographers track down stolen pictures When changing a light bulb is a really big deal Fans face closer tracking when stadiums reopen Can artificial intelligence create a decent dinner? Why are there so few black tech entrepreneurs? In 2016 HM Courts & Tribunals Service began a Â£1bn court reform programme. This included a video-conferencing tool called the Cloud Video Platform (CVP), which allows for a dedicated private conference area, so criminal lawyers can speak to their clients without visiting prison. A programme for testing and adopting video technology was planned out until 2022, but in the pandemic, the government had to get CVP up and running in 10 weeks. This has since been extended to civil courts. But this implementation has been challenging, as there are only a restricted number of physical video links allowed. ""As we weren't ready for this huge technological revolution no-one had manned the tech rooms or built enough rooms on the other end in the prison. We can have as many laptops as we like, as much software as we like but if we can't put a prisoner into a room with a screen, the other end is pointless,"" Ms Hardy says. In 2016 a Â£1bn court reform programme began According to Ms Hardy, the waiting times to get these slots have been ""completely unacceptable"", and it has meant that sometimes hearings had to go ahead without the defendant present. ""It's like human beings failing where technology could have bridged the gap,"" she says. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that it had offered more than 400 CVP meeting rooms since the outbreak of coronavirus, but added that it is taking steps to increase the available capacity of video conferencing at some locations by extending operating hours. The spokesperson said that the MoJ is also undertaking urgent action to increase the physical number of video link outlets at critical sites. At the moment, criminal trials are going ahead using social distancing - meaning sometimes a second courtroom is linked by technology, but this is creating further backlogs, as it means one case is occupying the same space as two. Justice, the all-party law reform and human rights organisation, has trialled a virtual jury trial with a mock case, and suggested it should be considered as a possible option, but this hasn't been taken on by the courts. The issue with virtual jury trials is whether or not they could affect the outcome of a trial. Some lawyers feel like juries should see a witness, feel an exhibit and dispense justice to a fellow human being in the confines of a court room. Jodie Hill says it is more difficult to cross-examine people in video hearings ""You can lose the impact of cross examination. When you're challenging their evidence in person it's easier to get them to trip up if they're not being honest, whereas if they're on video it might be easier for them to cover it up,"" says Jodie Hill, solicitor and managing director of Thrive Law, an employment law specialist. For smaller hearings, online alternatives could be here for the long term, as it means lawyers don't have to travel all over the UK unnecessarily. This doesn't mean that every hearing that can be done remotely, should be done remotely. ""We don't want overkill. We think some cases still need to be in the room, particularly if you're dealing with vulnerable people or sensitive cases. It has to be a balancing act of harnessing the benefits of technology and thinking about the specific case,"" says Ms Hardy.

"'Paul' was accused of committing a domestic burglary in June 2018. In early 2019 he was told by police that no further action would be taken against him. However, he was subsequently charged. Last week - over two years since the alleged offence - he appeared at Inner London Crown Court. But his barrister told the court that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had still not served the sole evidence - DNA - in the case on the defence. Paul (not his real name) is on bail and had his trial put on provisional ""warned"" list - for December 2021. It means there is no guarantee it will take place at that time - just that it might. The judge explained apologetically that priority is being given to cases where defendants are being held in custody. So, three and a half-years from the date of the alleged offence, there has been no justice for the alleged burglary victim - or the accused. Paul's was one of a number of cases I saw on a visit to Inner London with the chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) James Mulholland QC. He told me it was typical. ""This is justice 2020, but it has been like this for the last 10 years, delay after delay, inbuilt into the system. These cases are being pushed back continuously. ""Lack of investment is at the heart of it and government needs to understand that you don't create a proper justice system without proper investment. ""What we are seeing here are the fruits of a lack of interest."" That apparent ""lack of interest"" is reflected in the state of some court buildings. Outside Inner London I saw a dead pigeon decaying on netting, vast weeds growing up the side of the building and old pipes leaking water. Meanwhile, a court official told me that some court centres are now listing trials for 2023. The delays are caused by a range of factors. Lawyers point to huge cuts to the police, CPS and other agencies such as probation. There are a range of things malfunctioning within the system. They include long initial delays caused by police ""releasing suspects under investigation"" - sometimes for years - before a charging decision is made. Systemic problems continue with the CPS serving evidence late on the defence, meaning lawyers cannot advise their clients in a timely manner. And perhaps most significantly - the decisions by government to cut thousands of crown court sitting days. That has meant that courts have been mothballed while trials stack up in a growing backlog. None of these problems are caused by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, but they are of course exacerbated by it. Pre-lockdown the crown court backlog in England and Wales stood at some 37,000. It is now over 46,000. James Mulholland QC says lengthy waits are typical ""Adam"" - not his real name - was accused of rape in March 2018. He denies the charge. His trial has been put back twice, once because of the pandemic. He is now on a ""warned"" list for November, while his chosen career in one of the public services is on hold. ""I have suffered really bad with my mental health through it,"" he says. ""I've had to up my dosage of anti-depressants. It's affected my potential career. ""The hard work I have done at university and everything to get me there it's all basically going out of the window now. I haven't got any trust or hope that it will be anywhere near the end of this year. ""I think it will be more like April next year."" The next case I saw involved two young men charged with possession of drugs with intent to supply.  The alleged offence took place in December 2017. No one in court could explain the delay. It was followed by a case in which the judge needed a pre-sentence report from the probation service in order to sentence the defendant. Despite repeated requests, no one was available. In order to achieve a conclusion of the case, the judge had to devise a sentence which did not require a report.  It was not ideal, but it showed professionals trying to do their best in the face of a lack of resources. Emma Fenn, a barrister specialising in criminal work, paints a bleak picture. ""Defendants are suspended from their jobs with trial dates one to two years away. Some are losing university places with dates from the alleged offence to trial of four years. ""And some who are awaiting trial for 18-24 months on bail, can be on electronic tagged curfew from 7-7 every day, for up to two years."" To help deal with the situation, the government has announced that the period of time an accused person can be held before a trial - known as the Custody Time Limit (CTL) - will be increased from six to eight months. But the government admitted - in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group Fair Trials - that it did not know how many people had been held in prison beyond the time limit since lockdown. Lawyers fear some accused will spend more time in custody awaiting trial than the sentence they would eventually receive if they pleaded guilty - and that some might falsely plead guilty simply to bring an end to their case. 'Please don't forget us': Virus adds to court backlog Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Life is bleak for those in custody awaiting trial, says Ms Fenn, ""There are often no visits from family or in-person visits from lawyers. Defendants can be locked up for 23.5 hours a day, education classes and courses are suspended, jobs within the prison restricted, and there are reports of showers being limited to 1-2 a week."" Covid has also removed a ""huge amount of mental health, drug and alcohol agency support"", she says. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said justice had been kept moving ""despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic"" and overall, cases are falling. However, they acknowledged that ""more needs to be done"". The government has launched an Â£80 million CriminalCourts Recovery plan,externalwhich includes: Employing 1,600 court staff to support recovery measures Introducing plexiglass screens to separate members of the jury to enable safe use of more court rooms Magistrate courts are seeing the number of outstanding cases drop - dealing with over 21,000 cases a week. Increasing capacity through ""Nightingale Courts"" - 10 are up and running, a further eight planned to open shortly Exploring new extended court 'COVID operating hours' However, only three of the new Nightingale Courts are dealing with crime. I visited one, Prospero House, a short walk from Inner London. It is a state of the art commercial building with three large courtrooms allowing ample room for social distancing.  Every desk has hand sanitiser and protective gloves. But Mr Mulholland says: ""We need 60 criminal Nightingale Court buildings. At the moment we have just three."" The CBA says there are around 460 crown courtrooms in England and Wales. Currently around 100 are able to hear trials, though not all are hosting them. The government says its plan will bring on stream another 250 of the existing rooms to hear jury trials by the end of October. The CBA believes that simply will not cut into the backlog. Lawyers believe that the Treasury has long seen justice as a poor relation to health and education in terms of public spending. ""Investing in the criminal justice system is investing in the wealth and prosperity of the country,"" says Mr Mulholland. ""It is an empty and insulting promise for any minister to declare a war on crime if a government can't fund a system that keeps us safe - and ensures crimes are swiftly investigated and cases come to court on time.""

"Nicola Sturgeon is to announce later whether Scotland's Covid-19 lockdown is to continue past the end of January. The first minister said Tuesday's statement at Holyrood would concern the ""duration"" of restrictions rather than whether any new ones would be imposed. Minsters will also decide at a cabinet meeting whether schools will be allowed to re-open in full from 1 February. Education Secretary John Swinney has suggested it would be a ""tall order"" for pupils to return to classrooms. Ms Sturgeon said on Monday that she did not want to ""raise parents' expectations"", saying transmission of the virus ""is still higher than we would want it to be"". Covid in Scotland: FM gives update on lockdown The whole Scottish mainland and several islands have been in a strict lockdown since early January, with a ""stay at home"" message in force. This was initially due to run until February, but this will be reviewed by ministers on Tuesday morning with a view to having the restrictions last longer. While Ms Sturgeon has warned that the government would consider further measures if necessary, she said ""it is the duration rather than the content of restrictions that we will be looking at"" on Tuesday. The outcome of this review will then be announced to MSPs in a statement at Holyrood in the afternoon. Nicola Sturgeon will announce the result of the latest review in a Holyrood statement The review will also cover the situation in schools, with the majority learning remotely from home and only some children of key workers and vulnerable pupils being allowed into school buildings. On Monday, the first minister said she did not want to ""raise expectations"" about classes returning to normal, but added that she was ""not going to make any assumptions"" ahead of the cabinet meeting. She said: ""I am not going to raise parents' expectations, you can see from the numbers we are seeing some positive signs in the numbers that lockdown is starting to stabilise things and tip them into decline, but transmission is still higher than we would want it to be. ""We want to get schools back as quickly as we possibly can, it is not in the interests of kids to be out of school for any longer than is absolutely necessary, but community transmission has always been a key factor in these decisions."" This echoed comments from Mr Swinney, who had previously said it would be ""a tall order"" for schools to fully re-open with ""the virus still at a very high level in general within society"". I am expecting continuity rather than change from today's announcement on coronavirus restrictions. The continuation of the current lockdown and presumably the extension of remote learning for most school pupils into the February break at least. Both decisions are likely to be reviewed again next month. But it's not clear if the first minister will feel able to suggest a target date for restrictions to ease. Cabinet will also be giving special attention to theserious Covid outbreak on Barraand considering if the level three restrictions that apply in the Western Isles remain appropriate. While there are signs the pace at which the current wave of coronavirus is spreading is starting to slow, evidence of much greater suppression will be required before the stay at home lockdown in place across mainland Scotland is lifted. The review comes less than a week afterrestrictions in Scotland were tightened, with some click and collect services ordered to close and outdoor alcohol consumption banned. The entire Scottish mainland has been in the top level of restrictions - level four - since Boxing Day, with level three measures in place in Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and some islands in Argyll and Bute and the Highlands. Scots are subject to a legal requirement not to leave home for anything other than essential purposes, such as shopping for essentials, exercise and caring responsibilities. The number of new cases reported each day on average has begun to fall, but the number of people in hospital with the virus continues to rise and is now ""significantly"" above that seen in the first wave in 2020. Ms Sturgeon said the ""position overall is very precarious, very concerning in terms of the level of transmission"", but said there were ""some early signs to be optimistic that measures are having an effect"". The first minister will take questions from opposition leaders following her statement. The Scottish Conservatives have voiced concerns that Covid-19 vaccines are not being rolled out quickly enough, saying the Scottish government are ""trailing their own targets"". Statistics released on Monday showed that Scotland has vaccinated 264,991 people so far - 6% of its adult population. This is lower than the figure for England, where 8% of the adult population - 3,520,056 people - have been vaccinated, and Northern Ireland, which has the highest vaccination rate in the UK at 8.7%. Wales has a similar figure to Scotland at 6%. England has also given a second dose of the vaccine to 427,386 people, compared to only 3,698 in Scotland. However, Ms Sturgeon has insisted that all parts of the UK are ""working to the same targets"" to vaccinate priority groups, and said her government is ""on track"" to hit them subject to supplies arriving. This would see care home residents, healthcare staff and all over-80s get a first dose by the start of February, with over-70s and those deemed ""extremely vulnerable"" by mid-February and all over-65s by the beginning of March. By that time the government aims to be vaccinating up to 400,000 people a week on average, with all priority groups getting a first jab by early May and the rest of the adult population in line thereafter.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app. The West Suffolk MP said self-isolation was ""perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing"" and urged others to do the same if contacted. In a tweet, Mr Hancock said he would be working from home until Sunday, adding ""we all have a part to play in getting this virus under control"". He contracted coronavirus in March 2020 andsuffered ""mild symptoms"". What are the rules if I'm asked to self-isolate? Inside NHS Test and Trace UK-bound travellers now need negative test for entry Mr Hancock said he learned from the app he had been ""in close contact with somebody who's tested positive"" and so self-isolating was ""how we break the chains of transmission"". ""So you must follow these rules like I'm going to,"" he said. ""I've got to work from home for the next six days, and together, by doing this, by following this, and all the other panoply of rules that we've had to put in place, we can get through this and beat this virus."" Mr Hancock said he was alerted by the app on Monday night, having earlier led a Downing Street press conference alongside NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis and Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins. The NHS app tells a person if they have been in close contact with someone who has later tested positive for coronavirus and tells them to isolate for 10 full days from their last contact. While it is not clear from Mr Hancock's statement if his isolation ends on Sunday or Monday, his period of quarantine suggests he was last in contact with the person who was infected on Wednesday or Thursday.

Downing Street confirmed that Mr Hancock would not receive the vaccine early because he is leading the pandemic response. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The PM and the rest of the cabinet will take the vaccine when it's their turn to do so based on the priority lists that have been published. ""We don't think it's right that the PM or other members of cabinet take the vaccine in place of somebody who is at higher clinical risk."" In March, the health secretary revealed he had tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had confirmed he too had the virus. While the health secretary recovered fairly swiftly, and was able to work from home during his illness,Mr Johnson required hospital treatment. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Self-isolation, which means staying at home and not leaving, is a legal requirement for anybody who has Covid symptoms, has tested positive for the virus, lives with someone who has symptoms, has arrived from abroad or has been contacted by NHS Test and Trace. In December, the self-isolation period required was cut from 14 days to 10 days. Using Bluetooth technology the NHS app makes contact between mobile phoneswhen they are near each other, if an owner of a phone later tests positive for the virus and shares that with the app, alerts are sent to anyone who is deemed to have been a close contact.

"Oxford University is opening a new research institute dedicated to tackling resistance to antibiotics. The university says this is one of the the biggest rising threats to global health, already causing 1.5 million deaths per year worldwide. The institute will be funded by Â£100m donated by the Ineos chemical company. Vice chancellor Louise Richardson said the Covid pandemic had shown the ""high cost of ignoring something that is likely to head our way"". There will be 50 researchers working in the new Ineos Oxford Institute for Antimicrobial Resistance, addressing the ""over-use and mis-use"" of antibiotics, which the university warned could cause 10 million excess deaths per year by 2050. How antibiotics resistance 'could take us back to the dark ages' Global threat of resistance to antibiotics Antibiotic use falling but resistance rising Panorama: The race for a vaccine Routine operations and ""taken-for-granted treatments"" would become much riskier without effective antibiotics, said the university. ""The growing menace of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most under-reported issues of our time,"" says David Sweetnam, a surgeon advising the new institute. ""We now have a very narrow window of opportunity in which to change course and prevent the unthinkable from becoming the inevitable,"" he said. Professor Richardson says Oxford's success with a Covid vaccine has improved the public's view of university research Prof Richardson said the growth of resistance to antibiotics made it ""absolutely imperative that we act"" ""It may seem very costly to do all this research now but it's nothing on the cost of failure to act,"" she said. The vice chancellor said Oxford's success in developing a Covid vaccine had created a much more positive public perception of university research and the value of experts. ""We were able to adapt so quickly and produce a vaccine in less than a year because we had spent 20 years working on it, doing blue skies research,"" said Prof Richardson. There had been debates about universities not providing value for money and too many people going into higher education, but Prof Richardson suggested the public mood had changed. ""The British public cannot get enough of experts at the moment,"" she said. The high-profile development of a Covid vaccine had shown the value of university research, said Prof Richardson - ""critical not just to health, but to the economy, to the preservation of culture and to generation of new ideas"". ""It's so much in the national interest that we have good universities,"" she said. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, billionaire chairman of Ineos, said the partnership with Oxford aimed to ""accelerate progress in tackling this urgent global challenge"".

"Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment. However, the Turn2Us charity warned of a ""drastic impact"" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes. Universal credit isa single benefit payment for working-age people,external. It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. There were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according toofficial government statistics.,externalNearly 40% of claimants have jobs. The government is expected to spend Â£90bn on UC in 2024-25. That compares with Â£153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, Â£40bn on disability benefits and Â£14bn on child benefit. For UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May. The rule change means180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says. The 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (Â£11.44 for those aged 21 or over). Someone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET). The AET now stands at Â£892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage. Universal credit claimants must seek 18 hours work Sunak sets out plans to tackle 'sick note culture' If a couple is earning less than Â£1,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings. Claimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach. Certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability. Turn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. The government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sickness have increased. It claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save Â£4bn a year. Labour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead. The amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household: Single claimant under 25: Â£311.68 a month Single claimant 25 or over: Â£393.45 a month Joint claimants both under 25: Â£489.23 a month Joint claimants either aged 25 or over: Â£617.60 a month You may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. Extra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. You may also be able to claima reduction in council tax,externalwhile on UC, orassistance to pay your mortgage,external, although you would need to meet strict criteria. Under the UC taper, payments are reduced as claimants earn more. The current taper ""rate"" is 55%. This means thatfor every additional Â£1 earned over the work allowance,external, UC payments are reduced by 55p. It is complicated to work out exactly how much UC you might receive. Some people have found they are entitled to less money under UC than they would have been under the previous benefit arrangements. Those with Â£16,000 or more in savings are not eligible. It usually takes about five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible. An application for UCmay put a stop to any tax credits you receive,even if it proves to be unsuccessful. 'One click and I was worse off' from benefit claim The main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work isnew-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).,external This is worth Â£71.70 a week if you are under 25, or Â£90.50 a week if you are 25 or over. You can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike UC, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim, although you may get less if you have part-time earnings or a pension. You may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.

"Protests against China's alleged abuse of the Muslim Uighur community The government is facing a rebellion over the Trade Bill, and opposition proposals to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. Rebel Tory MPs want to allow Parliament to debate ending trade deals with countries responsible for genocide. The government says trade policy should not be set by the courts. But some MPs think the proposal would be a good way of targeting China and its treatment of the Uighur people. On Tuesday, America's top diplomat Mike Pompeo, in his last day in the role, said the US had determined that China's persecution of the Muslim group and other minorities in Xinjiang province represented genocide and crimes against humanity under international law. The UK has repeatedly condemned the actions of the Chinese authorities but stopped short of describing them as genocide - saying only international courts should determine this. Uighur model sends rare video from Chinese detention Will the UK refuse trade deals over human rights? And ministers also argue that trade deals are matters for governments, not the courts, to decide upon. The MPs' amendment to the Trade Bill is a watered-down version of an earlier proposal from the House of Lords, which would force the government to withdraw from any free trade agreement with any country found guilty of genocide by the High Court of England and Wales. The new proposal is signed by 10 Conservative MPs, one of whom described their amendment as ""tidier"" than the Lords version and designed to attract more support. Speaking in the Commons, Sir Edward Leigh asked ""is there any way we can acknowledge that genocide is taking place in a discussion on a trade deal"". In response, International Trade minister Greg Hands said ministers were prepared to have further discussions but not within the scope of the current legislation. He told MPs the government was ""answerable to Parliament, not the courts"" and the Lords version would have led to an ""unacceptable erosion"" of its authority. The UK, he added, had ""no plans"" to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with China due to concerns about its human rights record, particularlyits persecution of the Muslim Uighurcommunity. Nusrat Ghani urged ministers to consider the ""compromise"" proposal, which she said recognised the ""separation of powers"" between the executive, Parliament and the courts. The Conservative ex-minister said the UK should ""never let economic concerns trump ethical ones by dealing with genocidal states"". ""Why would we want to use our newfound freedom to trade with states that commit and profit from genocide? Britain is better than that."" Speaking to Politics Live, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it is currently ""impossible"" for international courts to rule on whether there has been genocide, as other countries can block hearings in the UN. He argued it is therefore important to allow British courts to make the judgement. The MP insisted he is not ""anti-China"" but said the Chinese government need to be ""reasonable and behave in a way that is acceptable"" if it wanted to be part of global trading organisations. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour would be supporting the new amendment arguing that the government ""does not consider human rights abuses enough before signing up to trade deals"". This is an interesting story in its own right because of the issues involved but it's also a neat metaphor for Brexit. The government has taken back control of trade policy from the EU but is already having to share it with the House of Lords, Tory MPs and potentially with the High Court. During the passage of the Trade Bill, the government also had to beef up the powers of the Trade and Agriculture Commission - an independent body of experts - in response to lobbying from farmers who were worried about the dilution of food standards. Soon trade disputes with other countries will partly be overseen by the new Trade Remedies Authority, another organisation that reports to ministers but is independent of them. And of course, everything has to be compatible with World Trade Organisation rules, anyway. The government has control of trade. It's just not total.

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is self-isolating after being alerted by the UK's NHS Covid-19 app. The West Suffolk MP said self-isolation was ""perhaps the most important part of all the social distancing"" and urged others to do the same if contacted. In a tweet, Mr Hancock said he would be working from home until Sunday, adding ""we all have a part to play in getting this virus under control"". He contracted coronavirus in March 2020 andsuffered ""mild symptoms"". What are the rules if I'm asked to self-isolate? Inside NHS Test and Trace UK-bound travellers now need negative test for entry Mr Hancock said he learned from the app he had been ""in close contact with somebody who's tested positive"" and so self-isolating was ""how we break the chains of transmission"". ""So you must follow these rules like I'm going to,"" he said. ""I've got to work from home for the next six days, and together, by doing this, by following this, and all the other panoply of rules that we've had to put in place, we can get through this and beat this virus."" Mr Hancock said he was alerted by the app on Monday night, having earlier led a Downing Street press conference alongside NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis and Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkins. The NHS app tells a person if they have been in close contact with someone who has later tested positive for coronavirus and tells them to isolate for 10 full days from their last contact. While it is not clear from Mr Hancock's statement if his isolation ends on Sunday or Monday, his period of quarantine suggests he was last in contact with the person who was infected on Wednesday or Thursday.

Downing Street confirmed that Mr Hancock would not receive the vaccine early because he is leading the pandemic response. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The PM and the rest of the cabinet will take the vaccine when it's their turn to do so based on the priority lists that have been published. ""We don't think it's right that the PM or other members of cabinet take the vaccine in place of somebody who is at higher clinical risk."" In March, the health secretary revealed he had tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had confirmed he too had the virus. While the health secretary recovered fairly swiftly, and was able to work from home during his illness,Mr Johnson required hospital treatment. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Self-isolation, which means staying at home and not leaving, is a legal requirement for anybody who has Covid symptoms, has tested positive for the virus, lives with someone who has symptoms, has arrived from abroad or has been contacted by NHS Test and Trace. In December, the self-isolation period required was cut from 14 days to 10 days. Using Bluetooth technology the NHS app makes contact between mobile phoneswhen they are near each other, if an owner of a phone later tests positive for the virus and shares that with the app, alerts are sent to anyone who is deemed to have been a close contact.

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

"21-year-old Amelia's Depop account was hacked by a fraudster When Amelia Strike, 21, was logged out of her Depop social shopping app account in October, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. ""I thought I had just forgotten my password when I couldn't get back in, but a couple of days passed and I realised something wasn't right,"" says the Birmingham-based law student. She then received a message from a stranger on Instagram, alerting her to the fact that her account had been taken over by a scammer advertising Apple AirPod headphones for Â£50. She immediately used her brother's Depop account to comment on the offending post and contact the app. It was removed by the firm in a few hours and her password was reset. But when Ms Strike logged back in, she was shocked by what she found. ""I felt sick - I scrolled and scrolled through hundreds of messages people had sent the scammer,"" she says. The fraudster had been instructing shoppers to pay them directly through PayPal's ""Friends and Family"" option, which sidesteps Depop's fees and doesn't offer any protection for buyers. The scammer sent messages like this one to other Depop users from Amelia's account Ms Strike counted at least three Depop users who made unauthorised payments of Â£50 to the scammer. In Ms Strike's situation, to get users to trust scam listing, the hacker had also uploaded a photo of her name on a post-it note next to the headphones that were supposedly for sale. This is a common tactic used by people selling second-hand items online, to prove that the photos were not stolen from another listing. ""I just felt so violated,"" she says. Depop says train seat crop top violates its terms Can pre-loved clothes make fast fashion sustainable? 'I made Â£1,265 selling my clothes second-hand' She is not alone - 14 other users have told BBC News that their Depop accounts have been hacked in recent months. In all cases, the fraudsters demanded to be paid directly, rather than through the app. Blending the look and social elements of Instagram with the buy-and-sell format of eBay, 90% of Depop's users are aged 26 or under. Emily Goold, 21, a journalism student in Tewkesbury, was scared when her account was hacked and a fraudster posted a listing for a Â£350 jacket. Emily Goold, 21, told the BBC a fraudster hacked her Depop account and advertised a Â£350 Moncler jacket Depop took the listing down within 12 hours and reset her password, but Ms Goold says such incidents are becoming commonplace. ""You always know somebody who's had a Depop horror story. It's such a widespread problem now."" Scammers have continued to plague many online services through the pandemic. One ""have a go"" method called ""credential stuffing"" involves using automated tools to repeatedly log into accounts, entering usernames and password information previously exposed from data breaches of other popular online services. If a user doesn't use the same password on multiple services or has changed their passwords after being exposed in a data breach, this won't work. According to Liv Rowley, a threat intelligence analyst at cyber-security firm Blueliv, cyber criminals are now targeting Depop accounts on an ""industrial scale"" using this method, capitalising on the fact that people often use similar passwords. Blending the look and social elements of Instagram with the buy-and-sell format of eBay, 90% of Depop's users are aged 26 or under Depop told the BBC that the safety and security of its community is its ""number one priority"", and that the service has never had a data breach or had its infrastructure compromised. The firm confirmed that credential stuffing is a big part of the problem. ""Weak passwords and the use of the same password across multiple accounts is the greatest source of account takeover, which is why we have initiated a campaign in the second half of 2020 to force some users to strengthen their passwords and to remind others of the importance of strong and unique passwords,"" says Depop's chief operating officer Dominic Rose. Depop has started resetting passwords for some 12 million users that have not changed them in over a year and told the BBC it had sent reminders to a similar number to make sure their log-in details are unique. ""We will continue to remind our community about the importance of account security and updating their passwords."" The firm, founded in 2011, told the BBC that although the number of its users increased nearly two-fold to 26 million last year, it had seen a 50% decrease in account ""takeovers"" since its campaign began. But Blueliv found that login details for several thousand hacked Depop accounts are being advertised for as little as $1.05 (77p) each on the dark web - a part of the internet that is only accessible using specialised tools. While a Vice investigation,externalfirst highlighted the problem in May, there is now evidence that account logins are being sold across multiple dark web ""marketplaces"". The information for sale includes usernames and passwords, with extra charged for details such as follower count, the number of sales completed by a user and their ratings by other shoppers. On the dark net marketplace White House Market, ""premium"" Depop accounts are being sold for $5 ""The accounts are being compromised and that definitely is concerning,"" Ms Rowley says. ""While it's not a Depop-specific problem, I think [credential stuffing] is one we're going to see expand in the next five years."" One Depop user told the BBC they would feel ""much more comfortable"" if the app introduced two-factor authentication, where users enter a one-time code sent to them via email or text, for example, after attempting to sign in. Depop confirmed that it intends to implement multi-factor authentication in 2021. But Aman Johal, director at law firm Your Lawyers, which specialises in consumer action claims, says the platform needs to act urgently, ""particularly given its relatively young user base, where the duty of care is greater"". ""The fact that this has been going on for months...is unacceptable. Given the volume of compromised accounts for sale, the horse has already bolted,"" he added. For some users, trust in the company has been dented. ""I feel like their security measures need to be amped up because it's just not good enough,"" says Ms Strike, who has been a Depop user since 2015. ""I've used [Depop] for a long time but I'm reluctant to continue because it just doesn't feel safe anymore.""

"This video can not be played Competitors in the Australian Open are having to practise in different circumstances this year Two more Australian Open tennis players have tested positive for Covid-19 after arriving in Melbourne, state health officials said on Tuesday. It comes after a player was believed to have tested positive on Sunday, amid growing controversy over the event. One more ""non-playing participant"" also has Covid, bringing the overall total linked to the Open to seven, including a flight attendant. Some 1,200 people have flown in for the tournament, which begins on 8 February. Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said in a statement that the latest three positive tests of two players and a non-participant were of a woman in her 20s and two men in their 30s, all of whom were in hotel quarantine. But there was confusion when Tennis Australia disputed the latest announcement. Chief executive Craig Tiley said no players had tested positive at all - only those in their entourages. He said no players were in the medi-hotel, to which people are transferred if they test positive while in hotel quarantine. Rows over quarantine rules have cast a shadow over the upcoming event. Some players have expressed frustration about being confined to hotel rooms full-time while other rivals are not. Australian Open players hit out at Covid isolation Tennis stars' arrival angers stranded Australians And some residents in Melbourne - a city which endured one of the world's longest lockdowns last year - have their own concerns about the potential Covid risk posed by the tournament. Positive cases on three flights have forced 72 players into full quarantine, meaning they have to isolate full-time in their hotel rooms for 14 days instead of being allowed outside to train like other participants. Mr Tiley insisted players had been made aware of the quarantine possibilities beforehand and said that some may have not taken it seriously and ""brushed it off"". But he acknowledged it was ""not an even playing field"" for those stuck in their hotel rooms, given their competitors have access to five hours of court practice a day. The majority of some 500 players attending the Open have accepted the conditions, organisers say. Labor MP Bill Shorten told players to ""get a grip"", adding: ""People have died. People lost their jobs... and you got these pampered sooks who are having a cry over their conditions."" World number one Novak Djokovic lobbied authorities to relax quarantine rules for players - including making the periods shorter. The suggestions earned him criticism from Australian player Nick Kyrgios, who tweeted: ""Djokovic is a tool."" Top-ranked Djokovic arrived in Australia last week ahead of the major Last year Djokovic organised an exhibition event in which he and others contracted the virus, drawing the disdain of Kyrgios at the time. Kyrgios also criticised the girlfriend of fellow Australian player Bernard Tomic after she featured in a news clip complaining about hotel food and having to wash her hair by herself. Vanessa Sierra has since said her comments were taken out of context and that she had received death threats, after her ""I don't wash my own hair"" quote was mocked online. While most players are being quarantined in Melbourne, Djokovic is part of a smaller group of big-name stars including Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka who are stationed in Adelaide for an exhibition match. Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka issued a plea to fellow players to show ""co-operation, understanding and empathy for the local community that has been going through a lot of very demanding restrictions"".

The control of everything is not Tennis Australia, it's the people from the government... I can't imagine staying two weeks like this."" He later apologised for his words, which he said were taken out of context, adding that Australia's efforts to combat Covid were ""admirable"".

Here are the
main coronavirus headlines this Tuesday evening:  Updates were brought to you today by Alex Therrien, Becky
Morton, Claire Heald, Emma Harrison, Francesca Gillett, Julian Joyce, Paul
Kirby and Victoria Bisset. France has reported 23,608 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, according to health ministry data. The figure is up from 3,736 on Monday and from 19,752 last Tuesday. A further 656 Covid deaths in hospitals were also recorded - up from 403 on Monday. The number of people in intensive care rose by 26 to 2,839, while the total number of patients hospitalised for the disease was down 52 over 24 hours at 25,567. As Brazil started rolling out vaccinations, some Rio de Janeiro residents were able to receive their first injection at one of the world's most famous landmarks. Medical staff administered the jabs at the foot of the Christ the Redeemer statue on Monday eveningafter regulator Anvisa gave the green light to vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac. Brazil has the world's second-highest death toll from Covid-19 and infections are rising again across the country. Over 8.5 million cases have been recorded and more than 210,000 people have died since the pandemic began. Military personnel have already helped at vaccination and testing centres Four-hundred military personnel are now working alongside doctors and nurses in hospitals across London and the Midlands, NHS England has said. They are a mix of combat medical technicians and soldiers performing general duties, including helping on wards, operating as family liaisons between clinical teams and patients' relatives, as well as taking on estates and porter duties. It comes as hospitals across the UK struggle to cope with the number of patients coming in, with 10 hospital trustsacross England reportingthey had no spare adult critical care beds. You canread more hereabout military personnel being drafted in to help hospitals in Shropshire. They will fill in for healthcare assistants at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, who are either sick, shielding or self-isolating. As we mentioned earlier, the total number of vaccinations given in the UK has reached 4,266,577, up to and including 18 January. This means the UK currently has a seven-day average of 262,133 doses. A higher rate of 383,337 doses per day is needed to reach the target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people by mid-February. So far, south-west England has the highest percentage of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine - 7.6%. London has the lowest percentage when compared to the UK's nations and regions - 4.3% of the city's population has received a first jab. Wales could receive a larger share of coronavirus vaccines in future because of its older population, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He told the Welsh Parliament that ""actions are being taken"" by the UK Government to make sure Wales' higher median age is taken into account. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Wales has the highest proportion of older people in the UK, ranking highest with the number of over-65s and over-85s. Drakeford said the Welsh Government was focused on ""making the fastest and most efficient use of every drop of vaccine that comes here in Wales"", and they were ""on track"" to vaccinate the four priority groups by mid-February. As we reported earlier, a further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test -the highest number reported in a single day since the pandemic began. And another 33,355 positive Covid cases in the UK have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January. The statistics suggest that UK daily cases have begun to fall, but the number of deaths are on an upward trend. The number of patients in hospital across the UK is also still rising. However, with decreasing daily cases, we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths, our health correspondent Nick Triggle says. A temporary mortuary is being set up in Hampshire to provide extra capacity, following an increase in deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic. The new facility is being set up in Winklebury, Basingstoke, and will become operational on Thursday to support the four major NHS hospital mortuaries across the county. John Coughlan, chief executive of Hampshire County Council, said: ""While our hospitals and funeral sector are currently coping, we are regrettably seeing significant pressures within the system. ""We have therefore decided that it is prudent now to open the temporary mortuary to ensure that we are able to carefully manage and respond to any increase in demand for additional capacity. ""I would like to reassure the families and friends of those who may be accommodated temporarily at this facility that their loved ones will be afforded every possible care, dignity and respect, and that we have been liaising closely with faith leaders to ensure required customs and practices are observed.""  Up to 2,000 people working in roles in the Covid-19 vaccine supply chain will be offered jabs, the UK government says. This is to help ensure the UK gets the doses it needs to protect the most vulnerable. It follows a plea from AstraZeneca to protect workers involved with the manufacture of its vaccine, to ensure the supply chain runs smoothly. Staff working for Pfizer and AstraZeneca involved in crucial supply chain roles in the UK will be among those eligible for the vaccine, the Department for Health and Social Care said. A total of 3,424 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were admitted to hospitals in England on 17 January, NHS England has said. This is a 4% reduction on last week's figure on 10 January. Admissions peaked in the first wave of the virus at 3,099 on 1 April 2020. NHS England said all regions had recorded a week-on-week decrease in daily admissions, apart from the Midlands (up 12%), south-west England (up 1%) and north-east England/Yorkshire (no change). Scotland extended its lockdown this afternoon - the mainland and most of the islands remain in those most severe restrictions. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added the islands of Barra and Vatersay to the top tier of restrictions. Otherwise the Scottish places still in level three are Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles); and the following islands within Argyll and Bute: Coll, Colonsay, Erraid, Gometra, Iona, Islay, Jura, Mull, Oronsay, Tiree, and Ulva; Finally, all highland
authority islands remain in level 3 â except for Skye which comes within the national restrictions Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is aiming for school pupils to return to the classroom Scotland's lockdown has been extended for at least another two weeks. Not only willschools remain closed to most pupilsuntil at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return for pupils, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean? The groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children, and those in the final year of primary school getting ready to move to high school. For others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer. Both the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 February. Emirates and Etihad have announced that they will be among the first airlines in the world to test a mobile app for passengers to record their coronavirus test results and vaccine records. The two companies, which are both based in the UAE, said in separate statements on Tuesday that they were working together with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to test the IATA Travel Pass in the first quarter of 2021. The app will initially be tested on limited routes in the first quarter of this year, with Emirates offering the app to passengers from Dubai to verify their coronavirus test results before travel. The app will also provide information about travel and entry restrictions across various countries. It will also let labs and test centres ""securely send test results or vaccination certificates to passengers"" Emirates' said. Many countries and a number of airlines currently require passengers to provide a negative PCR result in the days before departure. The pandemic has negatively affected airlines across the world, withfigures from Eurocontrol showing that UK flights were down 82% yesterday,externalcompared to the equivalent day in 2019. HSBC has announced it is to close 82 branches in the UK between April and September this year, claiming customers are turning to digital banking. The company said the coronavirus pandemic ""emphasised the need for the changes"" it was making. It said the number of customers using branches had fallen by a third in the past five years, and 90% of all customer contact was over the phone, internet or smartphone, in addition to contacts on social media. Managers said they did not expect to make any redundancies, with staff moved to nearby branches instead. HSBC will have 511 remaining branches across the country.

The Siena College Poll of 804 New York State registered voters was conducted between 10 and 13 January. It found 7% of those surveyed said they had already been vaccinated. Of those who had not had the jab, 69% said they planned to get vaccinated and 27% said they did not. The US has administered 12.28m Covid-19 vaccine doses so far,according to figures from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,external. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Today's rising number of UK deaths was to be expected, sadly, after
the surge in cases during December. And it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even
higher than this. Todayâs numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays
registering deaths over the weekend tend to lead to higher figures being
reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day. To put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half
that. But there are two chinks of light in the daily update. Firstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 - for a third day
in a row. At the turn of the year it was touching 60,000 new
diagnoses. That means, in the coming weeks, we should start to see fewer
hospitalisations and, eventually, deaths. The number of vaccinations also continues to rise. It seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. But each increase at least takes us one step closer to
getting on top of the virus. Celia HattonBBC Asia Pacific Regional Editor Taiwanese soldiers take part in a Lunar New Year military exercise in Hsinchu A major festival to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year in Taiwan has been cancelled after four new coronavirus cases were discovered. A giant, undulating light sculpture had already been constructed in this year's host city, Hsinchu, to welcome hundreds of thousands of expected visitors. But now Taiwanese health officials are worried about a relatively small outbreak of Covid-19 on the island. Taiwan is one of the only places in the world which managed to keep the spread of the virus under control for most of last year, without imposing severe lockdown restrictions. However, the discovery of four locally-transmitted cases in one day - the biggest daily rise in eleven months - has lead officials to conclude that the lantern festival cannot go ahead. Taiwan has been one of the most successful places in the world in dealing with Covid-19.Read more about how it's been dealing with the virus here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Nearly 240,000 laptops and tablets have been sent to schools and councils in England since the start of the year, according to an update on the governmentâs scheme to help disadvantaged children learn from home. The Department for Education promised 1.3m devices to schools at a cost of Â£400m. A total of 801,324 devices have been dispatched as of 17 January, with 20,000 laptops or tablets being delivered every day. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson hailed the scheme as âone of the worldâs largest procurements of laptops and tabletsâ, saying it had âhappened despite intense global demandâ. But head teachersâ union leader Geoff Barton said âthe frustration is that we are nearly a year into the crisis, and deep into a second period of restricted school opening, and it has still not been fully resolvedâ. Labourâs shadow education minister Wes Streeting said the governmentâs scheme âfalls well shortâ. Birmingham and Lancashire rank highest among local authorities, having both received in excess of 10,000 devices. Anne Longfield, childrenâs commissioner for England, welcomed the âprogressâ but added âthere are many children who are still not able to learn from home properlyâ. In the last half hour, we reported that a further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - the highest daily figure since the pandemic began. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has reacted to the news,tweeting,external: ""Awful. Horrific. Devastating. And it didn't have to be like this.""

"The Met Office warned heavy rain combined with melting snow on higher ground was likely to cause flooding An amber rain warning has been issued for parts of northern and central England as Storm Christoph approaches. The Met Office told people in Yorkshire and the Humber, the North West, East Midlands and the east of England to expect heavy rain and potential floods. Yellow warnings have been issued for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and southern Scotland. Up to 70mm (2.75in) of rain is forecast to fall within 48 hours in the worst-hit areas from Tuesday. The Met Office said the downpours, set to last throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, were likely to cause flooding when combined with melting snow on higher ground. It said there was a ""danger to life"" due to fast-flowing or deep floodwater, and warned some communities there was a good chance they would be ""cut off"" by flooded roads. It also predicted delays and cancellations to public transport, with the amber warning in place until 12:00 GMT on Thursday. Councils and emergency services have warned people to prepare for potential flooding. Mayor of Doncaster Ros Jones declared a major incident in South Yorkshire ahead of possible flooding. In a tweet,,externalshe said emergency protocols were instigated on Sunday, with sandbags handed out in flood-risk areas, and told people not to panic but to be prepared. Calderdale councillor Scott Patient urged residents and businesses to ""take all the steps they can to protect themselves and their property"". Due to Covid-19 restrictions, Mr Patient said, the authority was preparing ""virtual community support hubs"" to help people if there was flooding.

"Not all parents have found it easy to home school their children during coronavirus lockdowns Levels of stress, depression and anxiety among parents and carers have increased with the pressures of the lockdowns, suggests research from the University of Oxford. Issues include difficulty relaxing, feeling hopeless and being irritable. Many parents, especially those of secondary-age pupils, say they are worried about their children's futures. The government has said it is aware how challenging it is for parents to support children with home learning. Theresearch,external, based on responses from 6,246 parents and carers between mid-March and the end of December 2020, found problems including: difficulty relaxing being easily upset or agitated feeling hopeless lacking interest and pleasure feeling fearful and worried being more irritable, over-reactive and impatient On an established scale of depression, anxiety and stress, parents' depression scores increased from April through to June from an average of 9.03 to 9.71, says the study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. While these average scores decreased over the summer, when Covid-19 restrictions were eased, to a low of 8.23 in September, they rose again over the course of the autumn term to a high of 10.1 points in December. Parents' stress scores were at their lowest in August and September at 11.4 points, but increased to a high of 13.2 in December, following the pre-Christmas lockdown. Parents 'burnt out' by home-schooling How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) How parents plan to tackle lockdown home-schooling Children 'traumatised' by coronavirus pandemic The researchers said higher levels of stress were detected particularly in low-income families, as well as single-parent households and those with children with special educational needs. While average anxiety scores were relatively stable throughout the whole period - ranging from a 4.71 points in April to 4.24 in July - they hit a high of 5 points in December. The study also found just over a third (36%) of parents with young children (10 years or younger) said they were ""substantially worried"" about their children's behaviour, in contrast to just over a quarter (28%) of parents who had older children only (11 years or older). However, nearly half (45%) of those with secondary-age children were worried about their children's education and future, compared to 32% of those with young children. Leticea, a parent who took part in the study, said: ""I think that UK leaders should have access to this data to see what is going on with the mental health of families and how they are being affected by Covid-19 with increased levels of stress, depression and anxiety - we need something to look forward to. ""I am also worried that the next three months will show a sharper increase in anxiety and stress where parents are having to do more teaching at home. ""Children are more worried as their teachers are becoming ill - the 'new variant' sounds more scary, my daughter keeps commenting on an increasing worry of catching Covid-19 which she didn't do so much before."" Another parent, Madiha, said: ''Current times are hard enough as they are. ""As a working parent, the most important thing for me is to ensure my family's wellbeing, their safety, and their continued development. ""Prolonged screen time, disruption to daily routine, frequent arguments, lack of exercise, and stress of exams have all been contributing factors to our mental health and wellbeing. Madiha said she hoped the study would play a part in informing policy and developing interventions to help families. Cathy Creswell, professor of clinical developmental psychology at Oxford University and co-leader of the study, said the findings showed parents were particularly vulnerable to distress during the first lockdown. ""Our data highlight the particular strains felt by parents during lockdown when many feel that they have been spread too thin by the demands of meeting their children's needs during the pandemic, along with home-schooling and work commitments."" Schools were first closed to most pupils in March John Jolly, head of the charity Parentkind, said the research highlighted ""the additional stress and pressure that partial school closures place on parents"". ""Given the disruption to family life, it is vital that policymakers consult and listen to the concerns of parents on issues that directly impact them and their children's futures. ""This includes the safety and reopening of schools, the fair allocation of grades in the absence of exams, and remote learning provision."" The Oxford researchers are tracking children's and parents' mental health throughout the current crisis, to help them identify what protects young people from deteriorating mental health and how this may vary according to child and family characteristics.

"In Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, residents have prepared their homes and businesses ahead of the heavy rain Emergency services in the north of England are preparing for widespread flooding caused by Storm Christoph. The Environment Agency has warned of a ""volatile situation"" as heavy rain combines with melting snow, while police in South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester declared major incidents. An amber rain warning is in place for Yorkshire, the North West, East Midlands and the east of England. A yellow rain warning was issued for the rest of the country. Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey said the force had declared a major incident to ensure it was ""as prepared as possible"". ""The safety of the public is our number one priority and we're continuing to work alongside partner agencies across the region,"" he said. Flood warning as Wales braced for Storm Christoph A government spokesperson said it had provided additional advice to local agencies to help them manage any evacuations and shelter provision in a Covid-secure way. ""The government has robust plans in place to support any areas affected by extreme weather this winter,"" they added. Sandbags were laid in at-risk areas, with up to 70mm (2.75in) of rain due. In isolated spots, particularly in the northern Peak District and parts of the southern Pennines, 200mm (7.87in) could be possible. Northern Rail said buses were being used instead of trains on services between Bolton and Blackburn due to flooding at Darwen. Some motorists attempted to drive through floodwater on Derby Road in Hathern, Leicestershire In the amber warning area, the Met Office said there was a ""danger to life"" due to fast-flowing or deep floodwater, and told some communities they might be ""cut off"" by flooded roads. It also predicted delays and cancellations to public transport, with the amber warning in place until 12:00 GMT on Thursday. BBC Weather Ros Jones, mayor of Doncaster, said key risk areas had been inspected over the past 36 hours, with the delivery of sandbags continuing on Tuesday. ""I do not want people to panic, but flooding is possible so please be prepared,"" she said. Residents of Fishlake, South Yorkshire, which saw severe flooding hit 160 homes and businesses in November 2019, said they felt much better prepared this time round. Flood warden and parish councillor Peter Trimingham said the arrival of sandbags had been a welcome sight. ""It gives us confidence,"" he said. Residents in Fishlake, near Doncaster, say they are better prepared than when flooding hit in 2019 Mr Trimingham added: ""We're absolutely hoping it doesn't rise to the same level. But, if it does, we're reasonably comfortable we've still got a chance because the Environment Agency have done tremendous work here along with Doncaster Council."" He said new defences had been built and their team of flood wardens had been expanded to 22 people. On Yarlborough Terrace in Bentley, Doncaster, many residents were out of their homes for months after the 2019 floods. Anna Booth, 37, who was forced to live in a caravan on her drive, said residents were worried about it happening again. ""Being in the pandemic doesn't help either. Morale's a bit down but I think we'll all pull together again like last time,"" she said. ""It breaks your heart, it's really sad, but we can't stop the weather."" This video can not be played Storm Christoph hits the UK The Environment Agency issued more than30 flood warnings,external, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action required, covering parts of Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Merseyside, Staffordshire and Northamptonshire as of 03:00 GMT on Wednesday. There are also more than 150 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, issued across northern England, the Midlands and the east. River levels in the Ouse, which flows through York in North Yorkshire, are high before the arrival of Storm Christoph Catherine Wright, acting executive director for flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, said: ""That rain is falling on very wet ground and so we are very concerned that it's a very volatile situation and we are expecting significant flooding to occur on the back of that weather."" She said the agency would be working with local authorities to help with evacuation efforts should a severe flood warning be issued, adding: ""If you do need to evacuate then that is allowed within the Covid rules."" Work took place on Tuesday morning to increase defences near the River Ouse Discussing the different levels of flood warnings, she said: ""If you receive a flood alert, please pack valuables like medicines and insurance documents in a bag ready to go. ""If you receive a flood warning, please move valuables and precious possessions upstairs and be ready to turn off gas, electricity and water. ""If you receive a severe flood warning, which means you will be evacuated, please listen out and take heed of the advice from the local emergency services."" Sandbags have been used to help defend homes in Fishlake, Doncaster, which suffered devastating floods in November 2019 Barry Greenwood, from the Upper Calder Valley Flood Prevention Group in West Yorkshire, has been ""sick"" with worry. ""I went round after the last [flood], people were there with their heads in their hands, thinking 'what am I going to do now?',"" he said. Flood sirens were sounded in Walsden on Tuesday evening after a flood warning was issued for the area. In atweet,external, Calderdale Council asked residents to put their flood plan into action and move valuables to a safe place. ""River levels across the Upper River Calder have risen and are now approaching levels where we expect properties to flood,"" it warned. Earlier it had said staff were on standby to respond overnight. The amber rain warning is in place until Thursday, with yellow warnings covering most of the UK coming in over the next three days A yellow rain alert is also in place for Wales, Northern Ireland, central and northern England and southern Scotland on Tuesday. This yellow warning extends to the rest of England from Wednesday, with a yellow alert for snow and ice in north east Scotland. Highways England advised drivers to take extra care on motorways and major A roads, while the RAC breakdown service said motorists should only drive if absolutely necessary.

Here are the
main coronavirus headlines this Tuesday evening:  Updates were brought to you today by Alex Therrien, Becky
Morton, Claire Heald, Emma Harrison, Francesca Gillett, Julian Joyce, Paul
Kirby and Victoria Bisset. France has reported 23,608 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, according to health ministry data. The figure is up from 3,736 on Monday and from 19,752 last Tuesday. A further 656 Covid deaths in hospitals were also recorded - up from 403 on Monday. The number of people in intensive care rose by 26 to 2,839, while the total number of patients hospitalised for the disease was down 52 over 24 hours at 25,567. As Brazil started rolling out vaccinations, some Rio de Janeiro residents were able to receive their first injection at one of the world's most famous landmarks. Medical staff administered the jabs at the foot of the Christ the Redeemer statue on Monday eveningafter regulator Anvisa gave the green light to vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac. Brazil has the world's second-highest death toll from Covid-19 and infections are rising again across the country. Over 8.5 million cases have been recorded and more than 210,000 people have died since the pandemic began. Military personnel have already helped at vaccination and testing centres Four-hundred military personnel are now working alongside doctors and nurses in hospitals across London and the Midlands, NHS England has said. They are a mix of combat medical technicians and soldiers performing general duties, including helping on wards, operating as family liaisons between clinical teams and patients' relatives, as well as taking on estates and porter duties. It comes as hospitals across the UK struggle to cope with the number of patients coming in, with 10 hospital trustsacross England reportingthey had no spare adult critical care beds. You canread more hereabout military personnel being drafted in to help hospitals in Shropshire. They will fill in for healthcare assistants at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, who are either sick, shielding or self-isolating. As we mentioned earlier, the total number of vaccinations given in the UK has reached 4,266,577, up to and including 18 January. This means the UK currently has a seven-day average of 262,133 doses. A higher rate of 383,337 doses per day is needed to reach the target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people by mid-February. So far, south-west England has the highest percentage of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine - 7.6%. London has the lowest percentage when compared to the UK's nations and regions - 4.3% of the city's population has received a first jab. Wales could receive a larger share of coronavirus vaccines in future because of its older population, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He told the Welsh Parliament that ""actions are being taken"" by the UK Government to make sure Wales' higher median age is taken into account. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Wales has the highest proportion of older people in the UK, ranking highest with the number of over-65s and over-85s. Drakeford said the Welsh Government was focused on ""making the fastest and most efficient use of every drop of vaccine that comes here in Wales"", and they were ""on track"" to vaccinate the four priority groups by mid-February. As we reported earlier, a further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test -the highest number reported in a single day since the pandemic began. And another 33,355 positive Covid cases in the UK have been recorded - less than half the peak figure of 68,053 on 8 January. The statistics suggest that UK daily cases have begun to fall, but the number of deaths are on an upward trend. The number of patients in hospital across the UK is also still rising. However, with decreasing daily cases, we should start to see fewer people in hospital and eventually fewer deaths, our health correspondent Nick Triggle says. A temporary mortuary is being set up in Hampshire to provide extra capacity, following an increase in deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic. The new facility is being set up in Winklebury, Basingstoke, and will become operational on Thursday to support the four major NHS hospital mortuaries across the county. John Coughlan, chief executive of Hampshire County Council, said: ""While our hospitals and funeral sector are currently coping, we are regrettably seeing significant pressures within the system. ""We have therefore decided that it is prudent now to open the temporary mortuary to ensure that we are able to carefully manage and respond to any increase in demand for additional capacity. ""I would like to reassure the families and friends of those who may be accommodated temporarily at this facility that their loved ones will be afforded every possible care, dignity and respect, and that we have been liaising closely with faith leaders to ensure required customs and practices are observed.""  Up to 2,000 people working in roles in the Covid-19 vaccine supply chain will be offered jabs, the UK government says. This is to help ensure the UK gets the doses it needs to protect the most vulnerable. It follows a plea from AstraZeneca to protect workers involved with the manufacture of its vaccine, to ensure the supply chain runs smoothly. Staff working for Pfizer and AstraZeneca involved in crucial supply chain roles in the UK will be among those eligible for the vaccine, the Department for Health and Social Care said. A total of 3,424 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were admitted to hospitals in England on 17 January, NHS England has said. This is a 4% reduction on last week's figure on 10 January. Admissions peaked in the first wave of the virus at 3,099 on 1 April 2020. NHS England said all regions had recorded a week-on-week decrease in daily admissions, apart from the Midlands (up 12%), south-west England (up 1%) and north-east England/Yorkshire (no change). Scotland extended its lockdown this afternoon - the mainland and most of the islands remain in those most severe restrictions. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added the islands of Barra and Vatersay to the top tier of restrictions. Otherwise the Scottish places still in level three are Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles); and the following islands within Argyll and Bute: Coll, Colonsay, Erraid, Gometra, Iona, Islay, Jura, Mull, Oronsay, Tiree, and Ulva; Finally, all highland
authority islands remain in level 3 â except for Skye which comes within the national restrictions Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is aiming for school pupils to return to the classroom Scotland's lockdown has been extended for at least another two weeks. Not only willschools remain closed to most pupilsuntil at least mid-February, they are unlikely to return to normal at that point. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that her aim is to begin a phased return for pupils, if coronavirus allows. So what might that mean? The groups that will get back into class first are likely to include secondary school exam year pupils, the youngest primary school children, and those in the final year of primary school getting ready to move to high school. For others, online learning is likely to last a bit longer. Both the return to school and the continuation of the wider lockdown will be reviewed again in a fortnight on 2 February. Emirates and Etihad have announced that they will be among the first airlines in the world to test a mobile app for passengers to record their coronavirus test results and vaccine records. The two companies, which are both based in the UAE, said in separate statements on Tuesday that they were working together with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to test the IATA Travel Pass in the first quarter of 2021. The app will initially be tested on limited routes in the first quarter of this year, with Emirates offering the app to passengers from Dubai to verify their coronavirus test results before travel. The app will also provide information about travel and entry restrictions across various countries. It will also let labs and test centres ""securely send test results or vaccination certificates to passengers"" Emirates' said. Many countries and a number of airlines currently require passengers to provide a negative PCR result in the days before departure. The pandemic has negatively affected airlines across the world, withfigures from Eurocontrol showing that UK flights were down 82% yesterday,externalcompared to the equivalent day in 2019. HSBC has announced it is to close 82 branches in the UK between April and September this year, claiming customers are turning to digital banking. The company said the coronavirus pandemic ""emphasised the need for the changes"" it was making. It said the number of customers using branches had fallen by a third in the past five years, and 90% of all customer contact was over the phone, internet or smartphone, in addition to contacts on social media. Managers said they did not expect to make any redundancies, with staff moved to nearby branches instead. HSBC will have 511 remaining branches across the country.

The Siena College Poll of 804 New York State registered voters was conducted between 10 and 13 January. It found 7% of those surveyed said they had already been vaccinated. Of those who had not had the jab, 69% said they planned to get vaccinated and 27% said they did not. The US has administered 12.28m Covid-19 vaccine doses so far,according to figures from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,external. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Today's rising number of UK deaths was to be expected, sadly, after
the surge in cases during December. And it is likely that the coming weeks will see figures even
higher than this. Todayâs numbers are, though, inflated by the fact that delays
registering deaths over the weekend tend to lead to higher figures being
reported on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On average, the UK is recording more than 1,100 deaths a day. To put that in context, at Christmas it was less than half
that. But there are two chinks of light in the daily update. Firstly, the number of cases is below 40,000 - for a third day
in a row. At the turn of the year it was touching 60,000 new
diagnoses. That means, in the coming weeks, we should start to see fewer
hospitalisations and, eventually, deaths. The number of vaccinations also continues to rise. It seems unlikely the NHS will manage its target of two million doses a week just yet. But each increase at least takes us one step closer to
getting on top of the virus. Celia HattonBBC Asia Pacific Regional Editor Taiwanese soldiers take part in a Lunar New Year military exercise in Hsinchu A major festival to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year in Taiwan has been cancelled after four new coronavirus cases were discovered. A giant, undulating light sculpture had already been constructed in this year's host city, Hsinchu, to welcome hundreds of thousands of expected visitors. But now Taiwanese health officials are worried about a relatively small outbreak of Covid-19 on the island. Taiwan is one of the only places in the world which managed to keep the spread of the virus under control for most of last year, without imposing severe lockdown restrictions. However, the discovery of four locally-transmitted cases in one day - the biggest daily rise in eleven months - has lead officials to conclude that the lantern festival cannot go ahead. Taiwan has been one of the most successful places in the world in dealing with Covid-19.Read more about how it's been dealing with the virus here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Nearly 240,000 laptops and tablets have been sent to schools and councils in England since the start of the year, according to an update on the governmentâs scheme to help disadvantaged children learn from home. The Department for Education promised 1.3m devices to schools at a cost of Â£400m. A total of 801,324 devices have been dispatched as of 17 January, with 20,000 laptops or tablets being delivered every day. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson hailed the scheme as âone of the worldâs largest procurements of laptops and tabletsâ, saying it had âhappened despite intense global demandâ. But head teachersâ union leader Geoff Barton said âthe frustration is that we are nearly a year into the crisis, and deep into a second period of restricted school opening, and it has still not been fully resolvedâ. Labourâs shadow education minister Wes Streeting said the governmentâs scheme âfalls well shortâ. Birmingham and Lancashire rank highest among local authorities, having both received in excess of 10,000 devices. Anne Longfield, childrenâs commissioner for England, welcomed the âprogressâ but added âthere are many children who are still not able to learn from home properlyâ. In the last half hour, we reported that a further 1,610 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test - the highest daily figure since the pandemic began. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has reacted to the news,tweeting,external: ""Awful. Horrific. Devastating. And it didn't have to be like this.""

"Not all parents have found it easy to home school their children during coronavirus lockdowns Levels of stress, depression and anxiety among parents and carers have increased with the pressures of the lockdowns, suggests research from the University of Oxford. Issues include difficulty relaxing, feeling hopeless and being irritable. Many parents, especially those of secondary-age pupils, say they are worried about their children's futures. The government has said it is aware how challenging it is for parents to support children with home learning. Theresearch,external, based on responses from 6,246 parents and carers between mid-March and the end of December 2020, found problems including: difficulty relaxing being easily upset or agitated feeling hopeless lacking interest and pleasure feeling fearful and worried being more irritable, over-reactive and impatient On an established scale of depression, anxiety and stress, parents' depression scores increased from April through to June from an average of 9.03 to 9.71, says the study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. While these average scores decreased over the summer, when Covid-19 restrictions were eased, to a low of 8.23 in September, they rose again over the course of the autumn term to a high of 10.1 points in December. Parents' stress scores were at their lowest in August and September at 11.4 points, but increased to a high of 13.2 in December, following the pre-Christmas lockdown. Parents 'burnt out' by home-schooling How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) How parents plan to tackle lockdown home-schooling Children 'traumatised' by coronavirus pandemic The researchers said higher levels of stress were detected particularly in low-income families, as well as single-parent households and those with children with special educational needs. While average anxiety scores were relatively stable throughout the whole period - ranging from a 4.71 points in April to 4.24 in July - they hit a high of 5 points in December. The study also found just over a third (36%) of parents with young children (10 years or younger) said they were ""substantially worried"" about their children's behaviour, in contrast to just over a quarter (28%) of parents who had older children only (11 years or older). However, nearly half (45%) of those with secondary-age children were worried about their children's education and future, compared to 32% of those with young children. Leticea, a parent who took part in the study, said: ""I think that UK leaders should have access to this data to see what is going on with the mental health of families and how they are being affected by Covid-19 with increased levels of stress, depression and anxiety - we need something to look forward to. ""I am also worried that the next three months will show a sharper increase in anxiety and stress where parents are having to do more teaching at home. ""Children are more worried as their teachers are becoming ill - the 'new variant' sounds more scary, my daughter keeps commenting on an increasing worry of catching Covid-19 which she didn't do so much before."" Another parent, Madiha, said: ''Current times are hard enough as they are. ""As a working parent, the most important thing for me is to ensure my family's wellbeing, their safety, and their continued development. ""Prolonged screen time, disruption to daily routine, frequent arguments, lack of exercise, and stress of exams have all been contributing factors to our mental health and wellbeing. Madiha said she hoped the study would play a part in informing policy and developing interventions to help families. Cathy Creswell, professor of clinical developmental psychology at Oxford University and co-leader of the study, said the findings showed parents were particularly vulnerable to distress during the first lockdown. ""Our data highlight the particular strains felt by parents during lockdown when many feel that they have been spread too thin by the demands of meeting their children's needs during the pandemic, along with home-schooling and work commitments."" Schools were first closed to most pupils in March John Jolly, head of the charity Parentkind, said the research highlighted ""the additional stress and pressure that partial school closures place on parents"". ""Given the disruption to family life, it is vital that policymakers consult and listen to the concerns of parents on issues that directly impact them and their children's futures. ""This includes the safety and reopening of schools, the fair allocation of grades in the absence of exams, and remote learning provision."" The Oxford researchers are tracking children's and parents' mental health throughout the current crisis, to help them identify what protects young people from deteriorating mental health and how this may vary according to child and family characteristics.

"Boris Johnson will be glad Donald Trump has not been re-elected for a second term as US president, ex-Civil Service head Lord Sedwill has suggested. Writing in the Daily Mail, Lord Sedwill said those who believed Boris Johnson would have preferred Mr Trump to win again were ""mistaken."" He said he ""would not have been to the benefit"" of British or European security, trade or environment issues. Downing Street said Mr Johnson looked forward to working with Joe Biden. Boris Johnson's public reflections on Donald Trump have varied considerably. This month he said Mr Trump was ""completely wrong"" to cast doubt on the US election and encourage supporters to storm the Capitol. And in 2015, when he was Mayor of London, Mr Johnson accused him of ""stupefying ignorance"" over his comments about violence in the city. But after Mr Trump's victory in the US election in 2016, then Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson said there was a ""lot to be positive about"", and while running for the Conservative leadership in 2019, he said the President had ""many good qualities"".

But BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Lord Sedwill's remarks would not be unhelpful to Downing Street as any perception in Washington that Mr Johnson was like Mr Trump becomes a liability with the arrival of President Biden. In his Daily Mail article,,externalLord Sedwill, who was the UK's most senior civil servant until he stood down in September, said there was ""relief in Western capitals"" that normal diplomatic relationships will be restored once Mr Biden is inaugurated on Wednesday.

"Experts say there needs to be more research done into female child sexual abuse Victims of female child sexual abusers face ""enormous stigma and shame"", according to police and charities. Figures from BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4show there were over 10,400 reports of this type of abuse from 2015 to 2019 - equivalent to an average of 40 a week. Experts say there is still a ""lack of understanding"" about the extent of such abuse. The UK government said it would not allow ""any safe space for sex offenders to operate - male or female"". Between 2015 and 2019, the numbers of reported cases of female-perpetrated child sexual abuse to police in England and Wales rose from 1,249 to 2,297 - an increase of 84%. Dr Andrea Darling, a criminology researcher at Durham University - who has looked at 40 cases of male and female teachers who sexually abused students - said the File on 4 figures represented the ""tip of the iceberg"". She said that although all child sexual abuse was underreported, there was a particular ""lack of understanding"" of the extent of female-perpetrated abuse. ""That means that potentially abusive behaviour that may have been picked up if the perpetrator had been a male is explained away,"" she said. ""I've seen that consistently in my research."" She added it was ""fundamentally important"" to understand a lot more about this kind of child sexual abuse. Nicola*, who is now in her mid 20s, was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her mother from a young age. She said the onset of puberty was a trigger for the escalation of sexual abuse. ""My appearance was quite a weapon for her, which would often lead into more severe stuff.  She would criticise my body, and make me take my clothes off."" In common with many child sexual abuse victims, Nicola describes deep feelings of shame and self-loathing. She has never had a relationship, or any consensual sexual contact. ""I think people will see me as very dirty; which is what I feel myself. ""I don't feel anyone will believe me - how does a mother or a woman do this?  I imagine that so strongly that it is a real inhibitor to talk about it. But women can rape."" Nicola's abuse only ended when she left home at 16. She started going to counselling in 2018, after struggling to access the right treatment. Katherine Cox, of charity Survivors UK, supports and counsels victims of female abusers Katherine Cox, services manager with male and non-binary victim support charity Survivors UK, said she believes the File on 4 figures did not reflect an increase in abuse, but an increase in people feeling able to report to the authorities. However, she added, far too many victims ""believe they won't be believed"". ""The prosecution rates are really low for any survivor,"" Ms Cox said. ""I think for a male survivor of female perpetrated abuse, the reality of getting a conviction is usually going to be extremely low."" Survivors UK have a waiting list of 10 months for its counselling services. Detective Superintendent Mark Lewis of South Wales Police Of the 45 UK forces File on 4 asked for figures, 36 were able to provide data. Northern Ireland and Scotland said collating this information would take too long. File on 4's data shows the gender split between male and female victims is roughly half. Detective Superintendent Mark Lewis of South Wales Police, who oversees child sexual abuse cases for his force says although the number of cases of female abusers he has dealt with is small, there is ""a taboo element"" and the stigma victims face is ""quite enormous"". ""It's down to police to keep trying to give that reassurance to victims to report, regardless of their circumstances,"" he said. In 2018, 5,547 offenders were found guilty of child sexual abuse in England and Wales, according to the Ministry of Justice. There were 66 convictions of female abusers There were a total of 73,260 reports of child sexual abuse offences in England and Wales in the 12 months from March 2018 One in 25 resulted in a charge or court summons In 2018-19, 3.8% of all child sexual abusers were female, based on police reports,Office of National Statistics data,externalshows Up to 16% of those abused in residential care and 6% of those abused in other institutional contexts such as schools, sports and religious settings said female perpetrators were involved,according to data from victim reports,externalto the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) The government said it would ""not allow there to be any safe space for sex offenders to operate - either online or offline, male or female - and will do all we can to help survivors of abuse"". ""To this end, we will soon publish a first of its kind strategy to tackle all forms of child sexual abuse, including that perpetrated by female offenders,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have also made significant increases to the national and local funding available to support victims of child sexual abuse."" The Northern Irish Department of Justice said it was ""committed to ensuring victims of sexual abuse have access to co-ordinated support,"" and were introducing ""court reforms to reduce delay and stress on victims and witnesses"". The Scottish government said it has ""strengthened legislation and increased funding to make it easier for victims and survivors to speak out against abusers"", and work is being carried out to ""ensure better support for victims"". *Names have been changed to protect anonymity Women who Abuse is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 19 January at 20:00 GMT and will be available on BBC Soundshere.

"The UK is forging its post-Brexit path as a ""confident, independent nation - and an energetic force for good"", according to the government. It's free to set trade on its own terms, pursue opportunities and higher living standards. But can it square profit with principle? Is turning a blind eye to human rights violations worth it to have a trade deal that knocks a couple of quid off the price of an imported shirt? That New Year's resolution is already being tested, as China falls increasingly out of favour. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has referred to conditions, under which over a million Uighur Muslims are being held in camps and forced into work, as ""at the worst... torture and inhumane and degrading treatments"". 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems How many trade deals has the UK done so far? He warned that British companies will face fines, if they can't show that their supply chains are free from forced labour. In December, a BBC investigation revealedthousands of Uighurs and other minorities have been compelled to toil in the cotton fields of Xinjiang. The region accounts for a fifth of the world's crop - it's not always easy to tell where your t-shirt hails from. The UK and Canada have led the charge here, but one wonders how much further can it go. Mr Raab told the BBC that the UK should not be engaging in free trade negotiations with countries whose record was ""well below the level of genocide"". There are several issues with this: first, working out who gets to decree human rights abuses. Amendments to the Trade Bill currently going through Parliament would oblige the government to assess the human rights records of potential partners. In July, Dominic Raab accused China of ""gross and egregious"" human rights abuses against its Uighur population One amendment proposes allowing the High Court to declare a genocide in other countries, and forcing the immediate cancellation of trade deals with said nations. Mr Raab, however, says the decision to declare a genocide can't, and shouldn't be, delegated to the courts. Rather, it's for MPs to hold the government to account over trade deals. But Labour MPs, who have written to their Conservative counterparts urging them to support the amendments, say they've already been denied powers of scrutiny. They highlight trade deals rolled over with Egypt, Cameroon and Turkey, with whom the UK previously enjoyed similar deals the EU had struck. These three countries, they argue, have questionable records on human rights. And then there's China. The UK is not planning a deal with Beijing and has indicated it won't do a deal with countries that don't share its democratic values. But both nations have their eye on joining the wider Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. With imports and exports worth almost Â£80bn in 2019, China already scores as one of the UK's largest trading partners, and it's not just about frocks and financial services crossing borders. Since Xi Jinping and David Cameron famously sipped a pint in a Buckinghamshire pub in 2015, Chinese investment in the UK has exploded, backing everything from football clubs to restaurant chains. Now China's appeal has soured, but it may not be easy to back away from encouraging investment, or a trade deal which touts lower import prices and greater opportunities for exporters, when the UK economy is already reeling. The Wolverhampton Wanderers are owned by Chinese investors Fosun International Take textiles - a free trade deal would do away with a 12% tariff on clothes hailing from China. Ultimately, trade deals build on an existing - in this case very lucrative - relationship. Critics argue it's not enough to refrain from boosting ties with nations with chequered records - they should be lessened. But it's even harder to snub countries that are already providing jobs for thousands, or items from the frivolous, such as smartphones, to the vital, like billions of PPE items. Some say the UK has its own issues elsewhere. It resumed the sales of arms to Saudi Arabia last year, after the government said the method for licensing had been reformulated to ensure they wouldn't be used in Yemen. Human rights groups are less sure. Balancing its quest to be a responsible citizen, together with exploring fresh fortunes, is just one dilemma the UK faces, as it shapes its new identity on the global stage.

"This video can not be played Competitors in the Australian Open are having to practise in different circumstances this year Two more Australian Open tennis players have tested positive for Covid-19 after arriving in Melbourne, state health officials said on Tuesday. It comes after a player was believed to have tested positive on Sunday, amid growing controversy over the event. One more ""non-playing participant"" also has Covid, bringing the overall total linked to the Open to seven, including a flight attendant. Some 1,200 people have flown in for the tournament, which begins on 8 February. Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said in a statement that the latest three positive tests of two players and a non-participant were of a woman in her 20s and two men in their 30s, all of whom were in hotel quarantine. But there was confusion when Tennis Australia disputed the latest announcement. Chief executive Craig Tiley said no players had tested positive at all - only those in their entourages. He said no players were in the medi-hotel, to which people are transferred if they test positive while in hotel quarantine. Rows over quarantine rules have cast a shadow over the upcoming event. Some players have expressed frustration about being confined to hotel rooms full-time while other rivals are not. Australian Open players hit out at Covid isolation Tennis stars' arrival angers stranded Australians And some residents in Melbourne - a city which endured one of the world's longest lockdowns last year - have their own concerns about the potential Covid risk posed by the tournament. Positive cases on three flights have forced 72 players into full quarantine, meaning they have to isolate full-time in their hotel rooms for 14 days instead of being allowed outside to train like other participants. Mr Tiley insisted players had been made aware of the quarantine possibilities beforehand and said that some may have not taken it seriously and ""brushed it off"". But he acknowledged it was ""not an even playing field"" for those stuck in their hotel rooms, given their competitors have access to five hours of court practice a day. The majority of some 500 players attending the Open have accepted the conditions, organisers say. Labor MP Bill Shorten told players to ""get a grip"", adding: ""People have died. People lost their jobs... and you got these pampered sooks who are having a cry over their conditions."" World number one Novak Djokovic lobbied authorities to relax quarantine rules for players - including making the periods shorter. The suggestions earned him criticism from Australian player Nick Kyrgios, who tweeted: ""Djokovic is a tool."" Top-ranked Djokovic arrived in Australia last week ahead of the major Last year Djokovic organised an exhibition event in which he and others contracted the virus, drawing the disdain of Kyrgios at the time. Kyrgios also criticised the girlfriend of fellow Australian player Bernard Tomic after she featured in a news clip complaining about hotel food and having to wash her hair by herself. Vanessa Sierra has since said her comments were taken out of context and that she had received death threats, after her ""I don't wash my own hair"" quote was mocked online. While most players are being quarantined in Melbourne, Djokovic is part of a smaller group of big-name stars including Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka who are stationed in Adelaide for an exhibition match. Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka issued a plea to fellow players to show ""co-operation, understanding and empathy for the local community that has been going through a lot of very demanding restrictions"".

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez.

"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration US President-elect Joe Biden is to undo one of Donald Trump's last actions in office by blocking his decree lifting Covid travel bans on visitors from much of Europe and Brazil. Mr Biden's spokeswoman said now was not the time to be easing travel measures. Joe Biden will take office at 12:00 (17:00 GMT) on Wednesday. However, much of the spotlight is on Mr Trump's final moves, including presidential pardons. Security is intense in Washington DC ahead of the inauguration ceremony. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob on 6 January that left five people dead. The FBI had earlier warned of possible protests across the nation by right-wing extremists emboldened by the invasion. Latest updates: Pardons expected on Trump's final full day How the White House gets ready for a new president When are Biden and Harris sworn in? The US imposed travel restrictions on Europe last March and the Brazilian entry ban was put in place in May, but the White House decreed on Monday that the entry ban would end on 26 January, six days after Mr Biden takes office. Just minutes later, Mr Biden's spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said on Twitter: ""On the advice of our medical team, the administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of Covid-19."" She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One.

"This video can not be played Competitors in the Australian Open are having to practise in different circumstances this year Two more Australian Open tennis players have tested positive for Covid-19 after arriving in Melbourne, state health officials said on Tuesday. It comes after a player was believed to have tested positive on Sunday, amid growing controversy over the event. One more ""non-playing participant"" also has Covid, bringing the overall total linked to the Open to seven, including a flight attendant. Some 1,200 people have flown in for the tournament, which begins on 8 February. Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said in a statement that the latest three positive tests of two players and a non-participant were of a woman in her 20s and two men in their 30s, all of whom were in hotel quarantine. But there was confusion when Tennis Australia disputed the latest announcement. Chief executive Craig Tiley said no players had tested positive at all - only those in their entourages. He said no players were in the medi-hotel, to which people are transferred if they test positive while in hotel quarantine. Rows over quarantine rules have cast a shadow over the upcoming event. Some players have expressed frustration about being confined to hotel rooms full-time while other rivals are not. Australian Open players hit out at Covid isolation Tennis stars' arrival angers stranded Australians And some residents in Melbourne - a city which endured one of the world's longest lockdowns last year - have their own concerns about the potential Covid risk posed by the tournament. Positive cases on three flights have forced 72 players into full quarantine, meaning they have to isolate full-time in their hotel rooms for 14 days instead of being allowed outside to train like other participants. Mr Tiley insisted players had been made aware of the quarantine possibilities beforehand and said that some may have not taken it seriously and ""brushed it off"". But he acknowledged it was ""not an even playing field"" for those stuck in their hotel rooms, given their competitors have access to five hours of court practice a day. The majority of some 500 players attending the Open have accepted the conditions, organisers say. Labor MP Bill Shorten told players to ""get a grip"", adding: ""People have died. People lost their jobs... and you got these pampered sooks who are having a cry over their conditions."" World number one Novak Djokovic lobbied authorities to relax quarantine rules for players - including making the periods shorter. The suggestions earned him criticism from Australian player Nick Kyrgios, who tweeted: ""Djokovic is a tool."" Top-ranked Djokovic arrived in Australia last week ahead of the major Last year Djokovic organised an exhibition event in which he and others contracted the virus, drawing the disdain of Kyrgios at the time. Kyrgios also criticised the girlfriend of fellow Australian player Bernard Tomic after she featured in a news clip complaining about hotel food and having to wash her hair by herself. Vanessa Sierra has since said her comments were taken out of context and that she had received death threats, after her ""I don't wash my own hair"" quote was mocked online. While most players are being quarantined in Melbourne, Djokovic is part of a smaller group of big-name stars including Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka who are stationed in Adelaide for an exhibition match. Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka issued a plea to fellow players to show ""co-operation, understanding and empathy for the local community that has been going through a lot of very demanding restrictions"".

But Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut said that quarantine felt like prison. ""These people have no idea about tennis, about practice courts, about anything. It's a complete disaster... The control of everything is not Tennis Australia, it's the people from the government... I can't imagine staying two weeks like this."" He later apologised for his words, which he said were taken out of context, adding that Australia's efforts to combat Covid were ""admirable"".

"This video can not be played Support groups ""make me feel less lonely"", says nine-year-old Kieran Young carer services need ""sustainable funding"" and prioritisation for the safe re-opening of face-to-face support, according to a charity. Carers Trust Wales said it needs to be able to plan what support it could offer after lockdown, to help deal with the ""increasing isolation"". For young carers such as nine-year-old Kieran, those services have helped build confidence and make friends. The Welsh Government said more funding has gone towards supporting carers. It added: ""We encourage young carers to contact their local authority to get the help and support they are entitled to."" Young carers get 'death stares' while out shopping Carers 'worn out' by Covid and need services back Unpaid carers 'invisible' during pandemic Wales Live asked all local councils in Wales what they were doing to support young carers during the pandemic. Of the 17 that responded, 14 said they were now offering support services either online or over the phone, with four saying the need for additional support had increased over the past months. There were 7,544 young carers under the age of 16 in Wales, according to the last census in 2011, although Carers Trust Wales said this figure is now likely to be far higher following the start of the pandemic. The charity said resuming face-to-face support must be prioritised because the wellbeing and mental health of young carers have deteriorated, with the respite of schools now taken away. It said: ""We really need to find ways of creating the space for them to get a break, to get the time that they need to be themselves and to actually be children at this really difficult time and to think about how those services are planned."" Chloe, 13, asked to be trained to help use the dialysis machine so she can support her mother Chloe, 13, is one of those children balancing home-schooling with being a young carer, even helping with daily dialysis sessions for her mother Becky, who has kidney failure as well as other health conditions. Chloe asked to be trained to help use the dialysis machine so she can support her mother during the four-hour-long sessions, although admits it's sometimes a rush between schoolwork and helping out at home. The coronavirus pandemic has been even more 'tiring' because of the extra worry of her mother becoming unwell with the virus. Chloe and her family have been shielding since March last year. ""At first it was quite scary because, as the lockdown was easing a bit, you could see friends going out and hanging out with each other, but that wasn't an option for me,"" said Chloe. ""And in this lockdown it's the same. It's a bit sad because I wanted to be one of them people that hangs out with their friends."" While enjoying extra time with her parents, Chloe misses the young carers groups she attended each week before the pandemic. Now all her interaction with other young carers happens entirely online. ""It was hanging out with people who know what you're going through,"" she said. ""So you have a place where you can relax and not have to worry about people asking a bunch of questions. It was where you could just be normal and not have to worry."" Kieran's sister Tegan has Joubert's syndrome, which means she can struggle with communication and mobility Also relying on online support is nine-year-old Kieran, who is a young carer for his 11-year-old sister Tegan. Tegan hasJoubert's syndrome,external, a rare condition which means she can struggle with communication and mobility. While she is becoming more independent as she gets older, Kieran is sometimes more of an older brother than a younger brother and helps with things like getting dressed and ready for the day. He said the past 10 months have made him feel lonely. ""I am missing going to school because I stress a lot at home and I miss seeing my friends."" As well as going to school, Kieran said meeting other young carers through organised trips and activities helped him build his confidence and make new friends. That was until lockdown. Simon Hatch, director of Carers Trust Wales said lockdown and extra responsibilities were ""adding real pressure"" to young carers. ""They are giving us information about feeling frustrated, more isolated and lonely, particularly [at] not being able to engage with the services,"" he said. ""For many young carers, schools and being able to be at school with their friends is one of the only forms of respite they get, so you can imagine how much more difficult things are now."" The Welsh Government thanked young carers for the ""remarkable support"" they are providing during the pandemic. ""We are working with Carers Trust Wales to understand further the pressures young carers are facing and ensure they get support they need,"" added a spokesperson. ""We have also provided additional funding for mental health services and to support carers during this incredibly difficult time.""

"Experts say there needs to be more research done into female child sexual abuse Victims of female child sexual abusers face ""enormous stigma and shame"", according to police and charities. Figures from BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4show there were over 10,400 reports of this type of abuse from 2015 to 2019 - equivalent to an average of 40 a week. Experts say there is still a ""lack of understanding"" about the extent of such abuse. The UK government said it would not allow ""any safe space for sex offenders to operate - male or female"". Between 2015 and 2019, the numbers of reported cases of female-perpetrated child sexual abuse to police in England and Wales rose from 1,249 to 2,297 - an increase of 84%. Dr Andrea Darling, a criminology researcher at Durham University - who has looked at 40 cases of male and female teachers who sexually abused students - said the File on 4 figures represented the ""tip of the iceberg"". She said that although all child sexual abuse was underreported, there was a particular ""lack of understanding"" of the extent of female-perpetrated abuse. ""That means that potentially abusive behaviour that may have been picked up if the perpetrator had been a male is explained away,"" she said. ""I've seen that consistently in my research."" She added it was ""fundamentally important"" to understand a lot more about this kind of child sexual abuse. Nicola*, who is now in her mid 20s, was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her mother from a young age. She said the onset of puberty was a trigger for the escalation of sexual abuse. ""My appearance was quite a weapon for her, which would often lead into more severe stuff.  She would criticise my body, and make me take my clothes off."" In common with many child sexual abuse victims, Nicola describes deep feelings of shame and self-loathing. She has never had a relationship, or any consensual sexual contact. ""I think people will see me as very dirty; which is what I feel myself. ""I don't feel anyone will believe me - how does a mother or a woman do this?  I imagine that so strongly that it is a real inhibitor to talk about it. But women can rape."" Nicola's abuse only ended when she left home at 16. She started going to counselling in 2018, after struggling to access the right treatment. Katherine Cox, of charity Survivors UK, supports and counsels victims of female abusers Katherine Cox, services manager with male and non-binary victim support charity Survivors UK, said she believes the File on 4 figures did not reflect an increase in abuse, but an increase in people feeling able to report to the authorities. However, she added, far too many victims ""believe they won't be believed"". ""The prosecution rates are really low for any survivor,"" Ms Cox said. ""I think for a male survivor of female perpetrated abuse, the reality of getting a conviction is usually going to be extremely low."" Survivors UK have a waiting list of 10 months for its counselling services. Detective Superintendent Mark Lewis of South Wales Police Of the 45 UK forces File on 4 asked for figures, 36 were able to provide data. Northern Ireland and Scotland said collating this information would take too long. File on 4's data shows the gender split between male and female victims is roughly half. Detective Superintendent Mark Lewis of South Wales Police, who oversees child sexual abuse cases for his force says although the number of cases of female abusers he has dealt with is small, there is ""a taboo element"" and the stigma victims face is ""quite enormous"". ""It's down to police to keep trying to give that reassurance to victims to report, regardless of their circumstances,"" he said. In 2018, 5,547 offenders were found guilty of child sexual abuse in England and Wales, according to the Ministry of Justice. There were 66 convictions of female abusers There were a total of 73,260 reports of child sexual abuse offences in England and Wales in the 12 months from March 2018 One in 25 resulted in a charge or court summons In 2018-19, 3.8% of all child sexual abusers were female, based on police reports,Office of National Statistics data,externalshows Up to 16% of those abused in residential care and 6% of those abused in other institutional contexts such as schools, sports and religious settings said female perpetrators were involved,according to data from victim reports,externalto the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) The government said it would ""not allow there to be any safe space for sex offenders to operate - either online or offline, male or female - and will do all we can to help survivors of abuse"". ""To this end, we will soon publish a first of its kind strategy to tackle all forms of child sexual abuse, including that perpetrated by female offenders,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have also made significant increases to the national and local funding available to support victims of child sexual abuse."" The Northern Irish Department of Justice said it was ""committed to ensuring victims of sexual abuse have access to co-ordinated support,"" and were introducing ""court reforms to reduce delay and stress on victims and witnesses"". The Scottish government said it has ""strengthened legislation and increased funding to make it easier for victims and survivors to speak out against abusers"", and work is being carried out to ""ensure better support for victims"". *Names have been changed to protect anonymity Women who Abuse is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 19 January at 20:00 GMT and will be available on BBC Soundshere.

She said that with ""more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel"". Barred from Twitter following the Capitol riots, the president has been uncharacteristically quiet and there have been few details of what he might do on Tuesday. A statement from the White House press office read simply: ""President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings."" There has been no invitation to Joe Biden for the traditional pre-inauguration meeting at the White House. Melania and Donald Trump appear not to be planning any welcoming events for the Bidens Mr Trump still contests the election he fought with Mr Biden, although he has pledged a transition of power. The main focus will be on presidential pardons, with US media suggesting a list of some 100 people is being considered. The New York Times said some could be of criminals whose cases have been championed by justice activists. More controversial names include Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Mr Trump's former adviser Stephen Bannon. Rapper Lil Wayne, a prominent Trump supporter, is also reported to be on the list. He pleaded guilty to possession of a gold-plated handgun, which was loaded when his chartered private jet landed in Miami in December 2019. How do presidential pardons work? Friends ofJoe Exotic, the star of the Netflix documentary Tiger Kingwho is serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse, are also hopeful he could be pardoned. Then, of course, there is Donald Trump.Could the president pardon himself?It is unclear either whether he plans to do so or even if it is legally possible. This video can not be played Outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others The ceremony will be unlike any other. The number of spectators will be greatly reduced, some 25,000 National Guard soldiers are being deployed and Donald Trump will snub his successor by not attending - something that has not happened for more than 150 years. On Monday, the Capitol complex was briefly locked down after a security alert. Some 200,000 flags, bathed in light, have been planted on the National Mall to represent the crowds who cannot attend and reflect on those who have lost their lives to Covid. The flags commemorate the nearly 400,000 Americans who lost their lives to Covid-19 The inauguration ceremony will feature performances by Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Trump will head to Florida early on Wednesday, using up his presidential travel privileges by taking Marine One to Joint Base Andrews and then boarding Air Force One. Bloomberg said Mr Trump was planning a military send-off for himself at Andrews. On Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver an evening address on Covid from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He is set to immediately reverse a number of Trump policies, scrapping the ban on travellers from some mainly Muslim countries and rejoining the Paris climate accord. He will also focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border and issuing mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Bidenwill also cancel the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office, US media report. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing The pipeline is projected to carry oil nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Canadian province of Alberta down to Nebraska, to join an existing pipeline. Environmentalists and Native American groups have fought the project for more than a decade. Confirmation hearings for Mr Biden's appointees begin later on Tuesday.

"Mass vaccination has already started in several countries, including Russia The world faces a ""catastrophic moral failure"" because of unequal Covid vaccine policies, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was not fair for younger, healthy people in richer nations to get injections before vulnerable people in poorer states. He said over 39 million vaccine doses had been given in 49 richer states - but one poor nation had only 25 doses. Meanwhile, both the WHO and China were criticised for their Covid response. An independent panel commissioned by the WHO said the UN public health body should have declared an international emergency earlier, and also rapped China for not taking public health measures sooner. India begins world's biggest Covid vaccine drive Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? So far, China, India, Russia, the UK and the US have all developed Covid vaccines, with others being made by multinational teams - like the American-German Pfizer vaccine. Almost all of these nations have prioritised distribution to their own populations. Speaking at a WHO executive board session on Monday, Dr Tedros said,external, ""I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries."" Dr Tedros said a ""me-first"" approach would be self-defeating because it would push up prices and encourage hoarding. ""Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering,"" he added. This video can not be played A 'bittersweet' moment for India's health workers And the WHO head called for a full commitment to the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax, which is due to start rolling out next month. ""My challenge to all member states is to ensure that by the time World Health Day arrives on 7 April, Covid-19 vaccines are being administered in every country, as a symbol of hope for overcoming both the pandemic and the inequalities that lie at the root of so many global health challenges,"" Dr Tedros said. So far, more than 180 countries have signed up to the Covax initiative, which is supported by the WHO and a group of international vaccine advocacy groups. Its aim is to unite countries into one bloc so they have more power to negotiate with drug companies. Ninety-two countries - all of them low or middle-income - will have their vaccines paid for by a fund sponsored by donors. ""We have secured two billion doses from five producers, with options of more than one billion more doses, and we aim to start deliveries in February,"" Dr Tedros said. Reacting to Dr Tedros' warning, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The UK is the world's biggest supporter, financial supporter, of the global programme to ensure access to vaccines in all countries in the world."" Mr Hancock said the UK had ""put the most financial support in these international efforts to ensure everybody has access to vaccines"". The UK government has provided Â£548m ($734m) to the Covax programme. More thanfour million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures. People in their 70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable in England are now among those being offered the jab. Last month,the People's Vaccine Alliance coalition of campaigning bodies said that rich countries were hoarding doses of Covid vaccinesand people living in poor countries were set to miss out. It said that nearly 70 lower-income countries would only be able to vaccinate one in 10 people. Canada, in particular, came in for criticism, with the coalition saying the North American nation had ordered enough vaccine doses to protect each Canadian five times. In December, Karina Gould, Canada's minister of international development, denied allegations the country was hoarding vaccines, saying any discussion of a surplus was ""hypothetical"" as the doses had not been delivered. She said Canada was providing C$485 million ($380 million; Â£280 million) to help developing countries cope with Covid-19. In their interim report, the panel of independent experts said both China and the WHO should have acted faster during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. The document said that Beijing should have acted more forcefully to localise the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan first detected in late 2019. The experts also criticised the WHO for only declaring a global emergency on 30 January 2020. ""The global pandemic alert system is not fit for purpose,"" the report said. ""The World Health Organization has been underpowered to do the job."" The panel of experts was led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

"21-year-old Amelia's Depop account was hacked by a fraudster When Amelia Strike, 21, was logged out of her Depop social shopping app account in October, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. ""I thought I had just forgotten my password when I couldn't get back in, but a couple of days passed and I realised something wasn't right,"" says the Birmingham-based law student. She then received a message from a stranger on Instagram, alerting her to the fact that her account had been taken over by a scammer advertising Apple AirPod headphones for Â£50. She immediately used her brother's Depop account to comment on the offending post and contact the app. It was removed by the firm in a few hours and her password was reset. But when Ms Strike logged back in, she was shocked by what she found. ""I felt sick - I scrolled and scrolled through hundreds of messages people had sent the scammer,"" she says. The fraudster had been instructing shoppers to pay them directly through PayPal's ""Friends and Family"" option, which sidesteps Depop's fees and doesn't offer any protection for buyers. The scammer sent messages like this one to other Depop users from Amelia's account Ms Strike counted at least three Depop users who made unauthorised payments of Â£50 to the scammer. In Ms Strike's situation, to get users to trust scam listing, the hacker had also uploaded a photo of her name on a post-it note next to the headphones that were supposedly for sale. This is a common tactic used by people selling second-hand items online, to prove that the photos were not stolen from another listing. ""I just felt so violated,"" she says. Depop says train seat crop top violates its terms Can pre-loved clothes make fast fashion sustainable? 'I made Â£1,265 selling my clothes second-hand' She is not alone - 14 other users have told BBC News that their Depop accounts have been hacked in recent months. In all cases, the fraudsters demanded to be paid directly, rather than through the app. Blending the look and social elements of Instagram with the buy-and-sell format of eBay, 90% of Depop's users are aged 26 or under. Emily Goold, 21, a journalism student in Tewkesbury, was scared when her account was hacked and a fraudster posted a listing for a Â£350 jacket. Emily Goold, 21, told the BBC a fraudster hacked her Depop account and advertised a Â£350 Moncler jacket Depop took the listing down within 12 hours and reset her password, but Ms Goold says such incidents are becoming commonplace. ""You always know somebody who's had a Depop horror story. It's such a widespread problem now."" Scammers have continued to plague many online services through the pandemic. One ""have a go"" method called ""credential stuffing"" involves using automated tools to repeatedly log into accounts, entering usernames and password information previously exposed from data breaches of other popular online services. If a user doesn't use the same password on multiple services or has changed their passwords after being exposed in a data breach, this won't work. According to Liv Rowley, a threat intelligence analyst at cyber-security firm Blueliv, cyber criminals are now targeting Depop accounts on an ""industrial scale"" using this method, capitalising on the fact that people often use similar passwords. Blending the look and social elements of Instagram with the buy-and-sell format of eBay, 90% of Depop's users are aged 26 or under Depop told the BBC that the safety and security of its community is its ""number one priority"", and that the service has never had a data breach or had its infrastructure compromised. The firm confirmed that credential stuffing is a big part of the problem. ""Weak passwords and the use of the same password across multiple accounts is the greatest source of account takeover, which is why we have initiated a campaign in the second half of 2020 to force some users to strengthen their passwords and to remind others of the importance of strong and unique passwords,"" says Depop's chief operating officer Dominic Rose. Depop has started resetting passwords for some 12 million users that have not changed them in over a year and told the BBC it had sent reminders to a similar number to make sure their log-in details are unique. ""We will continue to remind our community about the importance of account security and updating their passwords."" The firm, founded in 2011, told the BBC that although the number of its users increased nearly two-fold to 26 million last year, it had seen a 50% decrease in account ""takeovers"" since its campaign began. But Blueliv found that login details for several thousand hacked Depop accounts are being advertised for as little as $1.05 (77p) each on the dark web - a part of the internet that is only accessible using specialised tools. While a Vice investigation,externalfirst highlighted the problem in May, there is now evidence that account logins are being sold across multiple dark web ""marketplaces"". The information for sale includes usernames and passwords, with extra charged for details such as follower count, the number of sales completed by a user and their ratings by other shoppers. On the dark net marketplace White House Market, ""premium"" Depop accounts are being sold for $5 ""The accounts are being compromised and that definitely is concerning,"" Ms Rowley says. ""While it's not a Depop-specific problem, I think [credential stuffing] is one we're going to see expand in the next five years."" One Depop user told the BBC they would feel ""much more comfortable"" if the app introduced two-factor authentication, where users enter a one-time code sent to them via email or text, for example, after attempting to sign in. Depop confirmed that it intends to implement multi-factor authentication in 2021. But Aman Johal, director at law firm Your Lawyers, which specialises in consumer action claims, says the platform needs to act urgently, ""particularly given its relatively young user base, where the duty of care is greater"". ""The fact that this has been going on for months...is unacceptable. Given the volume of compromised accounts for sale, the horse has already bolted,"" he added. For some users, trust in the company has been dented. ""I feel like their security measures need to be amped up because it's just not good enough,"" says Ms Strike, who has been a Depop user since 2015. ""I've used [Depop] for a long time but I'm reluctant to continue because it just doesn't feel safe anymore.""

"Jane works as an administrator for a private healthcare firm in Oxfordshire, a job she is expected to do from the office, even in lockdown. However, since she caught Covid-19 at work before Christmas, she has chosen to work from home because she feels safer - something that is causing problems with her boss. ""The office is so small and it is impossible to socially distance,"" she tells the BBC. ""My boss also didn't follow guidelines when I got ill and no one was told to isolate. It was so irresponsible."" Jane argues that her job, which is computer and phone-based, can be done easily from home. She feels that she is only following government guidelines. Concerns over bosses breaking Covid safety rules Can my boss force me to go to work? Plumbing firm to make workers get vaccinations However, she says her boss wants her to come back in and she cannot hold out much longer: ""I have a mortgage to pay, I can't risk losing my home."" Under current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so, including in areas such as healthcare. But there are concerns that bosses are breaking Covid safety rules, with the head of the UK's unions calling for tougher enforcement. Between 6 and 14 January, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received 3,934 complaints relating to coronavirus and took enforcement action in 81 cases. That usually meant a verbal or written warning however, with only one company facing tougher action. Policing can be a problem as well, as some workers fear reprisals if they speak up. George says he works in the office of a construction firm where social distancing rules ""are ignored or undermined"". He is torn about whether to complain. He and 10 close colleagues could all do their jobs easily from home - and did so during the first lockdown - but that is not an option this time, even though half of them are over 60, with two people in the high-risk category. ""I was given a template letter saying we are unable to work from home, despite all of us having done so easily for six months prior,"" he tells the BBC. ""There's only one way to report this internally and doing that clearly flags you for redundancy."" He says the situation forces you to ""weigh up having a job in the pandemic, or standing up for what you think is right"". Under current lockdown restrictions, people across the UK who can work effectively from home should do so. They should only travel to their workplace if they cannot do their job remotely. This includes,externalhealthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers. For workplaces that remain open in England, employers must ""carry out an appropriate Covid-19 risk assessment"" to develop a ""specific"" strategy to stop the virus's spread. In England, guidelines set out strict measures,externalwhich employers must follow, such as minimising the number of unnecessary visits to the office, frequent cleaning of workspaces and ensuring that staff observe 2m (6ft) social distancing wherever possible. There is similar guidance for employers across a range of sectors inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Read more from our Explainers team here. The HSE, which has done 33,000 site visits since March, told the BBC it continued to ""scale up"" its checks on employers. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) wants the government to strengthen enforcement and give the HSE more resources. Some say nothing will change, unless the government changes the rules to ensure only people doing essential work go in. John (not his real name) from Gloucester is part of a team installing smart meters in people's homes for SSE, the energy company owned by Ovo. He tells the BBC he doesn't feel safe doing the job, which requires him to go into five or six people's homes each day, usually for several hours at a time. And while he accepts his job cannot be done from home, he thinks energy suppliers should only be doing essential emergency work as they did during the first lockdown, not installing smart meters which are largely about improving energy efficiency. ""We all know the quickest way to spread a virus is contact,"" he tells the BBC, adding that he thinks staff like him should be furloughed. ""They have given us face coverings and gloves, but NHS staff wear high grade PPE and yet they are still dying."" An SSE spokeswoman said the safety and wellbeing of staff was its ""primary focus"" and that the firm was open to discussing furlough options with staff. ""We have created rigorous protocols for working in homes including the opportunity for both the engineer or customer to cancel an appointment, or abort a job, if they do not feel comfortable,"" she said. Steve, who spent the last three months working at a fulfilment warehouse in Stoke-on-Trent, says he was shocked by the disregard for coronavirus rules at the site. He said social distancing was ""non-existent"", with people working ""side by side"", but when he complained the managers did nothing. ""They were more interested in getting the product out,"" he adds. However, he felt he had no choice but to keep working, even when he learned that someone in the warehouse canteen had come down with Covid. A spokesman for the government says it has worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to produce ""comprehensive Covid-secure guidance"", so that businesses permitted to remain open can do so safely: ""This is kept under review as our understanding of the virus develops.""

"LAS received almost 200,000 calls in December - up 50,000 on November, when London was in the second national lockdown Last week London exceeded the grim milestone of 10,000 deaths linked to Covid-19. Thousands of people are critically ill in hospital, and as many as 5% of Londoners are thought to have the virus in some parts of the city. As coronavirus continues to circulate silently around the capital, staff at the London Ambulance Service (LAS) are under immense pressure. The service is currently taking up to 8,500 calls a day, compared with a pre-Covid figure of 5,000 to 6,000, according to its chief executive Garrett Emmerson. Lizzie Cooke is one of the workers at LAS's south London headquarters who are dealing with strangers at what is a distressing time. Calmly, the 30-year-old answers the phone and usually asks first if the patient is breathing. ""In the first wave we were getting a lot of calls of [people seeking] reassurance,"" Lizzie says. ""But now there are more and more who have symptoms, and family members are really frightened."" It is a fear that Lizzie knows all too well, having been hospitalised with Covid-19 in March. She spent a week receiving treatment for the virus. ""I was at work taking calls and struggling to concentrate,"" the call-handling supervisor says. ""At times I would just have my head on the desk in between calls. ""I started to develop chest pains five days later so my parents took me to Royal County Hospital, in Hampshire, and an X-ray showed a lot of fluid in my lungs. It was quite horrible. ""Luckily, I wasn't on a ventilator but I had the oxygen hood, and the nurses were so rushed off their feet. I didn't have my phone with me or know my parents' numbers off by heart so for that week I was quite alone and isolated. ""It was just a mixture of the unknown and not knowing when it was going to stop that was so daunting."" The unprecedented volume of calls means waiting times for patients are increasing Lizzie's personal battle with coronavirus has helped her to empathise with people who call up with breathing problems. It's something she says she's having to do more and more. ""Just before Christmas we were getting a lot of respiratory and cardiac arrest calls,"" she says. ""You could just hear colleagues counting to four [for chest compressions] and it was echoing around the room. It has been tough. ""We are getting calls from family members who are really frightened. I covered the London Bridge terror attacks and Grenfell but this is a different scale. ""I did get one call for toothache, but that's part of the job."" The hospital hit by a coronavirus 'tidal wave' of patients London's Covid death toll exceeds 10,000 Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says Lizzie, who lives in Hampshire, says that because the coverage of coronavirus is everywhere, it is ""difficult to escape"". When she's not at work she binge-watches Line of Duty on Netflix, but she says winding down isn't easy. Lizzie sometimes thinks about the people who aren't following the rules aimed at helping stop the spread of the virus, and those who deny Covid-19 even exists. ""It's a kick in the teeth,"" she says. ""It is frustrating on the way to work when you see people not wearing masks or even posting stuff on social media not believing the virus is real. ""I just don't know where the disconnect is coming from; there are many people in hospital, many people dying, and I don't know what more needs to be said to make them realise how dangerous the illness is."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Sitting a few metres away from Lizzie is 24-year-old Louise Essam, who has been in the job for two years. ""Every call we take at the moment is coronavirus,"" she says. ""My record was 108 calls in a day back in March during the first wave. ""But easily in the last few weeks I've been taking around 100 a day at times,"" Louise adds. ""We are just doing the best we can,"" says emergency call co-ordinator Louise Essam ""Sometimes I'll come in for a shift and can just hear colleagues counting one, two, three, four, for the compressions, and you just know what kind of shift it is going to be. ""It has been tough and quite frustrating, really. We are trying to help people. We are under so much pressure as there are high waiting times, but we are just doing the best we can."" Help is at hand though from the LAS workers' fellow emergency services personnel. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick visited Wembley Stadium on Wednesday, where her officers are being trained to drive ambulances Seventy-five Met Police officers are currently being trained at Wembley Stadium to drive ambulances. They will start work as drivers from 20 January, joining the 200 firefighters who are already helping LAS. ""It came as a huge relief when they announced it,"" says 37-year-old paramedic Ben West. Ben West has been with the London Ambulance Service for 13 years As is the case with many frontline workers, Ben says he is concerned about the dangers of exposure to coronavirus. He has lost four colleagues to Covid-19, including Ian Reynolds, a paramedic based in Croydon, and Melonie Mitchell, a member of the NHS 111 team. They both died during the first wave in April. ""I wouldn't be a normal person if I said I wasn't scared,"" he says. ""I am scared and I do worry but we take every day as it comes, take our precautions and we just see where we go with that. ""We know the virus is out there in the community and we are not immune.""

"Northern Ireland's hospitals have faced intense pressure in recent weeks Medical staff are expected to ""face pressures unlike any other they have faced before"" as NI approaches its toughest week so far in the pandemic. The British Medical Association has said while its doctors are ""coping"", many feel they are unable to give care to the ""standard they would want"". The peak in intensive care is predicted to happen next weekend. The head of the BMA in NI, Dr Tom Black has been critical of the way this wave of the pandemic has been managed. He said: ""Staff will do their best in a very difficult situation, where many decisions in this pandemic were made too late."" While it is expected the number of hospital admissions will peak sometime over the next eight to 10 days, the number requiring intensive care treatment is likely to continue increasing for at least another fortnight. Dr Black said he was concerned for both patients and staff. He said: ""It is likely that over the next few weeks doctors will be asked to work in a new location or provide support to areas that are already overstretched. ""Many have already had planned annual leave cancelled."" There were a further 19 virus-related deaths and 640 more Covid-19 cases reported in Northern Ireland on Monday. The latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,625, while 96,001 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began. Some 65 patients are in ICU, down two from the last report, and 51 patients are being ventilated. Sincethe vaccine rolloutbegan in NI, 146,733 people have been vaccinated, according to the Department of Health. Of that number, 125,717 were first doses and 21,016 were second jabs. A total of 31,393 people from the over-80 age group have been vaccinated. Earlier the BMA told BBC News NI that more than 90,000 doses the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had arrived in Northern Ireland but the Department of Health has said it is anticipated separate deliveries will arrive by this weekend. Dr Black said many staff members had reported feeling ""exhausted and demoralised"" and he warned that when it came to reviewing how the pandemic was handled ""this phase will stand out as one where we could have planned better"". Health Minister Robin Swann said the next seven days is ""when we will see that real intense pressure coming on our inpatients and intensive care units"". ""Our worst case scenario has modelling up to 1,200 inpatients - and that's a serious pressure that comes on our system,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. Robin Swann says increasing ICU capacity puts staff under ""severe pressure"" ""We can go up into nearly 200 ICU capacity but that comes at a stretch, that comes with putting our staff under severe pressure in ICU units. ""It also comes by having to shift the ICU specialist nurse from a ratio of one-to-one to a ratio of one-to-two or even one-to-three in extreme pressures. ""That's not something we want to do,"" he added. The past week saw hospitals across Northern Ireland coming together in order to cope with the strain. On 10 January,the Southern Health Trust was on the cusp of declaring a major incidentamid the mounting pressures across the health service. That was avoided as many off-duty staff answered a call to come into work and the health trusts pulled together to provide a regional response to the crisis. Patients were diverted to those hospitals which could take them and where infrastructure could cope with supplying additional oxygen to the very ill. Over the weekend of 9/10 January the Southern Health Trust - the smallest of the health trusts - was dealing with the highest number of patients who required oxygen. In the past week the Northern and Southern Health Trusts have seen the highest number of patients. That reflects the high rate of community transmission in some areas those trusts cover. Meanwhile, no resolution has been reached between Stormont leaders and the Irish Government over the sharing of passenger data. Last week, First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill criticised Dublin for failing to share information on travellers arriving there during the pandemic. Michelle O'Neill said it was ""regrettable"" the issue has not been resolved First Minister Arlene Foster said repeated efforts to access data on passenger locator forms filled out by people arriving in the Republic of Ireland had failed. Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill indicated on Thursday that they planned to raise the matter directly with Taoiseach (Irish prime minsiter) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Ms O'Neill told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday that no resolution has been found yet. She told MLAs the issue had been raised ""on every occasion we have had the opportunity"" and that it was ""regrettable"" that the issue had not been resolved. The travel issue will be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday involving the first minister, the deputy first minister, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and NI Secretary of State Brandon Lewis. ""I hope that perhaps Wednesday's meeting will allow some opportunity for there to be a way forward,"" the deputy first minister added. It was announced on Sunday that all travellers who have returned from Portugal ortransited through 16 South American countries,externalin the past 14 days will have to - along with their household - self-isolate for 10 days upon return to Northern Ireland. This includes travellers who entered these countries en route to another destination. All travellers returning home from South America are advised to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms. From Thursday,all international travellers will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test result,externalbefore arriving in Northern Ireland. This rule comes into effect inEngland, Scotland and Wales on Monday. On Monday, the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported eight more coronavirus-related deaths. It brings its death toll to 2,616. The department said 2,121 new cases of the virus had been reported, with a cumulative total of 174,843 infections. It said that as of 14:00 local time on Monday, 1,975 Covid-19 patients are in hospital, of which 200 are in ICU (intensive care units). Irish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan, said: ""This third wave of the pandemic has seen higher level of hospitalisations across all age groups.

"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with""approved proof of vaccination"".,externalThis now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February. Will travel return to normal this summer? What Covid rules remain across the UK? Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure. They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately froma government-approved list of providers.,external If this is positive, they need toself-isolate. However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. All unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete apassenger locator form,externalbefore departure.

"Lisbet Stone is stranded at Madrid Airport due to having an out-of-date coronavirus test result Passenger Lisbet Stone says she is stuck in Madrid Airport after airline officials said her coronavirus test result was out of date. From Monday, travellers arriving in the UK, whether by boat, train or plane,have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. The test must be taken in the three days before travelling. For those with connecting flights, the test must be 72 hours before your final departure point to England. Anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500. Mrs Stone originally travelled to Cuba in February 2020 to see family. The British Cuban dual national was unable to fly home to the UK when Cuba closed its borders in March. What are the new UK travel rules? Covid: Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? 'Urgent' aviation support plea over travel curbs The family say she had several previous flights cancelled before finally being able to leave this weekend. She hasn't been able to see her four children or her husband Trevor in 11 months. The government are understood to be speaking to Air Europa to try to get Mrs Stone home. Carriers have been told that they should permit stranded passengers to board and will not be fined for doing so. While Mrs Stone has been caught out by the new restrictions for incoming travellers, the first day of the new regulations appeared to go smoothly.

""She's crying her eyes out,"" says Trevor Stone, her husband. ""I feel absolutely helpless. She doesn't have any Euros as she wasn't meant to stay in Spain. The authorities have given her no help whatsoever, we are just trying to understand what to do.

"In 2009, Spector was convicted of the 2003 murder of Hollywood actress Lana Clarkson The BBC has apologised for the original headline in its reporting of the death of the convicted murderer Phil Spector. The former music producer died on Saturday at the age of 81, while serving a prison sentence for the murder of Lana Clarkson in 2003. The first version on the breaking news story on the BBC News website carried the headline: ""Talented but flawed producer Phil Spector dies aged 81"". The BBC said the headline ""did not meet our editorial standards"". The text was quickly changed to: ""Pop producer jailed for murder dies at 81."" ""This was changed within minutes and we also deleted a tweet that had gone out automatically with the original headline,""a statement issued by the BBC read. ""We apologise for this error."" Murderer and music producer Spector dies at 81 Obituary: Phil Spector ""Our coverage of the story across BBC News has been clear that Phil Spector was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson and had a long history of violence and abuse,"" it continued. Spector was convicted of murdering Clarkson, an actress, in 2009. His death was confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Reacting to the original version of the BBC's story, pop starLily Allen tweeted,external: ""Rolling eyes at all the journos deliberately downplaying Phil Spector being a murderer in their headlines, so everyone points this out while linking to their articles resulting in lots of clicks."" ""He murdered Lana Clarkson""posted Labour MP Apsana Begum,external. ""Unforgivable reporting."" ""How about 'Murderer, Phil Spector dies aged 81'?"" offered author and historian Hallie Rubenhold. The headline was also discussed on TV and radio programmes on Monday, including Loose Women and Radio 4's Woman's Hour, and promptedan article in the Guardian,external. The phrasing of the BBC's article - and others like it -  were ""a reflection of how a man's 'genius' is often viewed as more important than a woman's humanity,"" said columnist Arwa Mahdawi. Spector, who transformed pop with his ""wall of sound"" recordings, worked with The Beatles, The Righteous Brothers and Tina Turner. But after the commercial failure of Tina Turner's River Deep, Mountain High, he largely withdrew from public life, and entered a long decline, marked by erratic behaviour, heavy drinking, and a fondness for guns. His turbulent marriage to Ronettes singer Veronica Bennett, known as Ronnie Spector, ended in divorce. ""Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio,"" she wrote after his death was announced. ""Darkness set in, many lives were damaged."" Singer Darlene Love, who sang on several songs Spector produced, said he ""changed the sound of rock 'n' roll"" but likened their relationship to ""a bad marriage"". ""The problem I have with Phil is that he wanted to control Darlene Love's talent,"" she told Variety. ""If he couldn't do that, he was going to do everything in his power to keep my talent from shining."" Weeks before Lana Clarkson was shot dead, Spector gave a rare interview to British broadsheet The Telegraph.
