"Mike Dorricott, pictured with his daughter Sarah, died in 2015 Conservative leadership contender Jeremy Hunt failed to keep his promise to a man with terminal cancer during his time as health secretary, an inquiry was told. Mike Dorricott died in 2015 from liver cancer linked to the hepatitis C he contracted through infected blood. His widow Ann told the inquiry into the scandal Mr Hunt had promised to ""sort out"" a settlement for victims. A spokesman for Mr Hunt said he had ""pushed for this landmark inquiry"". Mr Dorricott, who died aged 47, campaigned for fair compensation for those affected by contaminated blood products before his death and met Mr Hunt, his South West Surrey MP, on numerous occasions. More news from Yorkshire The inquiry is looking at why 4,800 people with haemophiliawere infected with hepatitis C or HIVin the 1970s and 1980s. More than 2,000 are thought to have died. By Hugh Pym, BBC News health editor It was the first strong criticism of a politician at the infected blood inquiry and it won't be the last. Ann Dorricott recalled a meeting with Jeremy Hunt and his officials in 2014 when he seemed to indicate support for the idea of a ""fair and final settlement"".  Campaigners have long called for full compensation for victims and their families covering loss of earnings and recompense for their mistreatment by the NHS. Currently they get financial support intended to cover living costs.  Compensation has not been delivered in the UK as it has in Ireland, hence Ann Dorricott's view that a promise had been broken.  A spokesperson for Mr Hunt said he had increased financial support since the meeting and pushed for the inquiry. As the hearings continue this year and next, former health secretaries will be called to give evidence and the former Prime Minister Sir John Major.  The inquiry will probe the Government's handling of what's been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Mrs Dorricott told the inquiry, sitting in Leeds, that a meeting had been held shortly after her husband's terminal diagnosis to discuss a ""fair and final settlement"" for the victims. ""When Mike told the room that it was terminal, Mike got very upset, very emotional,"" she said. ""Towards the end of the meeting, Jeremy Hunt came to myself and Mike, shook our hands and said to us, 'don't worry about this, we'll sort it'. ""Those were his words."" This sign was placed outside Jeremy Hunt's constituency office in Surrey after Mr Dorricott's death Counsel to the inquiry, Jenni Richards, asked Mrs Dorricott about her witness statement. ""You say in your statement this 'since that meeting he has not fulfilled his promise'. That is your view and that was Mike's view?"" Mrs Dorricott replied: ""Yes."" A spokesman for Mr Hunt, currently foreign secretary, said: ""The Dorricott family are among thousands who have faced tragedy as a result of this appalling injustice. ""As well as increasing the financial support for victims, Jeremy pushed for this landmark inquiry because those affected have a right to know what went wrong and why."" The family said Mr Dorricott, who had mild haemophilia, had been given a contaminated blood product in 1982 during routine dental surgery in Huddersfield near his home in West Yorkshire. He would only discover he had hepatitis C almost 25 years later, and numerous treatments and two liver transplants followed before he was told his condition was terminal in 2014. ""We tried to lead a normal life for the girls, but it was just out of our control,"" Mrs Dorricott told the inquiry. Blood victims 'given death sentence' What is the infected blood scandal?

"Police have suspended work with the UK's biggest private forensic company following a cyber-attack on the firm. The suspension has led to delays in forensic testing, which could impact on court cases. Eurofins Forensic Services carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK. Its parent company, Eurofins, suffered a ransomware attack on 1 or 2 June, which is under criminal investigation. Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to unlock access. It is the latest in a series of major forensic science problems to hit police forces since the closure of the government-owned service in England and Wales in 2012. Forensics error drug-drive cases quashed Met investigator 'botched' cases Forensic science standards 'at risk' An emergency police response has been put in place, led by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which took the decision to ""temporarily suspend"" all submissions to Eurofins. Eurofins, which caters for over 50% of the UK market,deals with over 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year.,external A group of senior officers will ensure the most serious crimes are given priority, as well as ensuring other forensic providers aren't overloaded with submissions. ""Our priority is to minimise the impact on the criminal justice system,"" said the NPCC lead for forensics, Chief Constable James Vaughan. ""It is too early to fully quantify the impact but we are working at pace with partners to understand and mitigate the risks."" The Crown Prosecution Service said a police investigation was ongoing, but at this stage there was ""no evidence to suggest that previous convictions were unsafe"". A spokesperson added: ""The CPS is assessing current cases to identify any impact on criminal trials as a result of this attack, and will ensure all necessary action is taken to allow them to proceed fairly."" Eurofins said the attack ""caused disruption to many of its IT systems in several countries"" ina statement on it website.,external It said it believed the attack was carried out by ""highly sophisticated well-resourced perpetrators"" and the ransomware involved appears to have been a ""new malware variant"". The National Crime Agency is conducting an investigation into the cyber attack, supported by the National Cyber Security Centre. A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with law enforcement and justice partners to investigate the sources of the attack and minimise any impact on our criminal justice system."" Forensic science work has been carried out by private firms and police laboratories in England and Wales since the closure of the government's Forensic Science Service in 2012. Last year 40 drug-driving offences were quashed and thousands of cases were reviewed after data was allegedly manipulated at Randox Testing Services. Another company - Key Forensic Services - collapsed in January 2018, while the Met Police also had to carry out a review after a forensic scientist apparently botched examinations. Eurofins has seven laboratories in the UK - Teddington, south-west London; Leeds Dock, in Leeds; Risley, Cheshire; Wakefield, west Yorkshire; Culham, Oxfordshire; Fordham, Cambridgeshire; Tamworth, Staffordshire. It also provides a range of other screening services to industry, agriculture and the pharmaceutical sector. The impact on these services is unclear.

"Nicola Sturgeon discussed the Tory leadership race during a trip to the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh The Conservative party leadership race proves that Scotland is on a ""different political path"" to the rest of the UK, according to Scotland's first minister. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are going head-to-head to become the next Tory leader and prime minister. Both men say they are prepared to leave the European Union without a deal. At the Royal Highland Show, Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland both candidates were ""out of touch"" with mainstream opinion in Scotland. Supporters of both Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, and former London mayor Mr Johnson say they will unite the country. Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Stage set for Johnson v Hunt Quick Q&A: Tory candidates' Brexit plans The pair won the most support in the final round of voting among Tory MPs on Thursday, which saw Environment Secretary Michael Gove eliminated. They will now both go to a ballot of the wider membership of the Conservative party. Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt took part in the BBC leaders debate Ms Sturgeon said the leadership contest - which has been dominated by discussions on Brexit - highlighted stark differences between Scotland and the UK on the issue. A total of 51.9% of UK voters opted to leave in the EU referendum in 2016, but the figure was much lower in Scotland where only38% voted in favour of Brexit. Ms Sturgeon described both leadership rivals as ""hard line Brexiteers"" and warned that the risk of a ""catastrophic no deal"" was increasing. But she said the Scottish government would do ""everything in our power"" to avoid it. ""I think most people in Scotland will be looking at the Tory leadership election and wondering how it's possible for a political establishment at Westminster to be so out of touch with mainstream opinion in Scotland,"" she told BBC Scotland. She added: ""There's a growing sense in having a hard line Brexiteer, whether its Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt as prime minister, further illustrates that Scotland and the rest of the UK are on different political paths with different political priorities, ""Of course, there will be differences of opinion in what we should do about that. ""But surely it should be for Scotland to choose and decide which path we want to take - continue to be taken down the Westminster path, removed from the European Union, with someone like Boris Johnson as prime minister and all that entails, or the ability to become an independent European nation, co-operating with the rest of the UK but also being able to contribute in Europe and beyond. ""That's a choice that shouldn't be imposed on Scotland but one for us to make."" The first minister said she was reassuring the agricultural sector that the Scottish government would ""redouble its efforts"" to avoid a no deal Brexit Last month, Ms Sturgeon said she wanted to hold another referendum on Scottish independence in thesecond half of next year. However, Conservative MP Colin Clark, who is backing Mr Johnson in the leadership race, said the former foreign secretary could bring the UK together after a turbulent period in politics. He said Mr Johnson would ""deliver on Brexit"" by 31 October, ""for the sake of business, farming and the rest of the economy"". Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? The MP for Gordon added: ""Boris is a proven entity when he was mayor of London, a city of nine or 10 million people. ""He brings people together. He's brought 160 Conservative MPs together. ""What we want to see him do is bring the country together and I truly believe that Boris Johnson, as prime minister, is the right man to create a cabinet to bring the country back together."" MP for Gordon, Colin Clark, was vocal in his support for Boris Johnson during a visit to the Royal Highland Show Meanwhile, John Lamont, the MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, who was one of eight MPs to nominate Jeremy Hunt at the start of the campaign, reiterated his support for the minister. ""His pragmatic approach and his background in business means he is the only candidate who can negotiate with the EU and our own parliament to get Brexit delivered,"" he said. ""He is clear that he is prepared to walk away from the EU if no deal can be found, but that he would work hard to get a better deal for this country."" Mr Hunt has spent a lot of time in Scotland and understands the issues facing people in the Borders, he added. ""His plans to kick-start our economy by lowering taxes would bring jobs and investment to the Borders,"" he added. ""He also has some really radical plans about how we need to get better at championing and strengthening our United Kingdom.""

"Police were called to the London home of Boris Johnson and his partner in the early hours of Friday after neighbours reportedly heard a loud argument. The Guardian said,externalCarrie Symonds was heard telling the Conservative MP to ""get off me"" and ""get out of my flat"". The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it ""spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well"". In a statement, it said ""there was no cause for police action"". A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: ""No comment"". Mr Johnson refused to answer questions as he arrived at Birmingham ahead of the first of the Conservative Party's leadership membership hustings. Earlier, a neighbour of Ms Symonds in Camberwell, south London, told the Guardian they had heard a woman screaming followed by ""slamming and banging"". The paper said the neighbour was inside their own flat when they recorded the alleged altercation. It said that in the recording - heard by the newspaper, but not by the BBC - Mr Johnson was refusing to leave the flat and told the woman to ""get off"" his laptop, before there was a loud crashing noise. Ms Symonds is allegedly heard saying the MP had ruined a sofa with red wine: ""You just don't care for anything because you're spoilt. You have no care for money or anything."" Another neighbour, who would only give her name as Fatima, told the BBC: ""I heard a female voice, shouting and screaming, and then I heard things smashing, it sounded like plates or glasses. ""I couldn't hear what she was saying but she sounded really angry."" Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he could not comment on the Guardian's report specifically but said character was relevant in the contest to be leader of the party. ""They are going to be in a position of responsibility where they have to make very important decisions,"" he said. The former attorney general added: ""Clearly, things like reliability and honesty are very important things. ""And I think they matter in one's private and personal life, and also they matter in one's public life."" Carrie Symonds has been in a relationship with Mr Johnson since 2018 By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson Boris Johnson would have preferred his politics - not his private life - to be making headlines. As we enter the final stage of this leadership campaign the scrutiny of the two men who want the top job will no doubt increase. There will be intense focus on their every move; their past, their present and their future. It's not surprising given the importance of the job they want - running the country. But does what allegedly happened in the London flat Mr Johnson shares with his partner really matter? His critics will say yes. They argue that we need someone of good character who can make difficult decisions and work under pressure. Supporters of Boris Johnson disagree. Whatever happened, they say, was an entirely private matter between two people in a relationship which should never have been recorded by a neighbour. Journalist Sonia Purnell, who has written a biography of Mr Johnson, told the Today programme she believed it was important to know a future leader's character. She said: ""It is the most unbelievably pressured job, crises will be coming at you day and night. You have to have equilibrium, a clear head, a stability in your life to be able to cope with that."" But, political commentator Tim Montgomerie told the BBC that until a complaint was made by Ms Symonds, the row ""should be a non-issue"". He added: ""If there was any domestic violence, Boris Johnson's candidacy would be toast and would deserve to be. ""But all we have at the moment is a partially overheard conversation between two people late at night. ""Unless there is a complaint I think we should draw a line under this."" Some of Mr Johnson's supporters have also taken to social media to defend him. Brexit minister James Cleverly questioned the motives of the ""person who recorded Boris and then gave the story to the Guardian"". Tory MP Michael Fabricant appeared to confuse Camberwell with Islington but wrote he was glad he did not have ""nosey neighbours"" recording private conversations, sending them to newspapers and ""wasting police time for political advantage"". Mr Johnson's relationship with Ms Symonds - a former director of communications for the Conservative party - became public after Mr Johnson and his wife announced they were divorcing in 2018. Ms Symonds was seen in the audience during Mr Johnson's leadership campaign launch on 12 June. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: ""At 00:24 on Friday 21 June, police responded to a call from a local resident in the SE5 area of Camberwell.

"This video can not be played Greenpeace activist says Mark Field actions 'over the top' Mark Field has been suspended as a Foreign Office minister after grabbing a female Greenpeace activist at a black-tie City dinner. The MP has apologised for confronting Janet Barker and marching her away as protesters interrupted a speech by Chancellor Philip Hammond. Ms Barker suggested Mr Field ""go to anger management classes"" but said she did not intend to complain to police. Mr Field said he had been ""genuinely worried"" she may have been armed. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said there were also ""very serious questions to be asked"" about security, as a ""large number"" of protesters had apparently managed to ""walk through"" to the event at London's Mansion House. Footage of the incident involving Mr Field has been widely shared on social media, with several Labour politicians calling for him to be sacked. What is the law on tackling intruders? Greenpeace accuses minister of assault Climate protesters disrupt Hammond's speech A Downing Street spokeswoman said Prime Minister Theresa May had ""seen the footage"" and ""found it very concerning"". She added that Mr Field had ""referred himself to both the Cabinet Office and the Conservative Party. He will be suspended as a minister while investigations take place."" This video can not be played Climate change protesters interrupt Chancellor Philip Hammond's speech Climate change protesters - wearing suits, red dresses and sashes with ""climate emergency"" written on them - entered Mansion House on Thursday night, as Mr Hammond was beginning his speech on the state of the economy. One of them began reading an alternative speech. As Ms Barker walked past his table, Mr Field stood up, stopped her and pushed her against a column. The Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster then put a hand on the back of her neck and led her out of the room. Ms Barker told the BBC the purpose of the protest had been to speak to ""men who are in power, the bankers, the investors that are continuing to invest into fossil fuels"". ""We were polite with people and said: 'We're here to deliver a message',"" she said. City of London Police said they were looking into ""a number of third-party reports of a possible assault"". ""He certainly manhandled me in a way in which was very disagreeable,"" she said. Asked if she felt Mr Field's actions amounted to criminal assault, Ms Barker said: ""No, I don't think so. I don't want this to turn into a mud-slinging match."" The activist, who travelled from her home in Wales to take part in Thursday's protest, said: ""350 people were there and only one person reacted that way. ""It's more the behaviour of that individual. I want him to reflect on what he did and not do it again. Maybe he should go to anger management classes."" Protesters dressed in black tie and red dresses crowded into the building The City of London Corporation is to review security after protesters walked into Mansion House Chancellor Philip Hammond eventually completed his speech Before his suspension, Mr Field told ITV News that guests had ""understandably felt threatened"" and he had ""instinctively reacted"" when Ms Barker rushed past. ""There was no security present and I was, for a split second, genuinely worried she might have been armed,"" Mr Field said. He added: ""I deeply regret this episode and unreservedly apologise to the lady concerned for grabbing her, but in the current climate I felt the need to act decisively to close down the threat to the safety of those present."" Labour's shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler tweeted: ""This is horrific... [Mark Field] must immediately be suspended or sacked."" But Mr Field was defended by some of his colleagues, with Conservative MP Johnny Mercer tweeting: ""He panicked, he's not trained in restraint and arrest, and if you think this is 'serious violence' you may need to recalibrate your sensitivities."" Another Conservative MP, Bob Stewart, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Mr Field had ""probably"" placed his hand on Ms Barker's neck because if he had ""touched her anywhere else he'd probably have been deemed highly inappropriate"". Conservative leadership contender Jeremy Hunt, who, as Foreign Secretary, is Mr Field's boss, said: ""Mark has issued a full and unreserved apology. He recognised that what happened was an over-reaction. ""In his interest and in the interest of the lady involved we need a proper [Cabinet Office] inquiry and that's what going to happen."" The City of London Corporation said it was investigating how security had been breached at Mansion House, adding it would be ""reviewing arrangements for future events"".

"Nicola Sturgeon discussed the Tory leadership race during a trip to the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh The Conservative party leadership race proves that Scotland is on a ""different political path"" to the rest of the UK, according to Scotland's first minister. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are going head-to-head to become the next Tory leader and prime minister. Both men say they are prepared to leave the European Union without a deal. At the Royal Highland Show, Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland both candidates were ""out of touch"" with mainstream opinion in Scotland. Supporters of both Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, and former London mayor Mr Johnson say they will unite the country. Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Stage set for Johnson v Hunt Quick Q&A: Tory candidates' Brexit plans The pair won the most support in the final round of voting among Tory MPs on Thursday, which saw Environment Secretary Michael Gove eliminated. They will now both go to a ballot of the wider membership of the Conservative party. Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt took part in the BBC leaders debate Ms Sturgeon said the leadership contest - which has been dominated by discussions on Brexit - highlighted stark differences between Scotland and the UK on the issue. A total of 51.9% of UK voters opted to leave in the EU referendum in 2016, but the figure was much lower in Scotland where only38% voted in favour of Brexit. Ms Sturgeon described both leadership rivals as ""hard line Brexiteers"" and warned that the risk of a ""catastrophic no deal"" was increasing. But she said the Scottish government would do ""everything in our power"" to avoid it. ""I think most people in Scotland will be looking at the Tory leadership election and wondering how it's possible for a political establishment at Westminster to be so out of touch with mainstream opinion in Scotland,"" she told BBC Scotland. She added: ""There's a growing sense in having a hard line Brexiteer, whether its Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt as prime minister, further illustrates that Scotland and the rest of the UK are on different political paths with different political priorities, ""Of course, there will be differences of opinion in what we should do about that. ""But surely it should be for Scotland to choose and decide which path we want to take - continue to be taken down the Westminster path, removed from the European Union, with someone like Boris Johnson as prime minister and all that entails, or the ability to become an independent European nation, co-operating with the rest of the UK but also being able to contribute in Europe and beyond. ""That's a choice that shouldn't be imposed on Scotland but one for us to make."" The first minister said she was reassuring the agricultural sector that the Scottish government would ""redouble its efforts"" to avoid a no deal Brexit Last month, Ms Sturgeon said she wanted to hold another referendum on Scottish independence in thesecond half of next year. However, Conservative MP Colin Clark, who is backing Mr Johnson in the leadership race, said the former foreign secretary could bring the UK together after a turbulent period in politics. He said Mr Johnson would ""deliver on Brexit"" by 31 October, ""for the sake of business, farming and the rest of the economy"". Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? The MP for Gordon added: ""Boris is a proven entity when he was mayor of London, a city of nine or 10 million people. ""He brings people together. He's brought 160 Conservative MPs together. ""What we want to see him do is bring the country together and I truly believe that Boris Johnson, as prime minister, is the right man to create a cabinet to bring the country back together."" MP for Gordon, Colin Clark, was vocal in his support for Boris Johnson during a visit to the Royal Highland Show Meanwhile, John Lamont, the MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, who was one of eight MPs to nominate Jeremy Hunt at the start of the campaign, reiterated his support for the minister. ""His pragmatic approach and his background in business means he is the only candidate who can negotiate with the EU and our own parliament to get Brexit delivered,"" he said. ""He is clear that he is prepared to walk away from the EU if no deal can be found, but that he would work hard to get a better deal for this country."" Mr Hunt has spent a lot of time in Scotland and understands the issues facing people in the Borders, he added. ""His plans to kick-start our economy by lowering taxes would bring jobs and investment to the Borders,"" he added. ""He also has some really radical plans about how we need to get better at championing and strengthening our United Kingdom.""

"Police have suspended work with the UK's biggest private forensic company following a cyber-attack on the firm. The suspension has led to delays in forensic testing, which could impact on court cases. Eurofins Forensic Services carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK. Its parent company, Eurofins, suffered a ransomware attack on 1 or 2 June, which is under criminal investigation. Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to unlock access. It is the latest in a series of major forensic science problems to hit police forces since the closure of the government-owned service in England and Wales in 2012. Forensics error drug-drive cases quashed Met investigator 'botched' cases Forensic science standards 'at risk' An emergency police response has been put in place, led by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which took the decision to ""temporarily suspend"" all submissions to Eurofins. Eurofins, which caters for over 50% of the UK market,deals with over 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year.,external A group of senior officers will ensure the most serious crimes are given priority, as well as ensuring other forensic providers aren't overloaded with submissions. ""Our priority is to minimise the impact on the criminal justice system,"" said the NPCC lead for forensics, Chief Constable James Vaughan. ""It is too early to fully quantify the impact but we are working at pace with partners to understand and mitigate the risks."" The Crown Prosecution Service said a police investigation was ongoing, but at this stage there was ""no evidence to suggest that previous convictions were unsafe"". A spokesperson added: ""The CPS is assessing current cases to identify any impact on criminal trials as a result of this attack, and will ensure all necessary action is taken to allow them to proceed fairly."" Eurofins said the attack ""caused disruption to many of its IT systems in several countries"" ina statement on it website.,external It said it believed the attack was carried out by ""highly sophisticated well-resourced perpetrators"" and the ransomware involved appears to have been a ""new malware variant"". The National Crime Agency is conducting an investigation into the cyber attack, supported by the National Cyber Security Centre. A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with law enforcement and justice partners to investigate the sources of the attack and minimise any impact on our criminal justice system."" Forensic science work has been carried out by private firms and police laboratories in England and Wales since the closure of the government's Forensic Science Service in 2012. Last year 40 drug-driving offences were quashed and thousands of cases were reviewed after data was allegedly manipulated at Randox Testing Services. Another company - Key Forensic Services - collapsed in January 2018, while the Met Police also had to carry out a review after a forensic scientist apparently botched examinations. Eurofins has seven laboratories in the UK - Teddington, south-west London; Leeds Dock, in Leeds; Risley, Cheshire; Wakefield, west Yorkshire; Culham, Oxfordshire; Fordham, Cambridgeshire; Tamworth, Staffordshire. It also provides a range of other screening services to industry, agriculture and the pharmaceutical sector. The impact on these services is unclear.

"Cheryl Hooper was described by her parents as ""full of kindness"" A farmer who shot his estranged wife as she sat in her car outside her home has been jailed for life for her murder. Cheryl Hooper, 51, was killed in front of her daughter outside her home in Newport, Shropshire, in January 2018. Andrew Hooper, 46, who turned the shotgun on himself after the attack, now has severe facial injuries that mean he has lost the ability to speak. After being found guilty by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court, Hooper was ordered to serve a minimum of 31 years. Judge Mark Wall QC told Hooper: ""The sentence that I must pass on you is one that you richly deserve - life imprisonment. Telling Hooper he had not expressed any remorse or regret after leaving a ""horrific aftermath"" when he fled the scene, the judge added: ""This was not a last-minute decision to kill, arrived at outside Cheryl's, but rather a planned execution."" Andrew Hooper was found guilty by a unanimous verdict Following the verdict, Det Insp Mark Bellamy from West Mercia Police said Mrs Hooper had been murdered by her ""controlling and jealous husband in a premeditated act of the most savage violence"". The Crown Prosecution Service said, following their separation, Hooper had a tracker fitted to Mrs Hooper's car without her knowledge. The Crown Prosecution Service said Hooper smashed the car's window with the shotgun before shooting his wife twice The jury had heard Hooper suspected his wife was having an affair, and, on the night she was killed, tracked her to a pub in Wolverhampton and found her with friends and her suspected lover. Later, he arrived at her home, he said, intending to frighten her into leaving the other man and resuming their marriage. Mrs Hooper's daughter said the defendant""had murder in his eyes""when he shot her mother in her Range Rover. Latest news from the West Midlands Following the verdict, it emerged that Hooper was also given a suspended sentence in 2004 after breaking into his first wife's home and threatening to kill her. Mrs Hooper's daughter Georgia, who was 14 at the time and witnessed the shooting, read a victim impact statement to the court. ""Mum was funny, beautiful and my best friend; the thought of her not being with me to share my life makes me very sad,"" she said. Cheryl Hooper's daughter Georgia said her mum was her ""best friend"" Judge Mark Wall QC told the teenager: ""The way in which you have conducted yourself throughout this trial, which must have been extremely difficult for you, has been admirable and awe-inspiring. ""Your mother would, I have no doubt, been immensely proud of the way you have dealt with a tragic and difficult process."" Mrs Hooper's parents Tony and Rita said: ""Cheryl was a wonderful daughter, mother, sister and friend; she was beautiful both inside and out - full of kindness to everyone she came into contact with."" The Independent Office for Police Complaints (IOPC) said it had investigated contact Mrs Hooper had with police before her death, and published the results following the sentencing. It said Mrs Hooper had made reports to Staffordshire Police about her estranged husband's behaviour, which had been referred to West Mercia Police, which covered Mrs Hooper's home area, to make appropriate safeguarding measures. IOPC regional director Derrick Campbell said: ""Police could not have reasonably foreseen the horrific event that transpired. ""While some inquiries could have been carried out more quickly or thoroughly, we found no indication that any officers or staff acted in a manner that would justify any disciplinary proceedings. ""Police decision-making and actions were carried out in compliance with relevant force and national policies.""

"The former chief executive of Barclays, John Varley, has been acquitted of charges of conspiracy to commit fraud. The Court of Appeal declined an application by the Serious Fraud Office to overturn a decision by Mr Justice Robert Jay that there was insufficient evidence against Mr Varley.

"The past decade has seen a huge surge in wind and solar capacity For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, Britain is obtaining more power from zero-carbon sources than fossil fuels. The milestone has been passed for the first five months of 2019. National Grid says clean energy has nudged ahead with 48% of generation, against 47% for coal and gas. The rest is biomass burning. The transformation reflects the precipitous decline of coal energy, and a boom from wind and solar. National Grid says that in the past decade, coal generation will have plunged from 30% to 3%. Meanwhile, wind power has shot up from 1% to 19%. Mini-milestones have been passed along the way. In May, for instance, Britain clocked up its first coal-free fortnight and generated record levels of solar power for two consecutive days. The shift is being driven by the need to cut emissions of the greenhouse gases that are over-heating the climate. The electricity sector was seen as the easiest place to start. John Pettigrew, CEO of National Grid, told BBC News: ""Over the last 10 years thereâs been real progress in de-carbonisation of the energy system â but 2019 is going to be a key milestone. ""It's the first time since the Industrial Revolution that more electricity has been produced from zero and low-carbon sources rather than fossil fuels. It's tremendously exciting because it's such a tipping point."" National Grid says it is confident to make predictions for Britain's whole year power generation based on figures so far and on historical patterns. In years to come, more energy storage will be needed as the share of wind and solar energy swells further. Mr Pettigrew told us some of the renewable energy generated when the wind is blowing or the Sun is shining will be stored in the batteries of people's electric cars for use later. The cars' charging systems will be reversed so their batteries can feed electricity back to the grid when demand peaks â like when people are cooking supper. This video can not be played The first electric car that can make money with the energy it stores ""One of key attributes of electric vehicles is they have a battery and therefore they can be used as a source of energy on to the network,"" he said. ""We could aggregate all the cars and use that electricity to support the grid when itâs needed. It's going to be a really effective tool for us to keep costs down."" The firm estimates this vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G) could solve 10-15% of the UK's demand for storage. But it's hard to be confident about projections because autonomous vehicles may disrupt patterns of car usage and ownership. Another way of filling in the gaps in energy when the wind's not blowing is by trading with continental neighbours. National Grid expects that giant cables from continental Europe will soon supply enough to power eight million homes. The firm says 63% of electricity imported through interconnectors this year has come from zero-carbon sources â much of it from French nuclear. UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 LED lights making dent in UK energy demand Climate change: Where we are in seven charts? The zero-carbon share should increase to 90% by the 2030s as the UK trades more electricity with Norwayâs vast hydropower system. There's still major uncertainty about low-carbon energy, though, with no clarity over nuclear power, and increased expected demand from motorists. Mr Pettigrew has joined the chorus of critics warning government that the progress of electric vehicles is too slow â and urging much more effort to decarbonise heat. The veteran energy analyst Tom Burke from e3g told BBC News: ""Today's landmark is a real tribute to technologists. We have cracked technical problems of dealing with climate change. ""The problems we face are political. As we move towards Net Zero (carbon emissions), jobs will be lost in fossil fuel industries and created in low-carbon industries. ""The government has blown hot and cold on climate policies â and it's shown no sign of thinking about managing the politics of this."" A government White Paper on energy is due soon.

"Cheryl Hooper was described by her parents as ""full of kindness"" A farmer who shot his estranged wife as she sat in her car outside her home has been jailed for life for her murder. Cheryl Hooper, 51, was killed in front of her daughter outside her home in Newport, Shropshire, in January 2018. Andrew Hooper, 46, who turned the shotgun on himself after the attack, now has severe facial injuries that mean he has lost the ability to speak. After being found guilty by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court, Hooper was ordered to serve a minimum of 31 years. Judge Mark Wall QC told Hooper: ""The sentence that I must pass on you is one that you richly deserve - life imprisonment. Telling Hooper he had not expressed any remorse or regret after leaving a ""horrific aftermath"" when he fled the scene, the judge added: ""This was not a last-minute decision to kill, arrived at outside Cheryl's, but rather a planned execution."" Andrew Hooper was found guilty by a unanimous verdict Following the verdict, Det Insp Mark Bellamy from West Mercia Police said Mrs Hooper had been murdered by her ""controlling and jealous husband in a premeditated act of the most savage violence"". The Crown Prosecution Service said, following their separation, Hooper had a tracker fitted to Mrs Hooper's car without her knowledge. The Crown Prosecution Service said Hooper smashed the car's window with the shotgun before shooting his wife twice The jury had heard Hooper suspected his wife was having an affair, and, on the night she was killed, tracked her to a pub in Wolverhampton and found her with friends and her suspected lover. Later, he arrived at her home, he said, intending to frighten her into leaving the other man and resuming their marriage. Mrs Hooper's daughter said the defendant""had murder in his eyes""when he shot her mother in her Range Rover. Latest news from the West Midlands Following the verdict, it emerged that Hooper was also given a suspended sentence in 2004 after breaking into his first wife's home and threatening to kill her. Mrs Hooper's daughter Georgia, who was 14 at the time and witnessed the shooting, read a victim impact statement to the court. ""Mum was funny, beautiful and my best friend; the thought of her not being with me to share my life makes me very sad,"" she said. Cheryl Hooper's daughter Georgia said her mum was her ""best friend"" Judge Mark Wall QC told the teenager: ""The way in which you have conducted yourself throughout this trial, which must have been extremely difficult for you, has been admirable and awe-inspiring. ""Your mother would, I have no doubt, been immensely proud of the way you have dealt with a tragic and difficult process."" Mrs Hooper's parents Tony and Rita said: ""Cheryl was a wonderful daughter, mother, sister and friend; she was beautiful both inside and out - full of kindness to everyone she came into contact with."" The Independent Office for Police Complaints (IOPC) said it had investigated contact Mrs Hooper had with police before her death, and published the results following the sentencing. It said Mrs Hooper had made reports to Staffordshire Police about her estranged husband's behaviour, which had been referred to West Mercia Police, which covered Mrs Hooper's home area, to make appropriate safeguarding measures. IOPC regional director Derrick Campbell said: ""Police could not have reasonably foreseen the horrific event that transpired. ""While some inquiries could have been carried out more quickly or thoroughly, we found no indication that any officers or staff acted in a manner that would justify any disciplinary proceedings. ""Police decision-making and actions were carried out in compliance with relevant force and national policies.""

"The former chief executive of Barclays, John Varley, has been acquitted of charges of conspiracy to commit fraud. The Court of Appeal declined an application by the Serious Fraud Office to overturn a decision by Mr Justice Robert Jay that there was insufficient evidence against Mr Varley. However, the other three defendants, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, will now face a retrial. The three defendants deny any wrongdoing. The SFO accuses them of secretly paying Â£322m to secure investments from Qatar during the financial crisis. The funding allowed Barclays to avoid a UK government bailout in 2008. The case against Mr Varley was the only attempt to prosecute a chief executive of a major bank following the financial crisis. It was seen as an important case for the SFO which had been criticised for the failure of previous prosecutions, including the collapse last year of acase against three Tesco executives.

"This video can not be played Summer solstice at Stonehenge Thousands of people cheered sunrise at Stonehenge on summer solstice. About 10,000 people gathered at the Neolithic monument to greet the start of the longest day of the year, according to Wiltshire Police. Kate Logan, from English Heritage, said: ""There was a lovely, friendly atmosphere, the sun shone and the dawn was greeted with loud cheers."" The celebrations at Stonehenge came as people descended on sites across the UK to celebrate the first day of summer. Glastonbury Tor in Somerset and the Avebury stone circle in Wiltshire also attracted crowds. Stonehenge is a monument that aligns to the midsummer sunrise and the midwinter sunset. On the summer solstice, the sun rises behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the Stone Circle, and rays of sunlight are channelled into the centre of the monument. Those who observed the spectacle at the neolithic Wiltshire monument encountered a chilly morning accompanied by clear skies as the sun glinted over the horizon. Ms Logan said it was ""one of the highlights of the year"" at the ancient site. A moment of reflection at Stonehenge Police arrested four people at Stonehenge and a fifth was detained in Avebury. A 25-year-old man from Warminster was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving; a 15-year-old girl from Bulford was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly; a 44-year-old man from Salisbury was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure and a 19-year-old man from the Isle of Wight was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. In Avebury, a 45-year-old man from Great Somerford was arrested on suspicion of common assault. Revellers celebrate the summer solstice as the sun rises at Glastonbury Tor in Glastonbury Among those taking photographs of the stunning skies above Somerset from Glastonbury Tor was Michelle Cowbourne. ""Look at the beautiful colours in the sky before sunrise,"" she said in a Tweet, in which she shared her pictures. ""What a beautiful morning,"" she added.

"The Northern Powerhouse aims to encourage growth outside London and south-east England The Northern Powerhouse is being ""undermined"" by austerity despite signs of economic growth, a think tank says. Five years since its launch, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the project was at risk of ""fizzling out"". The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) North said the economy had ""moved in the right direction"" but more children were living in ""poor"" households. The government said record numbers of people were in work across the north. IPPR North, a centre-left think tank, said the Northern Powerhouse had succeeded in devolving power by creating five new ""metro mayors"" and a regional transport body - Transport for the North. However, it said the government had ""undermined"" the project while making cuts in public spending. Although spending has recently increased, the north has seen an overall Â£3.6bn a year reduction in real terms since 2009-10, while south-east and south-west England saw a Â£4.7bn rise. In an analysis marking five years of the Northern Powerhouse, IPPR North found positive changes included: 34,520 more jobs in professional, scientific and technical jobs in 2019 compared with 2014, plus a further 54,523 jobs in manufacturing roles. ""Marginally"" higher economic growth in the north than the national average - a 10.7% rise between 2014 and 2017, compared with 10.6% for the UK as a whole and 9.7% for the UK excluding London Employment in the north increased about 7%, compared to the UK average of just over 6% Broken down by individual region, the North West was second only to London for the rise in jobs. Scotland saw a slight decrease. George Osborne wanted to give northern cities more powers The Northern Powerhousewas first mentioned by the then Chancellor George Osbornein June 2014, when he outlined an ambition to bring together the cities, towns and rural communities of the north of England to fuel economic growth through modern transport links, devolved powers and increased investment. Cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle were encouraged to work together both in rivalling London and the South East and to ""take on the world"", with more jobs and opportunities. IPPR North said there had been ""several negative changes"" including: 800,000 northern children are living in ""poor"" households, a rise of about 200,000 since 2014 Weekly pay across the north has risen by Â£12 (2.4%), against a national average increase of Â£19 (3.5%) in real terms A household is defined as in ""relative poverty"" when its income is less than 60% of the median average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. How my sleeping town became a crime hotspot Harassment 'part of being shot girl' Police arrest 44 in grooming inquiry IPPR North said since 2014 transport spending in the north had increased by Â£149 per person in real terms, but this was less than half the Â£330 per person increase in London. Northern mayors want more investment in transport after figures showed train services also got worse. The number of cancelled and significantly late trains on TransPennine Express and Northern franchises more than doubled from 20,000 in 2014-15 to 47,000 in 2018-19. It meant that almost one in every 20 services was either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late arriving at its destination. by Danny Savage, BBC North of England correspondent Rail passengers in the north experienced thousands of delayed and cancelled services last year The idea of the Northern Powerhouse wastruly welcomed across this part of England- from Liverpool to Hull and up to Newcastle. Cumbria was a bit more lukewarm because it always feels geographically distant. People watched and waited. And five years on, many feel they're still waiting. Raise the issue with strangers on a train and comments like ""Northern Powercut more like"" or ""you mean the Northern Poorhouse"" are forthcoming. The government can point to a success in devolved power with regional mayors and some local initiatives but the perception of people living here is that the pledge made by George Osborne in 2014 hasn't been turned into action. They point to old trains, arguments over electrifying key rail routes and quite obviously more investment in the south. The north of England has a combined population of nearly 15 million people. That's a lot of potential voters for any government to disappoint. It's been thus for decades but should the north-south divide feel so stark in 2019? Andy Burnham says northern cities should be given the same powers as London Labour mayor Mr Burnham said the north had a louder voice than it did five years ago. ""There are signs in Greater Manchester that devolution is starting to work,"" he said. ""We're doing more to get people back to work but overall there is a real danger that the Northern Powerhouse could be about to fizzle out. ""Westminster has failed the North of England and that is over decades under governments of all colours."" Mayor of the Sheffield City Region, Labour MP Dan Jarvis, said he wanted the government to ""look at the north of England as an asset, not a liability"". Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: ""The northern authorities are working much more closely together and that's a real benefit. ""The real difficulty we have is that (transport) schemes are delayed and there's a real lack of commitment to rebalancing the economy."" Leeds council leader Judith Blake said the north was speaking with one voice The Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, said the Northern Powerhouse had helped him to secure the Â£35m purchase ofDurham Tees Valley Airport. He said: ""We've done very well out of it. We've got a huge amount of money from central government. We've got more powers and control over our own destiny and it's led to things like my ability to buy our local airport and the create the first mayoral development corporation outside of London that will create many thousands of jobs in the Tees Valley. ""We could always ask for more money and more powers and that's something we do on a daily basis but there's always more we can do on a pan northern level working together across political parties."" Luke Raikes from IPPR North said: ""Austerity has undercut a lot of the powerhouse agenda just because it's hit the north harder than any other region and that's had a consequence for people living in the North and for the economy within the North. So we've seen child poverty go up by 200,000 in just five years - that's quite a big increase."" When Mr Osborne unveiled the Powerhouse plans in 2014 he was Chancellor in David Cameron's coalition government and had been an MP for a northern constituency - Tatton, in Cheshire - for 13 years. But he left the Cabinet after 2016's EU referendum, stood down as an MP at the following year's general election and is now the editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper. A government spokeswoman said the Northern Powerhouse remained a priority and was ""delivering results for people across the north with a record number of people in work and nearly 200,000 more businesses today than in 2010"". ""We're investing over Â£13bn in improving transport - more than any government in history - and, with almost half the region represented by five strong metro mayors, we're keeping our promise for more decisions in the north to be made by the north,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Businesses 'not fully ready' for no-deal, says Carney About 150,000 businesses still do not have the paperwork they need to keep exporting to the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mark Carney has said. The Bank of England governor added that many had built up contingency stocks, but these would only last ""weeks"". ""Business will be reliant on what the governments are able to do in order to keep the ports open, the trade flowing,"" he told the Today programme. But he said the financial system was prepared for a no-deal scenario. Is there a 10-year rule to sort out trade? Johnson and Hunt left in Tory leader race Carney gives Facebook currency cautious welcome The UK is due to leave the EU by 31 October after seeking an extension to leave the bloc back in March. Boris Johnson, considered the favourite in the race to become the next prime minister, has said the UK must leave in October, even if it has not struck a deal. His rival, Jeremy Hunt, has said the UK may need more time, although he would accept no-deal as a last resort. Ahead of his Mansion House speech to the City on Thursday, Mr Carney said about three quarters of UK businesses have done as much as they could do to prepare for a no-deal. ""But it doesn't mean they are fully ready, in fact far from it,"" he told the BBC. He also stressed that in the event of a no-deal exit, the return of trade tariffs on goods shipped to the EU would be ""automatic"". This contradicts a claim from Mr Johnson that the UK could secure a 10-year standstill in current arrangements using an article of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradeknown as ""Gatt 24"". ""The Gatt rules are clear... Gatt 24 applies if you have a [withdrawal] agreement, not if you've decided not to have an agreement, or you have been unable to come to an agreement,"" Mr Carney said. ""So... we should be clear that not having an agreement with the European Union would mean that there are tariffs, automatically, because the Europeans have to apply the same rules to us as they apply to everyone else."" Mr Carney also said he was cautiously open toFacebook's new digital currency, Libra, which is due to launch in the first half of next year. But he said the Bank would be setting ""ground rules upfront"" to protect consumers and their data, and that Libra ""had to be safe or it is not going to happen"". ""Welcome to the world of finance: there is oversight, there is consumer protection, there is market integrity, people have certain rights to privacy that have to be respected. ""And we're not going to allow a network that comes into place that is a network for criminals and terrorists."" Facebook unveiled details about Libra this week, claiming the virtual currency would be as easy to use as texting. It said Libra would be independently managed, backed by real assets and pegged to a basket of well-known currencies. But there have been concerns about how people's data and cash will be protected, as well as the currency's potential volatility. Mr Carney said: ""All the major global central banks and supervisors would have direct regulatory control of this if it is going to work, which is an open question, and we have an open mind about it.""

"The Northern Powerhouse aims to encourage growth outside London and south-east England The Northern Powerhouse is being ""undermined"" by austerity despite signs of economic growth, a think tank says. Five years since its launch, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the project was at risk of ""fizzling out"". The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) North said the economy had ""moved in the right direction"" but more children were living in ""poor"" households. The government said record numbers of people were in work across the north. IPPR North, a centre-left think tank, said the Northern Powerhouse had succeeded in devolving power by creating five new ""metro mayors"" and a regional transport body - Transport for the North. However, it said the government had ""undermined"" the project while making cuts in public spending. Although spending has recently increased, the north has seen an overall Â£3.6bn a year reduction in real terms since 2009-10, while south-east and south-west England saw a Â£4.7bn rise. In an analysis marking five years of the Northern Powerhouse, IPPR North found positive changes included: 34,520 more jobs in professional, scientific and technical jobs in 2019 compared with 2014, plus a further 54,523 jobs in manufacturing roles. ""Marginally"" higher economic growth in the north than the national average - a 10.7% rise between 2014 and 2017, compared with 10.6% for the UK as a whole and 9.7% for the UK excluding London Employment in the north increased about 7%, compared to the UK average of just over 6% Broken down by individual region, the North West was second only to London for the rise in jobs. Scotland saw a slight decrease. George Osborne wanted to give northern cities more powers The Northern Powerhousewas first mentioned by the then Chancellor George Osbornein June 2014, when he outlined an ambition to bring together the cities, towns and rural communities of the north of England to fuel economic growth through modern transport links, devolved powers and increased investment. Cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle were encouraged to work together both in rivalling London and the South East and to ""take on the world"", with more jobs and opportunities. IPPR North said there had been ""several negative changes"" including: 800,000 northern children are living in ""poor"" households, a rise of about 200,000 since 2014 Weekly pay across the north has risen by Â£12 (2.4%), against a national average increase of Â£19 (3.5%) in real terms A household is defined as in ""relative poverty"" when its income is less than 60% of the median average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. How my sleeping town became a crime hotspot Harassment 'part of being shot girl' Police arrest 44 in grooming inquiry IPPR North said since 2014 transport spending in the north had increased by Â£149 per person in real terms, but this was less than half the Â£330 per person increase in London. Northern mayors want more investment in transport after figures showed train services also got worse. The number of cancelled and significantly late trains on TransPennine Express and Northern franchises more than doubled from 20,000 in 2014-15 to 47,000 in 2018-19. It meant that almost one in every 20 services was either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late arriving at its destination. by Danny Savage, BBC North of England correspondent Rail passengers in the north experienced thousands of delayed and cancelled services last year The idea of the Northern Powerhouse wastruly welcomed across this part of England- from Liverpool to Hull and up to Newcastle. Cumbria was a bit more lukewarm because it always feels geographically distant. People watched and waited. And five years on, many feel they're still waiting. Raise the issue with strangers on a train and comments like ""Northern Powercut more like"" or ""you mean the Northern Poorhouse"" are forthcoming. The government can point to a success in devolved power with regional mayors and some local initiatives but the perception of people living here is that the pledge made by George Osborne in 2014 hasn't been turned into action. They point to old trains, arguments over electrifying key rail routes and quite obviously more investment in the south. The north of England has a combined population of nearly 15 million people. That's a lot of potential voters for any government to disappoint. It's been thus for decades but should the north-south divide feel so stark in 2019? Andy Burnham says northern cities should be given the same powers as London Labour mayor Mr Burnham said the north had a louder voice than it did five years ago. ""There are signs in Greater Manchester that devolution is starting to work,"" he said. ""We're doing more to get people back to work but overall there is a real danger that the Northern Powerhouse could be about to fizzle out. ""Westminster has failed the North of England and that is over decades under governments of all colours."" Mayor of the Sheffield City Region, Labour MP Dan Jarvis, said he wanted the government to ""look at the north of England as an asset, not a liability"". Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: ""The northern authorities are working much more closely together and that's a real benefit. ""The real difficulty we have is that (transport) schemes are delayed and there's a real lack of commitment to rebalancing the economy."" Leeds council leader Judith Blake said the north was speaking with one voice The Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, said the Northern Powerhouse had helped him to secure the Â£35m purchase ofDurham Tees Valley Airport. He said: ""We've done very well out of it. We've got a huge amount of money from central government. We've got more powers and control over our own destiny and it's led to things like my ability to buy our local airport and the create the first mayoral development corporation outside of London that will create many thousands of jobs in the Tees Valley. ""We could always ask for more money and more powers and that's something we do on a daily basis but there's always more we can do on a pan northern level working together across political parties."" Luke Raikes from IPPR North said: ""Austerity has undercut a lot of the powerhouse agenda just because it's hit the north harder than any other region and that's had a consequence for people living in the North and for the economy within the North. So we've seen child poverty go up by 200,000 in just five years - that's quite a big increase."" When Mr Osborne unveiled the Powerhouse plans in 2014 he was Chancellor in David Cameron's coalition government and had been an MP for a northern constituency - Tatton, in Cheshire - for 13 years. But he left the Cabinet after 2016's EU referendum, stood down as an MP at the following year's general election and is now the editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper. A government spokeswoman said the Northern Powerhouse remained a priority and was ""delivering results for people across the north with a record number of people in work and nearly 200,000 more businesses today than in 2010"". ""We're investing over Â£13bn in improving transport - more than any government in history - and, with almost half the region represented by five strong metro mayors, we're keeping our promise for more decisions in the north to be made by the north,"" she said.

"Sir Brian Leveson is retiring as head of criminal justice for England and Wales The most senior criminal judge in England and Wales has expressed ""enormous concern"" that many crimes are not being prosecuted. Sir Brian Leveson, who retires on Friday as Head of Criminal Justice, has warned the system could collapse without investment. He also told the BBC the government would be wrong to abolish prison sentences of less than six months. The government said it was investing Â£1bn in modernising the justice system. In the wake of the phone hacking scandal Sir Brian became a national figure, chairing the public inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press. Government sees off press inquiry bid Leveson report: At-a-glance In his role as head of criminal justice he led on the delivery of criminal justice for England and Wales.

""It is very, very concerning that citizens suffer wrongs and are not obtaining redress through the criminal courts,"" he said. ""The criminal courts are a critical part of our society and they are the way that society reflects the minimum standards of behaviour which it requires of all its citizens and therefore it is an enormous concern that crimes are not being detected and crimes are not being prosecuted,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Summer solstice at Stonehenge Thousands of people cheered sunrise at Stonehenge on summer solstice. About 10,000 people gathered at the Neolithic monument to greet the start of the longest day of the year, according to Wiltshire Police. Kate Logan, from English Heritage, said: ""There was a lovely, friendly atmosphere, the sun shone and the dawn was greeted with loud cheers."" The celebrations at Stonehenge came as people descended on sites across the UK to celebrate the first day of summer. Glastonbury Tor in Somerset and the Avebury stone circle in Wiltshire also attracted crowds. Stonehenge is a monument that aligns to the midsummer sunrise and the midwinter sunset. On the summer solstice, the sun rises behind the Heel Stone, the ancient entrance to the Stone Circle, and rays of sunlight are channelled into the centre of the monument. Those who observed the spectacle at the neolithic Wiltshire monument encountered a chilly morning accompanied by clear skies as the sun glinted over the horizon. Ms Logan said it was ""one of the highlights of the year"" at the ancient site. A moment of reflection at Stonehenge Police arrested four people at Stonehenge and a fifth was detained in Avebury. A 25-year-old man from Warminster was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving; a 15-year-old girl from Bulford was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly; a 44-year-old man from Salisbury was arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure and a 19-year-old man from the Isle of Wight was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. In Avebury, a 45-year-old man from Great Somerford was arrested on suspicion of common assault. Revellers celebrate the summer solstice as the sun rises at Glastonbury Tor in Glastonbury Among those taking photographs of the stunning skies above Somerset from Glastonbury Tor was Michelle Cowbourne. ""Look at the beautiful colours in the sky before sunrise,"" she said in a Tweet, in which she shared her pictures. ""What a beautiful morning,"" she added. Glastonbury Tor Summer solstice takes place as one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the sun and the sun reaches its highest position in the sky, ensuring the longest period of daylight in the year.

"The past decade has seen a huge surge in wind and solar capacity For the first time since the Industrial Revolution, Britain is obtaining more power from zero-carbon sources than fossil fuels. The milestone has been passed for the first five months of 2019. National Grid says clean energy has nudged ahead with 48% of generation, against 47% for coal and gas. The rest is biomass burning. The transformation reflects the precipitous decline of coal energy, and a boom from wind and solar. National Grid says that in the past decade, coal generation will have plunged from 30% to 3%. Meanwhile, wind power has shot up from 1% to 19%. Mini-milestones have been passed along the way. In May, for instance, Britain clocked up its first coal-free fortnight and generated record levels of solar power for two consecutive days. The shift is being driven by the need to cut emissions of the greenhouse gases that are over-heating the climate. The electricity sector was seen as the easiest place to start. John Pettigrew, CEO of National Grid, told BBC News: ""Over the last 10 years thereâs been real progress in de-carbonisation of the energy system â but 2019 is going to be a key milestone. ""It's the first time since the Industrial Revolution that more electricity has been produced from zero and low-carbon sources rather than fossil fuels. It's tremendously exciting because it's such a tipping point."" National Grid says it is confident to make predictions for Britain's whole year power generation based on figures so far and on historical patterns. In years to come, more energy storage will be needed as the share of wind and solar energy swells further. Mr Pettigrew told us some of the renewable energy generated when the wind is blowing or the Sun is shining will be stored in the batteries of people's electric cars for use later. The cars' charging systems will be reversed so their batteries can feed electricity back to the grid when demand peaks â like when people are cooking supper. This video can not be played The first electric car that can make money with the energy it stores ""One of key attributes of electric vehicles is they have a battery and therefore they can be used as a source of energy on to the network,"" he said. ""We could aggregate all the cars and use that electricity to support the grid when itâs needed. It's going to be a really effective tool for us to keep costs down."" The firm estimates this vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G) could solve 10-15% of the UK's demand for storage. But it's hard to be confident about projections because autonomous vehicles may disrupt patterns of car usage and ownership. Another way of filling in the gaps in energy when the wind's not blowing is by trading with continental neighbours. National Grid expects that giant cables from continental Europe will soon supply enough to power eight million homes. The firm says 63% of electricity imported through interconnectors this year has come from zero-carbon sources â much of it from French nuclear. UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 LED lights making dent in UK energy demand Climate change: Where we are in seven charts? The zero-carbon share should increase to 90% by the 2030s as the UK trades more electricity with Norwayâs vast hydropower system. There's still major uncertainty about low-carbon energy, though, with no clarity over nuclear power, and increased expected demand from motorists. Mr Pettigrew has joined the chorus of critics warning government that the progress of electric vehicles is too slow â and urging much more effort to decarbonise heat. The veteran energy analyst Tom Burke from e3g told BBC News: ""Today's landmark is a real tribute to technologists. We have cracked technical problems of dealing with climate change. ""The problems we face are political. As we move towards Net Zero (carbon emissions), jobs will be lost in fossil fuel industries and created in low-carbon industries. ""The government has blown hot and cold on climate policies â and it's shown no sign of thinking about managing the politics of this."" A government White Paper on energy is due soon.

"The Northern Powerhouse aims to encourage growth outside London and south-east England The Northern Powerhouse is being ""undermined"" by austerity despite signs of economic growth, a think tank says. Five years since its launch, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the project was at risk of ""fizzling out"". The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) North said the economy had ""moved in the right direction"" but more children were living in ""poor"" households. The government said record numbers of people were in work across the north. IPPR North, a centre-left think tank, said the Northern Powerhouse had succeeded in devolving power by creating five new ""metro mayors"" and a regional transport body - Transport for the North. However, it said the government had ""undermined"" the project while making cuts in public spending. Although spending has recently increased, the north has seen an overall Â£3.6bn a year reduction in real terms since 2009-10, while south-east and south-west England saw a Â£4.7bn rise. In an analysis marking five years of the Northern Powerhouse, IPPR North found positive changes included: 34,520 more jobs in professional, scientific and technical jobs in 2019 compared with 2014, plus a further 54,523 jobs in manufacturing roles. ""Marginally"" higher economic growth in the north than the national average - a 10.7% rise between 2014 and 2017, compared with 10.6% for the UK as a whole and 9.7% for the UK excluding London Employment in the north increased about 7%, compared to the UK average of just over 6% Broken down by individual region, the North West was second only to London for the rise in jobs. Scotland saw a slight decrease. George Osborne wanted to give northern cities more powers The Northern Powerhousewas first mentioned by the then Chancellor George Osbornein June 2014, when he outlined an ambition to bring together the cities, towns and rural communities of the north of England to fuel economic growth through modern transport links, devolved powers and increased investment. Cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle were encouraged to work together both in rivalling London and the South East and to ""take on the world"", with more jobs and opportunities. IPPR North said there had been ""several negative changes"" including: 800,000 northern children are living in ""poor"" households, a rise of about 200,000 since 2014 Weekly pay across the north has risen by Â£12 (2.4%), against a national average increase of Â£19 (3.5%) in real terms A household is defined as in ""relative poverty"" when its income is less than 60% of the median average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. How my sleeping town became a crime hotspot Harassment 'part of being shot girl' Police arrest 44 in grooming inquiry IPPR North said since 2014 transport spending in the north had increased by Â£149 per person in real terms, but this was less than half the Â£330 per person increase in London. Northern mayors want more investment in transport after figures showed train services also got worse. The number of cancelled and significantly late trains on TransPennine Express and Northern franchises more than doubled from 20,000 in 2014-15 to 47,000 in 2018-19. It meant that almost one in every 20 services was either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late arriving at its destination. by Danny Savage, BBC North of England correspondent Rail passengers in the north experienced thousands of delayed and cancelled services last year The idea of the Northern Powerhouse wastruly welcomed across this part of England- from Liverpool to Hull and up to Newcastle. Cumbria was a bit more lukewarm because it always feels geographically distant. People watched and waited. And five years on, many feel they're still waiting. Raise the issue with strangers on a train and comments like ""Northern Powercut more like"" or ""you mean the Northern Poorhouse"" are forthcoming. The government can point to a success in devolved power with regional mayors and some local initiatives but the perception of people living here is that the pledge made by George Osborne in 2014 hasn't been turned into action. They point to old trains, arguments over electrifying key rail routes and quite obviously more investment in the south. The north of England has a combined population of nearly 15 million people. That's a lot of potential voters for any government to disappoint. It's been thus for decades but should the north-south divide feel so stark in 2019? Andy Burnham says northern cities should be given the same powers as London Labour mayor Mr Burnham said the north had a louder voice than it did five years ago. ""There are signs in Greater Manchester that devolution is starting to work,"" he said. ""We're doing more to get people back to work but overall there is a real danger that the Northern Powerhouse could be about to fizzle out. ""Westminster has failed the North of England and that is over decades under governments of all colours."" Mayor of the Sheffield City Region, Labour MP Dan Jarvis, said he wanted the government to ""look at the north of England as an asset, not a liability"". Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: ""The northern authorities are working much more closely together and that's a real benefit. ""The real difficulty we have is that (transport) schemes are delayed and there's a real lack of commitment to rebalancing the economy."" Leeds council leader Judith Blake said the north was speaking with one voice The Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, said the Northern Powerhouse had helped him to secure the Â£35m purchase ofDurham Tees Valley Airport. He said: ""We've done very well out of it. We've got a huge amount of money from central government. We've got more powers and control over our own destiny and it's led to things like my ability to buy our local airport and the create the first mayoral development corporation outside of London that will create many thousands of jobs in the Tees Valley. ""We could always ask for more money and more powers and that's something we do on a daily basis but there's always more we can do on a pan northern level working together across political parties."" Luke Raikes from IPPR North said: ""Austerity has undercut a lot of the powerhouse agenda just because it's hit the north harder than any other region and that's had a consequence for people living in the North and for the economy within the North. So we've seen child poverty go up by 200,000 in just five years - that's quite a big increase."" When Mr Osborne unveiled the Powerhouse plans in 2014 he was Chancellor in David Cameron's coalition government and had been an MP for a northern constituency - Tatton, in Cheshire - for 13 years. But he left the Cabinet after 2016's EU referendum, stood down as an MP at the following year's general election and is now the editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper. A government spokeswoman said the Northern Powerhouse remained a priority and was ""delivering results for people across the north with a record number of people in work and nearly 200,000 more businesses today than in 2010"". ""We're investing over Â£13bn in improving transport - more than any government in history - and, with almost half the region represented by five strong metro mayors, we're keeping our promise for more decisions in the north to be made by the north,"" she said.

His rival, Jeremy Hunt, has said the UK may need more time, although he would accept no-deal as a last resort. Ahead of his Mansion House speech to the City on Thursday, Mr Carney said about three quarters of UK businesses have done as much as they could do to prepare for a no-deal. ""But it doesn't mean they are fully ready, in fact far from it,"" he told the BBC. He also stressed that in the event of a no-deal exit, the return of trade tariffs on goods shipped to the EU would be ""automatic"".

"Successors to Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and Donald Tusk will take office in November A summit of 28 European Union leaders has failed to reach agreement on who should take on the bloc's top jobs. The talks, held in Brussels, continued until the early hours of Friday morning without candidates being finalised. On top of trying to find majorities for successors, leaders were also trying to decide what issues the EU should prioritise over the next five years. A new summit will now be held on 30 June - just two days before a key meeting of the European Parliament. All of the bloc's top jobs are changing hands this year, following European-wide elections in May. Tense differences are said to have emerged over the successors for the key roles. After Thursday's summit, European Council President Donald Tusk confirmed a new summit was necessary. The most powerful role being decided is EU Commission president, held by ex-Luxembourg PM Jean-Claude Juncker since 2014. The European Commission drafts EU laws, oversees national budgets, enforces EU treaties and negotiates international trade deals. ""I note with certain amusement that it is not easy to replace me,"" Mr Juncker told journalists at a press conference. Who's in the running for EU top job? Green surge turns up heat on EU leaders Besides the replacements for him and Mr Tusk, the  leaders also have to decide on a new European Central Bank president and a high representative for foreign policy. Nominees require the support of least 21 of the 28 EU leaders and a majority in the European Parliament - which will meet on 2 July. The choices for the EU's top jobs have to take account of last month's European elections and achieve an acceptable balance regarding large and small states, gender and geography. The elections produced more political fragmentation, including a surge in the numbers of Green and liberal MEPs. What are the clear trends from EU elections? The contest for a new Commission president began with the parliament's ""Spitzenkandidat"" (lead candidate) race, but leaders do not have to go along with the result. The parliament says the president should come from the party with the most seats - which would mean Manfred Weber, a German in the centre-right European People's Party (EPP). Strong potential rivals to Mr Weber are EU veteran Frans Timmermans (Dutch, from the centre-left Socialist bloc) and Danish EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a liberal. But French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to favour Michel Barnier - the man who has been in charge of negotiating Brexit - for the post. The French and German leaders favour different candidates for the top job German Chancellor Angela Merkel had stressed the importance of finding a ""joint solution"" at the Council summit. Leaving the meeting on Friday, Mr Macron said no consensus was found on any of the leading candidates. ""The three Spitzenkandidat, the three names were tested by Donald Tusk and he considered that they had found no majority on either of these three names,"" he said. However, Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas struck a more upbeat note, telling journalists: ""All the names are still on the table but I am positive we will find a solution next Sunday"". Climate change was a big issue in last month's European elections, but on Thursday the leaders failed to get unanimous agreement on a 2050 target date for going ""carbon neutral"". France, Germany and the Netherlands were among a large group of states urging the EU to set that goal. It means reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a level where they are balanced by green initiatives, such as tree planting. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, heavily reliant on coal-fired power plants, opposed it. They are worried about the financial cost of shifting to green energy. The date was therefore relegated to a footnote in the conclusions,external, which says: ""For a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050."" This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures Brexit is not a major issue at this summit, but on Friday Mr Tusk is to give a brief update on developments regarding the UK's departure. The official EU position is that the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with outgoing PM Theresa May - and rejected by the UK Parliament - will not be reopened. When asked if Brexit negotiations could be extended again beyond the 31 October deadline, Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar was very sceptical. ""There's very much a strong view that there shouldn't be any more extensions. There's enormous hostility towards extension amongst the EU. I have endless patience but my colleagues do not,"" he said. UK would be 'diminished' after Brexit The summit adopted a Strategic Agenda for 2019-2024,external. It highlights: more intensive efforts to counter climate change measures to boost security on the EU's external borders and control migration into the bloc more resources to fight disinformation and ""hybrid threats"" which undermine European democracy better co-ordinated industrial policy, research and investment targeting digital technologies.

"Israel Folau says his legal fight is about religious freedom Rugby player Israel Folau, who was sacked by Rugby Australia (RA) for criticising gay people, has appealed for public donations to help him legally contest his dismissal. Folau, a 30-year-old star full-back, had his contract terminated in May after posting on social media saying ""hell awaits"" gay people. The devout Christian argues his firing was unlawful and an act of religious discrimination. RA says he breached a code of conduct. The former Wallabies player has drawn widespread condemnation for his social media comments, but he also has vocal supporters. On Friday, Folau released a video to launch a crowd-funding campaign aiming to raise A$3m (Â£1.6m; $2.1m) for his legal case. Folau sacked for anti-gay post Aussie rugby team same-sex marriage spat 'Teammates' homophobia stopped me playing footy' He filed a case against RA and Rugby New South Wales at the Fair Work Commission - Australia's national workplace relations tribunal - earlier this month. ""Every Australian should be able to practise their religion without fear of discrimination in the workplace,"" he says in the fundraising video. ""Even people who don't share my beliefs have defended my right to uphold and express them. ""If you want to join this journey with me, to fight for the right to freedom of religion, please donate."" Folau has played 73 Tests for Australia and was estimated to be on a contract worth A$5m. He owns a multi-million dollar property portfolio in Sydney and Brisbane,Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported,external. Folau said he and his wife had already spent more than A$100,000 on legal fees, after engaging a top legal team. RA has consistently defended their firing of the star full-back, saying he breached player behaviour standards ""including respectful use of social media"". It had previously warned Folau over anti-gay messages he had posted on social media in the past. This video can not be played How do you get rid of homophobia in football and rugby?

"Medicine has always been personal to some extent - a doctor looks for the best way to help the patient sitting in front of them. But with advances in technology, it is becoming possible to use the most unique of characteristics - our genomes - to tailor treatments for individuals. Genomes are made up of a complete set of our DNA, including all of our genes, and are the instruction manual on how to build and maintain the 37 trillion cells in our bodies. Any two people share more than 99% of their DNA. It's the remaining less than 1% that makes us unique, and can affect the severity of a disease and effectiveness of treatments. Looking at these small differences can also help us understand the best way to treat a patient for a range of diseases - from cancer and heart disease to depression. Cancer is the most advanced area of medicine in terms of developing personalised treatments. In the UK, differences in the DNA sequence are being used by the NHS to help doctors prevent and predict cancer. For example, women with an increased risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer have been identified by screening for changes to the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Mutations in these genesincrease a woman's risk of breast cancer by four-to-eightfoldand can explain why some families see many relatives with the disease. A BRCA1 mutation gives women alifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 40-50%. Screening has helped women make informed choices about treatment and prevention - for example, whether to have a mastectomy. It is steps like these - splitting patients into ever smaller groups to identify the best treatments - that is taking us towards personalisation. 'New era' of personalised cancer drugs 'Dismantling cancer' reveals weak spots Targeted checks 'prevent 10% of heart attacks' For certain cancers, measuring gene activity is becoming commonplace. Gene activity is a little like the dimmer switch on a light - it can be set to low, high or anywhere in between. Measuring this allows us to see how active a particular gene is in a tissue or cell. In breast cancer, a test measuring the activity of 50 genes in tumours can be used to guide decisions about whether the patient will benefit from chemotherapy. To extend this approach to other cancers, researchers are switching off all of the genes in hundreds of tumours grown in the laboratory. In doing so, scientists are looking for cancer's weaknesses - to try toproduce a detailed rule book for precision treatment,external. Genome sequencing is being offered in England tochildren with rare diseases- and has led to a change of treatment for some An 11-year-old became the first patient to use a leukaemia drug called CAR-T, whichre-programmes the immune system to fight cancer Theentire genetic code of women diagnosed with breast canceris being mapped by scientists in Cambridge There are plans to sequenceone million genomes in the UKin the next five years The development of such techniques raises the question: how far can personalisation go? For illnesses like heart disease, diabetes and infectious diseases, a combination of genetic, lifestyle and life events also play a part. This means that information about small differences in the DNA sequence alone will not be enough to predict susceptibility and outcome. Measuring the activity of our genes also captures information about current stresses to the body. For example, certain genes will have a higher or lower activity depending on the type of infection. Yuvan Thakkar, 11, is the first to receive a drug called CAR-T. His mother, Sapna, said: 'This new therapy is our last hope' Looking at gene activity could also provide important clues as to how to best treat a patient. One life-threatening illness where these techniques could help is sepsis. It is a condition in which the immune system damages its own organs when trying to fight an infection. Anyone can develop sepsis and it kills 52,000 people each year in the UK - more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined. Worldwide, a third of patients who develop sepsis die. To save lives, general antibiotics are given first to reduce the infection. A blood test is done to find out which particular bacteria have caused the sepsis, so a more targeted antibiotic can be given. More like this Can exercise reverse the ageing process? The disease that returned from the past Which countries eat the most meat? The places where too many are fat and too many are thin But these blood tests take precious time and cannot always identify the bacterium causing the infection. In our research, we are looking at gene activity in sepsis patients' immune systems, to give us clues as to why different people respond in different ways. We hope to pinpoint which part of their immune systems are not working properly - helping doctors decide how other drugs could be used. This demonstrates how personalised medicine could be used for short-term treatment in intensive care, as well as for longer-term illnesses like cancer. One challenge personalisation faces is speed - measuring what is happening in our genes is currently a slow, laboratory-based process. In order to be most effective in a medical setting, we need to be able to measure gene activity in a patient's blood instantly. New technology like themicroelectrode biosensordevice - which flags real-time critical changes in the blood - is being developed to make rapid analysis a reality. Through such advances it is hoped that genomic information, including gene activity, could become part of a GP's toolkit. Given recent advances in research and technology, the information in our genomes is likely to be used more and more often and in settings beyond cancer. Researchers are looking at thegenetic links to depression and anxiety,external, to help them understand the causes and develop new personalised treatments. They are also accessing large datasets like theUK Biobank,externalto use the small differences in DNA sequence toidentify people at high risk of a heart attack later in life,external. It is unlikely that information from your genome will result in a ""personalised pill"" being manufactured just for you.  Rather it could help doctors to tailor the right combination of medicines to treat the right person at the right time.

"This video can not be played Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe wants all new homes zero carbon from 2020 Almost Â£1bn a year should be set aside by Welsh Government to tackle climate change, a top adviser has urged. Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe said current funding for cutting emissions was ""nowhere near enough"". The money could be used for more public transport, insulating homes, planting trees and helping green energy schemes get off the ground. The Welsh Government said we must ""continuously raise our level of ambition"". Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths announced last week that Wales would set a legally-binding target for a 95% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, after declaring a climate emergency in May. Â£150m for improved public transport and Â£60m towards better cycling and walking provision is suggested Ms Howe said she could not fault the level of ambition, but warned more detail was needed about how it would be funded. ""What we can't get away from is the fact that this is going to require some really difficult spending decisions,"" she told BBC Wales. ""We can't just talk about it anymore - we need to be financing it and acting upon it."" Wales' 100% renewable energy challenge Reality check: Which renewable energy is cheapest? How does climate emergency affect us? She has launched a 10-point plan for ministers, calling on the Welsh Government to allocate more of its Â£18bn budget to reducing emissions. Currently 1% of spending goes on decarbonisation - about Â£200m for 2019-20.  Ms Howe wants that to rise to closer to 6% - or Â£991m. That is in line with recent advice from the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which estimated Â£30bn of public money would need to be spent between now and 2050 to eliminate greenhouse gases from our economy and way of life. TRANSPORT - Â£240m in the next budget Transport accounts for 14% of Wales' total emissions, with more than half coming from petrol and diesel cars. Ms Howe's plan sees Â£240m allocated to greener ways of getting around - with Â£60m used for walking and cycling infrastructure, and Â£150m for better public transport. She said Â£30m should go on encouraging uptake of low emissions vehicles - though this could be met by a mixture of public and private investment. A homes for power stations concept using solar cells, battery storage and a steel-frame build is being developed in Neath HOMES AND BUILDINGS - Â£330m in the next budget Housing currently makes up 9% of emissions from Wales, mainly from older, poorly insulated buildings. The plan says all new homes built here should be zero carbon from 2020. For the last three years, the Welsh Government has given Â£30m a year to support innovative housing schemes and Ms Howe said this should continue. The bigger challenge is retrofitting existing housing stock with energy efficiency measures so they use less power. The focus should be on people living in fuel poverty to start with, costing approximately Â£1bn per year - with the Welsh Government contributing Â£300m. RENEWABLE ENERGY - Â£200m in the next budget The plan repeats calls in a recent Institute of Welsh Affairs report for Wales to become 100% self-sufficient in renewable electricity by 2035. It would require about Â£30bn of investment over a 15-year period, from a combination of government, private sector and other sources. It is estimated it could support 20,150 jobs per year across Wales. The plans see 10% or Â£200m a year coming from public funding and calls on Welsh Government to ""set out urgently how the overall investment will be met"". FARMING AND THE ENVIRONMENT - Â£221m in the next budget Looking after the environment has a big role to play in meeting emissions targets as trees, plants and soil soak up and store carbon dioxide. About Â£16m a year should be spent on ""radically increasing tree cover"" in Wales, with the report warning that current planting targets are not being met. A further Â£205m a year should go on more green areas and habitats for wildlife in towns, cities and all new building developments. In addition to the new funding - the approximately Â£300m a year currently given as subsidies for farmers should be focused in future on supporting low carbon agricultural practices, Ms Howe said. 'Big shift' on climate emissions urged Climate change emergency declared Climate change in seven charts The end of the Welsh coal era Ms Howe would not be drawn on which areas of the budget should be cut, stating that her plan would be a ""starting point for those discussions"". However, she said spending more on climate change could reap long-term benefits such as job creation and savings for the NHS from cleaner air and encouraging people out of their cars. The CCC has repeatedly warned in recent years that Wales is set to miss a goal put in place by the Welsh Government in 2010 for a 40% cut in emissions by 2020. Latest figures for 2017 show a 25% fall, based on 1990 levels. Last year, the Welsh Government revised its targets - based on new advice from the CCC - and made them legally binding. So now it's aiming for a 27% cut by 2020 rising to 95% by 2050. Ms Howe said Wales was ""lagging considerably behind other countries across the world and indeed in the UK in a number of key areas such as investment in public transport, active travel, energy and re-greening our land"". A Welsh Government spokeswoman said:  ""It is clear we are facing a climate emergency and we must continuously raise our level of ambition.  We have published detailed sector emission profiles and 100 policies and proposals to tackle climate change in our low carbon plan. ""We welcome the contribution of the future generations office to this debate and would encourage all public bodies and communities to consider how they can contribute to tackling climate change. We all have a role to play."" How does 'climate emergency' affect us?

"About 1,400 homicides have been investigated by the Met in London since 2008 Murder detectives in London say the ""heartbreak"" of unsolved cases is being made worse by a ""wall of silence"". The Met has solved nearly 90% of homicide cases in the past decade but Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh says fears about ""snitching"" are a challenge. He said those who share information with police ""are not a grass, they are a public champion."" The aunt of Bjorn Brown, whose death is unsolved, said the wait for justice had prolonged her pain. Sandi Bogle (right) says silence around the death of her nephew Bjorn Brown had made the pain worse Commissioner Cressida Dick has previously said detectives wereoperating in a ""very challenging"" environment and were met with a ""wall of silence"" in some cases. The Met classes homicides as ""detected"" when a suspect is charged or following an inquest into the death of a suspect who would have been charged. Det Ch Insp McHugh said there were a higher number of unsolved homicides in 2018 and 2017 than other recent years because ""crimes don't necessarily get detected in the year they happen"". He said other challenges facing the homicide teams included extracting data from multiple mobile phones. ""Every mobile phone is effectively a computer. There is a massive amount of work for investigators to work through,"" Mr McHugh said. ""It might take two or three days to totally understand what a device was doing on that particular day. ""Recently, we had an investigation where we recovered 50 phones - it is enormous."" Det Ch Insp McHugh said he was keen to ""dismantle the snitching culture"". ""It is absolutely heartbreaking for the officers and the families, especially when there are people out there in the know, holding back information and hiding behind a wall of silence,"" he said. ""They are not a snitch, they are not a grass, they are a public champion."" The Met said it had a ""robust and comprehensive"" review process for all homicide investigations. If a case was unsolved after 28 days, a homicide investigation would be independently reviewed by specialist officers from the Met's Serious Crime Review Group. By Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs correspondent The clear-up rate for cases of murder and manslaughter has always been high - around 90% or above, with dedicated teams and substantial police resources rightly devoted to investigations. But the figures for the Met make worrying reading. Between 2008 and 2015 detections remained stable, with only 5 to 10 % of cases unsolved. Since then, however, the proportion of un-detected killings has risen from 13% in 2016 to 26% in 2017 and 2018. Although some cases will be classed as ""detected"" in the months to come as investigations develop and inquests conclude, the increase does suggest that murder is becoming harder to solve. As Noel McHugh suggests, it may be partly due to the volume of digital material now available and the reluctance of witnesses to come forward, particularly in street-based or gang-related crimes. But a shortage of detectives and forensic science provision, highlighted in numerous reports by inspectors and parliamentary committees, together with increased demands on police more generally, are also likely to be factors. Det Ch Supt Richard Wood explained unsolved murder cases were never closed and more recent cases were likely to be currently classed as ""undetected"" because of the normal length of a homicide investigation. He said: ""We prioritise resources to investigate homicides and work closely with the CPS to bring offenders to justice and support families at the most difficult of times."" The Met Police defines a ""detected"" homicide case as one that resulted in a charge Cases ""put on hold"" are reviewed every two years by an independent panel - chaired by a Commander - that aims to source any new information. One of the cases unsolved is that ofBjorn Brown, who was stabbed to death in Croydon in March 2017. Despite repeated CCTV appeals and a Â£20,000 reward for information - nobody has been charged with the 23-year-old's murder. His aunt Sandi Bogle - who featured in Channel 4's Gogglebox - said the so-called ""wall of silence"" had prolonged the pain of her family's loss and search for answers. Stormzy leads tributes to murdered friend Murder victim's family leave UK and say London 'too dangerous' 'Murders becoming harder to solve' ""It is sad that it has come to the point where money has to be offered for information,"" she said. ""It really makes you think people don't care about human life. ""Someone out there knows what has happened and I can't blame the police when there are friends and family who hide behind this wall of silence. ""It is painful, every event like birthdays, Christmas or Easter which go by, it just gets harder knowing Bjorn isn't there. ""It's never going to be too late to make that phone call and share whatever information you know so our family can get justice."" Det Ch Supt Wood expressed his sympathy to families such as Mr Brown's - but said cold cases often became ""lengthy and complicated"". He added: ""There is a huge amount of work taking place on unsolved murders. ""There are between 15 and 20 cases subject to a full cold case review at any one time. ""Behind every unsolved murder there is a family looking for answers. ""In some cases, they do take years to come to conclusion.""

"Successors to Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and Donald Tusk will take office in November A summit of 28 European Union leaders has failed to reach agreement on who should take on the bloc's top jobs. The talks, held in Brussels, continued until the early hours of Friday morning without candidates being finalised. On top of trying to find majorities for successors, leaders were also trying to decide what issues the EU should prioritise over the next five years. A new summit will now be held on 30 June - just two days before a key meeting of the European Parliament. All of the bloc's top jobs are changing hands this year, following European-wide elections in May. Tense differences are said to have emerged over the successors for the key roles. After Thursday's summit, European Council President Donald Tusk confirmed a new summit was necessary. The most powerful role being decided is EU Commission president, held by ex-Luxembourg PM Jean-Claude Juncker since 2014. The European Commission drafts EU laws, oversees national budgets, enforces EU treaties and negotiates international trade deals. ""I note with certain amusement that it is not easy to replace me,"" Mr Juncker told journalists at a press conference. Who's in the running for EU top job? Green surge turns up heat on EU leaders Besides the replacements for him and Mr Tusk, the  leaders also have to decide on a new European Central Bank president and a high representative for foreign policy. Nominees require the support of least 21 of the 28 EU leaders and a majority in the European Parliament - which will meet on 2 July. The choices for the EU's top jobs have to take account of last month's European elections and achieve an acceptable balance regarding large and small states, gender and geography. The elections produced more political fragmentation, including a surge in the numbers of Green and liberal MEPs. What are the clear trends from EU elections? The contest for a new Commission president began with the parliament's ""Spitzenkandidat"" (lead candidate) race, but leaders do not have to go along with the result. The parliament says the president should come from the party with the most seats - which would mean Manfred Weber, a German in the centre-right European People's Party (EPP). Strong potential rivals to Mr Weber are EU veteran Frans Timmermans (Dutch, from the centre-left Socialist bloc) and Danish EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a liberal. But French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to favour Michel Barnier - the man who has been in charge of negotiating Brexit - for the post. The French and German leaders favour different candidates for the top job German Chancellor Angela Merkel had stressed the importance of finding a ""joint solution"" at the Council summit. Leaving the meeting on Friday, Mr Macron said no consensus was found on any of the leading candidates. ""The three Spitzenkandidat, the three names were tested by Donald Tusk and he considered that they had found no majority on either of these three names,"" he said. However, Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas struck a more upbeat note, telling journalists: ""All the names are still on the table but I am positive we will find a solution next Sunday"". Climate change was a big issue in last month's European elections, but on Thursday the leaders failed to get unanimous agreement on a 2050 target date for going ""carbon neutral"". France, Germany and the Netherlands were among a large group of states urging the EU to set that goal. It means reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a level where they are balanced by green initiatives, such as tree planting. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, heavily reliant on coal-fired power plants, opposed it. They are worried about the financial cost of shifting to green energy. The date was therefore relegated to a footnote in the conclusions,external, which says: ""For a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050."" This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures Brexit is not a major issue at this summit, but on Friday Mr Tusk is to give a brief update on developments regarding the UK's departure. The official EU position is that the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with outgoing PM Theresa May - and rejected by the UK Parliament - will not be reopened. When asked if Brexit negotiations could be extended again beyond the 31 October deadline, Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar was very sceptical. ""There's very much a strong view that there shouldn't be any more extensions. There's enormous hostility towards extension amongst the EU. I have endless patience but my colleagues do not,"" he said. UK would be 'diminished' after Brexit The summit adopted a Strategic Agenda for 2019-2024,external. It highlights: more intensive efforts to counter climate change measures to boost security on the EU's external borders and control migration into the bloc more resources to fight disinformation and ""hybrid threats"" which undermine European democracy better co-ordinated industrial policy, research and investment targeting digital technologies.

"The review follows criticism of a televised debate between contenders in the Tory leadership contest The BBC is to review whether ""additional steps"" should be taken when vetting guests for political debates. The broadcaster was criticised over those given a chance to ask questions during its televised debate between candidates in the Tory leadership race. It emerged that one guest had shared allegedly anti-Semitic tweets - he was later suspended from his job. A BBC spokeswoman said ""vetting and transparency"" of guests for political programmes would be reviewed. ""We have a long history of producing successful debate programmes and this was no different,"" she said. She said it would be ""odd"" to have members of the public as contributors who all agreed ""with the politics of those they are questioning"". ""We did however, adopt a different format for this programme and we will look at whether there are additional steps we might take on vetting and transparency should we repeat it in the future,"" she added. BBC 'debate bias' and leadership race latest Five key moments from Tory leadership debate Johnson and Hunt left in Tory leader race On Wednesdaythe broadcaster defended its vetting processafter tweets by Imam Abdullah Patel came to light. The BBC said Mr Patel re-activated a previously inactive Twitter profile in the aftermath of Tuesday's programme, Our Next Prime Minister. The tweets had not been visible to its researchers before then, the BBC said. A screenshot of Mr Patel's Twitter feed from 2014posted on the Guido Fawkes website,externalshowed he shared a graphic of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"". Labour MP Naz Shah was temporarilysuspended from her partythree years ago after it emerged she had shared the same image on Facebook. Mr Patel would not have been selected for the programme if it had been ""aware of the views he expressed"", the broadcaster said. This video can not be played Abdullah Patel asked the Tory leadership candidates if they agreed that ""words had consequences"" Mr Patel, who asked the leadership candidates about the Islamophobic rhetoric faced by members of the Muslim community, was later suspended as deputy head of a girls' school. Al-Ashraf primary school in Gloucester said it was investigating the allegations against Mr Patel. Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire on Wednesday, he said had not criticised the Jewish community, but stood by criticism of Israeli policy. Separately, the BBC faced criticism on Wednesday for choosing as a guest on the programme a solicitor who has previously worked for Labour and once stood as a councillor for the party. In response the BBC said the questioners ""held a range of political views and we did not specify these views nor their backgrounds although some chose to do so themselves. ""The last questioner on the debate is a solicitor who was seconded by his law firm to the Labour Party in the past, rather than being a Labour 'staffer'.
