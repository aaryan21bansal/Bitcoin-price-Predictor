"Global death toll passes 20,000; confirmed cases 450,000; 110,000 people have recovered A quarter of the world's population is now living under some form of lockdown New York reports more than 25,000 cases but the governor says social distancing appears to be working President Donald Trump promises the US economy will take off ""like a rocket ship"" once the situation improves Prince Charles - heir to the British throne - tests positive for virus with ""mild symptoms"", palace says India's 1.3 billion people went into lockdown at midnight, with a ""total ban"" on leaving homes Russia's Putin postpones vote on constitutional change allowing him to stay in power The death toll in Spain has overtaken China, in Italy cases fall slightly from Tuesday Yaroslav Lukov, Gareth Evans, Emlyn Begley, Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Helier Cheung, Claudia Allen, Mal Siret, Andreas Illmer and Saira Asher We're pausing our live coverage for now, but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. Here's what you need to know: As always, you can find our latest coronavirus storieshere. And we leave you with this video which looks at the innovative ways people are socialising during the crisis: This video can not be played Celebrating a birthday party by video chat President Trump keeps reiterating that people need to get back to work, or the economy will suffer. However, he appears to have softened his stance slightly, compared to Tuesday, when he said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" Now, he says he hopes to have a recommendation on next steps by Easter, adding ""it could be sections of our country"" that go back to work, as ""there are big sections of our country that are little affected"". He says some of those going back to work could still practise ""social distancing and no hand shaking - they're going to wash their hands more than they've ever done"". ""The longer we stay out, the harder it is"" to improve the economy, he adds. The number of coronavirus cases confirmed across the US does vary greatly from state to state - from over 30,000 in New York, to about 30 in North Dakota. You can see how it is spread in our visual guidehere.  The economy is very much on Mr Trump's mind. He says that ""certain people"" would like the US ""not to open so quickly - would like it to do financially poorly, because they think that would do well at defeating me at the polls."" He tells a reporter: ""There are people in your profession that would like that to happen... there are people in your profession that write fake news."" He adds: ""We've done one hell of a job - nobody's done the job we've done."" Mr Trump regularly emphasises the importance of the economy - and attacks the media - in a way that appeals to his base. His re-election campaign is built around the claim that he has presided over record economic growth and low unemployment. You can read more about why Mr Trump wants stay-at-home orders liftedhere, and read about what the crisis reveals about the US, and its president,here. President Trump is now taking questions from reporters. Asked about his comments that the US should not rely on other countries, Mr Trump takes a swipe at the European Union (EU). ""We make the best medical equipment in the worldâ¦ but they have specifications, designed specifically so that our equipment can't come into their countries,"" he says. The EU has its own safety and specification standards for a variety of products - and the US does not meet all of them. ""They're all playing games against
us OK? They've been playing games against us for years... Some of the people who took the
biggest advantage of us? Our allies. They took advantage â financially but even
militarily as well."" Mr Trump has long argued that Nato allies should contribute more financially to the alliance, and that other countries should shoulder more of the burden. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
has thanked politicians on both sides for their ""bipartisan work"" on the relief bill. Earlier, President Trump urged Congress to pass the stimulus bill quickly, saying he would ""sign it immediately"" once it reached his desk. President Trump has been keen to stress that the US is ""now doing more testing than anybody by far"", including South Korea. Numerically this is true - but asour Reality Check team has found, this doesn't take into account the fact the US population is much larger. Mr Trump said that the emergency relief package going through the Senate would include ""$350bn [Â£295bn] in job retention loans for small businesses"" and ""funding for development of vaccines"". The economy is also on Mr Trump's mind - he said the economy would take off ""like a rocket ship"" once the situation got better, adding: ""I don't think it's going to be such a rough patch... we're going to open - the sooner the better."" He said the governor of New York was happy with the support from the federal government, adding: ""It's hard not to be happy with the job we're doing."" So far, President Trump has reiterated the importance of social distancing and listed a number of things the government has done, including:  He says Congress is ""close to passing"" the emergency relief bill. The coronavirus task force in the US is giving a press briefing. President Donald Trump is speaking now. We'll bring you more updates shortly. France is withdrawing its contingent of almost 200 soldiers from Iraq because of the pandemic that has caused 27 deaths there. Iraq's president has said the medical infrastructure is not up to required standards. In a statement the French military said the US-led coalition had ""decided to adjust its deployments"". The French contingent is involved in training Iraqi soldiers and working at coalition headquarters in Baghdad. An app tracking the symptoms of coronavirus has become one of the UK's most popular downloads, with creators hoping to deliver insights into why some people get the disease more severely than others. They also hope to create a map that shows where outbreaks are happening and a method of distinguishing cases from those of the common cold. Experts have warned people to be cautious about which apps they download in relation to the virus. At present, Covid Symptom Tracker is the third most popular app in Apple's UK store and second in Google Play's new releases chart for the country. President Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in Florida and Texas over the coronavirus pandemic. The phrase ""major disaster"" may sound scary, but it's actually something that states want - the declaration makes them eligible for federal assistance for relief work. Mr Trump has already issued disaster declarations for New York, Washington state, California, Iowa and Louisiana. You can see how coronavirus cases are distributed across the US in our visual guidehere. Florida has more than 1,400 cases Donald Trump is due to speak shortly at the White House on Covid-19. He's likely to be accompanied by officials including Dr Anthony Fauci, who has emerged as the face of America's fight against coronavirus. For Americans, he has become a trusted presence behind the podium at White House briefings, where he has dispensed facts about the US response, explaining the science and sometimes correcting President Trump's pronouncements.

British manufacturer Dyson has received an order for 10,000 ventilators from the UK government. BBC Business editor Simon Jack,externalreports that the order will be ready in April, and that the firm will also donate an extra 1,000 to the UK, and 4,000 to other countries. Ministers have asked manufacturers to switch their production in order to make the equipment, which can be used to help keep the worst-affected Covid-19 patients alive. The UK has evenpublished the design online,externalin a bid to help.

Nepal, a restaurant owner is giving away freshly cooked food to
stranded foreign tourists. Dorji Lama, who runs a popular restaurant in the town of Pokhara, says he wants to help tourists who can't travel or
find restaurants to eat at, due to the nationwide lockdown. He opens a side
door of his restaurant for two hours daily to hand out the parcels and fresh
water. He told BBC Nepali that on the first day of the lockdown, 56 tourists
came to his place for food, and today there were 78. Mr Lama says he felt obliged to
help during this time of crisis. Dorji Lama's restaurant in the tourist town of Pokhara Police officers patrol the streets of Lima, Peru Over 16,000 people have been arrested in Peru for ignoring compulsory social distancing measures announced in the country, President MartÃ­n Vizcarra has said. They were taken to police stations where they were detained for a few hours and reprimanded. The government is considering a fine for repeat offenders. Mr Vizcarra declared a state of emergency on 15 March and imposed an overnight curfew in many cities between the hours of 20:00 and 05:00. Those living in the areas under the state of emergency are only allowed out to buy food or to go to the hospital. Videos shared on social media showed residents of the capital, Lima, openly flouting the measures by drinking on the streets and playing football. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 Britons have been stranded in the South American country after it closed its borders and stopped all flights amid the coronavirus outbreak. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said special flights will be laid on later this week to bring them back. Peru has recorded 480 cases of the virus so far, and nine deaths. US President Donald Trump has again expressed his desire that people go back to work as soon as possible - even as more states have issued ""stay at home"" orders. Observers believe there could be growing divisions between medical professionals in the administration and those whose focus might lie on the economic impact of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Stay-at-home orders are issued and lifted by state governors, so Mr Trump doesn't have the power to directly order people back to work. However, his November re-election campaign is built around the claim that he has presided over record economic growth and low unemployment - both of which have been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. He also routinely attacks the media - which he describes as ""fake news"" - in a way that appeals to his base.

Our Reality Check team has alsofact-checked some of Mr Trump's latest tweets.  The UK government has been sending letters to 1.5 million people telling them to stay indoors for 12 weeks to avoid contracting coronavirus. The measure is known as ""shielding"" and covers people most at risk of requiring hospital treatment if they are diagnosed, such as those with organ transplants and some cancer patients. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick promised that those without the support of friends and family nearby would get help from the government for their essentials. This evening the minister tweeted a picture of what he said was the first food and supplies box ready to be delivered to one of the ""shielded"" people. Allow Twitter content?

Another 28 people have died from coronavirus in England, according to the latest numbers from the NHS. This brings the total number of deaths in the country to 414. NHS England said the patients who died were aged between 47 and 93 years old. All of the people, except the 47-year-old, had underlying health conditions. The figure brings the total number of deaths in the UK to 465. Earlier today, a further five were recorded in Wales, a further six in Scotland and two more in Northern Ireland. The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, is giving an update. The state currently has more than 2,600 confirmed cases - it's the American state with the third-most cases, after New York and New Jersey. Governor Newsom said:  He warned people to take physical distancing seriously. âWe can defeat this virus. But we canât defeat it unless we commit to fulfilling individual obligations. These stay at home orders are real â theyâre a bipartisan order.â Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Canada is implementing a mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for all travellers returning to the country from abroad. The decision to make the self-isolation measure legally required follows reports people weren't following the existing guidelines. Officials had warned travellers not to stop and pick up groceries or visit friends upon their return. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told a news conference that self-isolation would be a ""legal obligation"" across the country as of midnight. People could face fines or criminal charges.

"This video can not be played PM: Number of NHS volunteers in 24 hours equal to ""population of Coventry"" The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS in its fight against coronavirus has passed half a million, double the government's recruitment target. Speaking at his daily news conference, PM Boris Johnson said all 504,303 could now play an ""absolutely crucial"" role. The helpers are needed for delivering food and medicines, driving patients to appointments and phoning the isolated. The scheme is one of a number aimed at relieving pressure on the NHS. Mr Johnson said he a wanted to offer ""special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS"". He added: ""And to all of you, and all the former NHS staff who are coming back into the service, I say thank you on behalf of the entire country."" About 11,000 former medics have also agreed to return to the health service and more than 24,000 final year student nurses and medics will join them. Stephen Powis, NHS England medical director, said there had been ""outbreaks of altruism"" and he was ""bowled over"" by the medics returning to the front line and the response from volunteers. This comes as it was confirmedPrince Charles, the 71-year-old heir to the throne, tested positive for coronavirusafter displaying mild symptoms. He is now self-isolating at home in Scotland with the Duchess of Cornwall, who tested negative. A Clarence House spokesman said it was not possible to know who he had caught it from due to a ""high number of engagements"" in recent weeks. Buckingham Palace shared a picture of the Queen at Windsor Castle, holding her weekly meeting with the prime minister over the phone Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the death toll in England to 414. There have also been 22 deaths so far in Scotland, 22 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures. The government scheme to recruit 250,000 helpers - who must be over 18 and in good health - went live on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, they had exceeded their target, after many thousands signed up toGood Sam,external, the group coordinating the response. The help is being targeted at the 1.5 million people with underlying health conditions who have been asked to shield themselves from the virus by staying at home for 12 weeks.

There are nowcalls to replicate the volunteering scheme- which is currently only for those in England - in Wales. Meanwhile,Parliament has shut down until 21 April at the earliest, after sweeping emergency powers to tackle the coronavirus crisis were passed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the emergency legislation will allow ""extraordinary measures"" never seen in peacetime in the UK. What is in emergency coronavirus legislation? Claudia is an actress and her industry has shut down Technology expertAlex Hamilton, from Northampton, was among the first to sign up. ""I'm working from home but it's quiet. I'm doing a lot of gardening and this is an opportunity to do something to help - I've volunteered to do anything necessary."" His wife has a low immune system after having breast cancer twice and says she has concerns ""about what I could be bringing back"". ""But I want to do good,"" he said. University tutorRobert Howarth, 23, from Blackburn, has also signed up. ""I just want to help,"" he says. He is currently working remotely and part-time, which he says gives him the chance to do more. ""I've signed up for two roles out of the four on offer - to be a befriender helping people in self-isolation and delivering vital products."" ActressClaudia Grantis another to have signed up. With much of her industry having shutdown, she says she has time to help.

On Tuesday, it was also announced thatthe NHS will treat coronavirus patients in a makeshift field hospitalin the ExCeL Centre in east London. There has been widespread concern and anger at the shortages of personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Healthcare Supply Association has been forced to use Twitter to ask DIY shops to donate equipment to NHS staff.

STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The government is also facing growing pressure to stop non-essential construction work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus in the UK. On Tuesday, Mr Hancock saidthose who cannot do their jobs from home should go to work to ""keep the country running""and construction work could continue so long as people were 2m (6.5ft) apart. But critics said public health should be prioritised over the economy. Some builders and construction workers have said they feel ""angry and unprotected""going to work, while others are under pressure from employers to go in. Mr Johnson has so far resistedpressure from politicians, unions and workers themselvesto halt construction work. This video can not be played A construction worker filmed colleagues failing to distance themselves The confusion over who should and should not be travelling for work came after government guidance announced by Mr Johnson on Monday curtailed many freedoms on life in the UK. The prime minister said people should only leave their home to shop for basic goods, to fulfil medical or care needs, to exercise, and to travel to and from work - but only where ""absolutely necessary"". Since Tuesday evening, hundreds of British Transport Police have been deployed onto the rail network to tell travellers that only those making essential journeys for work should be using tubes and trains. The prime minister confirmed the government was considering asking black taxi drivers to take NHS workers to work so that they can avoid public transport. Public services are coming under increasing strain - London Ambulance Service said it was receiving 8,000 calls a day - up 3,000 on a ""very busy"" day before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, calls to the 111 service have increased by up to 400%. The Department for Work and Pensions processed almost half a million benefit claims over nine days. What is banned and what isn't? Doctor 'kicked out by landlady' amid virus fears Meanwhile,the government is considering the early releaseof some prisoners in England and Wales to relieve pressure. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the virus posed an ""acute"" risk in prisons, many of which were overcrowded and faced staff shortages as officers self-isolated. Some 19 inmates have now tested positive for coronavirus in 10 different prisons. Elsewhere, the government remains under pressure to provide financial support for self-employed workers who face a loss of income if forced to stop working due to sickness or quarantine. Mr Johnson said a package of support for those workers would be announced on Thursday.

"Spain now has more than 47,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 Spainâs death toll from the coronavirus has surpassed the official figure from China, becoming the second highest in the world. The number of deaths rose by 738 in 24 hours - a daily record - to 3,434, higher than the 683 announced in Italy. By comparison, China has officially reported 3,285 deaths, while Italy â the worst affected country â has 6,820. Spain's rate of infection has increased by a fifth and almost 27,000 people are being treated in hospital. Madrid is the country's worst affected region but Catalonia in the north-east has seen a rapid increase in cases. Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo has tested positive for the virus, the government says. She was admitted to hospital on Sunday with respiratory symptoms. MPs are to vote on extending the countryâs state of emergency for another two weeks until 11 April. Under the rules, people are banned from leaving home except for buying essential supplies and medicines, or for work. Globally there are 460,000 cases of the virus, with more than 20,000 deaths and more than 110,000 people having recovered, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. On Wednesday the UN said the virus was ""threatening the whole of humanity"" as it launched a $2bn (Â£1.7bn) appeal for the world's poorest people. ""Global action and solidarity are crucial. Individual country responses are not going to be enough,"" UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said. Figures released by the health ministry on Wednesday showed that in just 24 hours,Spainâs national death toll rose by 738,external. Its number of cases soared by 7,973.

"A test to see whether someone has already had coronavirus is being developed but will not be available within days, the UK government's chief medical adviser says. ""I do not think - and I want to be clear - that this is something we'll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week,"" Prof Chris Whitty said. The antibody test would let doctors and nurses with immunity to return to work. MPs heard 3.5 million had already been bought and were being tested. Public Health England's Prof Sharon Peacock told MPs if they proved effective, ""people will be able to order a test or go to Boots to have their finger-prick test done"" in the ""near future"". But Prof Whitty said: ""The one thing that is worse than no test is a bad test."" Experts needed to ensure ""the right people get the test first in order to allow workers to go back"". But the priority remained scaling up tests which reveal if someone currently has the illness. These are available only to hospital patients at the moment, but there are plans to extend them to NHS workers. During the prime minister's daily press conference, Prof Whitty said if everyone kept to social distancing rules, the outbreak was ""probably manageable"" although he conceded it would be a ""close-run thing"" for the NHS. ""At this point in time, as of today, there is not enormous pressure on critical care compared to a bad or even normal winter's day,"" he said. But this pressure is expected to increase over the next two weeks. This message was echoed by infectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson, who was questioned by the Science and Technology Committee of MPs on Wednesday. He said keeping people inside and increasing NHS staff and beds was likely to prevent intensive care units (ICUs) being overwhelmed nationally. Prof Ferguson told MPs he believed the government's current strategy would mean ""in some areas of the country, ICUs will get very close to capacity but it won't be breached at a national level"". ""There will be areas of the country which are extremely stressed but we are reasonably confident - which is all we can be at the current time - that, at the national level, we will be in capacity,"" he said. A key government adviser on the country's response to the crisis, Prof Ferguson was responsible for theImperial College modellingthat changed the government's approach and led to stricter social-distancing measures being introduced. These measures are aimed at completely suppressing the spread of the virus and preventing the health service being overwhelmed. The combination of keeping people in their homes and making more NHS resources available is predicted to bring demand down to a level hospitals can manage. There would be some resurgence of cases later, Prof Ferguson said, but these local outbreaks could hopefully be kept at a low level through more intensive testing. He told the committee that the latest research suggested as many as half to two-thirds of deaths from coronavirus might have happened this year anyway, because most fatalities were among people at the end of their lives or with other health conditions. The peak of demand for intensive care is expected to come in two to three weeks. The challenge the UK, and other countries, would then face, Prof Ferguson said, was how to move from a complete lockdown to a situation where some semblance of normal life could be allowed to restart, while still keeping coronavirus cases low. Part of this would be about significantly increasing the numbers of people being tested, until a vaccine could be found. But, Prof Ferguson added, theUK did not currently have the capacity to teston the level of countries such as South Korea. There are plans to expand testing capability significantly, however, first for the sickest people, then for NHS workers and eventually to find out if people in the general population have already had the virus.

The listwas updated on Wednesday,externalamid increasing reports supermarkets are selling out of some beers and wines. A major pub chain has said ""almost all"" its business had gone to supermarkets.

Pubs and restaurants have been required to close under the new restrictions,prompting complaintsfrom the head of Wetherspoons pub chain, Tim Martin, who said that most of the chain's trade had gone to supermarkets. Wetherspoons CEO Tim Martin says much of his trade is going to the supermarkets Exactly what qualifies as an ""essential business"" is causing confusion in some quarters. The director general of the CBI business organisation Carolyn Fairbairn says many firms ""do not know whether to stay open or to close"".

Halfords is covered by the essential retailers list. Boss Graham Stapleton said the chain had ""an essential role to play in keeping the country moving"". Its Autocentre garages and mobile vans remain open, with plans for ""partial store coverage"" across its 446 shops. The chain drew criticism after saying it would keep some stores open after being named by the government as an ""essential provider of services"". #BoycottHalfords was trending on social media on Tuesday. Some Twitter users cited concerns over a lack of protection for on-site workers while others, including MSP Fulton MacGregor, questioned whether the business should be open at all.

It also said it had the ""legal flexibility to remain open across the entire business"". Mr Stapleton said his chain had a part to play ""in providing vital support to emergency workers, fleet operations and the general population as they travel for essential supplies"". Halfords pointed out it was offering all NHS frontline workers a free 10-point car check during the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as the government announced it would grant drivers a six-month emergency MOT extension under new regulation due to come into force on 30 March to ensure ""frontline workers to get to work"". Other bicycle firms such as Brompton Bicycle, a folding bike specialist, have lent bicycles to staff at hospitals in London to help them get to and from work.

High Street retailer Next has confirmed it's offering some staff a 20 per cent pay rise if they volunteer to go into stores to help pick online orders, despite government warnings to stay at home. While all of its stores are closed to the public, the retailer says there are some items in its shops which have already been ordered and promised to online customers. The retailer said a ""very small group of volunteers"" will pick the orders under ""strict supervision and social distancing rules"". After strict new restrictions were brought in by government earlier this week, it issued a list of âessential retailersâ, such as Halfords, that are allowed to stay open. They include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Off-licences and licensed shops selling alcohol, including those within breweries Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Launderettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post offices Banks Trade industry bodies had previously said that bicycle retailers and repair shops had seen a spike in demand as people ""clean the cobwebs off"" their old bikes in an attempt to avoid public transport during the pandemic. Jonathan Harrison of the Association of Cycle Traders told the BBC that ""there had been an uplift in sales across the board, with larger retailers also reporting more 'entry-level' bikes going."" However, he pointed out that with more consumers staying in due to the new government restrictions, ""it's difficult to know whether or not that trend will continue.""

"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (Â£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%. Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal. Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday saidhe wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis. William Foster, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it would ""help mitigate the depth and duration of the economic shock"". ""Nonetheless, we expect the virus to have a significant negative impact on growth and the fiscal deficit this year,"" he said. Governments around the world have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by locking down societies in the hope of slowing the spread of the virus. The International Monetary Fund has warned the hit to global growth is likely to be bigger than the financial crisis. Many countries are now working on stimulus packages to support their economies, but these plans have received mixed responses from investors, as markets experience unprecedented volatility as they grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This month alone has seen the Dow having the five biggest daily gains and five biggest falls of its 135-year history. Reacting to news of the stimulus package, Tom Stevenson, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: ""It's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet. ""When markets are falling, you get these big rallies but you shouldn't get stuck on that. They do bounce around in these situations."" THE LATEST:Live updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The US rescue package follows five days of intense negotiations to try to agree a deal that will provide aid for American workers and businesses. Before it becomes law the deal must get through the Republican-controlled Senate, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve has already announced $4tn in extra lending to help stimulate the economy in the face of the coronavirus. US stocks surged in anticipation of the massive economic stimulus deal Nearly 19,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide since it emerged in China's Wuhan province in January, and more than 420,000 infections have been confirmed. Southern Europe is now at the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy. The US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history. Like the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. But there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon. Some economists say US firms may need five times as much cash to prevent mass bankruptcy and unemployment.

"The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are isolating at Birkhall, their residence on the Balmoral estate The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has announced. Prince Charles, 71, is displaying mild symptoms ""but otherwise remains in good health"", a spokesman said, adding that the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, has been tested but does not have the virus. Charles and Camilla are now self-isolating at Balmoral. Buckingham Palace said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, but was ""in good health"". The palace added that the Duke of Edinburgh was not present at that meeting, and that the Queen was now ""following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare"". A Clarence House statement read: ""In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland. ""The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing. ""It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks."" Buckingham Palace releases a photograph of the Queen speaking to the prime minister from Windsor Castle The duke and duchess arrived in Scotland on Sunday. Charles had been displaying mild symptoms over the weekend and was tested by the NHS in Aberdeenshire on Monday. The results came through on Tuesday night, showing he was positive. Charles is still working, is up and about and in good spirits. The 71-year-old heir to the throne last saw the Queen briefly on the 12 March. Three days earlier, mother and son had more protracted contact during the Commonwealth Day Service. It is important to re-emphasise the Queen is in good health. She moved to Windsor last week, with the Duke of Edinburgh who came from his usual residence at Sandringham in Norfolk. Given their ages, 93 and 98 respectively, there will be particular care taken that they are not jeopardised by this virus. Prince Charles and Camilla will be following governmental advice and isolating separately.  It's not a huge house but certainly big enough to isolate yourself within it. They've got a small staff with them - and it's expected Charles will now be in Scotland for a couple of weeks recovering from the symptoms. The prince's last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw the Queen - when he attended a dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort. However, Charles has also been working from home over the last few days, and has held a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy of Cornwall individuals, all of whom have been made aware. A number of household staff at Birkhall - the prince's residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes. A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

And we leave you with this video which looks at the innovative ways people are socialising during the crisis: This video can not be played Celebrating a birthday party by video chat President Trump keeps reiterating that people need to get back to work, or the economy will suffer. However, he appears to have softened his stance slightly, compared to Tuesday, when he said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" Now, he says he hopes to have a recommendation on next steps by Easter, adding ""it could be sections of our country"" that go back to work, as ""there are big sections of our country that are little affected"". He says some of those going back to work could still practise ""social distancing and no hand shaking - they're going to wash their hands more than they've ever done"". ""The longer we stay out, the harder it is"" to improve the economy, he adds. The number of coronavirus cases confirmed across the US does vary greatly from state to state - from over 30,000 in New York, to about 30 in North Dakota. You can see how it is spread in our visual guidehere.  The economy is very much on Mr Trump's mind. He says that ""certain people"" would like the US ""not to open so quickly - would like it to do financially poorly, because they think that would do well at defeating me at the polls."" He tells a reporter: ""There are people in your profession that would like that to happen... there are people in your profession that write fake news."" He adds: ""We've done one hell of a job - nobody's done the job we've done."" Mr Trump regularly emphasises the importance of the economy - and attacks the media - in a way that appeals to his base. His re-election campaign is built around the claim that he has presided over record economic growth and low unemployment. You can read more about why Mr Trump wants stay-at-home orders liftedhere, and read about what the crisis reveals about the US, and its president,here. President Trump is now taking questions from reporters. Asked about his comments that the US should not rely on other countries, Mr Trump takes a swipe at the European Union (EU). ""We make the best medical equipment in the worldâ¦ but they have specifications, designed specifically so that our equipment can't come into their countries,"" he says. The EU has its own safety and specification standards for a variety of products - and the US does not meet all of them. ""They're all playing games against
us OK? They've been playing games against us for years... Some of the people who took the
biggest advantage of us? Our allies. They took advantage â financially but even
militarily as well."" Mr Trump has long argued that Nato allies should contribute more financially to the alliance, and that other countries should shoulder more of the burden. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
has thanked politicians on both sides for their ""bipartisan work"" on the relief bill. Earlier, President Trump urged Congress to pass the stimulus bill quickly, saying he would ""sign it immediately"" once it reached his desk. President Trump has been keen to stress that the US is ""now doing more testing than anybody by far"", including South Korea. Numerically this is true - but asour Reality Check team has found, this doesn't take into account the fact the US population is much larger. Mr Trump said that the emergency relief package going through the Senate would include ""$350bn [Â£295bn] in job retention loans for small businesses"" and ""funding for development of vaccines"". The economy is also on Mr Trump's mind - he said the economy would take off ""like a rocket ship"" once the situation got better, adding: ""I don't think it's going to be such a rough patch... we're going to open - the sooner the better."" He said the governor of New York was happy with the support from the federal government, adding: ""It's hard not to be happy with the job we're doing."" So far, President Trump has reiterated the importance of social distancing and listed a number of things the government has done, including:  He says Congress is ""close to passing"" the emergency relief bill.

An app tracking the symptoms of coronavirus has become one of the UK's most popular downloads, with creators hoping to deliver insights into why some people get the disease more severely than others. They also hope to create a map that shows where outbreaks are happening and a method of distinguishing cases from those of the common cold. Experts have warned people to be cautious about which apps they download in relation to the virus. At present, Covid Symptom Tracker is the third most popular app in Apple's UK store and second in Google Play's new releases chart for the country. President Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in Florida and Texas over the coronavirus pandemic. The phrase ""major disaster"" may sound scary, but it's actually something that states want - the declaration makes them eligible for federal assistance for relief work.

Nepal, a restaurant owner is giving away freshly cooked food to
stranded foreign tourists. Dorji Lama, who runs a popular restaurant in the town of Pokhara, says he wants to help tourists who can't travel or
find restaurants to eat at, due to the nationwide lockdown. He opens a side
door of his restaurant for two hours daily to hand out the parcels and fresh
water. He told BBC Nepali that on the first day of the lockdown, 56 tourists
came to his place for food, and today there were 78. Mr Lama says he felt obliged to
help during this time of crisis.

They were taken to police stations where they were detained for a few hours and reprimanded. The government is considering a fine for repeat offenders. Mr Vizcarra declared a state of emergency on 15 March and imposed an overnight curfew in many cities between the hours of 20:00 and 05:00. Those living in the areas under the state of emergency are only allowed out to buy food or to go to the hospital. Videos shared on social media showed residents of the capital, Lima, openly flouting the measures by drinking on the streets and playing football. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 Britons have been stranded in the South American country after it closed its borders and stopped all flights amid the coronavirus outbreak. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said special flights will be laid on later this week to bring them back. Peru has recorded 480 cases of the virus so far, and nine deaths. US President Donald Trump has again expressed his desire that people go back to work as soon as possible - even as more states have issued ""stay at home"" orders. Observers believe there could be growing divisions between medical professionals in the administration and those whose focus might lie on the economic impact of the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Stay-at-home orders are issued and lifted by state governors, so Mr Trump doesn't have the power to directly order people back to work. However, his November re-election campaign is built around the claim that he has presided over record economic growth and low unemployment - both of which have been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. He also routinely attacks the media - which he describes as ""fake news"" - in a way that appeals to his base.

The UK government has been sending letters to 1.5 million people telling them to stay indoors for 12 weeks to avoid contracting coronavirus. The measure is known as ""shielding"" and covers people most at risk of requiring hospital treatment if they are diagnosed, such as those with organ transplants and some cancer patients. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick promised that those without the support of friends and family nearby would get help from the government for their essentials. This evening the minister tweeted a picture of what he said was the first food and supplies box ready to be delivered to one of the ""shielded"" people. Allow Twitter content?

Another 28 people have died from coronavirus in England, according to the latest numbers from the NHS. This brings the total number of deaths in the country to 414. NHS England said the patients who died were aged between 47 and 93 years old. All of the people, except the 47-year-old, had underlying health conditions.

The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, is giving an update. The state currently has more than 2,600 confirmed cases - it's the American state with the third-most cases, after New York and New Jersey. Governor Newsom said:  He warned people to take physical distancing seriously. âWe can defeat this virus. But we canât defeat it unless we commit to fulfilling individual obligations.

"A test to see whether someone has already had coronavirus is being developed but will not be available within days, the UK government's chief medical adviser says. ""I do not think - and I want to be clear - that this is something we'll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week,"" Prof Chris Whitty said. The antibody test would let doctors and nurses with immunity to return to work. MPs heard 3.5 million had already been bought and were being tested. Public Health England's Prof Sharon Peacock told MPs if they proved effective, ""people will be able to order a test or go to Boots to have their finger-prick test done"" in the ""near future"". But Prof Whitty said: ""The one thing that is worse than no test is a bad test."" Experts needed to ensure ""the right people get the test first in order to allow workers to go back"". But the priority remained scaling up tests which reveal if someone currently has the illness. These are available only to hospital patients at the moment, but there are plans to extend them to NHS workers. During the prime minister's daily press conference, Prof Whitty said if everyone kept to social distancing rules, the outbreak was ""probably manageable"" although he conceded it would be a ""close-run thing"" for the NHS. ""At this point in time, as of today, there is not enormous pressure on critical care compared to a bad or even normal winter's day,"" he said. But this pressure is expected to increase over the next two weeks. This message was echoed by infectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson, who was questioned by the Science and Technology Committee of MPs on Wednesday. He said keeping people inside and increasing NHS staff and beds was likely to prevent intensive care units (ICUs) being overwhelmed nationally. Prof Ferguson told MPs he believed the government's current strategy would mean ""in some areas of the country, ICUs will get very close to capacity but it won't be breached at a national level"". ""There will be areas of the country which are extremely stressed but we are reasonably confident - which is all we can be at the current time - that, at the national level, we will be in capacity,"" he said. A key government adviser on the country's response to the crisis, Prof Ferguson was responsible for theImperial College modellingthat changed the government's approach and led to stricter social-distancing measures being introduced. These measures are aimed at completely suppressing the spread of the virus and preventing the health service being overwhelmed. The combination of keeping people in their homes and making more NHS resources available is predicted to bring demand down to a level hospitals can manage. There would be some resurgence of cases later, Prof Ferguson said, but these local outbreaks could hopefully be kept at a low level through more intensive testing. He told the committee that the latest research suggested as many as half to two-thirds of deaths from coronavirus might have happened this year anyway, because most fatalities were among people at the end of their lives or with other health conditions. The peak of demand for intensive care is expected to come in two to three weeks. The challenge the UK, and other countries, would then face, Prof Ferguson said, was how to move from a complete lockdown to a situation where some semblance of normal life could be allowed to restart, while still keeping coronavirus cases low. Part of this would be about significantly increasing the numbers of people being tested, until a vaccine could be found. But, Prof Ferguson added, theUK did not currently have the capacity to teston the level of countries such as South Korea. There are plans to expand testing capability significantly, however, first for the sickest people, then for NHS workers and eventually to find out if people in the general population have already had the virus.

"This video can not be played Shafee Elsheikh and Alexander Kotey: Could face trial in US The UK acted unlawfully by passing evidence to the US that could lead to the execution of two British members of an Islamic State murder squad. The Supreme Court said former Home Secretary Sajid Javid should not have passed information on Shafee Elsheikh and Alexander Kotey to the US. Lord Kerr said the seven justices concluded the decision in 2018 breached the UK's strict data protection laws. The Londoners, linked to 27 murders, are in US custody in Iraq. Along with two other British men, they formed a foursome known as ""The Beatles"", allegedly helping to kidnap, torture and murder hostages. They were seized by Kurdish forces in 2018 as the Islamic State group began to crumble - and the US says it wants to prosecute them if the UK won't put the men on trial in London. Last year, the government agreed to hand over as many as 600 witness statements and related material after initially refusing to do so without a  guarantee they wouldn't face the death penalty. Elsheikh's mother, Maha Elgizouli, challenged the home secretary's decision to share that information with the US - not to prevent him from being prosecuted and jailed but to protect him from the death penalty. Welcoming the ruling, her lawyers said she recognised the difficult issues her case had raised. ""She has always expressed her belief that her son, if accused, should face justice - and that any trial should take place in the UK,"" they said in a statement. ""She has been asking since November 2018 for the CPS to conduct a review of the claim that there was insufficient evidence for him to be charged and tried in the UK - a review that the CPS now says should be completed by April 2020."" Now the court has ruled in her favour. There must be a further decision over what the UK must now do to comply with the law - including potentially asking the US to hand back information. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The government's priority has always been to maintain national security and to deliver justice for the victims and their families. This has not changed. We are clearly very disappointed with today's judgment and are carefully considering next steps."" Explaining the judgment over an unprecedented video link, due to coronavirus measures, Lord Kerr said: ""Much of the information provided, or to be provided, to the US authorities consisted of personal data. He said a transfer of personal data to a third country was only lawful if it was based on there being appropriate safeguards or on special circumstances. ""Here there was no adequacy decision and no appropriate safeguards,"" he added. Lord Kerr: Delivering judgment by video link due to coronavirus measures In the weeks leading up to the decision, British diplomats in Washington warned Mr Javid that US President Donald Trump would be ""wound up"" by any continued refusal by London to hand over the information American prosecutors needed. Lord Kerr said the decision by Mr Javid to transfer the information was ""based on political expediency, rather than strict necessity"". The seven justices however were split over whether the UK had a more wide-ranging legal bar on sharing any information with the US that could put someone at risk of capital punishment. The UK currently won't extradite someone to face trial in the US or other countries unless it first receives an assurance that they will not be put to death. However, the law on sharing information that could be used against someone already in the other country's custody, is less clear. Lord Kerr said: ""Law must be responsive to society's contemporary needs, standards and values, which are in a state of constant change. That is an essential part of the human condition and experience. ""I concluded, therefore, that a common law principle should be recognised whereby it is deemed unlawful to facilitate the trial of any individual in a foreign country where, to do so, would put that person in peril of being executed."" A majority of the other justices disagreed - concluding that the law did not extend that far because Parliament had not explicitly banned ministers from sharing information on criminals with countries that use the death penalty.

"This video can not be played Vladimir Putin visited a Moscow hospital for coronavirus patients Russian President Vladimir Putin has postponed a vote on constitutional change that would allow him to stay in power, because of coronavirus concerns. He said the public vote - previously due to be held on 22 April - would be delayed until a ""later date"". The proposed changes include scrapping a ban on allowing Mr Putin to run for office again. The changes have already been approved by parliament and Russia's constitutional court. They would give Mr Putin - who is serving his fourth presidential term and has dominated Russian politics for two decades - the right to serve two more consecutive terms. Live updates on the coronavirus pandemic from around the world Later on Wednesday Russia confirmed the deaths of two people who had been diagnosed with the virus. The 88- and 73-year-olds had pre-existing conditions, Ria Novosti reported. Russia has a total of 658 cases. ""The absolute priority for us is the health, life and safety of people. Therefore I believe that the vote should be postponed until a later date,"" Mr Putin said. Russia has more than 650 confirmed cases Mr Putin also announced that Russians would not work next week ""to slow the speed"" of the infection. But he warned that it was impossible to prevent any spread of the virus at all in Russia because of the country's size. This is Vladimir Putin bowing, finally, to the inevitable. Holding a nationwide vote in a pandemic had always seemed bad politics, at the very least. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny had even called it ""criminal"", especially as Russia's most faithful voters are pensioners and among the most vulnerable to the virus. Mr Putin had seemed to be delaying the decision, though, hoping Russia would somehow escape the worst of Covid-19. Some suspected the statistics were being massaged to make it seem that way, a claim officials here have denied repeatedly. But the number of confirmed cases is now climbing in Russia, like everywhere else. Russia's president promised this was a postponement, not a cancellation. While critics call the vote a crude way of ensuring Mr Putin remains in power, the Kremlin is keen the process should look legitimate, the people's choice. The delay, though, does mean officials across the country can finally focus on the clear priority - battling a pandemic, not securing a vote for Mr Putin. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The Russian economy was also under serious pressure because of the virus, Mr Putin said. During their week off, employees would continue to be paid and key services would continue, he said. He also announced extended welfare support, including for families with children and those who had lost jobs.

It has also stopped cultural and sporting events and closed gyms, cinemas and nightclubs, although cafes and restaurants have been allowed to stay open. But the country has so far stopped short of imposing the kind of lockdown seen in some European countries. There have been more than 435,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Europe is now the centre of the global outbreak. Spainâs death toll has surpassed the official figure from China, becoming the second highest in the world. Deaths have risen by 738 in just 24 hours to a total of 3,434 Italyhas increased punishments for breaking virus control measures, including fines of thousands of euros and five-year prison terms for anyone who tests positive and breaks their quarantine. Nearly 70,000 people have tested positive for the illness there On Tuesday,Francebecame the fifth country to record more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths. Jerome Salomon, the country's top health official, has warned that the number could be even higher, as the 1,100 confirmed total only counts people who died in hospitals.

"Motorists worried about getting an MOT because of the coronavirus crisis, have been handed a six-month reprieve. The government has granted car owners a six-month exemption from MOT testing. However, it won't come in until Monday 30 March which means vehicles due an MOT before then must still take it. The exemption ""will enable vital services such as deliveries to continue, frontline workers to get to work, and people get essential food and medicine,"" the government said. The exemption will apply to cars, motorcycles and vans, but the government warned that vehicles must be kept in a roadworthy condition. Garages will remain open for essential repair work while drivers will face prosecution if they're caught driving unsafe vehicles. ""We must ensure those on the frontline of helping the nation combat COVID19 are able to do so,"" said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. ""Safety is key, which is why garages will remain open for essential repair work."" The Department for Transport said the move won't hit any insurance claims during the period because they will be effectively extending MOT certificates meaning they will remain valid for insurance purposes. The new law will be introduced on 30 March when it will come into immediate effect for 12 months. What are the new restrictions and why are they needed? How long can I exercise for? and other questions answered What's the risk of taking buses or trains? It is not being introduced immediately because the government said it must ensure regulations are legally sound before coming into force. That means there will be a short consultation with key organisations before next Monday. However, drivers will still need to get their vehicle tested until the new regulations come into place if they need to travel. However, if someone is unable to get an MOT that is due because they are self isolating, the Department for Transport said it is working with insurers and the police to ensure people are not unfairly penalised for things out of their control. Practical driving tests and annual testing for lorries, buses and coaches have already been suspended for up to three months. The RAC said the move was a positive one, although drivers must remain responsible. ""We are in exceptional times and that calls for exceptional measures like this,"" an RAC spokesperson said.

If they know it's got problems or was likely to fail its MOT they should not be driving it."" At MOT centres across the country, extra precautions have already been put in place to protect customers and workers. At National Tyres and Autocare, for instance, staff routinely wear protective barrier gloves, fit seat covers and use floor mats before working on customers' vehicles. Meanwhile, technicians work on ramps that are suitably spaced apart and customers do not need to interact with staff in the workshop's space. ""Our customers have been asking if they still need to MOT their vehicles and, of course, it's vital that everything is maintained and kept roadworthy, so today's announcement that MOTs will be exempt for the next six months is welcome news for everybody,"" said Michael Bourne, marketing director at the firm. ""We all recognise our role to stop the spread of germs, while keeping key workers on the road and able to do their jobs,"" he said.

"A growing number of construction companies have said they will stop all non-essential work to help fight the coronavirus, but others continue to operate amid confusion over the government's advice. Housebuilder Persimmon has joined others in pledging to down tools, while most work has stopped on HS2 rail. But FTSE 250 listed Redrow is among those keeping sites open. There is concern the virus will spread easily on busy construction sites. The government has said work can continue so long as people are 2m (6.5ft) apart, but critics say this is impossible to enforce, and that public health should come first. Taylor Wimpey, which builds over 10,000 homes a year,  said this week that it was closing all of its sites ""because we believe it is the right thing to do"". Barratt, meanwhile, said it would close 400 sites and offices to prioritise ""the health and safety of customers and employees"". Persimmon said it would stop all but essential work, while the majority of HS2 sites had ""paused or are pausing construction works,"" a spokesperson for the project said. But Cairn Construction, which built 2,200 homes last year, was among those to say it would keep its sites open. ""Aligned to government guidelines, construction activity continues across each of our active sites under extensive health and safety protocols,"" the firm said. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said any worker who could not do their job from home should go to work to ""keep the country running"". But Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told ITV only construction workers doing jobs ""critical to the economy"" should go in. He added that builders should not be going into people's homes. Construction workers fear for their safety What are the new restrictions and why are they needed? On Wednesday, however, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick repeated Mr Hancock's advice and told the BBC that work in  people's homes was allowed if it was done safely. Reflecting the confusion, construction trade groups are currently giving differing advice to members. The National Federation of Builders, which represents small-to-medium sized contractors, said builders could work on sites if they followed safety guidelines, but the Federation of Master Builders said they should only go in if it is for emergency work. ""While we accept the government's advice to keep sites open, we have concerns about how this would be applied in practice,"" FMB boss Brian Berry said. Former Tory cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith joined those calling for a pause to all non-essential work in the UK, telling BBC Two's Newsnight: ""I think the balance is where we should delete some of those construction workers from going to work and focus only on the emergency requirements."" Andy Burnham, Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, told the programme the decision to allow non-essential work appeared to have been made for ""economic reasons"". ""When you're in the middle of a global pandemic, health reasons alone really should be guiding all decision-making,"" he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has promised help for the self-employed Some construction workers told the BBC they feel ""angry and unprotected"" going to work, while others are under pressure from employers to go in. Many are self-employed and fear that they could lose income if their employers shut down. Chancellor Rishi Sunakhas promised help for the self-employedand will announce a package of support on Thursday at the government's daily press conference, a government source told the BBC. Taylor Wimpey said it was looking at how to support its around 2,000 directly employed staff, but had no plans for the ""sizable number"" of self employed freelancers on its sites. ""They are generally not actually operating for us, they are operating for a sub-contractor, so we are trying to support our subcontractors [by paying them on time or in advance],"" boss Pete Redfern told the BBC's World at One. He admitted self-employed workers were the ""single biggest gap"" and that it was ""critical"" government support came through quickly. Different countries and regions have taken different approaches to the issue. Italy, which is under a strict lockdown, says employees including builders can continue to go to work if their jobs cannot be done at home. But Boston in the US announced construction activity should be suspended on Monday. And Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said building sites ""should close for the period of the efforts to combat this virus"".

"The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are isolating at Birkhall, their residence on the Balmoral estate The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has announced. Prince Charles, 71, is displaying mild symptoms ""but otherwise remains in good health"", a spokesman said, adding that the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, has been tested but does not have the virus. Charles and Camilla are now self-isolating at Balmoral. Buckingham Palace said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, but was ""in good health"". The palace added that the Duke of Edinburgh was not present at that meeting, and that the Queen was now ""following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare"". A Clarence House statement read: ""In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland. ""The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing. ""It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks."" Buckingham Palace releases a photograph of the Queen speaking to the prime minister from Windsor Castle The duke and duchess arrived in Scotland on Sunday. Charles had been displaying mild symptoms over the weekend and was tested by the NHS in Aberdeenshire on Monday. The results came through on Tuesday night, showing he was positive. Charles is still working, is up and about and in good spirits. The 71-year-old heir to the throne last saw the Queen briefly on the 12 March. Three days earlier, mother and son had more protracted contact during the Commonwealth Day Service. It is important to re-emphasise the Queen is in good health. She moved to Windsor last week, with the Duke of Edinburgh who came from his usual residence at Sandringham in Norfolk. Given their ages, 93 and 98 respectively, there will be particular care taken that they are not jeopardised by this virus. Prince Charles and Camilla will be following governmental advice and isolating separately.  It's not a huge house but certainly big enough to isolate yourself within it. They've got a small staff with them - and it's expected Charles will now be in Scotland for a couple of weeks recovering from the symptoms. The prince's last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw the Queen - when he attended a dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort. However, Charles has also been working from home over the last few days, and has held a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy of Cornwall individuals, all of whom have been made aware. A number of household staff at Birkhall - the prince's residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes. A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"A test to see whether someone has already had coronavirus is being developed but will not be available within days, the UK government's chief medical adviser says. ""I do not think - and I want to be clear - that this is something we'll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week,"" Prof Chris Whitty said. The antibody test would let doctors and nurses with immunity to return to work. MPs heard 3.5 million had already been bought and were being tested. Public Health England's Prof Sharon Peacock told MPs if they proved effective, ""people will be able to order a test or go to Boots to have their finger-prick test done"" in the ""near future"". But Prof Whitty said: ""The one thing that is worse than no test is a bad test."" Experts needed to ensure ""the right people get the test first in order to allow workers to go back"". But the priority remained scaling up tests which reveal if someone currently has the illness. These are available only to hospital patients at the moment, but there are plans to extend them to NHS workers. During the prime minister's daily press conference, Prof Whitty said if everyone kept to social distancing rules, the outbreak was ""probably manageable"" although he conceded it would be a ""close-run thing"" for the NHS. ""At this point in time, as of today, there is not enormous pressure on critical care compared to a bad or even normal winter's day,"" he said. But this pressure is expected to increase over the next two weeks. This message was echoed by infectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson, who was questioned by the Science and Technology Committee of MPs on Wednesday. He said keeping people inside and increasing NHS staff and beds was likely to prevent intensive care units (ICUs) being overwhelmed nationally. Prof Ferguson told MPs he believed the government's current strategy would mean ""in some areas of the country, ICUs will get very close to capacity but it won't be breached at a national level"". ""There will be areas of the country which are extremely stressed but we are reasonably confident - which is all we can be at the current time - that, at the national level, we will be in capacity,"" he said. A key government adviser on the country's response to the crisis, Prof Ferguson was responsible for theImperial College modellingthat changed the government's approach and led to stricter social-distancing measures being introduced. These measures are aimed at completely suppressing the spread of the virus and preventing the health service being overwhelmed. The combination of keeping people in their homes and making more NHS resources available is predicted to bring demand down to a level hospitals can manage. There would be some resurgence of cases later, Prof Ferguson said, but these local outbreaks could hopefully be kept at a low level through more intensive testing. He told the committee that the latest research suggested as many as half to two-thirds of deaths from coronavirus might have happened this year anyway, because most fatalities were among people at the end of their lives or with other health conditions. The peak of demand for intensive care is expected to come in two to three weeks. The challenge the UK, and other countries, would then face, Prof Ferguson said, was how to move from a complete lockdown to a situation where some semblance of normal life could be allowed to restart, while still keeping coronavirus cases low. Part of this would be about significantly increasing the numbers of people being tested, until a vaccine could be found. But, Prof Ferguson added, theUK did not currently have the capacity to teston the level of countries such as South Korea. There are plans to expand testing capability significantly, however, first for the sickest people, then for NHS workers and eventually to find out if people in the general population have already had the virus.

"BBC News has suspended plans to cut 450 jobs as it faces the demands of covering the coronavirus pandemic. The job losses were announced in January and were part of a plan to complete a Â£80m savings target by 2022. Outlets due to be hit include BBC Two's Newsnight, BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service's World Update programme. Director general Tony Hall gave staff the news on Wednesday, a week after the broadcaster delayed the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s. BBC delays over-75 TV licence fee changes BBC News announces 450 job cuts BBC and ITV revamp plans as coronavirus spreads Lord Hall said ""we're suspending the consultation on those saving plans"". He told staff: ""We've got to get on with doing the job that you're doing really brilliantly. ""It would be inappropriate. We haven't got the resource to plough ahead with those plans at the moment, so we'll come back to that at some point. ""But for the moment we just want to make sure you are supported and you've got the resources to do the job that you and your colleagues are doing amazingly."" Some programmes, such as Politics Live and Victoria Derbyshire, have been taken off air to prioritise coronavirus coverage, and several radio networks are sharing news bulletins. A planned modernisation of BBC News was due to contribute Â£40m of savings toward an overall target of Â£80m. The DG said it would be inappropriate to pursue this target while BBC News was so stretched in covering the pandemic. While these savings will probably be implemented under Lord Hall's successor (he leaves at the end of the summer), the BBC is racking up a huge bill because of coronavirus. It has already said it will delay changes to free TV licences for the over-75s by two months (at least) - and absorb that cost, which is coincidentally around Â£80m (at least). The next director general is going to inherit an even bigger financial black hole that she or he imagined. However, negotiations with a government that had threatened to ""whack"" the BBC may be made marginally easier if the BBC - like other public service broadcasters - can prove its worth through this crisis. Also on Wednesday, BBC Radio 1 announced changes to its schedule to ensure fewer presenters come in and out of the studios each day during the coronavirus crisis. From Monday, four shows will be broadcast between 04:00 and 19:00 instead of five, with DJs like Adele Roberts, Greg James, Scott Mills and Nick Grimshaw having their slots extended. Greg James (left) and Nick Grimshaw will be on air for longer ""In these testing times I've made the decision to simplify our schedule to ensure the health of our teams, presenters and the network itself,"" Radio 1's head of programmes Aled Haydn Jones said. ""I'm very proud of how the Radio 1 teams have been able to continue to entertain and inform our audience under such difficult conditions, and we'll be doing our best to carry on throughout the challenging weeks ahead.""

"A test to see whether someone has already had coronavirus is being developed but will not be available within days, the UK government's chief medical adviser says. ""I do not think - and I want to be clear - that this is something we'll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week,"" Prof Chris Whitty said. The antibody test would let doctors and nurses with immunity to return to work. MPs heard 3.5 million had already been bought and were being tested. Public Health England's Prof Sharon Peacock told MPs if they proved effective, ""people will be able to order a test or go to Boots to have their finger-prick test done"" in the ""near future"". But Prof Whitty said: ""The one thing that is worse than no test is a bad test."" Experts needed to ensure ""the right people get the test first in order to allow workers to go back"". But the priority remained scaling up tests which reveal if someone currently has the illness. These are available only to hospital patients at the moment, but there are plans to extend them to NHS workers. During the prime minister's daily press conference, Prof Whitty said if everyone kept to social distancing rules, the outbreak was ""probably manageable"" although he conceded it would be a ""close-run thing"" for the NHS. ""At this point in time, as of today, there is not enormous pressure on critical care compared to a bad or even normal winter's day,"" he said. But this pressure is expected to increase over the next two weeks. This message was echoed by infectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson, who was questioned by the Science and Technology Committee of MPs on Wednesday. He said keeping people inside and increasing NHS staff and beds was likely to prevent intensive care units (ICUs) being overwhelmed nationally. Prof Ferguson told MPs he believed the government's current strategy would mean ""in some areas of the country, ICUs will get very close to capacity but it won't be breached at a national level"". ""There will be areas of the country which are extremely stressed but we are reasonably confident - which is all we can be at the current time - that, at the national level, we will be in capacity,"" he said. A key government adviser on the country's response to the crisis, Prof Ferguson was responsible for theImperial College modellingthat changed the government's approach and led to stricter social-distancing measures being introduced. These measures are aimed at completely suppressing the spread of the virus and preventing the health service being overwhelmed. The combination of keeping people in their homes and making more NHS resources available is predicted to bring demand down to a level hospitals can manage. There would be some resurgence of cases later, Prof Ferguson said, but these local outbreaks could hopefully be kept at a low level through more intensive testing. He told the committee that the latest research suggested as many as half to two-thirds of deaths from coronavirus might have happened this year anyway, because most fatalities were among people at the end of their lives or with other health conditions. The peak of demand for intensive care is expected to come in two to three weeks. The challenge the UK, and other countries, would then face, Prof Ferguson said, was how to move from a complete lockdown to a situation where some semblance of normal life could be allowed to restart, while still keeping coronavirus cases low. Part of this would be about significantly increasing the numbers of people being tested, until a vaccine could be found. But, Prof Ferguson added, theUK did not currently have the capacity to teston the level of countries such as South Korea. There are plans to expand testing capability significantly, however, first for the sickest people, then for NHS workers and eventually to find out if people in the general population have already had the virus.

"This video can not be played PM: Number of NHS volunteers in 24 hours equal to ""population of Coventry"" The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS in its fight against coronavirus has passed half a million, double the government's recruitment target. Speaking at his daily news conference, PM Boris Johnson said all 504,303 could now play an ""absolutely crucial"" role. The helpers are needed for delivering food and medicines, driving patients to appointments and phoning the isolated. The scheme is one of a number aimed at relieving pressure on the NHS. Mr Johnson said he a wanted to offer ""special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS"". He added: ""And to all of you, and all the former NHS staff who are coming back into the service, I say thank you on behalf of the entire country."" About 11,000 former medics have also agreed to return to the health service and more than 24,000 final year student nurses and medics will join them. Stephen Powis, NHS England medical director, said there had been ""outbreaks of altruism"" and he was ""bowled over"" by the medics returning to the front line and the response from volunteers. This comes as it was confirmedPrince Charles, the 71-year-old heir to the throne, tested positive for coronavirusafter displaying mild symptoms. He is now self-isolating at home in Scotland with the Duchess of Cornwall, who tested negative. A Clarence House spokesman said it was not possible to know who he had caught it from due to a ""high number of engagements"" in recent weeks. Buckingham Palace shared a picture of the Queen at Windsor Castle, holding her weekly meeting with the prime minister over the phone Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the death toll in England to 414. There have also been 22 deaths so far in Scotland, 22 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures. The government scheme to recruit 250,000 helpers - who must be over 18 and in good health - went live on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, they had exceeded their target, after many thousands signed up toGood Sam,external, the group coordinating the response. The help is being targeted at the 1.5 million people with underlying health conditions who have been asked to shield themselves from the virus by staying at home for 12 weeks.

On Tuesday, Mr Hancock saidthose who cannot do their jobs from home should go to work to ""keep the country running""and construction work could continue so long as people were 2m (6.5ft) apart. But critics said public health should be prioritised over the economy. Some builders and construction workers have said they feel ""angry and unprotected""going to work, while others are under pressure from employers to go in. Mr Johnson has so far resistedpressure from politicians, unions and workers themselvesto halt construction work. This video can not be played A construction worker filmed colleagues failing to distance themselves The confusion over who should and should not be travelling for work came after government guidance announced by Mr Johnson on Monday curtailed many freedoms on life in the UK. The prime minister said people should only leave their home to shop for basic goods, to fulfil medical or care needs, to exercise, and to travel to and from work - but only where ""absolutely necessary"". Since Tuesday evening, hundreds of British Transport Police have been deployed onto the rail network to tell travellers that only those making essential journeys for work should be using tubes and trains. The prime minister confirmed the government was considering asking black taxi drivers to take NHS workers to work so that they can avoid public transport. Public services are coming under increasing strain - London Ambulance Service said it was receiving 8,000 calls a day - up 3,000 on a ""very busy"" day before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, calls to the 111 service have increased by up to 400%. The Department for Work and Pensions processed almost half a million benefit claims over nine days. What is banned and what isn't?

Some 19 inmates have now tested positive for coronavirus in 10 different prisons.

"This video can not be played PM: Number of NHS volunteers in 24 hours equal to ""population of Coventry"" The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS in its fight against coronavirus has passed half a million, double the government's recruitment target. Speaking at his daily news conference, PM Boris Johnson said all 504,303 could now play an ""absolutely crucial"" role. The helpers are needed for delivering food and medicines, driving patients to appointments and phoning the isolated. The scheme is one of a number aimed at relieving pressure on the NHS. Mr Johnson said he a wanted to offer ""special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS"". He added: ""And to all of you, and all the former NHS staff who are coming back into the service, I say thank you on behalf of the entire country."" About 11,000 former medics have also agreed to return to the health service and more than 24,000 final year student nurses and medics will join them. Stephen Powis, NHS England medical director, said there had been ""outbreaks of altruism"" and he was ""bowled over"" by the medics returning to the front line and the response from volunteers. This comes as it was confirmedPrince Charles, the 71-year-old heir to the throne, tested positive for coronavirusafter displaying mild symptoms. He is now self-isolating at home in Scotland with the Duchess of Cornwall, who tested negative. A Clarence House spokesman said it was not possible to know who he had caught it from due to a ""high number of engagements"" in recent weeks. Buckingham Palace shared a picture of the Queen at Windsor Castle, holding her weekly meeting with the prime minister over the phone Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the death toll in England to 414. There have also been 22 deaths so far in Scotland, 22 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures. The government scheme to recruit 250,000 helpers - who must be over 18 and in good health - went live on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, they had exceeded their target, after many thousands signed up toGood Sam,external, the group coordinating the response. The help is being targeted at the 1.5 million people with underlying health conditions who have been asked to shield themselves from the virus by staying at home for 12 weeks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick tweeted a photo of what he said was the first box of food and supplies ready to be sent out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There are nowcalls to replicate the volunteering scheme- which is currently only for those in England - in Wales. Meanwhile,Parliament has shut down until 21 April at the earliest, after sweeping emergency powers to tackle the coronavirus crisis were passed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the emergency legislation will allow ""extraordinary measures"" never seen in peacetime in the UK. What is in emergency coronavirus legislation? Claudia is an actress and her industry has shut down Technology expertAlex Hamilton, from Northampton, was among the first to sign up. ""I'm working from home but it's quiet. I'm doing a lot of gardening and this is an opportunity to do something to help - I've volunteered to do anything necessary."" His wife has a low immune system after having breast cancer twice and says she has concerns ""about what I could be bringing back"". ""But I want to do good,"" he said. University tutorRobert Howarth, 23, from Blackburn, has also signed up. ""I just want to help,"" he says. He is currently working remotely and part-time, which he says gives him the chance to do more. ""I've signed up for two roles out of the four on offer - to be a befriender helping people in self-isolation and delivering vital products."" ActressClaudia Grantis another to have signed up. With much of her industry having shutdown, she says she has time to help.

On Tuesday, it was also announced thatthe NHS will treat coronavirus patients in a makeshift field hospitalin the ExCeL Centre in east London. There has been widespread concern and anger at the shortages of personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Healthcare Supply Association has been forced to use Twitter to ask DIY shops to donate equipment to NHS staff.

STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The government is also facing growing pressure to stop non-essential construction work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus in the UK. On Tuesday, Mr Hancock saidthose who cannot do their jobs from home should go to work to ""keep the country running""and construction work could continue so long as people were 2m (6.5ft) apart. But critics said public health should be prioritised over the economy. Some builders and construction workers have said they feel ""angry and unprotected""going to work, while others are under pressure from employers to go in. Mr Johnson has so far resistedpressure from politicians, unions and workers themselvesto halt construction work. This video can not be played A construction worker filmed colleagues failing to distance themselves The confusion over who should and should not be travelling for work came after government guidance announced by Mr Johnson on Monday curtailed many freedoms on life in the UK. The prime minister said people should only leave their home to shop for basic goods, to fulfil medical or care needs, to exercise, and to travel to and from work - but only where ""absolutely necessary"". Since Tuesday evening, hundreds of British Transport Police have been deployed onto the rail network to tell travellers that only those making essential journeys for work should be using tubes and trains. The prime minister confirmed the government was considering asking black taxi drivers to take NHS workers to work so that they can avoid public transport. Public services are coming under increasing strain - London Ambulance Service said it was receiving 8,000 calls a day - up 3,000 on a ""very busy"" day before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, calls to the 111 service have increased by up to 400%. The Department for Work and Pensions processed almost half a million benefit claims over nine days. What is banned and what isn't? Doctor 'kicked out by landlady' amid virus fears Meanwhile,the government is considering the early releaseof some prisoners in England and Wales to relieve pressure. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the virus posed an ""acute"" risk in prisons, many of which were overcrowded and faced staff shortages as officers self-isolated. Some 19 inmates have now tested positive for coronavirus in 10 different prisons. Elsewhere, the government remains under pressure to provide financial support for self-employed workers who face a loss of income if forced to stop working due to sickness or quarantine. Mr Johnson said a package of support for those workers would be announced on Thursday.

"BBC News has suspended plans to cut 450 jobs as it faces the demands of covering the coronavirus pandemic. The job losses were announced in January and were part of a plan to complete a Â£80m savings target by 2022. Outlets due to be hit include BBC Two's Newsnight, BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Service's World Update programme. Director general Tony Hall gave staff the news on Wednesday, a week after the broadcaster delayed the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s. BBC delays over-75 TV licence fee changes BBC News announces 450 job cuts BBC and ITV revamp plans as coronavirus spreads Lord Hall said ""we're suspending the consultation on those saving plans"". He told staff: ""We've got to get on with doing the job that you're doing really brilliantly. ""It would be inappropriate. We haven't got the resource to plough ahead with those plans at the moment, so we'll come back to that at some point. ""But for the moment we just want to make sure you are supported and you've got the resources to do the job that you and your colleagues are doing amazingly."" Some programmes, such as Politics Live and Victoria Derbyshire, have been taken off air to prioritise coronavirus coverage, and several radio networks are sharing news bulletins. A planned modernisation of BBC News was due to contribute Â£40m of savings toward an overall target of Â£80m. The DG said it would be inappropriate to pursue this target while BBC News was so stretched in covering the pandemic. While these savings will probably be implemented under Lord Hall's successor (he leaves at the end of the summer), the BBC is racking up a huge bill because of coronavirus. It has already said it will delay changes to free TV licences for the over-75s by two months (at least) - and absorb that cost, which is coincidentally around Â£80m (at least). The next director general is going to inherit an even bigger financial black hole that she or he imagined. However, negotiations with a government that had threatened to ""whack"" the BBC may be made marginally easier if the BBC - like other public service broadcasters - can prove its worth through this crisis. Also on Wednesday, BBC Radio 1 announced changes to its schedule to ensure fewer presenters come in and out of the studios each day during the coronavirus crisis. From Monday, four shows will be broadcast between 04:00 and 19:00 instead of five, with DJs like Adele Roberts, Greg James, Scott Mills and Nick Grimshaw having their slots extended. Greg James (left) and Nick Grimshaw will be on air for longer ""In these testing times I've made the decision to simplify our schedule to ensure the health of our teams, presenters and the network itself,"" Radio 1's head of programmes Aled Haydn Jones said. ""I'm very proud of how the Radio 1 teams have been able to continue to entertain and inform our audience under such difficult conditions, and we'll be doing our best to carry on throughout the challenging weeks ahead.""

It also said it had the ""legal flexibility to remain open across the entire business"". Mr Stapleton said his chain had a part to play ""in providing vital support to emergency workers, fleet operations and the general population as they travel for essential supplies"". Halfords pointed out it was offering all NHS frontline workers a free 10-point car check during the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as the government announced it would grant drivers a six-month emergency MOT extension under new regulation due to come into force on 30 March to ensure ""frontline workers to get to work"". Other bicycle firms such as Brompton Bicycle, a folding bike specialist, have lent bicycles to staff at hospitals in London to help them get to and from work. And some people on social media supported Halfords' decision to stay open during the pandemic. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

High Street retailer Next has confirmed it's offering some staff a 20 per cent pay rise if they volunteer to go into stores to help pick online orders, despite government warnings to stay at home. While all of its stores are closed to the public, the retailer says there are some items in its shops which have already been ordered and promised to online customers. The retailer said a ""very small group of volunteers"" will pick the orders under ""strict supervision and social distancing rules"". After strict new restrictions were brought in by government earlier this week, it issued a list of âessential retailersâ, such as Halfords, that are allowed to stay open. They include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Off-licences and licensed shops selling alcohol, including those within breweries Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Launderettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post offices Banks Trade industry bodies had previously said that bicycle retailers and repair shops had seen a spike in demand as people ""clean the cobwebs off"" their old bikes in an attempt to avoid public transport during the pandemic. Jonathan Harrison of the Association of Cycle Traders told the BBC that ""there had been an uplift in sales across the board, with larger retailers also reporting more 'entry-level' bikes going."" However, he pointed out that with more consumers staying in due to the new government restrictions, ""it's difficult to know whether or not that trend will continue.""

"The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are isolating at Birkhall, their residence on the Balmoral estate The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has announced. Prince Charles, 71, is displaying mild symptoms ""but otherwise remains in good health"", a spokesman said, adding that the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, has been tested but does not have the virus. Charles and Camilla are now self-isolating at Balmoral. Buckingham Palace said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, but was ""in good health"". The palace added that the Duke of Edinburgh was not present at that meeting, and that the Queen was now ""following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare"". A Clarence House statement read: ""In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland. ""The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing. ""It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks."" Buckingham Palace releases a photograph of the Queen speaking to the prime minister from Windsor Castle The duke and duchess arrived in Scotland on Sunday. Charles had been displaying mild symptoms over the weekend and was tested by the NHS in Aberdeenshire on Monday. The results came through on Tuesday night, showing he was positive. Charles is still working, is up and about and in good spirits. The 71-year-old heir to the throne last saw the Queen briefly on the 12 March. Three days earlier, mother and son had more protracted contact during the Commonwealth Day Service. It is important to re-emphasise the Queen is in good health. She moved to Windsor last week, with the Duke of Edinburgh who came from his usual residence at Sandringham in Norfolk. Given their ages, 93 and 98 respectively, there will be particular care taken that they are not jeopardised by this virus. Prince Charles and Camilla will be following governmental advice and isolating separately.  It's not a huge house but certainly big enough to isolate yourself within it. They've got a small staff with them - and it's expected Charles will now be in Scotland for a couple of weeks recovering from the symptoms. The prince's last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw the Queen - when he attended a dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort. However, Charles has also been working from home over the last few days, and has held a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy of Cornwall individuals, all of whom have been made aware. A number of household staff at Birkhall - the prince's residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes. A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Motorists worried about getting an MOT because of the coronavirus crisis, have been handed a six-month reprieve. The government has granted car owners a six-month exemption from MOT testing. However, it won't come in until Monday 30 March which means vehicles due an MOT before then must still take it. The exemption ""will enable vital services such as deliveries to continue, frontline workers to get to work, and people get essential food and medicine,"" the government said. The exemption will apply to cars, motorcycles and vans, but the government warned that vehicles must be kept in a roadworthy condition. Garages will remain open for essential repair work while drivers will face prosecution if they're caught driving unsafe vehicles. ""We must ensure those on the frontline of helping the nation combat COVID19 are able to do so,"" said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. ""Safety is key, which is why garages will remain open for essential repair work."" The Department for Transport said the move won't hit any insurance claims during the period because they will be effectively extending MOT certificates meaning they will remain valid for insurance purposes. The new law will be introduced on 30 March when it will come into immediate effect for 12 months. What are the new restrictions and why are they needed? How long can I exercise for? and other questions answered What's the risk of taking buses or trains? It is not being introduced immediately because the government said it must ensure regulations are legally sound before coming into force. That means there will be a short consultation with key organisations before next Monday. However, drivers will still need to get their vehicle tested until the new regulations come into place if they need to travel. However, if someone is unable to get an MOT that is due because they are self isolating, the Department for Transport said it is working with insurers and the police to ensure people are not unfairly penalised for things out of their control. Practical driving tests and annual testing for lorries, buses and coaches have already been suspended for up to three months. The RAC said the move was a positive one, although drivers must remain responsible. ""We are in exceptional times and that calls for exceptional measures like this,"" an RAC spokesperson said.

At MOT centres across the country, extra precautions have already been put in place to protect customers and workers. At National Tyres and Autocare, for instance, staff routinely wear protective barrier gloves, fit seat covers and use floor mats before working on customers' vehicles. Meanwhile, technicians work on ramps that are suitably spaced apart and customers do not need to interact with staff in the workshop's space. ""Our customers have been asking if they still need to MOT their vehicles and, of course, it's vital that everything is maintained and kept roadworthy, so today's announcement that MOTs will be exempt for the next six months is welcome news for everybody,"" said Michael Bourne, marketing director at the firm. ""We all recognise our role to stop the spread of germs, while keeping key workers on the road and able to do their jobs,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ""People in your profession write fake news - you do"", President Trump tells journalist The US Senate has passed a $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill that is the largest economic stimulus in US history. The vote was delayed by a last-minute row between Republican and Democratic senators over unemployment benefits. The plan includes direct payments of $1,200 to most American adults and aid to help small businesses pay workers. US coronavirus deaths are around the 1,000 mark and there have been nearly 70,000 confirmed infections. More than 21,000 people with coronavirus have died across the world since it emerged in China's Hubei province in December, while the number of infections is racing towards half a million. Southern Europe is now the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. One case lays bare America's testing failure A visual guide to the pandemic Coronavirus slowdown in US seen from space President Donald Trump, a Republican, said on Wednesday he would sign the fast-tracked bill as soon as it reached his desk. But the plan hit a speed bump as Republican senators Tim Scott, Rick Scott, Ben Sasse and Lindsey Graham said its major expansion of unemployment benefits provided ""a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work"". They said they would oppose the bill unless it was fixed to ensure workers could not have a higher income while unemployed than in a job. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he would oppose the bill unless the Republicans dropped their objections. He also demanded tougher conditions on the legislation's ""corporate welfare"". This video can not be played 'My income vanished overnight with no safety net' In the end the Republican senators were allowed a vote on their amendment, which failed. The bill does have cross-party support but it must still be passed in votes in the Senate and House of Representatives before the president signs it into law. With revisions being made to the bill late into Wednesday, the Republican-majority Senate finally, and unanimously, approved it with a 96-0 vote. It now moves on to the House which is expected to vote on Friday. The face of America's fight against Covid-19 Trump says US tested more than S Korea - is he right? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was ""proud"" that not a single senator voted against the bill. The chamber's senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, said: ""And so this is a good ending, twists and turns were enormous. I always had faith we would [pass this bill] because America and the American people demanded it."" The agreement reached by Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages. The nearly 900-page bill has a price tag that amounts to roughly half the size of the US government's annual budget, and includes: Direct payments of $1,200 to millions of individuals who earn $75,000 or less, and an additional $500 per each child An expansion of unemployment aid including payments, for the first time, to people who are self-employed or work in the gig economy A $500bn fund to help companies, which includes loans to hard-hit sectors such as the airline industry $350bn in loans for small businesses $100bn for hospitals and related health systems on the frontlines of the pandemic Mr McConnell described the package as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the US nation. The Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said she hoped the bill could be passed by voice vote. That would allow members of Congress - several of whom have coronavirus or are self-isolating - to stay away from the chamber in order to cast their votes. But if any member objected, lawmakers would be asked to return to Washington and vote over the course of an entire day, in order to limit how many people are present on the House floor at one time. LIVE UPDATES:Virus surges in US A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday it was likely half of America's most populous city of more than eight million would catch coronavirus by the time the pandemic ran its course. The city's death toll reached 280, officials said on Wednesday night, with 20,011 confirmed cases. On Tuesday,13 patients died in a matter of hours at a hospital,externalin the Queens borough of the city, with a young doctor there describing ""apocalyptic"" scenes, according to the New York Times. But there were signs of hope. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke of tentative indications that the spread of the disease may be slowing. On Sunday, hospital admissions were doubling every two days. But by Monday that rate had fallen to every 3.4 days, and on Tuesday every 4.7 days, Mr Cuomo said. The whole of New York state has had 285 coronavirus deaths and more than 33,000 patients - about half the total US caseload.  The US Federal Emergency Management Agency said New York, North Carolina and Hawaii had requested special mortuary teams to be ready for mass casualties. New Orleans, in Louisiana, where crowds celebrated Mardi Gras last month, has recorded the world's highest growth rate in coronavirus cases. California's Governor Gavin Newsom said one million Californians had registered as unemployed just this month. This video can not be played Celebrating a birthday party by video chat The US is more than midway through a 15-day attempt to slow the spread of the virus through social distancing. Two more states - Minnesota and Idaho - issued state-wide ""stay at home"" orders on Wednesday, joining at least 17 others. The president said on Tuesday that reopening the country by Easter would be a ""beautiful timeline"".

"Kirsten and Richard Groom's wedding was watched by more than 100 people on Facebook A couple whose dream wedding was thrown into doubt by coronavirus restrictions held the service a month early and streamed it to 100 guests on Facebook. Kirsten and Richard Groom spent 18 months planning their April nuptials. But instead they married at St Matthew's Church, Walsall, on Saturday, sensing their original date was doomed. Mrs Groom said they ""took the opportunity while we could"". The governmenthas since ordered services to be cancelled. ""Richard had seen the situation in the UK was heating up and had floated the idea of bringing the wedding forward,"" said Mrs Groom, who is the church's administrator. ""When the prime minister started restrictions [last week], another person said 'why not get married now?' but we had put a year and a half into planning our perfect wedding. ""We knew there was no way we would be able to get married in April, so we took the opportunity while we could."" The couple had just four days to arrange their wedding after deciding to bring it forward During overhauled preparations, Mrs Groom was living in a shared house with 12 other people, and they all pitched in to help pull together the wedding in four days. The outfit she planned to wear in April was not ready in time so the housemates sourced another, as well as arranging photographs and flowers. The housemates were the couple's only attending guests, with others watching the service through the Facebook live stream. Coronavirus in West Midlands: Latest updates ""The people we have talked to so far have said they felt part of it, even from a distance, and we are really happy we were able to have that option available to them,"" Mrs Groom said. Rev Jim Trood, who led the service, said: ""To be honest, I found it quite emotional when they were making the promises in sickness and in health - it was a powerful thing to be saying.""

"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (Â£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%. Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal. Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday saidhe wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis. William Foster, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it would ""help mitigate the depth and duration of the economic shock"". ""Nonetheless, we expect the virus to have a significant negative impact on growth and the fiscal deficit this year,"" he said. Governments around the world have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by locking down societies in the hope of slowing the spread of the virus. The International Monetary Fund has warned the hit to global growth is likely to be bigger than the financial crisis. Many countries are now working on stimulus packages to support their economies, but these plans have received mixed responses from investors, as markets experience unprecedented volatility as they grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This month alone has seen the Dow having the five biggest daily gains and five biggest falls of its 135-year history. Reacting to news of the stimulus package, Tom Stevenson, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: ""It's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet. ""When markets are falling, you get these big rallies but you shouldn't get stuck on that. They do bounce around in these situations."" THE LATEST:Live updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The US rescue package follows five days of intense negotiations to try to agree a deal that will provide aid for American workers and businesses. Before it becomes law the deal must get through the Republican-controlled Senate, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve has already announced $4tn in extra lending to help stimulate the economy in the face of the coronavirus. US stocks surged in anticipation of the massive economic stimulus deal Nearly 19,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide since it emerged in China's Wuhan province in January, and more than 420,000 infections have been confirmed. Southern Europe is now at the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy. The US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history. Like the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. But there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon. Some economists say US firms may need five times as much cash to prevent mass bankruptcy and unemployment.

"The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are isolating at Birkhall, their residence on the Balmoral estate The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has announced. Prince Charles, 71, is displaying mild symptoms ""but otherwise remains in good health"", a spokesman said, adding that the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, has been tested but does not have the virus. Charles and Camilla are now self-isolating at Balmoral. Buckingham Palace said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, but was ""in good health"". The palace added that the Duke of Edinburgh was not present at that meeting, and that the Queen was now ""following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare"". A Clarence House statement read: ""In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland. ""The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing. ""It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks."" Buckingham Palace releases a photograph of the Queen speaking to the prime minister from Windsor Castle The duke and duchess arrived in Scotland on Sunday. Charles had been displaying mild symptoms over the weekend and was tested by the NHS in Aberdeenshire on Monday. The results came through on Tuesday night, showing he was positive. Charles is still working, is up and about and in good spirits. The 71-year-old heir to the throne last saw the Queen briefly on the 12 March. Three days earlier, mother and son had more protracted contact during the Commonwealth Day Service. It is important to re-emphasise the Queen is in good health. She moved to Windsor last week, with the Duke of Edinburgh who came from his usual residence at Sandringham in Norfolk. Given their ages, 93 and 98 respectively, there will be particular care taken that they are not jeopardised by this virus. Prince Charles and Camilla will be following governmental advice and isolating separately.  It's not a huge house but certainly big enough to isolate yourself within it. They've got a small staff with them - and it's expected Charles will now be in Scotland for a couple of weeks recovering from the symptoms. The prince's last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw the Queen - when he attended a dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort. However, Charles has also been working from home over the last few days, and has held a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy of Cornwall individuals, all of whom have been made aware. A number of household staff at Birkhall - the prince's residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes. A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"This video can not be played Trump on goal to reopen US by Easter: It's 'a beautiful timeline' US President Donald Trump has said he hopes the US will shake off coronavirus by Easter, even as New York's governor sounded the alarm that the illness is spreading faster than ""a bullet train"". The president told a White House news briefing reopening the US early next month would be ""a beautiful timeline"". Hours later, the Senate agreed a $2 trillion (Â£1.7tn) economic rescue plan with the White House. The deal will be passed later on Wednesday by the Senate. ""At last, we have a deal,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, citing the massive ""wartime level of investment into our nation"". The package includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages for businesses. The House of Representatives still needs to pass the legislation before it is sent to Mr Trump for his signature. The US has recorded almost 55,000 cases and nearly 800 deaths from coronavirus. Globally there have been more than 420,000 cases confirmed and approaching 19,000 deaths. On Tuesday, he told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is on the weekend of 12 April. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: ""We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter."" He added in a subsequent interview: ""Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country."" America is humbled - but there is a glimmer of hope Can I go for a walk? How to avoid 'quarantine-shaming' Mr Trump also warned that unless the country reopened for business it could suffer ""a massive recession or depression"". The president said: ""You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen. You're going to have instability."" This video can not be played Celebrating a birthday party by video chat Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said he was beginning ""to see the light at the end of the tunnel"", though he said ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data"". Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told the same press briefing: ""No-one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City."" With more than 25,000 coronavirus cases by Tuesday morning, the Empire state accounted for half of all US infections. Dr Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said on Tuesday the New York City metro area is the source of 60% of all new cases in the US. This video can not be played The New York Governor Andrew Cuomo: The city 'is a test case' She advised anyone leaving the region to self-quarantine for two weeks. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told another news conference on Tuesday: ""The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' ""'We're now looking at a bullet train.'"" He added: ""New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time."" The governor said New York's hospital system will soon reach breaking point unless the US Federal Emergency Management Agency urgently sends more healthcare supplies. ""You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,"" Mr Cuomo said. New York currently has 7,000 medical ventilators - machines used to keep patients breathing - but needs 30,000, the governor said. On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. ""A great American resurrection,"" the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases. Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say. If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe.

"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (Â£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%. Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal. Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday saidhe wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis.

"Construction workers are among those calling for action to protect them People can go to work if they cannot do their work at home, the health secretary has said, amid confusion over the new coronavirus restrictions. It comes after calls for clarity, including from construction workers, about Monday's wider shutdown measures. Matt Hancock also said Tube services should be running ""in full"", after being asked aboutpacked trains during Tuesday's morning commute. The number of UK deaths rose to 422 on Tuesday, a rise of 87 in one day. As it continues to ramp up its response to the number of people testing positive for the disease, the governmentis opening a new makeshift hospitalat the ExCel exhibition centre in London. The temporary Nightingale Hospital has been set up with help from the military and will have capacity for 4,000 patients. Mr Hancock also appealed for 250,000 volunteers to help the NHS, and said more than 11,000 former medics had answered the government's call to return to the NHS. More than 24,000 final-year student nurses and medics will also join the health service. Mr Hancock led Tuesday's daily Downing Street briefing - which saw reporters asking questions over video-link - after complaints that part of the government's strict new rules were confusing for workers. Thenew measures, in place for at least three weeks, tell Britons to only leave home to go to work ""where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home"".

Unions and workers in the construction industryhave called for protection, saying their work is not essential and puts people's health at risk. And Piers Morgan highlighted the issue on ITV's Good Morning Britain when he showed images of construction workers working at London's Heathrow Airport and said: ""Ask yourself a moral question: what are you doing? Do the right thing. Do you have to be out there? Can this work wait? You need to get your priorities right."" He then interviewed London's mayor Sadiq Khan who said that, in his view, construction workers should not be going to work and that he had made that point ""quite forcefully"" to Boris Johnson. Asked about the issue at the briefing, Mr Hancock said people whose jobs has not already been shut down by the government measures to date should continue to work but should only be travelling to a workplace ""where that work can't be done at home"". He said construction workers - many of whom work outdoors - could and should continue to go to work as long as they are able to remain two metres apart at all times. LIVE:India lockdown begins A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The cabinet minister said: ""The judgment we have made is that in work, in many instances, the 2m rule can be applied. ""Where possible, people should work from home and employers have a duty to ensure that people are more than 2m apart. Unlike the UK government, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid building sites should close- unless it involves an essential building such as a hospital. She said it was not possible to provide a ""bespoke guidance"" for each occupation  - but she gave clarity with some examples and general principles. Mr Davis, who has his own company, said he is in a better position than many in the construction industry. Construction workers are still being told to come to work, according to Andrew Lee Davis, 36, a civil engineer based in Newport, south Wales. ""We can't just go home because we won't be paid,"" he told the BBC. Self-employed workers may have to rely on the benefits system as things stand. However, benefits may not come through on time, or be enough to pay the bills, Mr Davis said. ""Morally, I know I should stay at home, but I'm absolutely tied here. Until the government pay the self-employed, I've got to come into work."" If he were to stay home, Mr Davis, who helps support his wife and three children, would have to rely on his savings. Those would not last for the duration of the crisis, he said. ""There's a lot of worried boys here on site,"" he said. Many of them are on minimum wage, self-employed and without savings, which puts them in a more precarious financial position. Some big contractors are telling subcontractors to continue working, which Mr Davis says could put extra strain on the NHS in a time of crisis. He would like major contractors to shut non-essential sites, even though this could cost him valuable work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for ""clear and unambiguous advice around which workers can and can't go out"". He said he believed just key workers - those whose jobs are considered essential andincluded on a government list,external- should go to work. Mr Hancock also said Transport for London ""should have the tube running in full so that people travelling on the tube are spaced out and can be further apart"". ""And there is no good reason in the information that I've seen that the current levels of tube provision should be as low as they are,"" he said.

According to the latest Department of Health figures,,externalthere are now more than 8,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK. The latest people to have diedinclude Ruth Burke, 82, in County Antrim. Her family said it was heartbreaking not being able to kiss her goodbye because of how contagious the disease is, adding they did not want her simply to be remembered as a statistic. Brenda Doherty said her mother Ruth was a strong woman Earlier, Mr Hancock told MPs the government was ""ramping up testing as fast as we can"" and it was buying ""millions of tests"" which it would ""make available as quickly as possible"". He also said the government was working to ensure victims of domestic violence who are forced to stay at home would get support. Police chiefs said phone lines were inundated with calls after the prime minister's statement, as people rang to ask what they were still allowed to do. The British Transport Police said it was deploying 500 officers to patrol stations across the country and remind people to follow government advice. The PM's official spokesman said the overwhelming majority of people ""can be expected to follow the rules without any need for enforcement action"". But the punishment in England for not complying would be a fixed penalty notice initially set at Â£30 for people breaking the rule of no public gatherings of three people or more. ""We will keep this under review and can increase it significantly if it is necessary to ensure public compliance,"" the spokesman added. Meanwhile, Police Scotlandwill not hesitate to enforce the new measures,the force's chief constable said. Children can visit separated parents during restrictions Four things stats say about coronavirus in London Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said enforcing the new restrictions would be ""a real, real challenge"", as there was already ""large amounts of sickness"" among officers across London. Meanwhile, opposition parties and unions have called on the government to do more to protect self-employed people, who will not be covered by the government's promise to pay 80% of salaries of employees unable to work.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Sunak said work is going on in Whitehall to come up with a ""deliverable and fair"" support package.

"This video can not be played PM: Number of NHS volunteers in 24 hours equal to ""population of Coventry"" The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS in its fight against coronavirus has passed half a million, double the government's recruitment target. Speaking at his daily news conference, PM Boris Johnson said all 504,303 could now play an ""absolutely crucial"" role. The helpers are needed for delivering food and medicines, driving patients to appointments and phoning the isolated. The scheme is one of a number aimed at relieving pressure on the NHS. Mr Johnson said he a wanted to offer ""special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS"". He added: ""And to all of you, and all the former NHS staff who are coming back into the service, I say thank you on behalf of the entire country."" About 11,000 former medics have also agreed to return to the health service and more than 24,000 final year student nurses and medics will join them. Stephen Powis, NHS England medical director, said there had been ""outbreaks of altruism"" and he was ""bowled over"" by the medics returning to the front line and the response from volunteers. This comes as it was confirmedPrince Charles, the 71-year-old heir to the throne, tested positive for coronavirusafter displaying mild symptoms. He is now self-isolating at home in Scotland with the Duchess of Cornwall, who tested negative. A Clarence House spokesman said it was not possible to know who he had caught it from due to a ""high number of engagements"" in recent weeks. Buckingham Palace shared a picture of the Queen at Windsor Castle, holding her weekly meeting with the prime minister over the phone Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the death toll in England to 414. There have also been 22 deaths so far in Scotland, 22 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures. The government scheme to recruit 250,000 helpers - who must be over 18 and in good health - went live on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, they had exceeded their target, after many thousands signed up toGood Sam,external, the group coordinating the response. The help is being targeted at the 1.5 million people with underlying health conditions who have been asked to shield themselves from the virus by staying at home for 12 weeks.

There has been widespread concern and anger at the shortages of personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Healthcare Supply Association has been forced to use Twitter to ask DIY shops to donate equipment to NHS staff.

STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The government is also facing growing pressure to stop non-essential construction work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus in the UK. On Tuesday, Mr Hancock saidthose who cannot do their jobs from home should go to work to ""keep the country running""and construction work could continue so long as people were 2m (6.5ft) apart. But critics said public health should be prioritised over the economy. Some builders and construction workers have said they feel ""angry and unprotected""going to work, while others are under pressure from employers to go in. Mr Johnson has so far resistedpressure from politicians, unions and workers themselvesto halt construction work. This video can not be played A construction worker filmed colleagues failing to distance themselves The confusion over who should and should not be travelling for work came after government guidance announced by Mr Johnson on Monday curtailed many freedoms on life in the UK. The prime minister said people should only leave their home to shop for basic goods, to fulfil medical or care needs, to exercise, and to travel to and from work - but only where ""absolutely necessary"". Since Tuesday evening, hundreds of British Transport Police have been deployed onto the rail network to tell travellers that only those making essential journeys for work should be using tubes and trains. The prime minister confirmed the government was considering asking black taxi drivers to take NHS workers to work so that they can avoid public transport. Public services are coming under increasing strain - London Ambulance Service said it was receiving 8,000 calls a day - up 3,000 on a ""very busy"" day before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, calls to the 111 service have increased by up to 400%. The Department for Work and Pensions processed almost half a million benefit claims over nine days. What is banned and what isn't?

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the virus posed an ""acute"" risk in prisons, many of which were overcrowded and faced staff shortages as officers self-isolated. Some 19 inmates have now tested positive for coronavirus in 10 different prisons. Elsewhere, the government remains under pressure to provide financial support for self-employed workers who face a loss of income if forced to stop working due to sickness or quarantine. Mr Johnson said a package of support for those workers would be announced on Thursday.

"This video can not be played People panicked after Narendra Modi said nobody should leave their homes, and did not mention the status of essential supplies India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has imposed a nationwide lockdown in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The restrictions came into force at midnight local time (18:30 GMT) and will be enforced for 21 days. ""There will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes,"" Mr Modi said in a televised address. He appealed for people not to panic - but crowds quickly mobbed stores in the capital, Delhi, and other cities. Correspondents say it is not clear how - or even if - people will now be allowed out to buy food and other essentials. Why do you lock down 1.3bn people? 'Hunger may kill us before coronavirus' The new measures follow a sharp increase in cases in recent days. There have been 519 confirmed cases across India and 10 reported deaths. India - which has a population of 1.3bn - joins a growing list of countries that have imposed similar measures. Nearly 400,000 people have tested positive for the virus worldwide, and around 17,000 have died. THE LATEST:Live updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

But in Delhi and the financial capital, Mumbai, people fearing shortages quickly thronged shops and pharmacies. ""I have never witnessed such a chaos in my life,"" the owner of one store in the Shakarpur district of Delhi said, quoted by the Press Trust of India. ""All our stocks, including rice, flour, bread, biscuits, edible oils, have been sold out."" Police in the busy city of Ghaziabad, in Uttar Pradesh state, patrolled the streets with megaphones to tell residents to stay indoors. People in Mumbai rushed to stock up on essentials following Mr Modi's address Under the new measures, all non-essential businesses will be closed but hospitals and other medical facilities will continue to function as normal. Schools and universities will remain shut and almost all public gatherings will be banned. Anyone flouting the new rules faces up to two years in prison and heavy fines. In his address, Prime Minister Modi also: Stressed that the 21-day lockdown was ""very necessary to break the chain of coronavirus"" Emphasised the seriousness of the situation and said that even developed countries had faced problems in combating it Said that ""social distancing was the only way to stop"" the virus spreading Announced that nearly $2bn (Â£1.8bn) would be made available to boost the country's health infrastructure Called on people not to ""spread rumours"" and to follow instructions His announcement came after several Indian states introduced measures of their own, such as travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential services. India has already issued a ban on international arrivals and grounded domestic flights. The country's rail network has also suspended most passenger services. Many parts of India, including cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, are already under tight restrictions. But this move extends those provisions to every corner of the country. An earlier one-day curfew, which was seen as a trial, was flouted by many. Mr Modi called on Indians to clap and cheer the emergency services from their balconies on Sunday. But many misunderstood the call and congregated in the streets as they danced and chanted. ""It's impossible to fathom the cost that India may have to pay if such irresponsible behaviour continues,"" Mr Modi warned at the time. ""Social distancing is the only option to combat coronavirus."" The implications of a total lockdown in India are huge, not just economically, but socially. This is a nation where community is everything. Going to worship at a temple, mosque or church is an essential part of daily life for so many. This is a seismic cultural shift but - like the rest of the world facing similar restrictions - a necessary one. Neighbouring Pakistan has almost twice as many confirmed cases - 878 as of Monday evening. Sweeping restrictions are in place although the government has stopped short of imposing a nationwide lockdown. However, several provinces have announced them independently. The army is being brought in to help enforce the restrictions Bangladesh, which has reported 33 cases and three deaths, is also deploying its armed forces to help maintain social distancing and boost Covid-19 preventive measures. The soldiers will also monitor thousands of quarantined expatriate returnees. Across South Asia, there are concerns that the actual number of cases could be much higher than is being reported. Indonesia, which has 49 confirmed Covid-19 deaths - the highest in South East Asia - has converted an athlete's village built for the 2018 Asian Games into a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients. A state of emergency was declared in Jakarta on Monday In Thailand, a month-long state of emergency which will include curfews and checkpoints will begin on Thursday. The government has been criticised for failing to take strong action so far. Four people have died and nearly 900 tested positive The most populous country that was without a case until now - Myanmar - has announced two cases Elsewhere, governments are continuing to work to stem the spread of the virus which has now affected more than 190 countries worldwide More than 2.6 billion people are in lockdown now India has introduced its new measures, according to a tally by the AFP news agency This video can not be played Reality Check tackles misleading health advice being shared online Europe remains at the epicentre of the pandemic.

"US markets gained again as Donald Trump and the Senate agreed a massive economic relief package worth more than $1.8 trillion (Â£1.5tn). The package includes money to bail out industries that have been affected by the coronavirus crisis. Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell described it as a ""wartime level of investment"" in the economy. The relief plans lifted financial markets around the world, but investors remained on edge. US markets, which surged on Tuesday in anticipation of the deal, teetered in the final moments of trade on Wednesday, closing below their peak for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.4% higher, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.1%. The Nasdaq dipped 0.45%. Shares in Boeing surged more than 23%, fuelled in part by expectations that it would benefit from the deal. Earlier, shares rose in Europe and Asia on news of the relief package. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 8% higher, while London's FTSE 100 index gained more than 4.4%. Full details of the deal agreed in the US will not be published until later on Wednesday. However, it is expected to contain measures to help people pay bills if they are laid off because of the virus, expand unemployment assistance by $250bn and get $350bn in emergency loans to small firms. Mr McConnell said it would also ""stabilise"" key industrial sectors and give money to hospitals and other healthcare providers which were having difficulty getting equipment. ""We're going to pass this legislation later today,"" Mr McConnell added. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called the package ""the largest rescue package in American history"". He said it was a ""Marshall Plan"" for hospitals. ""Help is on the way, big help and quick help."" Separately, President Trump on Tuesday saidhe wanted to get the economy up and running again by Easter. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones jumped by 11.4% on Tuesday - its biggest one-day gain since the Great Depression - as political leaders signalled a deal was close. The final package is estimated to amount to about 10% of US output, more than double the relief offered during the 2008 financial crisis. William Foster, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it would ""help mitigate the depth and duration of the economic shock"". ""Nonetheless, we expect the virus to have a significant negative impact on growth and the fiscal deficit this year,"" he said. Governments around the world have responded to a surge in coronavirus cases by locking down societies in the hope of slowing the spread of the virus. The International Monetary Fund has warned the hit to global growth is likely to be bigger than the financial crisis. Many countries are now working on stimulus packages to support their economies, but these plans have received mixed responses from investors, as markets experience unprecedented volatility as they grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This month alone has seen the Dow having the five biggest daily gains and five biggest falls of its 135-year history. Reacting to news of the stimulus package, Tom Stevenson, investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: ""It's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet. ""When markets are falling, you get these big rallies but you shouldn't get stuck on that. They do bounce around in these situations."" THE LATEST:Live updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The US rescue package follows five days of intense negotiations to try to agree a deal that will provide aid for American workers and businesses. Before it becomes law the deal must get through the Republican-controlled Senate, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve has already announced $4tn in extra lending to help stimulate the economy in the face of the coronavirus. US stocks surged in anticipation of the massive economic stimulus deal Nearly 19,000 people have died with coronavirus worldwide since it emerged in China's Wuhan province in January, and more than 420,000 infections have been confirmed. Southern Europe is now at the centre of the pandemic, with Italy and Spain recording hundreds of new deaths every day. The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy. The US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history. Like the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child. But there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon. Some economists say US firms may need five times as much cash to prevent mass bankruptcy and unemployment.

"This video can not be played People panicked after Narendra Modi said nobody should leave their homes, and did not mention the status of essential supplies India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has imposed a nationwide lockdown in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The restrictions came into force at midnight local time (18:30 GMT) and will be enforced for 21 days. ""There will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes,"" Mr Modi said in a televised address. He appealed for people not to panic - but crowds quickly mobbed stores in the capital, Delhi, and other cities. Correspondents say it is not clear how - or even if - people will now be allowed out to buy food and other essentials. Why do you lock down 1.3bn people? 'Hunger may kill us before coronavirus' The new measures follow a sharp increase in cases in recent days. There have been 519 confirmed cases across India and 10 reported deaths. India - which has a population of 1.3bn - joins a growing list of countries that have imposed similar measures. Nearly 400,000 people have tested positive for the virus worldwide, and around 17,000 have died. THE LATEST:Live updates A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak ""The entire country will be in lockdown, total lockdown,"" Mr Modi said on Tuesday. He added: ""To save India, to save its every citizen, you, your family... every street, every neighbourhood is being put under lockdown."" Mr Modi warned that if India does not ""handle these 21 days well, then our country... will go backwards by 21 years"". ""This is a curfew,"" he said. ""We will have to pay the economic cost of this but [it] is the responsibility of everyone."" This video can not be played We explain why staying in is a matter of life and death Mr Modi later warned that panic-buying would only spread the disease. He said the government would ensure supplies. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But in Delhi and the financial capital, Mumbai, people fearing shortages quickly thronged shops and pharmacies. ""I have never witnessed such a chaos in my life,"" the owner of one store in the Shakarpur district of Delhi said, quoted by the Press Trust of India. ""All our stocks, including rice, flour, bread, biscuits, edible oils, have been sold out."" Police in the busy city of Ghaziabad, in Uttar Pradesh state, patrolled the streets with megaphones to tell residents to stay indoors. People in Mumbai rushed to stock up on essentials following Mr Modi's address Under the new measures, all non-essential businesses will be closed but hospitals and other medical facilities will continue to function as normal. Schools and universities will remain shut and almost all public gatherings will be banned. Anyone flouting the new rules faces up to two years in prison and heavy fines. In his address, Prime Minister Modi also: Stressed that the 21-day lockdown was ""very necessary to break the chain of coronavirus"" Emphasised the seriousness of the situation and said that even developed countries had faced problems in combating it Said that ""social distancing was the only way to stop"" the virus spreading Announced that nearly $2bn (Â£1.8bn) would be made available to boost the country's health infrastructure Called on people not to ""spread rumours"" and to follow instructions His announcement came after several Indian states introduced measures of their own, such as travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential services. India has already issued a ban on international arrivals and grounded domestic flights. The country's rail network has also suspended most passenger services. Many parts of India, including cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, are already under tight restrictions. But this move extends those provisions to every corner of the country. An earlier one-day curfew, which was seen as a trial, was flouted by many. Mr Modi called on Indians to clap and cheer the emergency services from their balconies on Sunday. But many misunderstood the call and congregated in the streets as they danced and chanted. ""It's impossible to fathom the cost that India may have to pay if such irresponsible behaviour continues,"" Mr Modi warned at the time. ""Social distancing is the only option to combat coronavirus."" The implications of a total lockdown in India are huge, not just economically, but socially. This is a nation where community is everything. Going to worship at a temple, mosque or church is an essential part of daily life for so many. This is a seismic cultural shift but - like the rest of the world facing similar restrictions - a necessary one. Neighbouring Pakistan has almost twice as many confirmed cases - 878 as of Monday evening. Sweeping restrictions are in place although the government has stopped short of imposing a nationwide lockdown. However, several provinces have announced them independently. The army is being brought in to help enforce the restrictions Bangladesh, which has reported 33 cases and three deaths, is also deploying its armed forces to help maintain social distancing and boost Covid-19 preventive measures. The soldiers will also monitor thousands of quarantined expatriate returnees. Across South Asia, there are concerns that the actual number of cases could be much higher than is being reported. Indonesia, which has 49 confirmed Covid-19 deaths - the highest in South East Asia - has converted an athlete's village built for the 2018 Asian Games into a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients. A state of emergency was declared in Jakarta on Monday In Thailand, a month-long state of emergency which will include curfews and checkpoints will begin on Thursday. The government has been criticised for failing to take strong action so far. Four people have died and nearly 900 tested positive The most populous country that was without a case until now - Myanmar - has announced two cases Elsewhere, governments are continuing to work to stem the spread of the virus which has now affected more than 190 countries worldwide More than 2.6 billion people are in lockdown now India has introduced its new measures, according to a tally by the AFP news agency This video can not be played Reality Check tackles misleading health advice being shared online Europe remains at the epicentre of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the death toll jumped by 514 in a single day in Spain and other European countries also reported sharp increases Italy is the worst affected country in the world in terms of deaths. The virus has killed almost 7,000 people there over the past month The UK, meanwhile, is spending its first day under tight new restrictions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced unprecedented measureson Monday and ordered the immediate closure of shops selling non-essential goods And in the US, New York's governor has said the federal government is not sending enough equipmentto combat the crisis.

"Visits to stores will now be carefully regulated Visit a supermarket today and you're likely to be greeted outside by a member of staff. But they won't be helping you with your shopping. Instead they'll be ensuring you stick to the new strict social-distancing rules that have applied since Monday evening. At Waitrose you'll be met by a marshal, while at M&S they're called greeters. Asda will also station more staff at its shop doors to ""greet"" customers. Their jobs are exactly the same: to ensure only a limited number of shoppers enter stores at any one time. They also check people are queuing responsibly and that shoppers wait patiently and stand two metres away from each other. Shopping is no longer a leisure activity. Instead, visits to a store - which you're only supposed to make to pick up essentials - will be carefully regulated. The rules are as much to protect store workers as shoppers. Indeed, Lidl, Morrisons, Aldi, Iceland and Sainsbury's have all installed protective screens for staff, while Waitrose has ordered screens and visors for its workers. Aldi is one of the supermarkets installing protective glass You'll see staff wearing gloves and plenty of hand-sanitisers near tills and other areas. They also no longer want your cash. Instead, supermarkets are trying to encourage shoppers to pay by contactless card to cut down on potentially virus-covered cash being passed around the population. You'll see posters encouraging you to look after yourself and treat staff well. Wetherspoon boss tells staff to get a job at Tesco Buy responsibly and think of others, shoppers told Supermarket workers facing coronavirus 'abuse' And on the floor, there are markings to show where it is safe to stand and when queuing. At Sainsbury's, there's tape marking out the correct two metre distance to maintain between customers in a queue. Tesco has lines on the floor and around checkouts to help shoppers with social-distancing measures. Tesco has marked the floor to help shoppers keep their distance from one another If you think you can avoid the new tightly-regulated in-store experience by getting a home delivery, you may be in for a disappointment. Some people are having to wait weeks for an available slot as online systems struggle to cope with demand. Visitors to online store Ocado on Tuesday were greeted with the message: ""You are in a virtual queue to log in. Once you have logged in you may need to queue again to shop."" Samantha Ward, who went into self-isolation last week when her husband developed Covid-19 symptoms, is struggling to get any supplies. ""Every day since self-isolating, I've been trying to place an online shopping order with all of the main supermarkets but there have been no available slots for weeks ahead."" ""Friends who have been going on shopping expeditions for me come back with very little,"" she reports. ""Supermarket shelves are stripped bare. But ironically, I'm regularly receiving standardised emails from the bosses of major stores reassuring me that there is plenty of food to go round!"" Some Ocado shoppers had to enter a a virtual queue to log in. There's also the Click+Collect option, where customers can arrange to pick up goods at their local store if they can't get a delivery slot. But that can prove a problem too, as Maidenhead-based shopper Lisa Bull discovered. ""I booked a click-and-collect with Tesco as there were no delivery slots available. Throughout the week, I edited my order as I thought of things I and my self-isolating elderly parents needed. ""When I edited my order on Monday morning, I was then unable to check out and my whole shop was cancelled."" ""It is an extremely busy time for both our stores and our delivery service and availability is challenging across many products,"" A Tesco spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We're doing our best to make sure people can get the food and items they need."" What are the new restrictions? New guidance from the government,externalsays people should now only leave home for the following reasons: Shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, with trips made as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk or cycle. This should be done alone or only with people you live with Any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person. This includes moving children under the age of 18 between their parents' homes, where applicable. Key workers or those with children identified as vulnerable can still take their children to school Travelling to and from work, but only where it absolutely cannot be done from home Businesses that are allowed to stay open under the strict new guidelines include supermarkets, banks, pharmacies, post offices, corner shops or market stalls selling food and restaurants that offer a takeaway service.
