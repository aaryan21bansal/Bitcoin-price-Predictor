"Scotland's train services are to be run by a public sector body, the Scottish government has announced. Dutch firm Abellio will stop running the ScotRail franchise at the end of March next year. After this an ""arms-length"" Scottish government company will take over the running of services. Abellio has been running the franchise since 2015 but had its contract ended early amid criticism over cancellations and performance levels. All ScotRail staff will transfer to the new Scottish government-owned entity. Abellio ScotRail contract to end three years early Public sector to compete for ScotRail franchise Welsh rail services nationalised The arrangement is being made under powers which allow the Scottish government to take over the rail franchise without a bidding process. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said he was not able to say how long these ""operator of last resort"" arrangements would last for. He said: ""I have decided that it would not be appropriate to award a franchise agreement to any party at this time, either through a competition or a direct award. ""That is why I have confirmed that, from the expiry of the current franchise, ScotRail services will be provided in public hands through a company wholly owned and controlled by the Scottish government. ""This approach will provide a stable platform for ScotRail services and certainty for passengers and staff."" Mr Matheson told MSPs that taking ScotRail into public hands was the right thing to do in the face of the challenges created by Covid Scotland's railways have already been temporarily nationalised since March last year to help the service cope with the impact of coronavirus. The Scottish government has spent Â£452m in support for ScotRail, along with the Caledonian Sleeper, after passenger numbers dropped dramatically as a result of lockdown restrictions. Mr Matheson described Abellio's time in charge of ScotRail as ""a difficult period"" which had confirmed the franchise system was ""broken and not working in the taxpayers' interest"". He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""There have been periods where they have under-performed, which has resulted in us having to take direct action. ""It's also a time when we have seen our rail network expand, with more new trains... and a greater range of services to the travelling public. ""So it's been very much a mixed report card that we would give to Abellio, but one that we did not believe lived up to our aspirations."" Mr Matheson said passengers would get better value for money under the new set-up ""because it will effectively cut out the company"" which has been running the system. This includes the company's ""considerable"" management costs, he said. Kevin Lindsay, Scottish organiser of train driver union Aslef, said: ""We welcome the beginning of the end of the failed franchise system here in Scotland. ""However, never again should people's railway ever be in the hands of the privateers. ""It's now for all us in the railway to build a railway that's accessible, affordable, and safe for the people of Scotland."" The TSSA union said: ""This announcement is long overdue - much like many ScotRail trains were whilst Abellio was in charge."" The RMT union said public ownership would deliver significant benefits for Scotland's rail workers, passengers and taxpayers. The ""operator of last resort"" model that the Scottish government will use is currently being used by the UK government to run the East Coast franchise by means of the arms-length London North Eastern Railway company. In Wales, day-to-day services arebeing run by a publicly-owned companyafter a significant fall in passenger numbers during the Covid pandemic. Scottish Tory transport spokesman Graham SimpsonÂ said: ""The SNP government must be entirely honest about how much this will cost taxpayers and clear about what demonstrable benefits it is expected to bring to passengers. ""It is important that this is being motivated by pragmatismÂ not ideology. ""This is the same government that can't even build a couple of ferries which hardly instils confidence in them having the competence to run a rail service."" Scottish Greens transport spokesman John Finnie said the announcement was ""welcome progress"". He said: ""Given Wales brought railways into public ownership last year, this has been a long time coming. ""Nationalisation of services is just the first step towards a greener, integrated public transport system which serves communities not shareholders."" Scottish Labour's transport spokesman Alex Rowley said: ""When SNP ministers awarded the contract to Abellio they told us we would have world leading services but for far too many that was not the experience. ""The Scottish government could have acted on this much earlier, and it is their repeated failures that have led us to this point."" A statement from ScotRail posted to Twitter said: ""We want to reassure you that we'll keep operating a reliable service to support the vaccine rollout and the opening up of the economy over the coming months.""We'll work closely with Transport Scotland to ensure a smooth transition to the new operator, to deliver stability for customers and railway staff."" Privatisation of the railways in the 1990s was both radical and controversial. Even some who had supported the privatisations of other state-owned assets such as BT and the electricity companies questioned whether breaking up British Rail and offering businesses franchises to run services would actually work out for the best. They seemed to be proved right. The company that owned the lines, Railtrack, was brought back into public ownership as Network Rail. Some franchises proved unsuccessful or unviable so the state stepped in to keep the trains running. The ScotRail franchise, despite plenty of controversies, was relatively free of trouble and has been operated by three separate companies over the years -  Abellio now looks set to be the last. In many ways though, Scotland's railways were more like a public private partnership than a business simply driven by the market. The Scottish government supported big improvements to the line between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the reopening of the Waverley Line in the borders. For some, the renationalisation of Scotland's railway service will be seen as right or wrong as a mere point of principle. But the test for many passengers will be whether it results in better services or a greater degree of accountability.

"This video can not be played 'An absolutely monumental day' - abuse survivor Gary Cliffe ""Significant institutional failings"" by the Football Association meant it ""did not do enough to keep children safe"" - according to the findings of an independent review into historical child sexual abuse in the game. It found the FA was ""too slow"" to have sufficient protection measures in place between October 1995 and May 2000. It said there was no evidence the FA knew of a problem before summer 1995. The report focused on the abuse of children between 1970 and 2005. It said: ""The FA acted far too slowly to introduce appropriate and sufficient child protection measures, and to ensure that safeguarding was taken sufficiently seriously by those involved in the game. These are significant institutional failings for which there is no excuse."" Football's child sex abuse scandal - a timeline Survivors say game 'must learn from mistakes' In a statement, FA chief executive Mark Bullingham offered ""a heartfelt apology"" from the English game's governing body to all survivors and added there was ""no excuse"" for its failings. ""No child should ever have experienced the abuse you did,"" he continued in an address to those affected. ""What you went through was horrific and it is deeply upsetting that more was not done by the game at the time, to give you the protection you deserved."" The long-awaited 710-page review, led by Clive Sheldon QC and commissioned by the FA in 2016, found: Following high-profile convictions of child sexual abusers from the summer of 1995 until May 2000, the FA ""could and should have done more to keep children safe"". There was a significant delay by the FA in putting in place sufficient child protection measures in football at that time. In that period, the FA ""did not do enough"" to keep children safe and ""child protection was not regarded as an urgent priority"". Even after May 2000, when the FA launched a comprehensive child protection policy and programme, ""mistakes were still made"" by the FA. The FA failed to ban two of the most notorious perpetrators of child sexual abuse, Barry Bennell and Bob Higgins, from involvement in football. There were known to be at least 240 suspects and 692 survivors, yet relatively few people reported abuse and the actual level was likely to be far higher. Where incidents of abuse were reported to people in authority at football clubs, their responses were ""rarely competent or appropriate"". Abuse within football was ""not commonplace"". The overwhelming majority of young people were able to engage in football safely. While several of the perpetrators knew each other, there was not evidence of a ""paedophile ring"" in football - Sheldon says: ""I do not consider that perpetrators shared boys with one another for sexual purposes, or shared information with one another that would have facilitated child sexual abuse."" Sheldon, whose review made 13 safeguarding recommendations, said: ""Understanding and acknowledging the appalling abuse suffered by young players in the period covered by the review is important for its own sake. ""Survivors deserve to be listened to, and their suffering deserves to be properly recognised. As well as recognising and facing up to what happened in the past, it is also important that this terrible history is not repeated, and that everything possible is done now to safeguard the current and future generations of young players."" Bullingham said the report was ""a very important piece of work"" made possible by ""survivors bravely"" coming forward. He added that ""today is a dark day for the beautiful game"" and a ""critical moment"" for English football, which he admitted had been ""too slow to act"". ""We must acknowledge the mistakes of the past and ensure that we do everything possible to prevent them being repeated,"" he continued. ""Thankfully there have been huge strides in safeguarding in sport and football over the past two decades, and the report recognises that English football is in a very different place today."" Andy Woodward (left), Chris Unsworth (second left), Steve Walters (right) and Gary Cliffe (second right) spoke candidly about their experiences on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in 2018 On 16 November 2016, former footballerAndy Woodwardwaived his right to anonymity to talk about how he was sexually abused by Bennell at Crewe Alexandra from the age of 11 to 15. Several other people contacted police in the following days, before former England and Tottenham player Paul Stewart said he was abused as a child by a coach, later named as Frank Roper. Children's charity the NSPCC set up a hotline with the FA, dedicated to footballers who had experienced sexual abuse - more than 860 calls were received in the first week. After investigations involving several police forces started, the FA announced an independent inquiry into non-recent child sex abuse, led by Sheldon. The independent review made its first call for evidence in January 2017, writing to all football clubs in England and Wales, amateur and professional, asking for information about allegations between 1970 and 2005. Sheldon's review said the FA was not aware that abuse had actually occurred in football prior to the summer of 1995, before Bennell had been convicted in Florida in connection with a football-related tour. The report found the provision of child protection guidance was ""not something which was happening widely within sport"". Barry Bennell has been convicted five times and is serving a 34-year sentence Barry Bennell- the former Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City coach isserving a 34-year sentenceafter being convicted of child sexual abuse five times. He has been convicted of sexual abuse against 22 boys in total, although it is believed more than 100 victims have come forward to say they were abused by Bennell. George Ormond- the former Newcastle youth coach was jailed in 2002 for six years after being found guilty of abusing seven boys under 16 between 1975 and 1999. Other victims subsequently came forward andOrmond was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2018after being found guilty of 36 counts of sexual abuse against 18 victims between 1973 and 1998. Eddie Heath- Chelsea announced in November 2016 they were investigating allegations of sexual abuse by former chief scout Heath, who died in 1983. Evidence from 23 witnesses detailed how Heath groomed and abused young boys aged 10 to 17 in the 1970s. An external review saidsome adults at Chelsea must have been aware of Heath's abusebut ""turned a blind eye"". Chelsea apologised unreservedly after the review was published in 2019. Bob Higgins- the former Southampton and Peterborough youth coach wasjailed for 24 years and three months in 2019on 45 counts of indecent assault against 24 boys. Higgins went on trial in the early 1990s but was acquitted. Multiple former players came forward with allegations of abuse by Higgins in 2016 and 2017. Michael 'Kit' Carson- the 75-year-oldkilled himself by crashing into a treeon the first day of his trial in 2019. He was accused of sexually abusing boys under 16, from 1978 to 2009. Carson had worked for Peterborough United, Cambridge United and Norwich City. Ted Langford- the former Aston Villa and Leicester City part-time scout was jailed in 2007 for the sexual abuse of four boys between 1976 and 1989. Frank Roper- worked as a scout in the north west of England. Roper, who died in 2005, sexuallyabused young footballerswhile recruiting players to Blackpool's school of excellence. Phil Edwards- former Watford physio who died in 2019 while on bail for an alleged child sex offence. Hertfordshire police were subsequently contacted by16 people who made complaints about Edwards. Andy Woodward- was abused by Bennell as a junior Crewe player from the ages of 11 to 15. He told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethe abuse had a ""catastrophic"" impact on his life. Chris Unsworth- the ex-Manchester City youth player was abused by Bennell from the age of nine. Unsworthtold the BBChe had been ""raped between 50 and 100 times"". Steve Walters- was abused by Bennell and said it began at the age of 12 when he would stay at the former coach's house in the town during the school holidays. Hetold the BBCthe abuse was ""absolutely petrifying"". Paul Stewart-  the former Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool player was abusedby Roper,externaldaily for four years up to the age of 15. ""He was threatening that he would kill my parents and my two brothers if I ever spoke out. I was just absolutely frightened,""Stewart told the BBC. Paul Collins -played briefly for Charlton Athletic and was groomed by Heath with free boots and holidays. The trauma Collins suffered led to him quitting the game early in his career.Watch the interview here. Gary Johnson- the ex-Chelsea player joined the club as an 11-year-old in 1970 and said he had been groomed by Heath from the age of 13. Hesaid the club paid him a Â£50,000settlement that included a confidentiality clause. David Eatock- the former Newcastle United player told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshireshow he had been groomed by Ormond from the ages of 18 to 21. He said he ""froze"" with fear during an assault in Ormond's van. Tony Brien- said he was abused by Langford from the age of 12 when he was playing for a local youth team Dunlop Terriers in the early 1980s - a feeder team for Leicester and Aston Villa. Former Villa manager Graham Taylor isalleged to have discouraged Brienfrom going public with his allegations. Taylor died in January 2017. The report said that for much of the period the review covered: club staff and officials were generally unaware of child protection issues; they were not trained in child protection issues; they did not identify or respond to signs of potential abuse; and if they were aware of the signs, they did not examine them with curiosity or suspicion. In March 2019,Manchester Cityset upa multi-million pound compensation schemefor victims of historical child sexual abuse carried out by former coaches. The report said that City senior management were aware of rumours and concerns about Bennell's conduct in the early 1980s. It added: ""The club did not investigate these rumours. It should have done so. The club should also have investigated the arrangements for boys staying at Bennell's house."" Man City's child sexual abuse response was 'wholly inadequate' City commissioned an independent review in November 2016, led by Jane Mulcahy QC, that was also published on Wednesday. In addition to personal apologies made by the club to survivors, City said its board of directors wished to ""apologise publicly and unreservedly for the unimaginable suffering experienced by those who were abused as a result of the club's association"" with Bennell and two other convicted abusers, John Broome and Bill Toner. It added: ""The club also extends its heartfelt regret and sympathy to the multiple family members and friends affected by these traumatic events, the ramifications of which are felt by so many to the present day and will continue to be felt for a long time to come."" Crewe Alexandrahave reiterated they werenot aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell,externaluntil 1994 when he was convicted of sexual assault, and did not receive a single complaint about sexual abuse by him. The Sheldon report said: ""It is likely that three directors of Crewe Alexandra FC discussed concerns about Bennell which hinted at his sexual interest in children. ""There is no evidence that the advice of a senior police officer to the club's former chairman to keep a 'watching brief' on Bennell was heeded. ""The club should also have ensured that there were appropriate arrangements in place for boys staying overnight at Bennell's house. ""The boys should have been spoken to periodically to check that they were being properly cared for. Had such steps been taken, this might have led to boys making disclosures to the club."" Sheldon said former Crewe manager Dario Gradi ""should have done more"" to investigate concerns about Bennell but was not involved in a cover up. Gradi, who has always denied any wrongdoing, is also criticised in the report for not doing more when a claim of abuse by Heath was reported to him while assistant manager at Chelsea in 1975. The report states that Gradi ""did not consider a person putting their hands down another's trousers to be an assault"", but that he changed his mind after Sheldon insisted it was. Gradi, 79, wassuspended in 2016pending an FA investigation and retired from his position of director of football at Crewethree years later. Bullingham said on Wednesday that Gradi was ""effectively banned for life"" from football but could not go into the reasons. The FA's director of legal and governance Polly Handford said it was ""for safeguarding reasons"" but that was ""as far as we can go"". Stoke Citywere ""also aware of rumours about Bennell"" during his time associated with the club in the early 1990s, said the report, and steps should have been taken to monitor his activities. Premier League clubsAston Villa and Leicester paid damagesto five victims of Langford in March 2020. The report saidAston Villashould have reported disclosures about sexual abuse by Langford to the police when his role as a scout was terminated in July 1989. And on Wednesday,Southamptonadmitted ""considerable failings""and said they were ""deeply sorry"" to young footballers abused by Higgins. The report found Southampton andPeterborough United FCwere also aware of rumours about the inappropriate behaviour of Higgins, and were aware that boys were staying at his home. ""This awareness should have resulted in greater monitoring by the clubs. Had Higgins been properly monitored this might have prevented some of his abuse of young players,"" the report added. AtChelsea, in relation to Heath, the Sheldon report said steps should have been taken to protect the young player who had made a disclosure about abuse in or around 1975. Newcastle Unitedshould have acted more quickly following disclosures of abuse by Ormond at the youth club Monty's in early 1997. Ormond was only removed from the club many months later, and after he had been permitted to travel abroad with young players. The report found that despite being aware of the allegations, no additional safeguards were put in place by the club. In a statement, Newcastle expressed their ""sincere apologies and sympathy to all individuals affected by historic abuse in football and commend the bravery of those who have come forward and shared their stories"". The club added that they now have ""comprehensive and robust safeguarding measures in place to protect and support young people throughout the football club"". Among Sheldon's recommendations are the introduction of safeguarding training at several levels in the game, including all players and young people as well as the FA board and senior management team. He also recommends there should be safeguarding officers employed by all Premier League and English Football League (EFL) clubs. Both league governing bodies say they and associated clubs have safeguarding leads at board level, as well as dedicated safeguarding staff. The Premier League said it accepted the report's ""findings and insight it provides"", and added the recommendations ""will further strengthen safeguarding arrangements across the game"" as ""there is no room for complacency"". The EFL also said it accepted the advice and would work with the FA, clubs and other stakeholders ""to ensure [the recommendations] are implemented as a minimum [standard], where they have not been already"". Both the Premier League and EFL said they were ""well placed to meet all the recommendations"" and that the findings would inform a review of safeguarding governance, support and awareness arrangements. The Offside Trust, the organisation set up by survivors of child sexual abuse in sport, said the recommendations were ""blindingly obvious to anyone"" after the scandal broke in 2016. It added it was ""disappointed not to see anything stronger in terms of mandatory reporting"" and it would have liked to have ""seen more on wealthy clubs supporting grassroots safeguarding"". Julian KnightMP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said: ""The failure of the FA to keep children safe is truly shocking. ""There can be no excuses for the critical delays to act or provide guidance to those working on child protection. We could be looking at the biggest safeguarding scandal in football's history."" Former Manchester City junior playerGary Cliffewas among the survivors of Bennell's abuse. He said the ex-coachabused him hundreds of timesbetween the ages of 11 and 15. Cliffe told BBC Sport this was an ""absolutely monumental day"" because of of the publication of the findings. ""It matters so much because it's impacted on my life and numerous other people's lives,"" he added. ""We are hoping and looking for answers and culpability within that report."" But Cliffe said he was disappointed with the suggestions in the report that suspicions of abuse were not acted upon. ""I don't think he's gone far enough,"" he said. ""Throughout the whole report that I've read, there's a theme that people knew or suspected, but none of the officials had the gumption to raise it with anyone - police, social services - anyone at all. ""It's a theme running through it, so it's disappointing from that respect."" Ian Ackleywas a youth player when he was abused and raped by Bennell over a four-year period. Now working as an abuse survivor support advocate for the Professional Footballers' Association, he said it would be ""naive"" to believe abuse had been eradicated. ""Make sure your children are safe,"" he said. ""Don't assume that just because someone has got a badge, whistle or tracksuit that they're OK to leave your children with."" Former England internationalPaul Stewart,who was abused by Roper, told BBC News that there were ""suspicions and rumours"" of abuse, but they were ""totally ignored"". ""It caused a lot of survivors a lot of damage as we got on through adult life,"" he added. ""I don't think the report has shown how damaging the effects of abuse have been to individuals. ""We have to make sure we don't get complacent and the abuse doesn't happen again."" Football's Darkest Secrets- a three-part series examining historic child abuse in youth football all across England between the 1970s and the 1990s, airs on BBC One, from Monday, 22 March.

"Stuart Lubbock was found dead in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool in March 2001 A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the indecent assault and murder of Stuart Lubbock at the home of Michael Barrymore. Mr Lubbock, 31, died in hospital after being found unconscious in the TV presenter's pool in Roydon, Essex. He had been attending a party at the home of Mr Barrymore, 68, with eight other people in March 2001. The man, who was arrested in Cheshire, has since been released on bail, Essex Police said. A post-mortem examination found Mr Lubbock had suffered ""horrific"" injuries prior to his death, police said. Alcohol, ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream. Det Supt Lucy Morris, Essex Police's head of major crime, said the arrest was made after ""significant new information"" came to light following a renewed appeal in February 2020. This video can not be played Stuart Lubbock: Murder arrest followed 'significant new information' ""This information has led to us making an arrest and over the coming days we will be contacting all those who were present at the party at the time as well as others who may have information,"" she said. ""As we stated last February and have continually stated over the last 20 years, we believe someone or some people at that party know what happened."" Det Supt Morris said the investigation had been ""extremely lengthy and complex"", adding: ""We have never given up on finding out what exactly happened to Stuart and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends."" Mr Lubbock, a butcher from Harlow, was described by neighbours at the time of his death as a ""pleasant, sociable"" man. No-one has ever been charged with any offence in relation to his death. Stuart Lubbock's father Terry said he had been living ""to get justice"" for his son Reacting to news of the arrest, Mr Lubbock's father Terry said: ""There is just so much going on in my head. I can't get my head around it. ""Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me."" In February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. ""All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,"" he said. Michael Barrymore has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing Mr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge. The TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death. Speaking last year, he said: ""I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media."" On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest. Mr Barrymore's Essex home became the centre of inquiries into how Mr Lubbock died An inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict. Three years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest. In 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later. Last year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.

"The death of Sarah Everard has triggered conversations about women's safety The government has said it will ""on an experimental basis"" ask the police to record crimes of violence motivated by a person's sex or gender. The announcement is a concession to campaigners who have been calling for misogyny to be made a hate crime. Women's groups have argued this would help provide ""critical data"" on violence against women and girls. The Law Commission has carried out a review of hate crime legislation. It is expected to make its official recommendations to the government in 2021. Women 'should be protected' under hate crime laws Hate crimes recorded by police up 10% How many attacks on women are there? Home Office Minister Baroness Williams said the change would ""inform longer term decisions"" while the government awaited the outcome of the commission's review. The Labour MP Stella Creasy said it represented ""success"" for those who'd been campaigning on the issue, adding that changes to legislation were needed to make sure such crimes could be prosecuted.

A hate crime is deemed to have been committed when someone is assaulted or harassed because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. Seven police forces in England and Wales have already introduced their own misogyny hate crime policy - including Nottinghamshire Police. An evaluation of the policy in Nottinghamshire saidthe move had led to ""shifting attitudes as a result"". However others have urged caution including minister Victoria Atkins who said in 2018 that: ""Women are not a minority, and I would be hesitant to put us forward as one."" Speaking in the House of Lords, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams said ""On an experimental basis we will ask police forces to record and identify any crimes of violence against the person including stalking and harassment, and sexual offences where the victim perceives it to have been motivated by a hostility based on their sex"". She said data collection would ""help us find solutions"" to the problem of violence against women and girls. However she added it was important ""to ensure the law itself is coherent"". Responding to the announcement, Fawcett Society chief executive Felicia Willow said: ""This is a major step forward in changing how we understand, address and prevent violence against women - and one that we hope will help change attitudes towards women."" The Scottish governmenthas recently passeda hate crime law which extends protection for vulnerable groups, but an amendment that would have included women as a protected group was defeated. The government in Edinburgh has instead set up a working group to look at whether misogynistic abuse should be a separate crime.

"This video can not be played Atlanta shootings: ""It's scary just to be an Asian American woman"" A man has been charged with murder over the killing of eight people at massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia. Officials cannot yet confirm if the attack, in which six Asian women were killed, was racially motivated. Four victims were named on Wednesday. The suspect, named as Robert Aaron Long, faces multiple counts of murder as well as aggravated assault. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect may have been a patron and claimed to have a ""sex addiction"". The attack comes amid a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans. Four of the victims have been identified by Cherokee County officials as Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R Hernandez-Ortiz was identified as having been injured. In a news conference on Wednesday, investigators said Mr Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, admitted to the shooting spree, and said that he denied that the attack was motivated by race. He has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department. Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta ""He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,"" said Capt Jay Baker, adding that Mr Long was caught with a 9mm handgun and did not resist arrest. But Capt Baker's remarks - that ""yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did"" - came in for widespread criticism for appearing to sympathise with the alleged perpetrator. Massage parlours are known to sometimes provide prostitution services, but authorities say there is no indication yet that this is the case at the targeted locations. ""These are legally operating businesses that have not been on our radar,"" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who added that the city would not engage in ""victim shaming, victim blaming"". Police also noted it is still too early in the investigation to definitively state a motive and that the suspect appeared to have been acting alone. Ms Bottoms said that he was on his way to Florida, possibly to commit more shootings, when he was arrested. The suspect's parents helped to identify him, officials told reporters. According to CBS News, the suspect told investigators that ""he loved God and guns"". The first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County. Two people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded. Less than an hour later, police were called to a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. In the recording of the 911 call released on Wednesday, a woman tells the dispatcher that she's hiding from the assailant. ""Do you have a description of the male?"" the operator asks. ""We're hiding right now,"" the woman replies. ""They have a gun."" ""Please come, ok?"" she says. When authorities arrived at the spa, ""officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds"", police said. While there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead. On a second 911 call, a woman tells the operator that she got a call from a friend who said a man had entered the spa and fired a gun. ""They said some guy came in... We heard a gunshot and the lady's passed out in front of the door,"" she says. ""And everybody is scared and everybody is hiding."" Investigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta. Robert Aaron Long was taken into custody Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. Police have only identified the people who were attacked in Cherokee County at this time. Details have been slow to emerge. Here is what we know about the named victims so far. Ashley Yaun and her husband had gone to Young's Asian Massage for a couples massage, according to an online fundraiser. Her husband survived the attack and was unharmed. The couple have two children. ""We just don't know how to do any of this alone,"" the GoFundMe page says. A GoFundMe for Mr Hernandez-Ortiz, the only victim to survive the attacks, says that he is intensive care after being shot in the forehead, lungs and stomach. His daughter Yoseline, 9, told WGCL-TV that ""he is a really good dad,"" and ""I don't want him to go."" By Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Washington Heartbroken, fearful, angry, fed up. These are some shared feelings of people who showed up at a vigil in Washington DC the night after the shooting. Around 100 people marched in Chinatown and lit candles, mourning the eight lives lost in Atlanta - six of them of Asian descent. The authorities have not linked the killing with anti-Asian hate crime. But many here believe the shooting is yet another senseless attack against Asians and Asian-Americans during the pandemic. ""It's scary to be an Asian-American woman anywhere in the US,"" an Asian woman told me. She said it was finally time for her to speak up, after being told by her parents to stay silent about racism she experienced while growing up. There's a myth about Asian-Americans being the quiet ""model minority"". But those who attended the vigil, both Asians and non-Asians, spoke loud and clear with a unified voice. ""We will not fight racism with racism,"" a Korean-American man spoke to the crowd emotionally, ""We will fight racism with unity!"" Though authorities say it is too early to know if the victims were targeted because of their race, many online have criticised a recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, which activists have linked to rhetoric blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders acknowledged a motive was unclear, but said ""right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian American community that must be addressed"". It called the shootings ""an unspeakable tragedy"" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has ""been reeling from high levels of racist attacks"". From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise ""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,"" Mayor Bottoms said in a statement, adding that she had been in communication with the White House. Mr Biden tweeted that he and the first lady were ""keeping everyone impacted by the shootings in Atlanta in our prayers"". ""We don't yet know the motive, but what we do know is that the Asian-American community is feeling enormous pain tonight. The recent attacks against the community are un-American.  They must stop,"" he said. Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first Asian-American to hold the office, said during a Wednesday meeting with Irish officials: ""I do want to say to our Asian-American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people."" Ben Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: ""Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism."" Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta Atlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: ""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence.""

"The previous model, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20, was released last August Samsung, the worldâs biggest computer-chip manufacturer, has warned of a âserious imbalanceâ in the semiconductor industry, as global shortages cause disruption. It also said it might skip the launch of the next Galaxy Note smartphone, to streamline its lineup. There are growing fears market shortages could slow economic recovery after coronavirus. EU, US and Chinese governments are seeking to boost production. âThereâs a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally,â Samsung's co-chief executive and mobile chief, Koh Dong-jin, said at a shareholder meeting. ""It is hard to say the shortage issue has been solved 100%."" Samsung was working with overseas partners to meet demand, he added. The semiconductor shortage began last year, as the pandemic hit. Suffering from poor sales, car manufacturers cut their orders from the Chinese factories making computer chips. In response, the chip supply from factories was transferred to other sectors that had high demands. Chip-shortage 'crisis' halts car production How will 'chipageddon' affect you? And unable to retrieve cancelled orders when demand for cars grew, Volkswagen, Honda, Toyota and General Motors all had to reduce production. Meanwhile, as technology sales boomed, with people staying at home, the other sectors were also affected. New graphics cards were scarce, Apple staggered the release of some iPhones, and the latest models of Xbox and PlayStation consoles areselling outeach time a new stock is announced. ""The semiconductor manufacturers are working hard to fill the gaps in supply,"" Counterpoint Research partner Peter Richardson said. ""But it will take time before investment translates to more supply. ""This means that shortages for some products may continue for several months - possibly even in to 2022."" However, most consumers were unlikely to feel the impact, unless buying a new car, he added. Samsung's release of a new Galaxy Note smartphone may now be delayed until 2022, Mr Koh signalled. As a high-end model, âit might be difficult to releaseâ, he said. Another popular model, theSamsung Galaxy S21, was launched in January. âIt could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year,â Mr Koh added. This video can not be played Watch: First look at Samsung's S21 Ultra phone Quilter Cheviot research analyst Ben Barringer said: ""Growing trade tensions between the US and China put the semiconductor industry in uncertainty, even before the pandemic. ""This shortage illustrates how important certain countries have become in terms of supply chain - and how important access to semiconductors is."" And last month's closure of its chip-fabrication plant by adverse weather conditions in Texas had exacerbated Samsung's problems. Taiwanese research firm TrendForce estimated the shutdown could reduce global smartphone production by 5% in the second quarter of this year. ""They are trying to differentiate between absolute demands and nice-to-haves,"" Mr Barringer added. Why is there a chip shortage for computers and cars?

"NHS workers in Wales will get the bonus payment for the first time A bonus payment will be paid to all NHS and social care workers in Wales. The Welsh government said it would pay nearly 222,000 people the equivalent of Â£735 each, with an element to cover tax and National Insurance deductions. It means most would get Â£500, Health Minster Vaughan Gething said, adding it ""expresses our gratitude"" to those working in those jobs. But the Royal College of Nursing warned ""a one-off Covid-19 bonus is not a significant and substantive pay rise"". It is the second bonus for social care staff, and the first for NHS workers. ""Nurses have gone above and beyond in the past 12 months,"" said Helen Whyley, director of RCN Wales. She called for fair pay that encouraged nurses to stay in the profession and attract more staff. The RCN union says the bonus does not represent a pay rise However, the announcement was welcomed by the trade union Unison Cymru Wales, which said it was ""in contrast to the insulting approach of the Conservative UK government"". The Department of Health and Social Care has recommended a 1% pay rise to an independent panel examining salaries of NHS staff in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it was as muchas ministers could give. The Â£735 payment is separate to NHS pay. The Welsh Tories' Janet Finch-Saunders called for ""longer-term pay recognition"" for staff, while Plaid Cymru said the difference in health care and social care pay needed to be addressed. Both parties backed a minimum wage for social care workers ofÂ£10 an hourin the Senedd on Wednesday evening. How much will NHS staff be paid? Nurses are well-paid for the job, says minister 'No ceiling' set for any Welsh NHS pay rise The bonus award, the Welsh government said, will benefit an estimated 221,945 people. They include 103,600 social care staff, 90,000 NHS Wales staff, 2,345 deployed students and 26,000 primary care staff, including pharmacy, GP, dental and optometry workers. Last year a Â£500 payment was made to social care staff, but it did not coverany element of taxthat would need to be paid on it. Welsh ministers argued the Treasury should cover it. Plaid had called the handling of the matter ""baffling"". The Welsh government said it was working with councils - which fund social care - and trade unions to finalise how the new payments would work. This video can not be played Coronavirus: NHS bonus after 'truly remarkable contribution' At a Covid briefing on Wednesday Mr Gething said the Welsh government would not set an ""arbitrary cap"" on a pay rise for NHS staff. The issue of NHS pay rises is considered by independent pay review bodies who recommend how much staff should earn. ""For NHS staff it really does feel like a kick in the teeth for the UK government to say there would only be a 1% pay raise and that's what they want the pay review bodies to agree to,"" said Mr Gething. ""That isn't what we've done here in Wales, I've released the evidence and the letters that I have sent to those pay review bodies, we are not setting an arbitrary cap."" The announcement came ahead of a Senedd debate, where Plaid Cymru said it would call for social workers to receive Â£10 an hour. Delyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru Senedd member, said: ""This is a one-off recognition, it's a bonus because of the sacrifices that everyone in these sectors have had to make this past year ""The wider conversation we should be having is about the fact that there is this huge disparity between what health workers, and what care workers receive."" Janet Finch-Saunders, for the Welsh Conservatives, told BBC Wales she wanted to see ""longer-term pay recognition"" for staff, but said the payment was ""welcome news"". Asked what she would want to see in terms of a pay rise, she said: ""I don't think you can quantify or put in an actual percentage figure, but I just hope that here in Wales with the money that they now have that they actually do reward our health and social care workers.""

"Gerry Smith (L) is tested for the virus every time she visits her mother's care home Leading care organisations in England are warning of a ""cliff edge"" when emergency funding to support infection control and visits during the pandemic runs out in two weeks. Some providers fear the financial pressure could force them to close. They say the budget was a missed chance to tackle the short- and long-term funding crisis in adult social care. In 2019, on his first day as prime minister,Boris Johnson committed to 'fix the crisis in social care'. Ministers say they will bring forward proposals this year. The emergency funds are to help care homes and home care services with additional Covid costs, includinginfection control, visiting measures and extra staffing,external. Social care reform 'needed within a year' 10 charts on whatâs gone wrong with social care The Victory Care home in Chatham, Kent, which normally cares for 60 people, has used some of its emergency money on staff to organise visits and testing. ""Everything from extra newsletters, Zoom calls, the telephone calls, and then there will be additional resources put into ensuring people are tested, ensuring the tests are logged so that we know what our team's results are,"" says Raina Summerson, chief executive of Agincare, which runs the home. Gerry Smith, whose mother Julia moved there last October, is tested every time she visits. ""We haven't got out of the pandemic yet, so we still need to keep the precautions going for a bit longer until everyone's had the vaccine that's going to have the vaccine and the numbers have dropped,"" says Ms Smith. Care home running costs have spiralled during the pandemic, says Agincare chief executive Raina Summerson But if emergency funding stops in two weeks, there are fears about the impact on care home visiting, testing and even the survival of some providers. Ms Summerson says whilst Agincare is secure, the care homes and home care services she runs have seen wage bills rise between 10% and 18% during the pandemic. But, she says, fee rates offered by councils and the NHS for the year ahead are mainly staying the same or increasing by 1-2%. ""We will still have costs related to additional staffing for visiting, we will still need to be doing testing regularly, we will still need to be doing robust - more so than usual - infection control procedures,"" she says. ""Who will suffer through this lack of funding? People who desperately need services, and our workforce who have given so much over this last year. It feels like a real slap in the face for them."" The seven organisations which signedthe statement,externalcall themselves an ""unprecedented alliance"" of local politicians, council social service directors, care providers and people who need support. They say the absence of social care in the Budget was ""disappointing and a missed chance to provide much-needed certainty"". They want the government to publish its long-promised social care reform plan by the summer. Three years ago, Christie Michael and her mother Maria moved from one area where they were both eligible for council support to another with a very different approach. Maria has regular epileptic seizures, renal failure and diabetes. Christie has a rare condition that means her joints dislocate very easily. Christie Michael and her mother Maria say lack of long-term investment in social care has affected them directly But once they moved, Christie was not entitled to local authority funded help, and rather than four hours support a day, her mum was offered an hour and 15 minutes. They say the council told them they would have to pay Â£75 a week towards the care. ""We decided to stop the care, we just could not afford it. ""We already needed food banks before when we were getting free care,"" says Christie. She is now her mother's full-time carer. ""I feel like I owe her and I want to do it, but it means that I don't have a life and it means that my physical health and my mental health is declining as well."" Christie describes the care system as broken. ""I absolutely do not think you should get social care according to your postcode. ""It should be nationwide, available to everyone.""

"Several countries have pushed for the digital certificates to help revive the tourism industry A digital certificate to kick-start foreign travel should be given to citizens across the EU ""without discrimination"", officials say. The aim is to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU. The 27 member states will decide how to use the new digital certificate. Vaccine passports have faced opposition from some EU member states over concerns they might be discriminatory. Some argue that they would enable a minority to enjoy foreign travel without restrictions while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face measures such as quarantine. European Commission officials have made clear they want to avoid discrimination. P&O Cruises says travellers will need vaccinations British Airways plans app-based travel pass Europe in vaccine race to save summer Another issue raised has been that data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete. Ahead of the EU's announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was working to ""create an international trusted framework"" for safe travel, but that vaccinations should not be a condition. Separately, European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen has threatened to withhold exporting vaccines to the UKand any other countries outside the EU that do not supply doses in a reciprocal way. ""We're still waiting for doses to come from the UK,"" she said. ""So, this is an invitation to show us that there are also doses from the UK coming to the European Union."" Speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed digital green certificate would be ""for all EU citizens, their families when they're leaving the EU or living abroad"". ""It'll also be for the European Economic Area (EEA), because we want to work with Norway and Iceland,"" he said, adding that Switzerland would also be involved. Mr Reynders said there was still a lot to do to put the digital certificate in place, but the aim was to get it up and running before the summer tourist season. The European Commission proposal sets out that any EU member state permitting vaccinated travellers to bypass restrictions such as quarantine must accept certificates from other states within the bloc under the same conditions. The vaccines should be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These currently include drugs developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, but not Russia's Sputnik V or China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. However, the proposal adds that the guidelines ""should not prevent member states from deciding to accept vaccination certificates issued for other Covid-19 vaccines"". Vaccine pause hits Europe rollout as Covid cases rise Is the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine safe? Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Meanwhile, in the UK, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was looking at the idea of vaccine passports and had been ""discussing what the best way to proceed is"". ""We are having debates, discussions about travel... but I think what we also have to do is be driven by the data, we've got to see how coronavirus develops,"" he told the BBC. More than a third of the UK population - nearly 25 million people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine in the UK, which is no longer a member of the European Union. The rollout across the EU has been slower, and has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the currentsuspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccineover fears of possible side effects. The economies of countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy are unlikely to recover until the tourist industry is reopened, and they have been looking at ways to save the summer season while providing a safe environment for both travellers and local residents. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Wednesday welcomed the planned certificate, which he said would ""significantly facilitate the movement of citizens and will help boost tourism and the economies that rely heavily on it"". Last month, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos said that a common digital certificate was ""not discriminatory"", and that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer - but the procedure for them would be slower as they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival. This video can not be played Greece: Covid vaccine certificate is 'not discriminatory' A hotel manager in the Spanish resort of Benidorm, Ricardo SÃ¡nchez, told the BBC that the UK was its most important market, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, and people arriving from Eastern Europe. ""So many months working with so many restrictions and the restrictions are changing every 15 days,"" he said, adding that would-be tourists were unsure what to do and were waiting for ""good news"" before booking reservations. Iceland has said it is opening its borders to visitors who have received the vaccine without the need for testing or quarantine later this week.

Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic. But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns.

We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs. ""While it may be a bit different from the last time you visited, together we can find new ways to create magical moments togetherâand memories to treasure forever,"" the company is telling potential visitors on its website.

state of emergency curbs expire on schedule on Sunday, less than five months before the postponed Tokyo Olympics are due to begin. ""The figures have moved in the direction of lifting (the
emergency measures),"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""I will make a final decision towards ending the curbs after
listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9377958
"This video can not be played Atlanta shootings: ""It's scary just to be an Asian American woman"" A man has been charged with murder over the killing of eight people at massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia. Officials cannot yet confirm if the attack, in which six Asian women were killed, was racially motivated. Four victims were named on Wednesday. The suspect, named as Robert Aaron Long, faces multiple counts of murder as well as aggravated assault. Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect may have been a patron and claimed to have a ""sex addiction"". The attack comes amid a sharp uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans. Four of the victims have been identified by Cherokee County officials as Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R Hernandez-Ortiz was identified as having been injured. In a news conference on Wednesday, investigators said Mr Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, admitted to the shooting spree, and said that he denied that the attack was motivated by race. He has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department. Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta ""He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,"" said Capt Jay Baker, adding that Mr Long was caught with a 9mm handgun and did not resist arrest. But Capt Baker's remarks - that ""yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did"" - came in for widespread criticism for appearing to sympathise with the alleged perpetrator. Massage parlours are known to sometimes provide prostitution services, but authorities say there is no indication yet that this is the case at the targeted locations. ""These are legally operating businesses that have not been on our radar,"" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who added that the city would not engage in ""victim shaming, victim blaming"". Police also noted it is still too early in the investigation to definitively state a motive and that the suspect appeared to have been acting alone. Ms Bottoms said that he was on his way to Florida, possibly to commit more shootings, when he was arrested. The suspect's parents helped to identify him, officials told reporters. According to CBS News, the suspect told investigators that ""he loved God and guns"". The first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County. Two people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded. Less than an hour later, police were called to a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. In the recording of the 911 call released on Wednesday, a woman tells the dispatcher that she's hiding from the assailant. ""Do you have a description of the male?"" the operator asks. ""We're hiding right now,"" the woman replies. ""They have a gun."" ""Please come, ok?"" she says. When authorities arrived at the spa, ""officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds"", police said. While there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead. On a second 911 call, a woman tells the operator that she got a call from a friend who said a man had entered the spa and fired a gun. ""They said some guy came in... We heard a gunshot and the lady's passed out in front of the door,"" she says. ""And everybody is scared and everybody is hiding."" Investigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta. Robert Aaron Long was taken into custody Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. Police have only identified the people who were attacked in Cherokee County at this time. Details have been slow to emerge. Here is what we know about the named victims so far. Ashley Yaun and her husband had gone to Young's Asian Massage for a couples massage, according to an online fundraiser. Her husband survived the attack and was unharmed. The couple have two children. ""We just don't know how to do any of this alone,"" the GoFundMe page says. A GoFundMe for Mr Hernandez-Ortiz, the only victim to survive the attacks, says that he is intensive care after being shot in the forehead, lungs and stomach. His daughter Yoseline, 9, told WGCL-TV that ""he is a really good dad,"" and ""I don't want him to go."" By Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Washington Heartbroken, fearful, angry, fed up. These are some shared feelings of people who showed up at a vigil in Washington DC the night after the shooting. Around 100 people marched in Chinatown and lit candles, mourning the eight lives lost in Atlanta - six of them of Asian descent. The authorities have not linked the killing with anti-Asian hate crime. But many here believe the shooting is yet another senseless attack against Asians and Asian-Americans during the pandemic. ""It's scary to be an Asian-American woman anywhere in the US,"" an Asian woman told me. She said it was finally time for her to speak up, after being told by her parents to stay silent about racism she experienced while growing up. There's a myth about Asian-Americans being the quiet ""model minority"". But those who attended the vigil, both Asians and non-Asians, spoke loud and clear with a unified voice. ""We will not fight racism with racism,"" a Korean-American man spoke to the crowd emotionally, ""We will fight racism with unity!"" Though authorities say it is too early to know if the victims were targeted because of their race, many online have criticised a recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, which activists have linked to rhetoric blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders acknowledged a motive was unclear, but said ""right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian American community that must be addressed"". It called the shootings ""an unspeakable tragedy"" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has ""been reeling from high levels of racist attacks"". From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise ""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,"" Mayor Bottoms said in a statement, adding that she had been in communication with the White House. Mr Biden tweeted that he and the first lady were ""keeping everyone impacted by the shootings in Atlanta in our prayers"". ""We don't yet know the motive, but what we do know is that the Asian-American community is feeling enormous pain tonight. The recent attacks against the community are un-American.  They must stop,"" he said. Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first Asian-American to hold the office, said during a Wednesday meeting with Irish officials: ""I do want to say to our Asian-American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people."" Ben Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: ""Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism."" Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta Atlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: ""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence.""

But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns. Read more from Faisal here. We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

He said the cat, named after the TV detective, had initially targeted his headphone cable, resisting efforts to usher him away before he walked on to the keyboard and into the frame. ""The judge jokingly asked if he was my instructing solicitor, to which I said: 'No, it's my replacement junior.' ""Everyone laughed and, sensing stardom, Columbo just kept coming back."" Hussain, from Sheffield, said: ""It started to go viral and my junior said 'your cat is on the news'. I couldn't believe it, here was a Radio 4 news report about my cat."" ""I'm happy this small unexpected act made so many people laugh. The aftermath was surreal."" His appearance sparked a wave of press coverage, leading Mr Hussain to create a Twitter account -AdvoCat_QC,external- chronicling his exploits. Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs. ""While it may be a bit different from the last time you visited, together we can find new ways to create magical moments togetherâand memories to treasure forever,"" the company is telling potential visitors on its website.

state of emergency curbs expire on schedule on Sunday, less than five months before the postponed Tokyo Olympics are due to begin. ""The figures have moved in the direction of lifting (the
emergency measures),"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""I will make a final decision towards ending the curbs after
listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.00021515158
"The death of Sarah Everard has triggered conversations about women's safety The government has said it will ""on an experimental basis"" ask the police to record crimes of violence motivated by a person's sex or gender. The announcement is a concession to campaigners who have been calling for misogyny to be made a hate crime. Women's groups have argued this would help provide ""critical data"" on violence against women and girls. The Law Commission has carried out a review of hate crime legislation. It is expected to make its official recommendations to the government in 2021. Women 'should be protected' under hate crime laws Hate crimes recorded by police up 10% How many attacks on women are there? Home Office Minister Baroness Williams said the change would ""inform longer term decisions"" while the government awaited the outcome of the commission's review. The Labour MP Stella Creasy said it represented ""success"" for those who'd been campaigning on the issue, adding that changes to legislation were needed to make sure such crimes could be prosecuted.

A hate crime is deemed to have been committed when someone is assaulted or harassed because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. Seven police forces in England and Wales have already introduced their own misogyny hate crime policy - including Nottinghamshire Police. An evaluation of the policy in Nottinghamshire saidthe move had led to ""shifting attitudes as a result"". However others have urged caution including minister Victoria Atkins who said in 2018 that: ""Women are not a minority, and I would be hesitant to put us forward as one."" Speaking in the House of Lords, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams said ""On an experimental basis we will ask police forces to record and identify any crimes of violence against the person including stalking and harassment, and sexual offences where the victim perceives it to have been motivated by a hostility based on their sex"". She said data collection would ""help us find solutions"" to the problem of violence against women and girls. However she added it was important ""to ensure the law itself is coherent"".

The Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April. The Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a ""cautious"" return a week earlier, from 26 March. The four churches voluntarily suspended in-person gatherings in January of this year because of the coronavirus lockdown.

David Downes started out creating pictures of giant cells looming in the sky, but different themes emerged in his work as the past year ran its course. This video can not be played More than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield from the coronavirus from 1 April. It comes as the numbers of Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have declined for the past couple of weeks. Letters will be sent out to those in the clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm the move. In them, people will still be advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people. Since 5 January, they have been asked to stay at home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed to the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier confirmed the shielding guidance, which had been extended to 31 March, would indeed end then. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries recommended the change based on the latest scientific evidence and advice. Read more here. The fall in hospital cases is one of the factors behind the end of shielding Naomi GrimleyBBC News The lead investigator for the AstraZeneca vaccine trials in South Africa has said it was âextremely devastatingâ and âmind-bogglingâ that his country put the rollout of the vaccine on hold, even though his own research led to the government making the decision. Prof Shabir Madhiâs study into whether the vaccine worked against the South African variant found it offered âminimal protectionâ against mild forms of the disease. But he says the study was âmisinterpretedâ by officials and the vaccine could still be useful to protect against more severe forms of the disease in vulnerable people. Heâs also warning European governments against an âover-reactionâ over blood clot reports. Several European countries have paused the rollout of the vaccine, despite the the European Medicines Agency saying there is ""no indication"" the jab causes blood clots. Prof Madhi said: âWhen countries start interrupting their vaccination programmes that itself might lend an opportunity for the virus to start mutating and become resistant to the immune responses which have been induced by the vaccine.â He says governments need to be careful about making decisions that are hard to reverse because they can âdiminish public confidence in the rollout of all vaccines"". South Africa is currently thinking about selling its 1.5 million doses of the AZ vaccine to the African Union. They expire in April. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic.

"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

General Secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland the Reverend Dr Heather Morris said churches could make a ""careful"" return to services, adding ""this will allow time for preparation to celebrate the major Christian festival of Easter"". Presbyterian churches may also resume services on that date, but it will be up to individual congregations when they return, and will require ""all the mitigations in place to ensure the safety of people,"" the church said.

It comes as the numbers of Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have declined for the past couple of weeks. Letters will be sent out to those in the clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm the move. In them, people will still be advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people.

Prof Shabir Madhiâs study into whether the vaccine worked against the South African variant found it offered âminimal protectionâ against mild forms of the disease. But he says the study was âmisinterpretedâ by officials and the vaccine could still be useful to protect against more severe forms of the disease in vulnerable people. Heâs also warning European governments against an âover-reactionâ over blood clot reports. Several European countries have paused the rollout of the vaccine, despite the the European Medicines Agency saying there is ""no indication"" the jab causes blood clots. Prof Madhi said: âWhen countries start interrupting their vaccination programmes that itself might lend an opportunity for the virus to start mutating and become resistant to the immune responses which have been induced by the vaccine.â He says governments need to be careful about making decisions that are hard to reverse because they can âdiminish public confidence in the rollout of all vaccines"". South Africa is currently thinking about selling its 1.5 million doses of the AZ vaccine to the African Union. They expire in April. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic. But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns.

We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs.

state of emergency curbs expire on schedule on Sunday, less than five months before the postponed Tokyo Olympics are due to begin. ""The figures have moved in the direction of lifting (the
emergency measures),"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""I will make a final decision towards ending the curbs after
listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9998098
"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccine supply is ""always lumpy, but we're on course"" The NHS has warned of a ""significant reduction in the weekly supply"" of Covid vaccines in England next month in a letter to local health organisations. The letter says there has been a ""reduction in national inbound vaccines supply"" and asks organisations to ""ensure no further appointments are uploaded"" to booking systems in April. The health secretary said it was a ""standard"" letter. The BBC understands no-one who has booked a vaccine should lose a slot. Asked about it during a Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said the NHS regularly sent out ""technical letters"" that explained the ""ups and downs"" of supply. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there would be fewer AstraZeneca vaccines than expected because of issues with the company's international supply. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood that the vaccine supply issue related to a consignment from a manufacturer in India, with half of the order delayed by four weeks. Allow Twitter content?

A spokesperson for the AstraZeneca said: ""Our UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule."" We were always warned supply was fragile - and these developments are a reminder of that. The UK has its own plants that are supplying one to two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine each week. There are also stocks coming from Pfizer's Belgium plant - these would be the ones that would be susceptible to any restrictions on exports the EU is threatening. The Indian supplies were supposed to give the UK the ""bumper"" end to March, allowing the government to push ahead with vaccination of the under-50s within weeks. This has now been put on hold, given significant numbers will need their second doses from the start of next month. The government is still on track to hit its target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July. By late Spring the first doses of Moderna - the third vaccine to have been approved in the UK - should start arriving. But the delay to the second shipment from India means rollout is going to take a little longer than hoped at the start of this week. The letter from the NHS in England says that ""over this next period it is vital"" that health organisations focus on vaccinating those in thepriority groups one to nine, who are most vulnerable to coronavirus,external. It advises vaccination services to work with local authorities, voluntary community and faith organisations ""to put in place reserve lists"" of people eligible for the vaccine - as well as targeting areas of lower uptake. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Shielding advice to end on 1 April - Hancock The NHS says vaccination centres and community pharmacy-led services should close unfilled bookings from the week commencing 29 March. Earlier, it was announced thatalmost half of British adults have received their first doseof a coronavirus vaccine - more than 25 million people. Around 1.7 million people have also had a second dose. During Wednesday's briefing, Mr Hancock said the UK was ""ahead of schedule"" to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April. He also reiterated a commitment to ensuring that all adults in the UK are offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam encouraged people to get a vaccine when offered one Speaking alongside the health secretary, Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said ""every day we vaccinate more people we are preventing more deaths"". And England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was ""no evidence"" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine causes an ""increased risk"" of blood clots. The EU's medicines regulator has said it remains ""firmly convinced"" that the benefits of the  jab outweigh the risks,after several leading EU states paused their rollouts. Prof Van-Tam added that all medicines have both side effects and benefits, and listed some of the rare side effects of paracetamol as examples, pointing out that most people had no issue with taking it. BBC politics correspondent Jonathan Blake said the hold-up would have an impact on the momentum of the vaccine rollout and possibly the government's targets. Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthtweeted that,externalpeople ""across the country"" would be ""anxious and worried"" about the news of delays. ""Matt Hancock must explain what the issue is with supply and what efforts are being made to resolve them,"" he added. EU warns UK over Covid vaccine exports On Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that if Covid vaccine supplies in Europe do not improve, the EU ""will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate"". The EU and the UK have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the export of the vaccines, exacerbated by post-Brexit disagreements. Also during the briefing, Mr Hancock confirmed thatshielding guidance in England would end on 31 March- meaning that more than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard.,externalA further 5,758 people have tested positive.

Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,9.205577e-05
"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said vaccine supply is ""always lumpy, but we're on course"" The NHS has warned of a ""significant reduction in the weekly supply"" of Covid vaccines in England next month in a letter to local health organisations. The letter says there has been a ""reduction in national inbound vaccines supply"" and asks organisations to ""ensure no further appointments are uploaded"" to booking systems in April. The health secretary said it was a ""standard"" letter. The BBC understands no-one who has booked a vaccine should lose a slot. Asked about it during a Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said the NHS regularly sent out ""technical letters"" that explained the ""ups and downs"" of supply. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there would be fewer AstraZeneca vaccines than expected because of issues with the company's international supply. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood that the vaccine supply issue related to a consignment from a manufacturer in India, with half of the order delayed by four weeks. Allow Twitter content?

A spokesperson for the AstraZeneca said: ""Our UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule."" We were always warned supply was fragile - and these developments are a reminder of that. The UK has its own plants that are supplying one to two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine each week. There are also stocks coming from Pfizer's Belgium plant - these would be the ones that would be susceptible to any restrictions on exports the EU is threatening. The Indian supplies were supposed to give the UK the ""bumper"" end to March, allowing the government to push ahead with vaccination of the under-50s within weeks. This has now been put on hold, given significant numbers will need their second doses from the start of next month. The government is still on track to hit its target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July. By late Spring the first doses of Moderna - the third vaccine to have been approved in the UK - should start arriving. But the delay to the second shipment from India means rollout is going to take a little longer than hoped at the start of this week. The letter from the NHS in England says that ""over this next period it is vital"" that health organisations focus on vaccinating those in thepriority groups one to nine, who are most vulnerable to coronavirus,external. It advises vaccination services to work with local authorities, voluntary community and faith organisations ""to put in place reserve lists"" of people eligible for the vaccine - as well as targeting areas of lower uptake. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Shielding advice to end on 1 April - Hancock The NHS says vaccination centres and community pharmacy-led services should close unfilled bookings from the week commencing 29 March. Earlier, it was announced thatalmost half of British adults have received their first doseof a coronavirus vaccine - more than 25 million people. Around 1.7 million people have also had a second dose. During Wednesday's briefing, Mr Hancock said the UK was ""ahead of schedule"" to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April. He also reiterated a commitment to ensuring that all adults in the UK are offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July. This video can not be played Prof Jonathan Van-Tam encouraged people to get a vaccine when offered one Speaking alongside the health secretary, Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said ""every day we vaccinate more people we are preventing more deaths"". And England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was ""no evidence"" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine causes an ""increased risk"" of blood clots. The EU's medicines regulator has said it remains ""firmly convinced"" that the benefits of the  jab outweigh the risks,after several leading EU states paused their rollouts. Prof Van-Tam added that all medicines have both side effects and benefits, and listed some of the rare side effects of paracetamol as examples, pointing out that most people had no issue with taking it. BBC politics correspondent Jonathan Blake said the hold-up would have an impact on the momentum of the vaccine rollout and possibly the government's targets. Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworthtweeted that,externalpeople ""across the country"" would be ""anxious and worried"" about the news of delays. ""Matt Hancock must explain what the issue is with supply and what efforts are being made to resolve them,"" he added. EU warns UK over Covid vaccine exports On Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that if Covid vaccine supplies in Europe do not improve, the EU ""will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate"". The EU and the UK have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the export of the vaccines, exacerbated by post-Brexit disagreements. Also during the briefing, Mr Hancock confirmed thatshielding guidance in England would end on 31 March- meaning that more than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard.,externalA further 5,758 people have tested positive.

"People aged 50 and over in England are now being invited to book their appointment for a Covid vaccine. This is the final group on the priority list, which covers 99% of those at high risk of dying from Covid-19. Everyone in the top nine priority groups should be offered a second dose by mid-July, up to 12 weeks after the first. Nearly half of the UK adult population has had one vaccine dose - more than 25 million people. Around 1.7 million people have also had a second dose. In Northern Ireland and some areas of Scotland, the over-50s are already being offered a Covid vaccine. Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April. In total, the number of people who have had one vaccine dose is: More than 21 million in England About 1.9 million in Scotland About 1.1 million in Wales More than 640,000 in Northern Ireland The number of vaccines given this week in the UK isexpected to top four million- nearly double what has been achieved per week recently - thanks to a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? My vaccine side effects and what they mean This could mean all those aged 50 and over will be offered one dose by the end of March, putting the NHS rollout two weeks ahead of schedule. After that, the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated, with people prioritised by age. All adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccineby the end of July. It is 100 days sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to be vaccinated against Covidoutside of clinical trials. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I'm determined no-one should miss out on the chance to protect themselves and urge everyone who is eligible to come forward."" Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS England's primary care director, said vaccine supplies would go up and down over the next few months linked to manufacturers' ability to supply their jabs. ""But this week and next we have larger supplies, so we want anyone in the top priority groups - people aged 50 and older as well as those working in health and care and anyone with an underlying health condition - to come forward soon to protect themselves and their loved ones,"" she said. Two million text messages are being sent out to those aged 50-54 in England with a link allowing people to book an appointment throughthe national booking service website,external. People who cannot go online can call the service on 119. The expansion of the Covid vaccine rollout comes after government reassurance that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - one of two being given to people in the UK - was safe, after 13 countries paused their use of it. Expect a surge in vaccinations in the next week or so. Extra supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine have arrived from abroad to supplement existing stocks. The target to offer a vaccine to all those aged 50 and over by mid-April will almost certainly be met ahead of schedule. It will then be the turn of younger adults. The progress means the UK is easing restrictions as parts of Europe face new waves of infection. Concerns have been raised about safety of the AstraZeneca jab - the European regulator is investigating cases of blood clots, focusing on a rare type that affects the brain. Evidence from 10 million doses given in the UK show there have been three cases - none fatal. This is not above the level you would expect to happen normally, suggesting coincidence rather than cause. In Germany the numbers are higher - but because these events are so rare, it's easy for a couple of cases to raise alarm. It's understandable they are being investigated, but what has baffled experts is why some nations have paused rollout in the meantime. After all, this vaccine saves lives. That's why authorities here say it's safe and even the European regulator says vaccination should continue. The EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of rare blood clots in a tiny number of vaccinated people on Thursday. But the UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, and Downing Street has said there is no evidence to suggest the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is linked to the clots. Mr Hancock urged people to ""listen to the regulators"" and to ""get the jab"" as soon as they got the opportunity. A vaccine safety panel of the World Health Organization said it was ""carefully assessing the latest available data"" for the vaccine but, in the meantime, recommended that vaccinations should continue. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according tothe government's coronavirus dashboard.,externalA further 5,758 people tested positive.

"Police outside a spa on Piedmont Road in Atlanta Eight people, many of them women of Asian descent, have been killed in shootings at spas in the US state of Georgia. Police say the shootings took place at a massage parlour in Acworth, a suburb north of Atlanta, and two spas in the city itself. South Korea later confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent. Officials say a 21-year-old man was arrested and is suspected of involvement in all of the attacks. No motive has yet been established, but there are fears the crimes may have deliberately targeted people of Asian descent. Hate crimes against Asian-Americans spiked in recent months, fuelled by rhetoric that blames them for the spread of Covid-19. In an address last week, President Joe Biden condemned ""vicious hate crimes against Asian-Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated."" The first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County. Two people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Jay Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded. Less than an hour later, police were called to a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. ""Upon arrival, officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds,"" police said. While there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead. Police quoted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said all four Atlanta victims were Asian women. Investigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta. Robert Aaron Long was taken into custody Capt Baker said investigators were ""very confident"" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. The identities of the victims have not yet been made public. Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. Authorities say it is too early in the investigation to know if the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, said it was not clear ""whether or not the shootings were related or motivated by hate. But right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian-American community that must be addressed"". It called the shootings ""an unspeakable tragedy"" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has ""been reeling from high levels of racist attacks"". From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise ""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that she had been in communication with the White House. Ben Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: ""Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism."" Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta Atlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked. The New York Police Department's counter-terrorism branch said that while there was no known connection to New York city, it would ""be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the city out of an abundance of caution"". The police department in Seattle also said it would increase patrols and outreach to support its Asian-American community. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: ""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. ""We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,"" he said. ""We will stand up for the right of our fellow Americans, Korean Americans, to be safe, to be treated with dignity."" The White House said Mr Biden had been briefed on the ""horrific"" shootings. In 2018, Asians made up 28% of the US foreign-born population The figure represents a large increase from the 4% recorded in 1960 Starting in 2010, more Asian than Hispanics immigrants have arrived in the US each year They represent the fastest growing racial or ethnic segment of the US electorate, with more than 11m people eligible to vote in the last presidential election As of 2015, nearly 5m Chinese, 4m Indians and 1.9m Vietnamese, 1.8m Korean and 1.4m Japanese - as well as millions more who descend from more than 20 Asian countries - were living in the US Data compiled by the Pew Research Center This video can not be played Tracy Win Liu says she bought a gun after being faced with coronavirus-related racism From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"The hospitality industry is being ""scapegoated"" by the government as it moves to ease lockdown restrictions, business owners have said. First MinisterNicola Sturgeon has announced a planwhich will see hairdressers and garden centres allowed to reopen from 5 April. All shops, gyms and tourist accommodation can return from 26 April. But indoor hospitality including pubs, restaurants and wedding venues will still face some restrictions. Ms Sturgeon confirmed on Tuesday that cafes and restaurants will be able to open outdoors until 22:00 from 26 April and sell alcohol. However, indoor hospitality can only open until 20:00, alcohol will not be allowed and people must meet in groups of up to four people from two households. Alan Henderson, of the McGinty's group which runs pubs, restaurants and a hotel in Aberdeen, accused the government of double standards. Hairdressers to open on 5 April as Scots rules ease What Covid rules are changing, and when? What will Scotland's new Covid levels look like? He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme:  ""It is the one industry again that has been scapegoated. There are restrictions which are unnecessary. ""We keep getting told it's based on data rather than dates, but when they don't have the data they still pick on our industry. ""The hospitality industry is happy to stick to the data - but unfortunately the Scottish government is not."" Up to 50 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals under the new plans. Wedding venues will continue to face some restrictions However, Duncan McConchie of the Wedding Industry Alliance said a continued ban on alcohol sales would ""turn venue owners into police"". He said: ""People will drink, but they will go to their cars and drink. They will go to the toilets and drink. ""Whereas, if we are allowed to sell alcohol, we are then in charge of the alcohol that those guests consume."" Mr McConchie said the industry was ""broadly accepting and happy"" with Tuesday's announcements, ""but the devil is in the detail that comes back to bite us"". Julia Eeeles, who owns The One Lounge hairdressing and beauty salon in Glasgow, said partial reopening without allowing for beauty treatments would leave her worse off. ""The problem for me - and I think there will be a lot of beauty salons like this - is that I've got two hairdressers but 10 other members of staff. ""So I am actually under financial strain having to open up just for two people. ""It means I have to run the salon, run reception and use all my gas and electricity. It doesn't help me as a business owner."" Ms Sturgeon also announced that the ""stay at home"" lockdown order will be lifted from 5 April. People will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland. All children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April. The first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including ""a significant majority of Scotland's adult population"" - by mid-April. She said this would ""give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April"". It is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date. Other changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises. But Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like ""normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs"" - would involve ""plucking it out of thin air"".

"Several countries have pushed for the digital certificates to help revive the tourism industry A digital certificate to kick-start foreign travel should be given to citizens across the EU ""without discrimination"", officials say. The aim is to enable anyone vaccinated against Covid-19, or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the EU. The 27 member states will decide how to use the new digital certificate. Vaccine passports have faced opposition from some EU member states over concerns they might be discriminatory. Some argue that they would enable a minority to enjoy foreign travel without restrictions while others, such as young people who are not seen as a priority for inoculation, continue to face measures such as quarantine. European Commission officials have made clear they want to avoid discrimination. P&O Cruises says travellers will need vaccinations British Airways plans app-based travel pass Europe in vaccine race to save summer Another issue raised has been that data on the efficacy of vaccines in preventing a person from carrying or passing on the virus is incomplete. Ahead of the EU's announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was working to ""create an international trusted framework"" for safe travel, but that vaccinations should not be a condition. Separately, European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen has threatened to withhold exporting vaccines to the UKand any other countries outside the EU that do not supply doses in a reciprocal way. ""We're still waiting for doses to come from the UK,"" she said. ""So, this is an invitation to show us that there are also doses from the UK coming to the European Union."" Speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said the proposed digital green certificate would be ""for all EU citizens, their families when they're leaving the EU or living abroad"". ""It'll also be for the European Economic Area (EEA), because we want to work with Norway and Iceland,"" he said, adding that Switzerland would also be involved. Mr Reynders said there was still a lot to do to put the digital certificate in place, but the aim was to get it up and running before the summer tourist season. The European Commission proposal sets out that any EU member state permitting vaccinated travellers to bypass restrictions such as quarantine must accept certificates from other states within the bloc under the same conditions. The vaccines should be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). These currently include drugs developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, but not Russia's Sputnik V or China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. However, the proposal adds that the guidelines ""should not prevent member states from deciding to accept vaccination certificates issued for other Covid-19 vaccines"". Vaccine pause hits Europe rollout as Covid cases rise Is the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine safe? Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Meanwhile, in the UK, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was looking at the idea of vaccine passports and had been ""discussing what the best way to proceed is"". ""We are having debates, discussions about travel... but I think what we also have to do is be driven by the data, we've got to see how coronavirus develops,"" he told the BBC. More than a third of the UK population - nearly 25 million people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine in the UK, which is no longer a member of the European Union. The rollout across the EU has been slower, and has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the currentsuspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccineover fears of possible side effects. The economies of countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy are unlikely to recover until the tourist industry is reopened, and they have been looking at ways to save the summer season while providing a safe environment for both travellers and local residents. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Wednesday welcomed the planned certificate, which he said would ""significantly facilitate the movement of citizens and will help boost tourism and the economies that rely heavily on it"". Last month, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos said that a common digital certificate was ""not discriminatory"", and that non-vaccinated tourists could also visit Greece this summer - but the procedure for them would be slower as they would have to be tested and might have to self-isolate on arrival. This video can not be played Greece: Covid vaccine certificate is 'not discriminatory' A hotel manager in the Spanish resort of Benidorm, Ricardo SÃ¡nchez, told the BBC that the UK was its most important market, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, and people arriving from Eastern Europe.

"This video can not be played 'An absolutely monumental day' - abuse survivor Gary Cliffe ""Significant institutional failings"" by the Football Association meant it ""did not do enough to keep children safe"" - according to the findings of an independent review into historical child sexual abuse in the game. It found the FA was ""too slow"" to have sufficient protection measures in place between October 1995 and May 2000. It said there was no evidence the FA knew of a problem before summer 1995. The report focused on the abuse of children between 1970 and 2005. It said: ""The FA acted far too slowly to introduce appropriate and sufficient child protection measures, and to ensure that safeguarding was taken sufficiently seriously by those involved in the game. These are significant institutional failings for which there is no excuse."" Football's child sex abuse scandal - a timeline Survivors say game 'must learn from mistakes' In a statement, FA chief executive Mark Bullingham offered ""a heartfelt apology"" from the English game's governing body to all survivors and added there was ""no excuse"" for its failings. ""No child should ever have experienced the abuse you did,"" he continued in an address to those affected. ""What you went through was horrific and it is deeply upsetting that more was not done by the game at the time, to give you the protection you deserved."" The long-awaited 710-page review, led by Clive Sheldon QC and commissioned by the FA in 2016, found: Following high-profile convictions of child sexual abusers from the summer of 1995 until May 2000, the FA ""could and should have done more to keep children safe"". There was a significant delay by the FA in putting in place sufficient child protection measures in football at that time. In that period, the FA ""did not do enough"" to keep children safe and ""child protection was not regarded as an urgent priority"". Even after May 2000, when the FA launched a comprehensive child protection policy and programme, ""mistakes were still made"" by the FA. The FA failed to ban two of the most notorious perpetrators of child sexual abuse, Barry Bennell and Bob Higgins, from involvement in football. There were known to be at least 240 suspects and 692 survivors, yet relatively few people reported abuse and the actual level was likely to be far higher. Where incidents of abuse were reported to people in authority at football clubs, their responses were ""rarely competent or appropriate"". Abuse within football was ""not commonplace"". The overwhelming majority of young people were able to engage in football safely. While several of the perpetrators knew each other, there was not evidence of a ""paedophile ring"" in football - Sheldon says: ""I do not consider that perpetrators shared boys with one another for sexual purposes, or shared information with one another that would have facilitated child sexual abuse."" Sheldon, whose review made 13 safeguarding recommendations, said: ""Understanding and acknowledging the appalling abuse suffered by young players in the period covered by the review is important for its own sake. ""Survivors deserve to be listened to, and their suffering deserves to be properly recognised. As well as recognising and facing up to what happened in the past, it is also important that this terrible history is not repeated, and that everything possible is done now to safeguard the current and future generations of young players."" Bullingham said the report was ""a very important piece of work"" made possible by ""survivors bravely"" coming forward. He added that ""today is a dark day for the beautiful game"" and a ""critical moment"" for English football, which he admitted had been ""too slow to act"". ""We must acknowledge the mistakes of the past and ensure that we do everything possible to prevent them being repeated,"" he continued. ""Thankfully there have been huge strides in safeguarding in sport and football over the past two decades, and the report recognises that English football is in a very different place today."" Andy Woodward (left), Chris Unsworth (second left), Steve Walters (right) and Gary Cliffe (second right) spoke candidly about their experiences on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in 2018 On 16 November 2016, former footballerAndy Woodwardwaived his right to anonymity to talk about how he was sexually abused by Bennell at Crewe Alexandra from the age of 11 to 15. Several other people contacted police in the following days, before former England and Tottenham player Paul Stewart said he was abused as a child by a coach, later named as Frank Roper. Children's charity the NSPCC set up a hotline with the FA, dedicated to footballers who had experienced sexual abuse - more than 860 calls were received in the first week. After investigations involving several police forces started, the FA announced an independent inquiry into non-recent child sex abuse, led by Sheldon. The independent review made its first call for evidence in January 2017, writing to all football clubs in England and Wales, amateur and professional, asking for information about allegations between 1970 and 2005. Sheldon's review said the FA was not aware that abuse had actually occurred in football prior to the summer of 1995, before Bennell had been convicted in Florida in connection with a football-related tour. The report found the provision of child protection guidance was ""not something which was happening widely within sport"". Barry Bennell has been convicted five times and is serving a 34-year sentence Barry Bennell- the former Crewe Alexandra and Manchester City coach isserving a 34-year sentenceafter being convicted of child sexual abuse five times. He has been convicted of sexual abuse against 22 boys in total, although it is believed more than 100 victims have come forward to say they were abused by Bennell. George Ormond- the former Newcastle youth coach was jailed in 2002 for six years after being found guilty of abusing seven boys under 16 between 1975 and 1999. Other victims subsequently came forward andOrmond was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2018after being found guilty of 36 counts of sexual abuse against 18 victims between 1973 and 1998. Eddie Heath- Chelsea announced in November 2016 they were investigating allegations of sexual abuse by former chief scout Heath, who died in 1983. Evidence from 23 witnesses detailed how Heath groomed and abused young boys aged 10 to 17 in the 1970s. An external review saidsome adults at Chelsea must have been aware of Heath's abusebut ""turned a blind eye"". Chelsea apologised unreservedly after the review was published in 2019. Bob Higgins- the former Southampton and Peterborough youth coach wasjailed for 24 years and three months in 2019on 45 counts of indecent assault against 24 boys. Higgins went on trial in the early 1990s but was acquitted. Multiple former players came forward with allegations of abuse by Higgins in 2016 and 2017. Michael 'Kit' Carson- the 75-year-oldkilled himself by crashing into a treeon the first day of his trial in 2019. He was accused of sexually abusing boys under 16, from 1978 to 2009. Carson had worked for Peterborough United, Cambridge United and Norwich City. Ted Langford- the former Aston Villa and Leicester City part-time scout was jailed in 2007 for the sexual abuse of four boys between 1976 and 1989. Frank Roper- worked as a scout in the north west of England. Roper, who died in 2005, sexuallyabused young footballerswhile recruiting players to Blackpool's school of excellence. Phil Edwards- former Watford physio who died in 2019 while on bail for an alleged child sex offence. Hertfordshire police were subsequently contacted by16 people who made complaints about Edwards. Andy Woodward- was abused by Bennell as a junior Crewe player from the ages of 11 to 15. He told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethe abuse had a ""catastrophic"" impact on his life. Chris Unsworth- the ex-Manchester City youth player was abused by Bennell from the age of nine. Unsworthtold the BBChe had been ""raped between 50 and 100 times"". Steve Walters- was abused by Bennell and said it began at the age of 12 when he would stay at the former coach's house in the town during the school holidays. Hetold the BBCthe abuse was ""absolutely petrifying"". Paul Stewart-  the former Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool player was abusedby Roper,externaldaily for four years up to the age of 15. ""He was threatening that he would kill my parents and my two brothers if I ever spoke out. I was just absolutely frightened,""Stewart told the BBC. Paul Collins -played briefly for Charlton Athletic and was groomed by Heath with free boots and holidays. The trauma Collins suffered led to him quitting the game early in his career.Watch the interview here. Gary Johnson- the ex-Chelsea player joined the club as an 11-year-old in 1970 and said he had been groomed by Heath from the age of 13. Hesaid the club paid him a Â£50,000settlement that included a confidentiality clause. David Eatock- the former Newcastle United player told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshireshow he had been groomed by Ormond from the ages of 18 to 21. He said he ""froze"" with fear during an assault in Ormond's van. Tony Brien- said he was abused by Langford from the age of 12 when he was playing for a local youth team Dunlop Terriers in the early 1980s - a feeder team for Leicester and Aston Villa. Former Villa manager Graham Taylor isalleged to have discouraged Brienfrom going public with his allegations. Taylor died in January 2017. The report said that for much of the period the review covered: club staff and officials were generally unaware of child protection issues; they were not trained in child protection issues; they did not identify or respond to signs of potential abuse; and if they were aware of the signs, they did not examine them with curiosity or suspicion. In March 2019,Manchester Cityset upa multi-million pound compensation schemefor victims of historical child sexual abuse carried out by former coaches. The report said that City senior management were aware of rumours and concerns about Bennell's conduct in the early 1980s. It added: ""The club did not investigate these rumours. It should have done so. The club should also have investigated the arrangements for boys staying at Bennell's house."" Man City's child sexual abuse response was 'wholly inadequate' City commissioned an independent review in November 2016, led by Jane Mulcahy QC, that was also published on Wednesday. In addition to personal apologies made by the club to survivors, City said its board of directors wished to ""apologise publicly and unreservedly for the unimaginable suffering experienced by those who were abused as a result of the club's association"" with Bennell and two other convicted abusers, John Broome and Bill Toner. It added: ""The club also extends its heartfelt regret and sympathy to the multiple family members and friends affected by these traumatic events, the ramifications of which are felt by so many to the present day and will continue to be felt for a long time to come."" Crewe Alexandrahave reiterated they werenot aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell,externaluntil 1994 when he was convicted of sexual assault, and did not receive a single complaint about sexual abuse by him. The Sheldon report said: ""It is likely that three directors of Crewe Alexandra FC discussed concerns about Bennell which hinted at his sexual interest in children. ""There is no evidence that the advice of a senior police officer to the club's former chairman to keep a 'watching brief' on Bennell was heeded. ""The club should also have ensured that there were appropriate arrangements in place for boys staying overnight at Bennell's house. ""The boys should have been spoken to periodically to check that they were being properly cared for. Had such steps been taken, this might have led to boys making disclosures to the club."" Sheldon said former Crewe manager Dario Gradi ""should have done more"" to investigate concerns about Bennell but was not involved in a cover up. Gradi, who has always denied any wrongdoing, is also criticised in the report for not doing more when a claim of abuse by Heath was reported to him while assistant manager at Chelsea in 1975. The report states that Gradi ""did not consider a person putting their hands down another's trousers to be an assault"", but that he changed his mind after Sheldon insisted it was. Gradi, 79, wassuspended in 2016pending an FA investigation and retired from his position of director of football at Crewethree years later. Bullingham said on Wednesday that Gradi was ""effectively banned for life"" from football but could not go into the reasons. The FA's director of legal and governance Polly Handford said it was ""for safeguarding reasons"" but that was ""as far as we can go"". Stoke Citywere ""also aware of rumours about Bennell"" during his time associated with the club in the early 1990s, said the report, and steps should have been taken to monitor his activities. Premier League clubsAston Villa and Leicester paid damagesto five victims of Langford in March 2020. The report saidAston Villashould have reported disclosures about sexual abuse by Langford to the police when his role as a scout was terminated in July 1989. And on Wednesday,Southamptonadmitted ""considerable failings""and said they were ""deeply sorry"" to young footballers abused by Higgins. The report found Southampton andPeterborough United FCwere also aware of rumours about the inappropriate behaviour of Higgins, and were aware that boys were staying at his home. ""This awareness should have resulted in greater monitoring by the clubs. Had Higgins been properly monitored this might have prevented some of his abuse of young players,"" the report added. AtChelsea, in relation to Heath, the Sheldon report said steps should have been taken to protect the young player who had made a disclosure about abuse in or around 1975. Newcastle Unitedshould have acted more quickly following disclosures of abuse by Ormond at the youth club Monty's in early 1997. Ormond was only removed from the club many months later, and after he had been permitted to travel abroad with young players. The report found that despite being aware of the allegations, no additional safeguards were put in place by the club. In a statement, Newcastle expressed their ""sincere apologies and sympathy to all individuals affected by historic abuse in football and commend the bravery of those who have come forward and shared their stories"". The club added that they now have ""comprehensive and robust safeguarding measures in place to protect and support young people throughout the football club"". Among Sheldon's recommendations are the introduction of safeguarding training at several levels in the game, including all players and young people as well as the FA board and senior management team. He also recommends there should be safeguarding officers employed by all Premier League and English Football League (EFL) clubs. Both league governing bodies say they and associated clubs have safeguarding leads at board level, as well as dedicated safeguarding staff. The Premier League said it accepted the report's ""findings and insight it provides"", and added the recommendations ""will further strengthen safeguarding arrangements across the game"" as ""there is no room for complacency"". The EFL also said it accepted the advice and would work with the FA, clubs and other stakeholders ""to ensure [the recommendations] are implemented as a minimum [standard], where they have not been already"". Both the Premier League and EFL said they were ""well placed to meet all the recommendations"" and that the findings would inform a review of safeguarding governance, support and awareness arrangements. The Offside Trust, the organisation set up by survivors of child sexual abuse in sport, said the recommendations were ""blindingly obvious to anyone"" after the scandal broke in 2016. It added it was ""disappointed not to see anything stronger in terms of mandatory reporting"" and it would have liked to have ""seen more on wealthy clubs supporting grassroots safeguarding"". Julian KnightMP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said: ""The failure of the FA to keep children safe is truly shocking. ""There can be no excuses for the critical delays to act or provide guidance to those working on child protection. We could be looking at the biggest safeguarding scandal in football's history."" Former Manchester City junior playerGary Cliffewas among the survivors of Bennell's abuse. He said the ex-coachabused him hundreds of timesbetween the ages of 11 and 15. Cliffe told BBC Sport this was an ""absolutely monumental day"" because of of the publication of the findings. ""It matters so much because it's impacted on my life and numerous other people's lives,"" he added. ""We are hoping and looking for answers and culpability within that report."" But Cliffe said he was disappointed with the suggestions in the report that suspicions of abuse were not acted upon. ""I don't think he's gone far enough,"" he said. ""Throughout the whole report that I've read, there's a theme that people knew or suspected, but none of the officials had the gumption to raise it with anyone - police, social services - anyone at all. ""It's a theme running through it, so it's disappointing from that respect."" Ian Ackleywas a youth player when he was abused and raped by Bennell over a four-year period. Now working as an abuse survivor support advocate for the Professional Footballers' Association, he said it would be ""naive"" to believe abuse had been eradicated. ""Make sure your children are safe,"" he said. ""Don't assume that just because someone has got a badge, whistle or tracksuit that they're OK to leave your children with."" Former England internationalPaul Stewart,who was abused by Roper, told BBC News that there were ""suspicions and rumours"" of abuse, but they were ""totally ignored"". ""It caused a lot of survivors a lot of damage as we got on through adult life,"" he added. ""I don't think the report has shown how damaging the effects of abuse have been to individuals. ""We have to make sure we don't get complacent and the abuse doesn't happen again.""

The Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April. The Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a ""cautious"" return a week earlier, from 26 March. The four churches voluntarily suspended in-person gatherings in January of this year because of the coronavirus lockdown. General Secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland the Reverend Dr Heather Morris said churches could make a ""careful"" return to services, adding ""this will allow time for preparation to celebrate the major Christian festival of Easter"". Presbyterian churches may also resume services on that date, but it will be up to individual congregations when they return, and will require ""all the mitigations in place to ensure the safety of people,"" the church said. In a statement,external, the bishops of the Church of Ireland in Northern Ireland said the time had come for a ""cautious and careful"" reopening. An autistic artist says painting has helped him cope with the stresses of the coronavirus pandemic. David Downes started out creating pictures of giant cells looming in the sky, but different themes emerged in his work as the past year ran its course. This video can not be played More than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield from the coronavirus from 1 April. It comes as the numbers of Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have declined for the past couple of weeks. Letters will be sent out to those in the clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm the move. In them, people will still be advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people. Since 5 January, they have been asked to stay at home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed to the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier confirmed the shielding guidance, which had been extended to 31 March, would indeed end then. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries recommended the change based on the latest scientific evidence and advice. Read more here. The fall in hospital cases is one of the factors behind the end of shielding Naomi GrimleyBBC News The lead investigator for the AstraZeneca vaccine trials in South Africa has said it was âextremely devastatingâ and âmind-bogglingâ that his country put the rollout of the vaccine on hold, even though his own research led to the government making the decision. Prof Shabir Madhiâs study into whether the vaccine worked against the South African variant found it offered âminimal protectionâ against mild forms of the disease. But he says the study was âmisinterpretedâ by officials and the vaccine could still be useful to protect against more severe forms of the disease in vulnerable people. Heâs also warning European governments against an âover-reactionâ over blood clot reports. Several European countries have paused the rollout of the vaccine, despite the the European Medicines Agency saying there is ""no indication"" the jab causes blood clots. Prof Madhi said: âWhen countries start interrupting their vaccination programmes that itself might lend an opportunity for the virus to start mutating and become resistant to the immune responses which have been induced by the vaccine.â He says governments need to be careful about making decisions that are hard to reverse because they can âdiminish public confidence in the rollout of all vaccines"". South Africa is currently thinking about selling its 1.5 million doses of the AZ vaccine to the African Union. They expire in April. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic. But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns.

We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs. ""While it may be a bit different from the last time you visited, together we can find new ways to create magical moments togetherâand memories to treasure forever,"" the company is telling potential visitors on its website.

state of emergency curbs expire on schedule on Sunday, less than five months before the postponed Tokyo Olympics are due to begin. ""The figures have moved in the direction of lifting (the
emergency measures),"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""I will make a final decision towards ending the curbs after
listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.8534467e-16
"Retail groups are unhappy that no dates for reopening have been set Arlene Foster has said she knows people want Covid restrictions eased faster, but the last thing she wants is to have to ""step backwards"" again. The first minister was speaking after the executive announced the first key changes to the restrictions on Tuesday. Business groups have criticised the lack of dates provided for when they will be able to reopen. It comes as Northern Ireland'sfour main churches will return to public worship in time for Easter. The Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April. The Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a ""cautious"" return a week earlier, from 26 March. Meanwhile, the Health Minister Robin Swann on Wednesday addresseda reduction in vaccine supplies announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Mr Swann tweeted that ""we are currently considering what impact if any"" the announcement would have on vaccination plans in Northern Ireland. ""Our vaccination programme will continue in the coming weeks and more people will continue to receive first and second doses,"" he said. ""As has been the case since the programme began, the number of vaccinations carried out over time will vary due to supply however our programme is presently ahead of schedule and as ever we will be able to adapt to any changes in circumstances as they arise."" Earlier, on Good Morning Ulster, Mrs Foster said it was vital that coronavirus was kept under control in Northern Ireland and that restrictions have to be lifted ""in a slow way"". ""We are in a five-party executive; from my perspective we would like to move in a more steady way, others are more cautious. ""However I do think it is very important that we do need to protect all of our services in our healthcare - and the best way to protect all of our services and our healthcare system is to make sure that we don't see another rise in Covid cases."" What do NI's latest Covid-19 statistics tell us? NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered What is NI's plan for easing lockdown? Mrs Foster added: ""I know that there is a great desire to open up in a faster fashion. Our taskforce in the executive will not just look at the health data, which of course is important, but the economic and societal data as well ""We're doing that on a rolling basis. ""Last year, when we had that flexibility built into our plan, it allowed us to move a little faster that some other jurisdictions and my hope and desire is that that will be the case in this case as well."" Northern Irelandhas been in lockdown since 26 December. Measures announced on Tuesday to ease the lockdowninclude the return of all primary school children to school from Monday, other school groups from 12 April and more people allowed to meet outdoors from 1 April. Garden centres can resume click-and-collect services from 1 April and other non-essential shops from 12 April. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" that the executive had given ""no dates, no timeframes, no nothing"" for businesses to reopen. ""It is exceptionally frustrating when we are putting forward ideas on how we can make our high streets safe, cut down transmission levels of the virus and reassure consumers, but nothing is being done,"" Mr Roberts said. Arlene Foster said she would have liked to see more restrictions eased but caution was necessary ""If we don't get some indication of when our economy is allowed to reopen, then we're going to off-the-scale unemployment, business failure, huge off-the-scale levels of mental health problems in our society."" Dawn McLaughlin, chief executive of Derry Chamber, said some business felt like they are no further forward. ""What we would ask the executive is to provide a bit of hope to our members and to businesses throughout NI, give them some clarity in terms of indicative dates, not necessarily actual dates, but at least give them time to plan, time to organise,"" she said. ""A bit of clarity, a bit of time - we all understand if the numbers go the wrong way it'll have to be postponed, but give them that hope and that clarity."" Allow Twitter content?

William Montgomery, who runs a garden centre in County Armagh, said the return of click and collect was a small but welcome step. ""Realistically we're probably only going to be looking at 10%-15% of sales probably that we would normally do at this time of year,"" he said. ""But it will get us through, it will get rid of some stock that we have there that currently we can't sell."" No new Covid-19 related deaths were reported in NI on Wednesday.

Traditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM). That long-standing tradition continued this year, albeit virtually. The bowl was placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin on Wednesday. The two leaders discussed, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland. They might not have been in the same room but President Biden and the taoiseach were still able to virtually wish each other a Happy Saint Patrick's Day. It was a day of a firsts - a first for Joe Biden as president who pledged his support for the Good Friday Agreement. Referring to the Good Friday Agreement he said: ""We strongly support y and think it is critically important that we maintain it. The political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples."" And it was also Mr Martin's first St Patrick's Day as taoiseach. He said he wanted to move forward with a ""positive relationship with the UK."" ""That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. ""That in turn then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island - goals I know you support,"" he added.

"Martin Quinn says the family has been threatened by the South East Antrim UDA for speaking out The brother of a man found murdered in his home in Carrickfergus last year has appealed to the public to help ""break the silence"". Martin Quinn made his remarks as part of a BBC NI Spotlight programme about his brother's unsolved murder, and the paramilitary gang believed to be responsible. Glenn Quinn was terminally ill from a blood condition when he moved into a flat in the town just weeks before Christmas 2019. The 47-year-old had no connections to any crime or paramilitary gang but was threatened after he privately made a throwaway remark when he criticised an attack by the South East Antrim Ulster Defence Association (UDA) on a friend's business. The South East Antrim UDA is one of Northern Ireland's largest paramilitary gangs. According to a recent MI5-police intelligence assessment shared with Spotlight, the gang ""has access to arms"" and is ""heavily involved in drugs supply, community coercion, intimidation and other criminality"". This video can not be played 'Next time it might be your son' In December 2019, Glenn Quinn was first assaulted and threatened after he parked his car outside his flat. Fearful for his safety, he told his brother Martin what had happened to him. ""The window was down, and the guy approached from the rear of the car, put his hand in through the window and shoved Glenn back and basically grabbed him by the throat,"" he said. ""He was really concerned because at the end of that assault, he was told that the UDA were coming back to sort him out."" Glenn told his brother, and others, the name of the man who assaulted him. Security and loyalist sources have confirmed to Spotlight that person is known to them as a member of South East Antrim UDA. Glenn Quinn's body was found in Ashleigh Park in the Woodburn area of Carrickfergus on 4 January 2020 Just days later, the threat against Glenn Quinn was borne out. ""Glenn had just walked into the hallway of the block of apartments and as Glenn was opening the door, he was attacked from behind. ""There were three people, and these three people, then, gave him a terrible beating. ""They went at him with weapons. He just tried to get into a ball and protect himself as best he could."" Martin is aware of some of the details of the attack because his brother managed to ring him in the minutes afterwards. However, Martin was not fully aware of the critical nature of Glenn's injuries. ""He was quite lucid and by no means did I think that Glenn had been assaulted as badly as he had been. ""The next was Glenn couldn't be contacted and that's when Glenn's body was found. ""I still blame myself that I didn't act, didn't phone an ambulance. ""I wish I'd spoke longer to him, I wish I'd have said so many other things and if I had knew this was the last conversation I was going to have with Glenn. Tell him how much I loved him... talk about old times, and I didn't have that opportunity."" The Ulster Defence Association, formed in 1971, had tens of thousands of members at its peak. It killed hundreds of people during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and often claimed responsibility for sectarian murders using the cover name the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). The UDA had remained a legal organisation until it was banned in August 1992. Notorious attacks by the UFF included the shooting dead of five Catholics at a Belfast bookmakers in 1992 and the Greysteel massacre the following year.

When his family appealed for help with the PSNI investigation, they were also threatened by the South East Antrim UDA. ""I personally have been threatened three times, my mother's been threatened... They're threatening to shoot a 76-year-old woman. ""And that's part and parcel of how this organisation operate, they try to put people in fear."" Glenn Quinn's death shocked Carrickfergus and beyond, but many locals remain too scared to speak out. The murder, they say, is what happens when a ruthless criminal gang is effectively out-of-control and perceives itself to be above the law. ""I want people to search their hearts,"" said Martin. ""Because, next time, and there will be a next time, it might be their brother, it might be their son, and I'd ask them to do something to stop this. ""To break the silence. And help us.""

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic He announces a Â£500 bonus payment for all health and social care staff in Wales for their 'remarkable' work Holyhead on Anglesey could see its schools closed and a local lockdown imposed to tackle a local Covid flare-up The head of Wales' vaccine programme says concerns elsewhere over the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is not putting Welsh people off having it Eight more deaths with Covid have been reported by Public Health Wales, taking the official total to 5,463 Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts That brings our live coverage of the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing to a close. Here's a round-up of the main points:  That's all for today. We'll be back for the next Welsh Government Covid update on Friday. Thanks for joining us and have a good afternoon. Never mind the zebra crossing - where's the goat crossing? One unexpected side effect of the coronavirus pandemic has been an outbreak of frisky goats in a north Wales resort. The Kashmiri goats of the Great Orme mountain in Llandudno hit the headlines last yearafter they were filmed wandering the deserted streets of the townduring the first lockdown, looking for food. The goats are occasional visitors to the town even without a pandemic in place. Now, thanks to a delay in giving them their usual contraception shots to keep the numbers under control, their numbers have boomed, and they are back on the streets in the search for food, and roaming further than usual. However much people might enjoy the sight of the horned (and horny?) visitors,there are fears for their safety as the amount of traffic on the roads riseswith the easing of the current lockdown. Louise Emery, Conwy councillor for the Great Orme ward, said: ""There seems to be a rogue herd of goats that have wandered across the town into a completely new area where they have never been. ""It's a great concern at night time, actually, because they tend to wander more at night and the roads have been very quiet. ""Drivers can literally come round the corner and be faced with eight or nine goats in the road."" Will there be a repeat of the Grand Slam triumph from 2019? Wales' health minister has issued a plea to people not to gather to either watch or celebrate Wales' rugby Grand Slam decider match against France on Saturday evening. ""Four people from two different households can meet outdoors
now,"" he said. ""I know many of you will be keen to watch the rugby this
weekend and to hopefully celebrate a Grand Slam. ""But please celebrate with members of your own household only
and help to keep coronavirus at bay."" The health minister says the Welsh Government does have âa forward planâ for exiting coronavirus restrictions, despite not publishing as detailed a strategy as administrations in England and Scotland. Asked whether Welsh ministers would be issuing ""roadmaps"" as seen elsewhere, Vaughan Gething said they had already provided âa fair amount of detailâ. âWe are providing a forward map for the most significant elements of activity, and weâll continue to do that as the evidence base around us is updatedâ, he said. âWeâve already given a fair amount of detail about where we expect to be up to the 12th of April. Weâve also indicated whatâs likely to come after that. âWeâll then indicate for another further six-week period at least what we expect is going to happen up to the next review."" Mr Gething said it was important to assess the impact of easing restrictions gradually, before committing to longer-term ambitions. âYouâll have seen the headline case rates; theyâve levelled off at just over 40 now,â he said. âWe want to see us get on top of those, in the areas Iâve already identified, to see what happens in the rest of the country and, crucially, to understand the impact of the easements weâve already announced. âSo we do have a forward plan, and weâll update that as we continue to move forward."" Wales still has the equivalent of two district general hospitals full of people with coronavirus, despite diminishing numbers of patients being admitted, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said the critical care system was also operating at âmore than 100% of its usual capacityâ. âSo that is the challenge for us in reflecting the real pressure that our NHS is under,â he said. A revised Welsh Government plan for moving between Covid alert levels will be published in the next few days because of the more infectious Kent variant of the virus. Mr Gething made clear that the revisions to the plan â and the statistics that determine when to move between alert levels â will take into account the strain on the health service, not just the number of people with Covid-19. Conservative Senedd member Janet Finch-Saunders said: ""I do not agree with local lockdowns"", when asked about the best approach in areas with spikes of Covid cases,such as Holyhead on Anglesey. ""I think it's about finding out exactly how this happened, but it is fair to say that people are becoming very tired now of restricted movement,"" she told BBC Wales. ""I think we need a recovery roadmap so that we can get everybody living a more normal life taking in, of course, the Covid-19 precautionary measures. ""At the end of the day, going forward, we know that we're going to have a problem with this, we may all have to have annual boosters and things. ""We are going to have to learn to manage these situations as they happen."" Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell welcomed theÂ£500 bonus for NHS staff and care workers in Walesbut noted it was âjust a one-off paymentâ. She said there needed to be reform of pay and conditions for workers in the social care sector. The member of the Senedd (MS) added there should be on âÂ£10 minimum an hourâ saying there was a âhuge disparityâ between what NHS staff and care staff get paid.  Health staff in England have been told the government can only afford a 1% pay rise The Welsh Government will not set an âarbitrary capâ on a pay rise for NHS staff, the heath minister has insisted. Vaughan Gething made the comments as he announceda Â£500 bonus payment for all health and social care workers in Walesin recognition of their work during the pandemic. Mr Gething explained the bonus is separate to NHS pay. The issue of NHS pay rises is considered by independent pay review bodies who recommend how much staff should earn. However the UK government has said it can only afford a 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England. âIt really does feel like a kick in the teeth for the UK government to say there would only be a 1% pay raise and that's what they want the pay review bodies to agree to,"" Mr Gething said. âThat isnât what we've done here in Wales. I've released the evidence and the letters that I have sent to those pay review bodies. We are not setting an arbitrary cap.â The Welsh Government is âconcernedâ about growing rates of coronavirus in Merthyr Tydfil, Conwy and Anglesey, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said in the case of Anglesey in particular, it was important to gain an understanding of why case numbers are rising. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said on Wednesday morning âall optionsâ were under consideration, including closing schools. Mr Gething said that while keeping schools open remained the priority, he would âneverâ rule out taking steps necessary to protect the public. âThe challenge about Holyhead and Anglesey is about our understanding of what exactly is happeningâ, he said. ""We know thereâs a real impact on our children and young people of keeping schools closed . âWe know that actually our children and young people are the least likely to suffer harm [from the virus], so it isnât the operation of the schools that ends up being the issue that has driven coronavirus rates. âItâs almost always been indoor contact between adults as the biggest factor."" Gyms like this one in St Asaph were among the last businesses to reopen after the first lockdown Gyms will reopen âas quickly and as safely as possibleâ, but the Welsh Government is sticking to its phased approach of lifting lockdown and prioritising schools, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was asked about Public Health Wales research that suggests visiting gyms did not appear to increase the risk of catching coronavirus. Gyms have not been given a date to reopen, although the first minister has indicated they would be part of a review in April. Mr Gething said: âGyms that operate indoors are still part of that general understanding that indoor operations have a higher risk than outdoors. âItâs just the reality that we canât open everything up at once. If we did that we would do exactly what our chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officer have very clearly warned [against]. âA fast opening-up gives every prospect of a significant rebound in coronavirus cases."" Mr Gething told today's press briefing he knew many people would want to get back to the gym. ""I understand the anxiety for not just people who use gyms but other forms of activity to want to see those areas opened up â and we will do so as quickly and as safely as possible,"" he said. âBut ministers are still going to have to make choices with the headroom available to us, bearing in mind that our overriding priority remains getting our children and young people back to face-to-face learning, and I look forward to 12 April when that will happen.â The British Medical Association in Wales has welcomed the announcement of a one-off payment of Â£500 to health and social care staff in Wales in recognition for their efforts during the pandemic. Chairman Dr David Bailey said: 
 
âWe welcome this gesture as an acknowledgement of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by doctors and other NHS workers in Wales who have been stretched to the very limits during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are pleased to see their tireless commitment has been recognised."" Dr Bailey said he would also ""reiterate our calls for a significant pay uplift for doctors which would address the real term pay erosion over the past decade"". The GMB union called it ""excellent news"" for its health and social care members, saying it was ""the least they deserve"". Senior organiser Mike Payne said: ""Their care and commitment over the last 12 months fighting Covid has been exemplary, shouldering the risk without a secondâs hesitation and facing up to challenges that could possibly affect them and their families for many years in the future. âThe only human response to that is to reward that upstanding sense of duty, and itâs clear that this Welsh Labour government has put its money where its mouth is. âThey've shown health and social care staff that theyâre valued, which is something that the Tories in Westminster could learn from.â Hairdressers have benefitted from lockdown easing in Wales Health Minister Vaughan Gething says Covid restrictions in Wales are being relaxed âin a careful and phased wayâ but as people mix ""the virus will begin to circulate again"". âChildren have gone back to school, hairdressers and barbers are cutting hair again for the first time since mid-December, and weâve replaced the stay-at-home rule with a new stay-local instruction,"" he said. âWe are relaxing the restrictions in a careful and phased way â we donât want to lose the impact of all your hard work over the last few months by rushing to re-open too quickly. ""As we relax restrictions and we begin to mix again, the virus will begin to circulate again and we can expect to see more cases of coronavirus.  Wherever we go â the virus will come too. ""This is why itâs so important that we follow all the basic steps to keep us and our families safe. We need to keep our distance. We need to wash our hands often. ""We need to wear a face covering in indoor public places. We need to keep indoor places ventilated and we need to work from home wherever possible."" Vaughan Gething himself received a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Sunday Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething says everyone should take up the offer of a Covid vaccine. His comments follow the decision of several European countries to suspend use ofthe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinebecause of reports about blood clots. Mr Gething said:

âAstraZenecaâs review of all its safety data from some 17m vaccines administered across the UK and the EU has shown no increased risk of blood clots.â âThe company has said there have been 15 events of deep vein thrombosis and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among all those given the vaccine. âTo put this in context, thatâs 0.88 DVTs and 1.3 pulmonary embolisms for every million vaccines administered.â Mr Gething said there was âvery clear adviceâ from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), adding:

âEveryone should take up the vaccine when they are offered it. ""The same advice is given by the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency, and endorsed by all four UK chief medical officers. âWe echo that advice. âWe closely monitor the safety of the vaccine and will work with the MHRA to make sure vaccination continues to be a safe option to protect you."" Mr Gething himself received a first doseof the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Sunday. A testing centre has opened in Merthyr Tydfil in response to a localised spike in cases Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the overall rate of coronavirus in Wales âremains stableâ at around 42 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate is just under 4%. However, he said there was some variation in the figures associated with a number of outbreaks in some local authority areas. Mr Gething told the press briefing: âThese have helped to push up the case rate in Merthyr Tydfil, Anglesey and Conwy in particular.â He said Tuesday saw the lowest daily number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus in the pandemic. âBut figures fluctuate throughout the week,"" the minister added. âThere are now just under 1,000 Covid-related patients in hospital â this is the first time we have dipped below the 1,000 mark for many months."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government will publish its plans to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic next week. He announced a five-year plan which he said would transform hospital pharmacy services, including the development of three new regional centres to prepare specialist medicines. Mr Gething said Wales would be the first part of the UK to develop regional facilities which would prepare specialist medicines. He said these would include âinjectable systemic anti-cancer therapy, intravenous nutrition for people who have certain conditions which mean they canât absorb nutrients from the food they eat, and radio-pharmaceuticals used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers."" The minister said these medicines were currently prepared in hospital pharmacies but in future would be prepared in the new regional centres. âWe will be investing Â£67m to develop the three centres in north Wales and in south west and south east Wales,â he added. As the first anniversary of the pandemic approaches, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has paid tribute to NHS and social care staff for the âtruly remarkable contributionâ they have made to tackling the crisis. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething said: âI want to start by thanking all our NHS and social care staff who have worked so hard over the last year. âYour contribution has been truly remarkable. âYou have helped save lives and have kept people safe in some of the most difficult and challenging of circumstances. âAs we approach a year on, you are still working hard, looking after the sick and the vulnerable and vaccinating tens of thousands of people every day to give us real hope for the future.â All health and care staff will be eligible for the payment Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government will be giving all  NHS and social care staff âa special bonus paymentâ of Â£500. He told today's press briefing more than 220,000 people working across the NHS and social care would receive the payment in their pay packets starting next month. âWe will cover the cost of the basic rate of tax and national insurance contributions,"" Mr Gething said. âThis is equivalent to Â£735 per person â after tax and NI deductions, most people will receive Â£500."" The minister said students who worked in the NHS during the pandemic and some 26,000 primary care staff, including pharmacy, GPs, dental and optometry staff, would also be eligible for the payment. He added: âI want to be clear that this is not linked to the current issue of NHS pay â we have submitted our evidence to the independent pay review bodies, without an arbitrary cap on pay, and we await their recommendations.â It is the second bonus payment awarded to social care staff in Wales during the pandemic, but the first of its kind for health workers. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. We'll keep you posted with the main points here - you can also watch the briefing via the Coronavirus Update link at the top of this page. It's also available to watch live on BBC One Wales, on theBBC iPlayerand onS4Con TV and online. The number of people who have received a first dose of the vaccine in Wales now stands at 1,157,251. Of those, 289,185 have had their second dose. At least 94.5% of the over-70s have received a first jab, rising to 95.1% among 75 to 79-year-olds. Among the youngest priority group of 50 to 54-year-olds, 32.2% out of a group of 227,314 have had a first dose.  Holyhead's infection rate was over 400 cases per 100,000 over seven days A town's schoolscould be closedin a bid to curb ""extremely concerning"" Covid-19 infection rates. In Holyhead, on Anglesey, there have been 43 positive tests in the past seven days. This equates to an average case rate of 401.2 per 100,000 people over that period. Over the past seven days, the rate for Wales was 42.5. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said ""all options"" were being considered in discussions with schools. She told BBC Radio Cymru they were also considering the case for a local lockdown around Holyhead. ""We're looking at all options but we need to look at how realistic it is to enforce them, because we're dependent on the local people complying with the new restrictions,"" she said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or Â£8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. Uber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

An autistic artist says painting has helped him cope with the stresses of the coronavirus pandemic. David Downes started out creating pictures of giant cells looming in the sky, but different themes emerged in his work as the past year ran its course. This video can not be played More than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield from the coronavirus from 1 April. It comes as the numbers of Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have declined for the past couple of weeks. Letters will be sent out to those in the clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm the move. In them, people will still be advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people. Since 5 January, they have been asked to stay at home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed to the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier confirmed the shielding guidance, which had been extended to 31 March, would indeed end then. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries recommended the change based on the latest scientific evidence and advice. Read more here. The fall in hospital cases is one of the factors behind the end of shielding Naomi GrimleyBBC News The lead investigator for the AstraZeneca vaccine trials in South Africa has said it was âextremely devastatingâ and âmind-bogglingâ that his country put the rollout of the vaccine on hold, even though his own research led to the government making the decision. Prof Shabir Madhiâs study into whether the vaccine worked against the South African variant found it offered âminimal protectionâ against mild forms of the disease. But he says the study was âmisinterpretedâ by officials and the vaccine could still be useful to protect against more severe forms of the disease in vulnerable people. Heâs also warning European governments against an âover-reactionâ over blood clot reports. Several European countries have paused the rollout of the vaccine, despite the the European Medicines Agency saying there is ""no indication"" the jab causes blood clots. Prof Madhi said: âWhen countries start interrupting their vaccination programmes that itself might lend an opportunity for the virus to start mutating and become resistant to the immune responses which have been induced by the vaccine.â He says governments need to be careful about making decisions that are hard to reverse because they can âdiminish public confidence in the rollout of all vaccines"". South Africa is currently thinking about selling its 1.5 million doses of the AZ vaccine to the African Union. They expire in April. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic. But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns.

We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs.

state of emergency curbs expire on schedule on Sunday, less than five months before the postponed Tokyo Olympics are due to begin. ""The figures have moved in the direction of lifting (the
emergency measures),"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""I will make a final decision towards ending the curbs after
listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0002243907
"People aged 50 and over in England are now being invited to book their appointment for a Covid vaccine. This is the final group on the priority list, which covers 99% of those at high risk of dying from Covid-19. Everyone in the top nine priority groups should be offered a second dose by mid-July, up to 12 weeks after the first. Nearly half of the UK adult population has had one vaccine dose - more than 25 million people. Around 1.7 million people have also had a second dose. In Northern Ireland and some areas of Scotland, the over-50s are already being offered a Covid vaccine. Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April. In total, the number of people who have had one vaccine dose is: More than 21 million in England About 1.9 million in Scotland About 1.1 million in Wales More than 640,000 in Northern Ireland The number of vaccines given this week in the UK isexpected to top four million- nearly double what has been achieved per week recently - thanks to a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? My vaccine side effects and what they mean This could mean all those aged 50 and over will be offered one dose by the end of March, putting the NHS rollout two weeks ahead of schedule. After that, the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated, with people prioritised by age. All adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccineby the end of July. It is 100 days sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to be vaccinated against Covidoutside of clinical trials. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I'm determined no-one should miss out on the chance to protect themselves and urge everyone who is eligible to come forward."" Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS England's primary care director, said vaccine supplies would go up and down over the next few months linked to manufacturers' ability to supply their jabs. ""But this week and next we have larger supplies, so we want anyone in the top priority groups - people aged 50 and older as well as those working in health and care and anyone with an underlying health condition - to come forward soon to protect themselves and their loved ones,"" she said. Two million text messages are being sent out to those aged 50-54 in England with a link allowing people to book an appointment throughthe national booking service website,external. People who cannot go online can call the service on 119. The expansion of the Covid vaccine rollout comes after government reassurance that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - one of two being given to people in the UK - was safe, after 13 countries paused their use of it. Expect a surge in vaccinations in the next week or so. Extra supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine have arrived from abroad to supplement existing stocks. The target to offer a vaccine to all those aged 50 and over by mid-April will almost certainly be met ahead of schedule. It will then be the turn of younger adults. The progress means the UK is easing restrictions as parts of Europe face new waves of infection. Concerns have been raised about safety of the AstraZeneca jab - the European regulator is investigating cases of blood clots, focusing on a rare type that affects the brain. Evidence from 10 million doses given in the UK show there have been three cases - none fatal. This is not above the level you would expect to happen normally, suggesting coincidence rather than cause. In Germany the numbers are higher - but because these events are so rare, it's easy for a couple of cases to raise alarm. It's understandable they are being investigated, but what has baffled experts is why some nations have paused rollout in the meantime. After all, this vaccine saves lives. That's why authorities here say it's safe and even the European regulator says vaccination should continue. The EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of rare blood clots in a tiny number of vaccinated people on Thursday. But the UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, and Downing Street has said there is no evidence to suggest the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is linked to the clots. Mr Hancock urged people to ""listen to the regulators"" and to ""get the jab"" as soon as they got the opportunity. A vaccine safety panel of the World Health Organization said it was ""carefully assessing the latest available data"" for the vaccine but, in the meantime, recommended that vaccinations should continue. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according tothe government's coronavirus dashboard.,externalA further 5,758 people tested positive.

"Stuart Lubbock was found dead in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool in March 2001 A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the indecent assault and murder of Stuart Lubbock at the home of Michael Barrymore. Mr Lubbock, 31, died in hospital after being found unconscious in the TV presenter's pool in Roydon, Essex. He had been attending a party at the home of Mr Barrymore, 68, with eight other people in March 2001. The man, who was arrested in Cheshire, has since been released on bail, Essex Police said. A post-mortem examination found Mr Lubbock had suffered ""horrific"" injuries prior to his death, police said. Alcohol, ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream. Det Supt Lucy Morris, Essex Police's head of major crime, said the arrest was made after ""significant new information"" came to light following a renewed appeal in February 2020. This video can not be played Stuart Lubbock: Murder arrest followed 'significant new information' ""This information has led to us making an arrest and over the coming days we will be contacting all those who were present at the party at the time as well as others who may have information,"" she said. ""As we stated last February and have continually stated over the last 20 years, we believe someone or some people at that party know what happened."" Det Supt Morris said the investigation had been ""extremely lengthy and complex"", adding: ""We have never given up on finding out what exactly happened to Stuart and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends."" Mr Lubbock, a butcher from Harlow, was described by neighbours at the time of his death as a ""pleasant, sociable"" man. No-one has ever been charged with any offence in relation to his death. Stuart Lubbock's father Terry said he had been living ""to get justice"" for his son Reacting to news of the arrest, Mr Lubbock's father Terry said: ""There is just so much going on in my head. I can't get my head around it. ""Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me."" In February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. ""All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,"" he said. Michael Barrymore has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing Mr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge. The TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death. Speaking last year, he said: ""I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media."" On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest. Mr Barrymore's Essex home became the centre of inquiries into how Mr Lubbock died An inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict. Three years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest. In 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later. Last year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.

"Retail groups are unhappy that no dates for reopening have been set Arlene Foster has said she knows people want Covid restrictions eased faster, but the last thing she wants is to have to ""step backwards"" again. The first minister was speaking after the executive announced the first key changes to the restrictions on Tuesday. Business groups have criticised the lack of dates provided for when they will be able to reopen. It comes as Northern Ireland'sfour main churches will return to public worship in time for Easter. The Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April. The Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a ""cautious"" return a week earlier, from 26 March. Meanwhile, the Health Minister Robin Swann on Wednesday addresseda reduction in vaccine supplies announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Mr Swann tweeted that ""we are currently considering what impact if any"" the announcement would have on vaccination plans in Northern Ireland. ""Our vaccination programme will continue in the coming weeks and more people will continue to receive first and second doses,"" he said. ""As has been the case since the programme began, the number of vaccinations carried out over time will vary due to supply however our programme is presently ahead of schedule and as ever we will be able to adapt to any changes in circumstances as they arise."" Earlier, on Good Morning Ulster, Mrs Foster said it was vital that coronavirus was kept under control in Northern Ireland and that restrictions have to be lifted ""in a slow way"". ""We are in a five-party executive; from my perspective we would like to move in a more steady way, others are more cautious. ""However I do think it is very important that we do need to protect all of our services in our healthcare - and the best way to protect all of our services and our healthcare system is to make sure that we don't see another rise in Covid cases."" What do NI's latest Covid-19 statistics tell us? NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered What is NI's plan for easing lockdown? Mrs Foster added: ""I know that there is a great desire to open up in a faster fashion. Our taskforce in the executive will not just look at the health data, which of course is important, but the economic and societal data as well ""We're doing that on a rolling basis. ""Last year, when we had that flexibility built into our plan, it allowed us to move a little faster that some other jurisdictions and my hope and desire is that that will be the case in this case as well."" Northern Irelandhas been in lockdown since 26 December. Measures announced on Tuesday to ease the lockdowninclude the return of all primary school children to school from Monday, other school groups from 12 April and more people allowed to meet outdoors from 1 April. Garden centres can resume click-and-collect services from 1 April and other non-essential shops from 12 April. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" that the executive had given ""no dates, no timeframes, no nothing"" for businesses to reopen. ""It is exceptionally frustrating when we are putting forward ideas on how we can make our high streets safe, cut down transmission levels of the virus and reassure consumers, but nothing is being done,"" Mr Roberts said. Arlene Foster said she would have liked to see more restrictions eased but caution was necessary ""If we don't get some indication of when our economy is allowed to reopen, then we're going to off-the-scale unemployment, business failure, huge off-the-scale levels of mental health problems in our society."" Dawn McLaughlin, chief executive of Derry Chamber, said some business felt like they are no further forward. ""What we would ask the executive is to provide a bit of hope to our members and to businesses throughout NI, give them some clarity in terms of indicative dates, not necessarily actual dates, but at least give them time to plan, time to organise,"" she said. ""A bit of clarity, a bit of time - we all understand if the numbers go the wrong way it'll have to be postponed, but give them that hope and that clarity."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or Â£8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. Uber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

"Customers who pay too much to their energy supplier through their monthly direct debit payment should receive automatic annual refunds, Ofgem says. For years, customers have complained that energy firms can hoard thousands of pounds of overpayments and would only return it on request. Now the regulator has proposed balances are cleared once a year, claiming suppliers held a surplus of Â£1.4bn. It said some were using the money for ""unsustainable business practices"". Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said direct debits evened out bills even though domestic gas and electricity use varied considerably during the year. For the millions of customers paying by direct debit, energy firms set a sum to be collected each month. The amount is based on predictions of how much gas and electricity will be used, taking previous records into account. Often the balances go into credit in the summer, when less energy is used, before moving back closer to parity during the colder months. However, meter readings may show that direct debits have been set too high, meaning a customer has consistently overpaid. This can build up, in some cases, to thousands of pounds. In 2016, the BBC reported how one customerwas shocked to discover that his energy supplier owed him Â£3,049- with similar complaints having been made for years. Current rules state the onus is on the customer to request a refund of the money. The process can take months. Now, Ofgem has proposed that, from next year, companies automatically refund customers on the anniversary of the start of payments or their contract. That would mean a customer who signed up with a firm in April, for example, would see their excess balance the following April automatically refunded into their bank account. Ofgem estimates that people would receive Â£65 on average, under the latest calculations. ""These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers' money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers' money,"" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem. ""This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship."" Energy prices to rise for millions of households The regulator said it had evidence that excess payments were being used by some suppliers to prop up parts of the business that would otherwise be unsustainable. To prevent firms simply increasing direct debits during a year, the regulator is proposing a threshold for these payments. The methodology will be discussed during consultation. Any customers who owe money at the end of the year will, as is currently the case, receive a catch-up bill or see regular direct debits increased over the following year.

The Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April. The Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a ""cautious"" return a week earlier, from 26 March. The four churches voluntarily suspended in-person gatherings in January of this year because of the coronavirus lockdown. General Secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland the Reverend Dr Heather Morris said churches could make a ""careful"" return to services, adding ""this will allow time for preparation to celebrate the major Christian festival of Easter"". Presbyterian churches may also resume services on that date, but it will be up to individual congregations when they return, and will require ""all the mitigations in place to ensure the safety of people,"" the church said. In a statement,external, the bishops of the Church of Ireland in Northern Ireland said the time had come for a ""cautious and careful"" reopening. An autistic artist says painting has helped him cope with the stresses of the coronavirus pandemic. David Downes started out creating pictures of giant cells looming in the sky, but different themes emerged in his work as the past year ran its course. This video can not be played More than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield from the coronavirus from 1 April. It comes as the numbers of Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have declined for the past couple of weeks. Letters will be sent out to those in the clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm the move. In them, people will still be advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people. Since 5 January, they have been asked to stay at home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed to the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier confirmed the shielding guidance, which had been extended to 31 March, would indeed end then. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries recommended the change based on the latest scientific evidence and advice. Read more here. The fall in hospital cases is one of the factors behind the end of shielding Naomi GrimleyBBC News The lead investigator for the AstraZeneca vaccine trials in South Africa has said it was âextremely devastatingâ and âmind-bogglingâ that his country put the rollout of the vaccine on hold, even though his own research led to the government making the decision. Prof Shabir Madhiâs study into whether the vaccine worked against the South African variant found it offered âminimal protectionâ against mild forms of the disease. But he says the study was âmisinterpretedâ by officials and the vaccine could still be useful to protect against more severe forms of the disease in vulnerable people. Heâs also warning European governments against an âover-reactionâ over blood clot reports. Several European countries have paused the rollout of the vaccine, despite the the European Medicines Agency saying there is ""no indication"" the jab causes blood clots. Prof Madhi said: âWhen countries start interrupting their vaccination programmes that itself might lend an opportunity for the virus to start mutating and become resistant to the immune responses which have been induced by the vaccine.â He says governments need to be careful about making decisions that are hard to reverse because they can âdiminish public confidence in the rollout of all vaccines"". South Africa is currently thinking about selling its 1.5 million doses of the AZ vaccine to the African Union. They expire in April. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic. But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns.

We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs. ""While it may be a bit different from the last time you visited, together we can find new ways to create magical moments togetherâand memories to treasure forever,"" the company is telling potential visitors on its website.

listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"People aged 50 and over in England are now being invited to book their appointment for a Covid vaccine. This is the final group on the priority list, which covers 99% of those at high risk of dying from Covid-19. Everyone in the top nine priority groups should be offered a second dose by mid-July, up to 12 weeks after the first. Nearly half of the UK adult population has had one vaccine dose - more than 25 million people. Around 1.7 million people have also had a second dose. In Northern Ireland and some areas of Scotland, the over-50s are already being offered a Covid vaccine. Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April. In total, the number of people who have had one vaccine dose is: More than 21 million in England About 1.9 million in Scotland About 1.1 million in Wales More than 640,000 in Northern Ireland The number of vaccines given this week in the UK isexpected to top four million- nearly double what has been achieved per week recently - thanks to a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? My vaccine side effects and what they mean This could mean all those aged 50 and over will be offered one dose by the end of March, putting the NHS rollout two weeks ahead of schedule. After that, the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated, with people prioritised by age. All adults in the UK are expected to be offered their first dose of a coronavirus vaccineby the end of July. It is 100 days sinceMargaret Keenan became the first person in the UK to be vaccinated against Covidoutside of clinical trials. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I'm determined no-one should miss out on the chance to protect themselves and urge everyone who is eligible to come forward."" Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS England's primary care director, said vaccine supplies would go up and down over the next few months linked to manufacturers' ability to supply their jabs. ""But this week and next we have larger supplies, so we want anyone in the top priority groups - people aged 50 and older as well as those working in health and care and anyone with an underlying health condition - to come forward soon to protect themselves and their loved ones,"" she said. Two million text messages are being sent out to those aged 50-54 in England with a link allowing people to book an appointment throughthe national booking service website,external. People who cannot go online can call the service on 119. The expansion of the Covid vaccine rollout comes after government reassurance that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - one of two being given to people in the UK - was safe, after 13 countries paused their use of it. Expect a surge in vaccinations in the next week or so. Extra supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine have arrived from abroad to supplement existing stocks. The target to offer a vaccine to all those aged 50 and over by mid-April will almost certainly be met ahead of schedule. It will then be the turn of younger adults. The progress means the UK is easing restrictions as parts of Europe face new waves of infection. Concerns have been raised about safety of the AstraZeneca jab - the European regulator is investigating cases of blood clots, focusing on a rare type that affects the brain. Evidence from 10 million doses given in the UK show there have been three cases - none fatal. This is not above the level you would expect to happen normally, suggesting coincidence rather than cause. In Germany the numbers are higher - but because these events are so rare, it's easy for a couple of cases to raise alarm. It's understandable they are being investigated, but what has baffled experts is why some nations have paused rollout in the meantime. After all, this vaccine saves lives. That's why authorities here say it's safe and even the European regulator says vaccination should continue. The EU's regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is expected to release the findings of its investigation into cases of rare blood clots in a tiny number of vaccinated people on Thursday. But the UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, and Downing Street has said there is no evidence to suggest the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is linked to the clots. Mr Hancock urged people to ""listen to the regulators"" and to ""get the jab"" as soon as they got the opportunity. A vaccine safety panel of the World Health Organization said it was ""carefully assessing the latest available data"" for the vaccine but, in the meantime, recommended that vaccinations should continue. A further 141 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test, according tothe government's coronavirus dashboard.,externalA further 5,758 people tested positive.

"Customers who pay too much to their energy supplier through their monthly direct debit payment should receive automatic annual refunds, Ofgem says. For years, customers have complained that energy firms can hoard thousands of pounds of overpayments and would only return it on request. Now the regulator has proposed balances are cleared once a year, claiming suppliers held a surplus of Â£1.4bn. It said some were using the money for ""unsustainable business practices"". Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said direct debits evened out bills even though domestic gas and electricity use varied considerably during the year. For the millions of customers paying by direct debit, energy firms set a sum to be collected each month. The amount is based on predictions of how much gas and electricity will be used, taking previous records into account. Often the balances go into credit in the summer, when less energy is used, before moving back closer to parity during the colder months. However, meter readings may show that direct debits have been set too high, meaning a customer has consistently overpaid. This can build up, in some cases, to thousands of pounds. In 2016, the BBC reported how one customerwas shocked to discover that his energy supplier owed him Â£3,049- with similar complaints having been made for years. Current rules state the onus is on the customer to request a refund of the money. The process can take months. Now, Ofgem has proposed that, from next year, companies automatically refund customers on the anniversary of the start of payments or their contract. That would mean a customer who signed up with a firm in April, for example, would see their excess balance the following April automatically refunded into their bank account. Ofgem estimates that people would receive Â£65 on average, under the latest calculations. ""These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers' money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers' money,"" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem. ""This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship."" Energy prices to rise for millions of households The regulator said it had evidence that excess payments were being used by some suppliers to prop up parts of the business that would otherwise be unsustainable. To prevent firms simply increasing direct debits during a year, the regulator is proposing a threshold for these payments. The methodology will be discussed during consultation. Any customers who owe money at the end of the year will, as is currently the case, receive a catch-up bill or see regular direct debits increased over the following year. The Energy Ombudsman received 1,000 complaints about credit balances last year. ""Just as people are expected to pay their energy bills on time, we think it's fair to expect energy suppliers to do the same with refunds,"" said Ed Dodman, director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman. ""We know from looking at complaints that suppliers can sometimes take too long to issue refunds, which can be stressful for consumers."" On behalf of suppliers, Energy UK said: ""Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year. ""Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem's proposals.""

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic He announces a Â£500 bonus payment for all health and social care staff in Wales for their 'remarkable' work Holyhead on Anglesey could see its schools closed and a local lockdown imposed to tackle a local Covid flare-up The head of Wales' vaccine programme says concerns elsewhere over the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is not putting Welsh people off having it Eight more deaths with Covid have been reported by Public Health Wales, taking the official total to 5,463 Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts That brings our live coverage of the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing to a close. Here's a round-up of the main points:  That's all for today. We'll be back for the next Welsh Government Covid update on Friday. Thanks for joining us and have a good afternoon. Never mind the zebra crossing - where's the goat crossing? One unexpected side effect of the coronavirus pandemic has been an outbreak of frisky goats in a north Wales resort. The Kashmiri goats of the Great Orme mountain in Llandudno hit the headlines last yearafter they were filmed wandering the deserted streets of the townduring the first lockdown, looking for food. The goats are occasional visitors to the town even without a pandemic in place. Now, thanks to a delay in giving them their usual contraception shots to keep the numbers under control, their numbers have boomed, and they are back on the streets in the search for food, and roaming further than usual. However much people might enjoy the sight of the horned (and horny?) visitors,there are fears for their safety as the amount of traffic on the roads riseswith the easing of the current lockdown. Louise Emery, Conwy councillor for the Great Orme ward, said: ""There seems to be a rogue herd of goats that have wandered across the town into a completely new area where they have never been. ""It's a great concern at night time, actually, because they tend to wander more at night and the roads have been very quiet. ""Drivers can literally come round the corner and be faced with eight or nine goats in the road."" Will there be a repeat of the Grand Slam triumph from 2019? Wales' health minister has issued a plea to people not to gather to either watch or celebrate Wales' rugby Grand Slam decider match against France on Saturday evening. ""Four people from two different households can meet outdoors
now,"" he said. ""I know many of you will be keen to watch the rugby this
weekend and to hopefully celebrate a Grand Slam. ""But please celebrate with members of your own household only
and help to keep coronavirus at bay."" The health minister says the Welsh Government does have âa forward planâ for exiting coronavirus restrictions, despite not publishing as detailed a strategy as administrations in England and Scotland. Asked whether Welsh ministers would be issuing ""roadmaps"" as seen elsewhere, Vaughan Gething said they had already provided âa fair amount of detailâ. âWe are providing a forward map for the most significant elements of activity, and weâll continue to do that as the evidence base around us is updatedâ, he said. âWeâve already given a fair amount of detail about where we expect to be up to the 12th of April. Weâve also indicated whatâs likely to come after that. âWeâll then indicate for another further six-week period at least what we expect is going to happen up to the next review."" Mr Gething said it was important to assess the impact of easing restrictions gradually, before committing to longer-term ambitions. âYouâll have seen the headline case rates; theyâve levelled off at just over 40 now,â he said. âWe want to see us get on top of those, in the areas Iâve already identified, to see what happens in the rest of the country and, crucially, to understand the impact of the easements weâve already announced. âSo we do have a forward plan, and weâll update that as we continue to move forward."" Wales still has the equivalent of two district general hospitals full of people with coronavirus, despite diminishing numbers of patients being admitted, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said the critical care system was also operating at âmore than 100% of its usual capacityâ. âSo that is the challenge for us in reflecting the real pressure that our NHS is under,â he said. A revised Welsh Government plan for moving between Covid alert levels will be published in the next few days because of the more infectious Kent variant of the virus. Mr Gething made clear that the revisions to the plan â and the statistics that determine when to move between alert levels â will take into account the strain on the health service, not just the number of people with Covid-19. Conservative Senedd member Janet Finch-Saunders said: ""I do not agree with local lockdowns"", when asked about the best approach in areas with spikes of Covid cases,such as Holyhead on Anglesey. ""I think it's about finding out exactly how this happened, but it is fair to say that people are becoming very tired now of restricted movement,"" she told BBC Wales. ""I think we need a recovery roadmap so that we can get everybody living a more normal life taking in, of course, the Covid-19 precautionary measures. ""At the end of the day, going forward, we know that we're going to have a problem with this, we may all have to have annual boosters and things. ""We are going to have to learn to manage these situations as they happen."" Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell welcomed theÂ£500 bonus for NHS staff and care workers in Walesbut noted it was âjust a one-off paymentâ. She said there needed to be reform of pay and conditions for workers in the social care sector. The member of the Senedd (MS) added there should be on âÂ£10 minimum an hourâ saying there was a âhuge disparityâ between what NHS staff and care staff get paid.  Health staff in England have been told the government can only afford a 1% pay rise The Welsh Government will not set an âarbitrary capâ on a pay rise for NHS staff, the heath minister has insisted. Vaughan Gething made the comments as he announceda Â£500 bonus payment for all health and social care workers in Walesin recognition of their work during the pandemic. Mr Gething explained the bonus is separate to NHS pay. The issue of NHS pay rises is considered by independent pay review bodies who recommend how much staff should earn. However the UK government has said it can only afford a 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England. âIt really does feel like a kick in the teeth for the UK government to say there would only be a 1% pay raise and that's what they want the pay review bodies to agree to,"" Mr Gething said. âThat isnât what we've done here in Wales. I've released the evidence and the letters that I have sent to those pay review bodies. We are not setting an arbitrary cap.â The Welsh Government is âconcernedâ about growing rates of coronavirus in Merthyr Tydfil, Conwy and Anglesey, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said in the case of Anglesey in particular, it was important to gain an understanding of why case numbers are rising. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said on Wednesday morning âall optionsâ were under consideration, including closing schools. Mr Gething said that while keeping schools open remained the priority, he would âneverâ rule out taking steps necessary to protect the public. âThe challenge about Holyhead and Anglesey is about our understanding of what exactly is happeningâ, he said. ""We know thereâs a real impact on our children and young people of keeping schools closed . âWe know that actually our children and young people are the least likely to suffer harm [from the virus], so it isnât the operation of the schools that ends up being the issue that has driven coronavirus rates. âItâs almost always been indoor contact between adults as the biggest factor."" Gyms like this one in St Asaph were among the last businesses to reopen after the first lockdown Gyms will reopen âas quickly and as safely as possibleâ, but the Welsh Government is sticking to its phased approach of lifting lockdown and prioritising schools, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething was asked about Public Health Wales research that suggests visiting gyms did not appear to increase the risk of catching coronavirus. Gyms have not been given a date to reopen, although the first minister has indicated they would be part of a review in April. Mr Gething said: âGyms that operate indoors are still part of that general understanding that indoor operations have a higher risk than outdoors. âItâs just the reality that we canât open everything up at once. If we did that we would do exactly what our chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officer have very clearly warned [against]. âA fast opening-up gives every prospect of a significant rebound in coronavirus cases."" Mr Gething told today's press briefing he knew many people would want to get back to the gym. ""I understand the anxiety for not just people who use gyms but other forms of activity to want to see those areas opened up â and we will do so as quickly and as safely as possible,"" he said. âBut ministers are still going to have to make choices with the headroom available to us, bearing in mind that our overriding priority remains getting our children and young people back to face-to-face learning, and I look forward to 12 April when that will happen.â The British Medical Association in Wales has welcomed the announcement of a one-off payment of Â£500 to health and social care staff in Wales in recognition for their efforts during the pandemic. Chairman Dr David Bailey said: 
 
âWe welcome this gesture as an acknowledgement of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by doctors and other NHS workers in Wales who have been stretched to the very limits during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are pleased to see their tireless commitment has been recognised."" Dr Bailey said he would also ""reiterate our calls for a significant pay uplift for doctors which would address the real term pay erosion over the past decade"". The GMB union called it ""excellent news"" for its health and social care members, saying it was ""the least they deserve"". Senior organiser Mike Payne said: ""Their care and commitment over the last 12 months fighting Covid has been exemplary, shouldering the risk without a secondâs hesitation and facing up to challenges that could possibly affect them and their families for many years in the future. âThe only human response to that is to reward that upstanding sense of duty, and itâs clear that this Welsh Labour government has put its money where its mouth is. âThey've shown health and social care staff that theyâre valued, which is something that the Tories in Westminster could learn from.â Hairdressers have benefitted from lockdown easing in Wales Health Minister Vaughan Gething says Covid restrictions in Wales are being relaxed âin a careful and phased wayâ but as people mix ""the virus will begin to circulate again"". âChildren have gone back to school, hairdressers and barbers are cutting hair again for the first time since mid-December, and weâve replaced the stay-at-home rule with a new stay-local instruction,"" he said. âWe are relaxing the restrictions in a careful and phased way â we donât want to lose the impact of all your hard work over the last few months by rushing to re-open too quickly. ""As we relax restrictions and we begin to mix again, the virus will begin to circulate again and we can expect to see more cases of coronavirus.  Wherever we go â the virus will come too. ""This is why itâs so important that we follow all the basic steps to keep us and our families safe. We need to keep our distance. We need to wash our hands often. ""We need to wear a face covering in indoor public places. We need to keep indoor places ventilated and we need to work from home wherever possible."" Vaughan Gething himself received a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Sunday Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething says everyone should take up the offer of a Covid vaccine. His comments follow the decision of several European countries to suspend use ofthe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinebecause of reports about blood clots. Mr Gething said:

âAstraZenecaâs review of all its safety data from some 17m vaccines administered across the UK and the EU has shown no increased risk of blood clots.â âThe company has said there have been 15 events of deep vein thrombosis and 22 events of pulmonary embolism reported among all those given the vaccine. âTo put this in context, thatâs 0.88 DVTs and 1.3 pulmonary embolisms for every million vaccines administered.â Mr Gething said there was âvery clear adviceâ from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), adding:

âEveryone should take up the vaccine when they are offered it. ""The same advice is given by the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency, and endorsed by all four UK chief medical officers. âWe echo that advice. âWe closely monitor the safety of the vaccine and will work with the MHRA to make sure vaccination continues to be a safe option to protect you."" Mr Gething himself received a first doseof the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on Sunday. A testing centre has opened in Merthyr Tydfil in response to a localised spike in cases Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the overall rate of coronavirus in Wales âremains stableâ at around 42 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate is just under 4%. However, he said there was some variation in the figures associated with a number of outbreaks in some local authority areas. Mr Gething told the press briefing: âThese have helped to push up the case rate in Merthyr Tydfil, Anglesey and Conwy in particular.â He said Tuesday saw the lowest daily number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus in the pandemic. âBut figures fluctuate throughout the week,"" the minister added. âThere are now just under 1,000 Covid-related patients in hospital â this is the first time we have dipped below the 1,000 mark for many months."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government will publish its plans to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic next week. He announced a five-year plan which he said would transform hospital pharmacy services, including the development of three new regional centres to prepare specialist medicines. Mr Gething said Wales would be the first part of the UK to develop regional facilities which would prepare specialist medicines. He said these would include âinjectable systemic anti-cancer therapy, intravenous nutrition for people who have certain conditions which mean they canât absorb nutrients from the food they eat, and radio-pharmaceuticals used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers."" The minister said these medicines were currently prepared in hospital pharmacies but in future would be prepared in the new regional centres. âWe will be investing Â£67m to develop the three centres in north Wales and in south west and south east Wales,â he added. As the first anniversary of the pandemic approaches, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has paid tribute to NHS and social care staff for the âtruly remarkable contributionâ they have made to tackling the crisis. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething said: âI want to start by thanking all our NHS and social care staff who have worked so hard over the last year. âYour contribution has been truly remarkable. âYou have helped save lives and have kept people safe in some of the most difficult and challenging of circumstances. âAs we approach a year on, you are still working hard, looking after the sick and the vulnerable and vaccinating tens of thousands of people every day to give us real hope for the future.â All health and care staff will be eligible for the payment Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government will be giving all  NHS and social care staff âa special bonus paymentâ of Â£500. He told today's press briefing more than 220,000 people working across the NHS and social care would receive the payment in their pay packets starting next month. âWe will cover the cost of the basic rate of tax and national insurance contributions,"" Mr Gething said. âThis is equivalent to Â£735 per person â after tax and NI deductions, most people will receive Â£500."" The minister said students who worked in the NHS during the pandemic and some 26,000 primary care staff, including pharmacy, GPs, dental and optometry staff, would also be eligible for the payment. He added: âI want to be clear that this is not linked to the current issue of NHS pay â we have submitted our evidence to the independent pay review bodies, without an arbitrary cap on pay, and we await their recommendations.â It is the second bonus payment awarded to social care staff in Wales during the pandemic, but the first of its kind for health workers. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. We'll keep you posted with the main points here - you can also watch the briefing via the Coronavirus Update link at the top of this page. It's also available to watch live on BBC One Wales, on theBBC iPlayerand onS4Con TV and online. The number of people who have received a first dose of the vaccine in Wales now stands at 1,157,251. Of those, 289,185 have had their second dose. At least 94.5% of the over-70s have received a first jab, rising to 95.1% among 75 to 79-year-olds. Among the youngest priority group of 50 to 54-year-olds, 32.2% out of a group of 227,314 have had a first dose.  Holyhead's infection rate was over 400 cases per 100,000 over seven days A town's schoolscould be closedin a bid to curb ""extremely concerning"" Covid-19 infection rates. In Holyhead, on Anglesey, there have been 43 positive tests in the past seven days. This equates to an average case rate of 401.2 per 100,000 people over that period. Over the past seven days, the rate for Wales was 42.5. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said ""all options"" were being considered in discussions with schools. She told BBC Radio Cymru they were also considering the case for a local lockdown around Holyhead. ""We're looking at all options but we need to look at how realistic it is to enforce them, because we're dependent on the local people complying with the new restrictions,"" she said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or Â£8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. Uber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

"People aged 50 and over in England are now being invited to book their appointment for a Covid vaccine. This is the final group on the priority list, which covers 99% of those at high risk of dying from Covid-19. Everyone in the top nine priority groups should be offered a second dose by mid-July, up to 12 weeks after the first. Nearly half of the UK adult population has had one vaccine dose - more than 25 million people. Around 1.7 million people have also had a second dose. In Northern Ireland and some areas of Scotland, the over-50s are already being offered a Covid vaccine. Parts of England may already have started offering it to this age group too, with Wales targeting an offer of one dose to all over-50s by mid-April. In total, the number of people who have had one vaccine dose is: More than 21 million in England About 1.9 million in Scotland About 1.1 million in Wales More than 640,000 in Northern Ireland The number of vaccines given this week in the UK isexpected to top four million- nearly double what has been achieved per week recently - thanks to a large shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India.

Evidence from 10 million doses given in the UK show there have been three cases - none fatal. This is not above the level you would expect to happen normally, suggesting coincidence rather than cause. In Germany the numbers are higher - but because these events are so rare, it's easy for a couple of cases to raise alarm. It's understandable they are being investigated, but what has baffled experts is why some nations have paused rollout in the meantime. After all, this vaccine saves lives. That's why authorities here say it's safe and even the European regulator says vaccination should continue.

Traditionally, a bowl of shamrock is presented to the US president every year on 17 March by the visiting taoiseach (Irish PM). That long-standing tradition continued this year, albeit virtually. The bowl was placed on President Joe Biden's desk during his meeting with Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin on Wednesday. The two leaders discussed, among other things, combating Covid-19 and supporting political and economic stability in Northern Ireland. They might not have been in the same room but President Biden and the taoiseach were still able to virtually wish each other a Happy Saint Patrick's Day. It was a day of a firsts - a first for Joe Biden as president who pledged his support for the Good Friday Agreement. Referring to the Good Friday Agreement he said: ""We strongly support y and think it is critically important that we maintain it. The political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples."" And it was also Mr Martin's first St Patrick's Day as taoiseach. He said he wanted to move forward with a ""positive relationship with the UK."" ""That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. ""That in turn then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island - goals I know you support,"" he added. Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers also held a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. A range of issues were covered during the meeting including progress on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery, as well as highlighting regional strengths and priorities. Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster Ministers also expressed hope that President Biden and Vice President Harris would visit Northern Ireland at some point in the future. Hundreds of extra police officers were on duty in Northern Irelandfor a ""robust"" response to St Patrick's Day rule breakers. First Minister Arlene Foster had warned thatSt Patrick's Day ""must be different"" in Northern Ireland this year, to ensure progress made during the coronavirus lockdown continues. St Patrick's Day celebrations move online In the Republic of Ireland, GardaÃ­ (police) had a significant operation in place to deal with planned protests in Dublin city centre. Sixteen people were arrested in the city for failing to comply with directions from garda to abide by Covid-19 regulations.

In her message to Irish President Michael D Higgins, she said: ""We share ties of family, friendship and affection, the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as 10 years ago."" Since 2010, landmarks around the world have gone green in honour of St Patrick and this year, with a record number of places taking part. Some 690 sites in 66 countries will take part in Tourism Ireland's Global Greenings initiative. Alongside more famous landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Leaning Tower of Pisa were more quirky ones such as an abandoned sauna tilted on its side beside a lake in Finland, and a solar power-generated giraffe in Mozambique. Sydney Opera House was one of the first landmarks to take part in the Global Greenings Initiative, which is in its 12th year The Tilted Sauna in Kirkkonummi, Finland, joined in the fun Gwrych Castle in north Wales has gone green for the first time this year In Chicago, officials had cancelled the annual colouring of the Chicago River but the city's mayor decided to continue with the tradition, minus the fanfare. St Patrick lived in the 5th Century and is understood to have played a major part in converting the Irish to Christianity. He is traditionally associated with the shamrock plant, which he used to explain the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. St Patrick's Day started as a religious feast to celebrate his work, but it has grown to be an international festival of all things Irish.

"Police outside a spa on Piedmont Road in Atlanta Eight people, many of them women of Asian descent, have been killed in shootings at spas in the US state of Georgia. Police say the shootings took place at a massage parlour in Acworth, a suburb north of Atlanta, and two spas in the city itself. South Korea later confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent. Officials say a 21-year-old man was arrested and is suspected of involvement in all of the attacks. No motive has yet been established, but there are fears the crimes may have deliberately targeted people of Asian descent. Hate crimes against Asian-Americans spiked in recent months, fuelled by rhetoric that blames them for the spread of Covid-19. In an address last week, President Joe Biden condemned ""vicious hate crimes against Asian-Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated."" The first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County. Two people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Jay Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded. Less than an hour later, police were called to a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. ""Upon arrival, officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds,"" police said. While there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead. Police quoted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said all four Atlanta victims were Asian women. Investigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta. Robert Aaron Long was taken into custody Capt Baker said investigators were ""very confident"" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. The identities of the victims have not yet been made public. Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. Authorities say it is too early in the investigation to know if the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, said it was not clear ""whether or not the shootings were related or motivated by hate. But right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian-American community that must be addressed"". It called the shootings ""an unspeakable tragedy"" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has ""been reeling from high levels of racist attacks"". From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise ""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that she had been in communication with the White House. Ben Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: ""Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism."" Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta Atlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked. The New York Police Department's counter-terrorism branch said that while there was no known connection to New York city, it would ""be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the city out of an abundance of caution"". The police department in Seattle also said it would increase patrols and outreach to support its Asian-American community. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: ""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. ""We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,"" he said. ""We will stand up for the right of our fellow Americans, Korean Americans, to be safe, to be treated with dignity."" The White House said Mr Biden had been briefed on the ""horrific"" shootings. In 2018, Asians made up 28% of the US foreign-born population The figure represents a large increase from the 4% recorded in 1960 Starting in 2010, more Asian than Hispanics immigrants have arrived in the US each year They represent the fastest growing racial or ethnic segment of the US electorate, with more than 11m people eligible to vote in the last presidential election As of 2015, nearly 5m Chinese, 4m Indians and 1.9m Vietnamese, 1.8m Korean and 1.4m Japanese - as well as millions more who descend from more than 20 Asian countries - were living in the US Data compiled by the Pew Research Center This video can not be played Tracy Win Liu says she bought a gun after being faced with coronavirus-related racism From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or Â£8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. Uber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

"When the Uber he'd hired went to the wrong destination, one professor took his complaint to the very top - and then learned something valuable about the science of apologising. In January 2017, John List was due to give a keynote speech at a prestigious gathering of economists. He picked up his phone and, using the Uber app, booked a cab to take him the 30-minute journey from his home. He looked up briefly, as the car sped along Lake Shore Drive, on the banks of Lake Michigan, and took in the view of the approaching city, with its fabulous skyline of skyscrapers. Then he settled back down to work on his talk. About 20 minutes later he looked up again. Surely he must be nearly there now? ""Oh no!!"" he screamed. He was back where he'd begun. Something had gone wrong with the Uber app, which had instructed the driver to return to the professor's home. She had not wanted to disturb him, as he was so engrossed in his work. List was understandably furious. But what made him more so, was that Uber never sent him an apology. Not everyone who has a complaint to make with Uber has access to its chief executive, but John List did, and so he rang Travis Kalanick that evening. (This was not long before Kalanick was forced to step down as a result of shareholder pressure, following a series of controversies over company practices including its handling of sexual harassment allegations.) After List had related the tale, and let off a bit of steam, Kalanick spoke. ""What I want to know,"" he said, ""is how Uber should apologise when this sort of cock-up occurs.  What's the best way to keep Uber customers loyal, even when they've had a miserable experience?"" How to apologise is a question which every company is interested to know the answer. And John List was in a unique position to find out. Not many people with John List's background become leading academics. He grew up in a working class family in Sun Prairie, north-east of the Wisconsin capital Madison. His Dad was a lorry driver and expected his son to enter the family business. John had other ideas. His dream was to become a professional golfer and he won a golf scholarship to college. There he discovered two things: first, he wasn't as good at golf as he had once thought, and second, he was fascinated by economics. He's now on the economics faculty at one of America's top universities, the University of Chicago. But for a few years he's also been moonlighting, because Uber approached him to be their chief economist, and after he moved on from Uber, he joined another car-riding app, Lyft, where he holds the same position. Travis Kalanick had to make a series of apologies himself, before resigning in 2017 No doubt the job is generously remunerated, but for John List it has another appeal; for data geeks, car apps are like gold mines - in the US alone, before the pandemic, there were two million Uber drivers, making tens of millions of trips each week. John List has spent his career studying economic behaviour in the real world, so working with Uber ""was a dream come true"". With this cornucopia of information, he could analyse all sorts of consumer preferences: what kinds of cars people like, how far they typically travelled, and at what times, how they responded to a change in the price of fares. He could also learn the best way to apologise. His first step was to look at what happened to Uber users after they had had a bad ride - one that had taken much longer than the app had initially predicted. The app might predict, for example, that a journey would take nine minutes, and it would end up taking 23 minutes. By crunching the numbers, he and his collaborators discovered that riders who'd experienced such a bad ride would spend up to 10% less on Uber in the future. That represented a significant loss of earnings for the car app. The next move was to come up with a variety of apologies, and to randomly try them out on those who'd experienced a bad trip. Listen to John List inUbernomics,an episode of The Big Idea, on the BBC World Service Click here for transmission times, or to listen online Download the podcast It turns out there's a sort of science of sorry. Social scientists - and psychologists in particular - have studied what kinds of apologies work. But John List had a big advantage; he could actually measure the impact. He calls one type of sorry, the ""basic apology"" - ""We note that your trip took longer than we predicted and we sincerely apologise."" A more sophisticated apology involves an admission that the company messed up. Another type of apology involves a commitment - ""We will try to ensure that this will not happen again."" On Uber's behalf, John List tried them all. What's more, with some of these apologies Uber offered a $5 discount off the next trip. In the experiment there was also a group of Uber customers who received no apology at all. How many people does it take to oust a political leader? Choice blindness: Do you know yourself as well as you think? The result was surprising. On their own, apologies in whatever form proved ineffective. But an apology coupled with the $5 coupon kept many people loyal. ""So, we end up bringing back millions of dollars by assuaging consumers with an apology and a coupon."" What consumers want, it turns out, is for a company to demonstrate its remorse by taking a material financial hit. But looking deeper into the stats, List realised that even this device ceased to work if there was a second or third bad trip. Indeed, a second or third apology only seemed to alienate customers further. These are invaluable insights for Uber, and for other businesses too. Many economists sit at their desks and make predictions about economic activity based on their models. What makes John List a little unusual for an economist is that he likes to test theories out in the real world. He's conducted experiments from Tanzania, to New Zealand, China to Bangladesh. The vast digital data sets held by Uber and other car apps have enabled him to identify certain quirks in human behaviour that armchair economists might not have uncovered. For example, when you book an Uber you never know whether you'll get a male or female driver, so you might expect male and female drivers to earn the same. But in fact, male drivers earn about 7% more per hour than their female counterparts. Shocked by this disparity, List set about trying to find out the reason for it. He uncovered several explanations. One is that women tend to have more childcare responsibilities, so there are fewer female drivers available at lucrative times, such as morning and afternoon rush hour. But by far the most important factor turns out to be speed: Uber-driving men drive on average about 2.5% faster than Uber-driving women, so they give more rides per hour. Male drivers get smaller tips (even when they're awake) That's not the only gender gap. Because he thought it would make Uber drivers happier, List persuaded the Uber board to add a tipping function - bringing Uber in line with other car apps. He then studied tipping behaviour. For every $4 women give as a tip, it transpired, men give around $5. What's more, women drivers receive more tips than male drivers - except when those women drivers are 65 years old or older. I think we can take this as further evidence of male shallowness. The study of economic behaviour through car app data has been called Ubernomics - though John List's box of data toys is now delivered to him by Lyft, not Uber - and he continues to produce a stream of fascinating results. Analysing the behaviour of Lyft users, he's recently computed the power of what he calls ""left-digit bias"". Cutting the price of a journey from $15 to $14.99 has roughly the same impact on consumer demand as reducing it from $15.99 to $15. Some of the discoveries in Ubernomics are unsurprising. Consumers care about price: the lower the cost, the more likely we are to book a cab. But the analysis of how we use car apps is also revealing some of the biases and idiosyncrasies of human economic behaviour. By the way, if you ever decide to become an Uber driver, and think that being nice to the customer will have a significant impact on your income, there is some bad news. I'm afraid it won't. Even when customers rate one driver 10% higher than another for niceness, John List says, they both receive the same tip. We are not used to the idea of machines making ethical decisions, but the day when they will routinely do this - by themselves - is fast approaching. So how, asks the BBC's David Edmonds, will we teach them to do the right thing? Can we teach robots ethics?

"This video can not be played Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, says the firm has found a ""path forward"" Uber has insisted its fares will not rise after saying that its 70,000 UK drivers will be guaranteed a minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions. The ride-hailing giant said drivers would earn at least the National Living Wage, or Â£8.72 an hour, in a move that could shake up the wider gig economy. It comes a month after it lost a legal battle in the UK over drivers' status. Uber said it was ""turning the page"" on workers' rights, but some said it had not gone far enough. Analysts also warned the company had increased prices in California after a similar ruling and was likely to do the same in the UK. Writing in the Evening Standard, Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said: ""This is a significant improvement in the standard of work for UK drivers. But I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle. ""They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change."" Union leaders and employment experts said Uber's move would have far reaching consequences for the gig economy. Bates Wells lawyer Rachel Mathieson, who represented Uber drivers fighting for worker rights, called it ""a very significant milestone"". However, one union complained Uber would still not pay drivers for the time they spent waiting in between jobs. The changes also do not apply to couriers in its food delivery business, Uber Eats, who remain self-employed. In February, Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed. Uber drivers are workers not self-employed But the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Uber was not legally obliged to grant these benefits across its business, but it was facing further action from drivers as well as calls for compensation for past missed entitlements. The company is also being challenged by its drivers in many other countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Uber, which is worth $110bn but has never made a profit, said the changes to its UK drivers' pay would come in from Wednesday, and form an earnings floor, not an earnings ceiling. The company said the new rates would come on top of free insurance to cover sickness, injury and maternity and paternity payments which have been in place for all drivers since 2018. Uber says: It will pay at least the National Living Wage for over-25s,irrespective of a driver's age, after accepting a trip request and after expenses All drivers will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, paid out on a fortnightly basis Drivers will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber alongside driver contributions, setting drivers up over the long term It will continue free insurance in case of sickness or injury as well as parental payments, which have been in place for all drivers since 2018 All drivers will retain the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern Europe at Uber, said: ""Uber is just one part of a larger private-hire industry, so we hope that all other operators will join us in improving the quality of work for these important workers who are an essential part of our everyday lives. ""Drivers have consistently told us that they wanted both the flexibility that we provided but also they wanted the benefits and we've been struggling to find a way of bringing those two together in a way that work for us and work for drivers,"" he said. Uber pointed out in its statement announcing the changes that a worker is a classification that is unique under UK employment law. Workers are not full-blown employees but are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. The company said the recent UK Supreme Court ruling had provided a clearer path forward as to a model that gives drivers the rights of worker status - while continuing to let them work flexibly. Lawyers and union leaders said Uber's move will spark change across the gig economy Boss of the TUC union body, Frances O'Grady, said the announcement was ""really important because it shows that no multi-national company however big is above the law"". But she suggested Uber was trying to ""cherry pick"" from the Supreme Court's ruling, which said Uber should consider its drivers as workers from the time they logged onto the app, until they logged off. Instead it will only commit to these entitlements from the time a trip is accepted to the drop-off. James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two former drivers who sued Uber over worker status, said the company was still ""short changing [drivers] to the tune of 40-50%"". ""Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement,"" they said. Others pointed out that Uber had said nothing about compensating drivers for past entitlements they had missed out on. Despite the reservations, employment experts and unions heralded Uber's announcement as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. Nigel McCay of law firm Leigh Day, which represented Uber drivers in the recent court battles, told the BBC: ""We see so many other operators using this employment model which is questionable. ""And they'll now see this decision and think: 'Hang on, if Uber have had to finally give in and accept that the drivers are workers then how long are we going to be able to sustain an argument that our workers shouldn't be entitled to those rights?'"" Uber competitor Bolt told the BBC it had no plans to change its driver's conditions, as they ""already make more with Bolt compared to other ride-hailing companies because our commission rates are lower"". However, it said it would continue to consult with its 50,000 UK drivers to make sure ""any changes we make directly benefit them"". Mary Walker, partner and employment lawyer at law firm Gordons, said the additional costs facing the gig economy mean ""some businesses will simply be unable to continue trading"". Other firms will be able to restructure, but perhaps with fewer workers, she added. Union leaders also warned other gig economy firms they would have to change. ""This is the end of the road for bogus self employment,"" said Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which has been fighting for employment rights through the courts. ""It's a shame it took the GMB winning four court battles to make them see sense, but we got there in the end and ultimately that's a big win for our members. Other gig economy companies should take note,"" Mr Rix said. Union reps could barely contain their delight at Uber's announcement. After years of court battles, they portray this as a win of David over Goliath. And they are hopeful it might create a domino effect. Other gig economy companies have likely been looking closely at the Supreme Court's verdict in February. The fact that Uber has chosen to fundamentally change its system rather than fight on might encourage others to do the same. Uber has disrupted markets globally; this move could have repercussions around the world.

"Police outside a spa on Piedmont Road in Atlanta Eight people, many of them women of Asian descent, have been killed in shootings at spas in the US state of Georgia. Police say the shootings took place at a massage parlour in Acworth, a suburb north of Atlanta, and two spas in the city itself. South Korea later confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent. Officials say a 21-year-old man was arrested and is suspected of involvement in all of the attacks. No motive has yet been established, but there are fears the crimes may have deliberately targeted people of Asian descent. Hate crimes against Asian-Americans spiked in recent months, fuelled by rhetoric that blames them for the spread of Covid-19. In an address last week, President Joe Biden condemned ""vicious hate crimes against Asian-Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated."" The first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County. Two people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Jay Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded. Less than an hour later, police were called to a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. ""Upon arrival, officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds,"" police said. While there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead. Police quoted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said all four Atlanta victims were Asian women. Investigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta. Robert Aaron Long was taken into custody Capt Baker said investigators were ""very confident"" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. The identities of the victims have not yet been made public. Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. Authorities say it is too early in the investigation to know if the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, said it was not clear ""whether or not the shootings were related or motivated by hate. But right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian-American community that must be addressed"". It called the shootings ""an unspeakable tragedy"" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has ""been reeling from high levels of racist attacks"". From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise ""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that she had been in communication with the White House. Ben Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: ""Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism."" Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta Atlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked. The New York Police Department's counter-terrorism branch said that while there was no known connection to New York city, it would ""be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the city out of an abundance of caution"". The police department in Seattle also said it would increase patrols and outreach to support its Asian-American community. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: ""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. ""We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,"" he said. ""We will stand up for the right of our fellow Americans, Korean Americans, to be safe, to be treated with dignity."" The White House said Mr Biden had been briefed on the ""horrific"" shootings. In 2018, Asians made up 28% of the US foreign-born population The figure represents a large increase from the 4% recorded in 1960 Starting in 2010, more Asian than Hispanics immigrants have arrived in the US each year They represent the fastest growing racial or ethnic segment of the US electorate, with more than 11m people eligible to vote in the last presidential election As of 2015, nearly 5m Chinese, 4m Indians and 1.9m Vietnamese, 1.8m Korean and 1.4m Japanese - as well as millions more who descend from more than 20 Asian countries - were living in the US Data compiled by the Pew Research Center This video can not be played Tracy Win Liu says she bought a gun after being faced with coronavirus-related racism From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Police will be able to cross-reference data from the tags to new crimes Prolific burglars, robbers and thieves are to be tagged with GPS trackers in a bid to stop them reoffending. Offenders will be automatically tagged for up to 12 months after being released from prison, under a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) pilot. Gwent, Avon and Somerset, Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Humberside and West Midlands police forces are all taking part. The MoJ said tracking offenders 24 hours a day would act as a deterrent. It estimated 250 offenders, who have served a year in prison, will be fitted with the tag in the first six months of the scheme, as part of their licence conditions. 'Sobriety tag' changed offender's life Police pressure as pandemic changes 'landscape of crime' 'I fought off dognappers who threatened to stab me' Police will be able to cross-reference the GPS data with reports of new thefts, robberies and burglaries to see if offenders were in the area at the time. Diane Titmus says she has stopped claiming on her insurance Burglars broke into Diane Titmus's hair salon, stealing about Â£2,000 of stock and all of her stylists' hairdryers and straighteners, in December last year. The break-in was the 12th time the Newport salon had been broken into in 30 years. ""They just took the most expensive items, they knew what they were doing,"" said Ms Titmus. ""The first time it happened was some years ago. I came in on the Christmas weekend, our biggest weekend, they had taken every single item. ""I had to run around to all my friends and borrow dryers, scissors, just to be able to work that day. ""I was really very, very upset, but also angry. How dare they? I worked really hard all my life to have this, just for someone to come in and take it."" Ms Titmus said it had happened so many times she no longer made claims on her insurance because of the increase it would mean to her premium. ""Other times they've cost me Â£500 when they break a window and they probably had about 30p in pennies that were left in the drawer,"" she said. ""We just have to write it off as a loss. We work hard for a week to pay the burglar - that's how it works out."" More than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released During the coronavirus pandemic, the number of theft and burglary offences in England and Walesfell as many people stayed at home. Minister for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said, with levels expect to return to those seen before Covid-19, the tagging pilot was ""critical"". ""We want to make sure we help those offenders get back on the straight and narrow,"" he said. ""We think 24-hour-a-day supervision, through this tag on their ankle, will help them to realise that they're effectively being watched, and therefore choose something else to do, other than go back to their former crime. ""It's a rigorous supervision in a way that we haven't really seen before and we think it will have a big impact."" Kit Malthouse said the tags would help catch repeat offenders More than half of those convicted of theft reoffend within a year of being released from prison, according to MoJ figures. It said these types of crimes cost the public an estimated Â£4.8bn a year, yet 79% of theft cases and 62% of robbery cases resulted in no suspect being identified - compared with an average of 24% in all other cases. Following the pilots, the MoJ said it planned to roll out the scheme, run by the National Probation Service, to a further 13 forces in September. Tags have already been introduced in parts of England and Wales to monitor whether offenders who who were convicted of committing crimes while fuelled with alcohol, have been drinking. The ""sobriety tags"" monitor sweat levels of the wearer every 30 minutes to see whether they have drunk alcohol. The probation service is then alerted if they have had a drink. Amanda Blakeman said she hoped targeting serial offenders would reduce crime in the area Gwent's Deputy Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman said a small number of offenders were committing thefts, burglaries and robberies. ""Offenders tend to be serial offenders doing quite a lot of these types of crime over a short period of time, that can be very forensically aware, they can locate premises that aren't overlooked so there aren't any witnesses and then it becomes very difficult to pull those clues together to solve that particular crime. ""Obviously with the ability to be able to tag our persistent offenders it means we're able to see where they are and if they're in proximity of offences that have occurred,"" she said.

"Stuart Lubbock was found dead in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool in March 2001 A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the indecent assault and murder of Stuart Lubbock at the home of Michael Barrymore. Mr Lubbock, 31, died in hospital after being found unconscious in the TV presenter's pool in Roydon, Essex. He had been attending a party at the home of Mr Barrymore, 68, with eight other people in March 2001. The man, who was arrested in Cheshire, has since been released on bail, Essex Police said. A post-mortem examination found Mr Lubbock had suffered ""horrific"" injuries prior to his death, police said. Alcohol, ecstasy and cocaine were found in his bloodstream. Det Supt Lucy Morris, Essex Police's head of major crime, said the arrest was made after ""significant new information"" came to light following a renewed appeal in February 2020. This video can not be played Stuart Lubbock: Murder arrest followed 'significant new information' ""This information has led to us making an arrest and over the coming days we will be contacting all those who were present at the party at the time as well as others who may have information,"" she said. ""As we stated last February and have continually stated over the last 20 years, we believe someone or some people at that party know what happened."" Det Supt Morris said the investigation had been ""extremely lengthy and complex"", adding: ""We have never given up on finding out what exactly happened to Stuart and we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for him and for his family and friends."" Mr Lubbock, a butcher from Harlow, was described by neighbours at the time of his death as a ""pleasant, sociable"" man. No-one has ever been charged with any offence in relation to his death. Stuart Lubbock's father Terry said he had been living ""to get justice"" for his son Reacting to news of the arrest, Mr Lubbock's father Terry said: ""There is just so much going on in my head. I can't get my head around it. ""Of course I'm happy. Of course this is good news. But it's been 20 years. This has nearly killed me."" In February, the 76-year-old from Harlow said he had only months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. ""All I've been living for is to get justice for Stuart,"" he said. Michael Barrymore has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing Mr Barrymore and two other men were arrested in 2007 on suspicion of sexual assault and murder, but were later released without charge. The TV personality, who was known for shows including Strike It Lucky, has always denied involvement in the death. Speaking last year, he said: ""I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media."" On Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr Barrymore said it would be inappropriate to comment following the arrest. Mr Barrymore's Essex home became the centre of inquiries into how Mr Lubbock died An inquest into Mr Lubbock's death, in 2002, recorded an open verdict. Three years ago, the then-attorney general, Jeremy Wright, refused to let Terry Lubbock make a High Court application for a second inquest. In 2009, the police watchdog published the findings of a review of the investigation into Mr Lubbock's death, concluding that officers missed crucial evidence and did not ensure vital forensic tests were completed until six years later. Last year's police appeal coincided with the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary about Mr Lubbock's death.

Now the regulator has proposed balances are cleared once a year, claiming suppliers held a surplus of Â£1.4bn. It said some were using the money for ""unsustainable business practices"". Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said direct debits evened out bills even though domestic gas and electricity use varied considerably during the year. For the millions of customers paying by direct debit, energy firms set a sum to be collected each month. The amount is based on predictions of how much gas and electricity will be used, taking previous records into account. Often the balances go into credit in the summer, when less energy is used, before moving back closer to parity during the colder months. However, meter readings may show that direct debits have been set too high, meaning a customer has consistently overpaid. This can build up, in some cases, to thousands of pounds. In 2016, the BBC reported how one customerwas shocked to discover that his energy supplier owed him Â£3,049- with similar complaints having been made for years. Current rules state the onus is on the customer to request a refund of the money. The process can take months. Now, Ofgem has proposed that, from next year, companies automatically refund customers on the anniversary of the start of payments or their contract. That would mean a customer who signed up with a firm in April, for example, would see their excess balance the following April automatically refunded into their bank account. Ofgem estimates that people would receive Â£65 on average, under the latest calculations. ""These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers' money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers' money,"" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem. ""This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship."" Energy prices to rise for millions of households The regulator said it had evidence that excess payments were being used by some suppliers to prop up parts of the business that would otherwise be unsustainable. To prevent firms simply increasing direct debits during a year, the regulator is proposing a threshold for these payments. The methodology will be discussed during consultation. Any customers who owe money at the end of the year will, as is currently the case, receive a catch-up bill or see regular direct debits increased over the following year. The Energy Ombudsman received 1,000 complaints about credit balances last year. ""Just as people are expected to pay their energy bills on time, we think it's fair to expect energy suppliers to do the same with refunds,"" said Ed Dodman, director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman. ""We know from looking at complaints that suppliers can sometimes take too long to issue refunds, which can be stressful for consumers."" On behalf of suppliers, Energy UK said: ""Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year. ""Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem's proposals.""

The Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April. The Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a ""cautious"" return a week earlier, from 26 March. The four churches voluntarily suspended in-person gatherings in January of this year because of the coronavirus lockdown. General Secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland the Reverend Dr Heather Morris said churches could make a ""careful"" return to services, adding ""this will allow time for preparation to celebrate the major Christian festival of Easter"". Presbyterian churches may also resume services on that date, but it will be up to individual congregations when they return, and will require ""all the mitigations in place to ensure the safety of people,"" the church said. In a statement,external, the bishops of the Church of Ireland in Northern Ireland said the time had come for a ""cautious and careful"" reopening. An autistic artist says painting has helped him cope with the stresses of the coronavirus pandemic. David Downes started out creating pictures of giant cells looming in the sky, but different themes emerged in his work as the past year ran its course. This video can not be played More than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield from the coronavirus from 1 April. It comes as the numbers of Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have declined for the past couple of weeks. Letters will be sent out to those in the clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm the move. In them, people will still be advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people. Since 5 January, they have been asked to stay at home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed to the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier confirmed the shielding guidance, which had been extended to 31 March, would indeed end then. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries recommended the change based on the latest scientific evidence and advice. Read more here. The fall in hospital cases is one of the factors behind the end of shielding Naomi GrimleyBBC News The lead investigator for the AstraZeneca vaccine trials in South Africa has said it was âextremely devastatingâ and âmind-bogglingâ that his country put the rollout of the vaccine on hold, even though his own research led to the government making the decision. Prof Shabir Madhiâs study into whether the vaccine worked against the South African variant found it offered âminimal protectionâ against mild forms of the disease. But he says the study was âmisinterpretedâ by officials and the vaccine could still be useful to protect against more severe forms of the disease in vulnerable people. Heâs also warning European governments against an âover-reactionâ over blood clot reports. Several European countries have paused the rollout of the vaccine, despite the the European Medicines Agency saying there is ""no indication"" the jab causes blood clots. Prof Madhi said: âWhen countries start interrupting their vaccination programmes that itself might lend an opportunity for the virus to start mutating and become resistant to the immune responses which have been induced by the vaccine.â He says governments need to be careful about making decisions that are hard to reverse because they can âdiminish public confidence in the rollout of all vaccines"". South Africa is currently thinking about selling its 1.5 million doses of the AZ vaccine to the African Union. They expire in April. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic. But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns.

We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs. ""While it may be a bit different from the last time you visited, together we can find new ways to create magical moments togetherâand memories to treasure forever,"" the company is telling potential visitors on its website.

state of emergency curbs expire on schedule on Sunday, less than five months before the postponed Tokyo Olympics are due to begin. ""The figures have moved in the direction of lifting (the
emergency measures),"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""I will make a final decision towards ending the curbs after
listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout. She asks if this is how he sees it. Matt Hancock says the vaccine rollout has been ""a huge team effort"" and the NHS has ""led the way"" in terms of delivery. ""The spirit is a positive, mission-driven can-do spirit"" of those who are working to get vaccines to people, he adds. The next question is about when families who live in different
UK nations will be able to be reunited. Matt Hancock says he ""very much looks forward"" to all travel
restrictions in the UK being removed, saying in England the ""stay at home"" message will be lifted at the end of March. âI have no doubt within a short few weeks everybody will be free
to travel around the UK, as long as weâre able to keep this progress going.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.27424014

"Martin Quinn says the family has been threatened by the South East Antrim UDA for speaking out The brother of a man found murdered in his home in Carrickfergus last year has appealed to the public to help ""break the silence"". Martin Quinn made his remarks as part of a BBC NI Spotlight programme about his brother's unsolved murder, and the paramilitary gang believed to be responsible. Glenn Quinn was terminally ill from a blood condition when he moved into a flat in the town just weeks before Christmas 2019. The 47-year-old had no connections to any crime or paramilitary gang but was threatened after he privately made a throwaway remark when he criticised an attack by the South East Antrim Ulster Defence Association (UDA) on a friend's business. The South East Antrim UDA is one of Northern Ireland's largest paramilitary gangs. According to a recent MI5-police intelligence assessment shared with Spotlight, the gang ""has access to arms"" and is ""heavily involved in drugs supply, community coercion, intimidation and other criminality"". This video can not be played 'Next time it might be your son' In December 2019, Glenn Quinn was first assaulted and threatened after he parked his car outside his flat. Fearful for his safety, he told his brother Martin what had happened to him. ""The window was down, and the guy approached from the rear of the car, put his hand in through the window and shoved Glenn back and basically grabbed him by the throat,"" he said. ""He was really concerned because at the end of that assault, he was told that the UDA were coming back to sort him out."" Glenn told his brother, and others, the name of the man who assaulted him. Security and loyalist sources have confirmed to Spotlight that person is known to them as a member of South East Antrim UDA. Glenn Quinn's body was found in Ashleigh Park in the Woodburn area of Carrickfergus on 4 January 2020 Just days later, the threat against Glenn Quinn was borne out. ""Glenn had just walked into the hallway of the block of apartments and as Glenn was opening the door, he was attacked from behind. ""There were three people, and these three people, then, gave him a terrible beating. ""They went at him with weapons. He just tried to get into a ball and protect himself as best he could."" Martin is aware of some of the details of the attack because his brother managed to ring him in the minutes afterwards. However, Martin was not fully aware of the critical nature of Glenn's injuries. ""He was quite lucid and by no means did I think that Glenn had been assaulted as badly as he had been. ""The next was Glenn couldn't be contacted and that's when Glenn's body was found. ""I still blame myself that I didn't act, didn't phone an ambulance. ""I wish I'd spoke longer to him, I wish I'd have said so many other things and if I had knew this was the last conversation I was going to have with Glenn. Tell him how much I loved him... talk about old times, and I didn't have that opportunity."" The Ulster Defence Association, formed in 1971, had tens of thousands of members at its peak. It killed hundreds of people during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and often claimed responsibility for sectarian murders using the cover name the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). The UDA had remained a legal organisation until it was banned in August 1992. Notorious attacks by the UFF included the shooting dead of five Catholics at a Belfast bookmakers in 1992 and the Greysteel massacre the following year.

They're threatening to shoot a 76-year-old woman. ""And that's part and parcel of how this organisation operate, they try to put people in fear."" Glenn Quinn's death shocked Carrickfergus and beyond, but many locals remain too scared to speak out. The murder, they say, is what happens when a ruthless criminal gang is effectively out-of-control and perceives itself to be above the law. ""I want people to search their hearts,"" said Martin.

The Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in Northern Ireland will resume in-person services from Good Friday, 2 April. The Catholic Church has confirmed there will be a ""cautious"" return a week earlier, from 26 March. The four churches voluntarily suspended in-person gatherings in January of this year because of the coronavirus lockdown. General Secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland the Reverend Dr Heather Morris said churches could make a ""careful"" return to services, adding ""this will allow time for preparation to celebrate the major Christian festival of Easter"". Presbyterian churches may also resume services on that date, but it will be up to individual congregations when they return, and will require ""all the mitigations in place to ensure the safety of people,"" the church said. In a statement,external, the bishops of the Church of Ireland in Northern Ireland said the time had come for a ""cautious and careful"" reopening. An autistic artist says painting has helped him cope with the stresses of the coronavirus pandemic. David Downes started out creating pictures of giant cells looming in the sky, but different themes emerged in his work as the past year ran its course. This video can not be played More than 3.7 million vulnerable people in England will no longer have to shield from the coronavirus from 1 April. It comes as the numbers of Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions have declined for the past couple of weeks. Letters will be sent out to those in the clinically extremely vulnerable to confirm the move. In them, people will still be advised to keep social contacts at low levels, work from home where possible and stay at a distance from other people. Since 5 January, they have been asked to stay at home as much as possible to reduce their risk of being exposed to the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier confirmed the shielding guidance, which had been extended to 31 March, would indeed end then. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries recommended the change based on the latest scientific evidence and advice. Read more here. The fall in hospital cases is one of the factors behind the end of shielding Naomi GrimleyBBC News The lead investigator for the AstraZeneca vaccine trials in South Africa has said it was âextremely devastatingâ and âmind-bogglingâ that his country put the rollout of the vaccine on hold, even though his own research led to the government making the decision. Prof Shabir Madhiâs study into whether the vaccine worked against the South African variant found it offered âminimal protectionâ against mild forms of the disease. But he says the study was âmisinterpretedâ by officials and the vaccine could still be useful to protect against more severe forms of the disease in vulnerable people. Heâs also warning European governments against an âover-reactionâ over blood clot reports. Several European countries have paused the rollout of the vaccine, despite the the European Medicines Agency saying there is ""no indication"" the jab causes blood clots. Prof Madhi said: âWhen countries start interrupting their vaccination programmes that itself might lend an opportunity for the virus to start mutating and become resistant to the immune responses which have been induced by the vaccine.â He says governments need to be careful about making decisions that are hard to reverse because they can âdiminish public confidence in the rollout of all vaccines"". South Africa is currently thinking about selling its 1.5 million doses of the AZ vaccine to the African Union. They expire in April. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Twelve brutal months have supplied one lesson above all: economics cannot be disentangled from health. There never was a simple binary trade-off between the two factors. Those countries with the biggest first wave of excess deaths also had the biggest hits to the economy. The UK was the hardest hit of similar countries on both measures within the G7 group of industrialised countries. That economic picture remains, even after stripping out different methods of measuring the public sector, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment at this month's Budget. The shape of the recession we saw from the pandemic and lockdowns was extraordinary, historic, but also unique - a very sharp fall with a rapid rebound. Over 2020 the overall numbers saw the largest hit in three centuries. Larger than any single year of the Great Wars or the 1920s Depression. The UK economy, like those of Italy and Spain, is particularly exposed to industries where there is social contact, such as restaurants and tourism, that were shut down in the pandemic. But beyond that, as the OBR concluded this month, the primary reason the UK has suffered a greater economic hit is simply that the UK experienced higher rates of infections, hospitalisation and deaths from the virus than other countries, and spent longer in stricter lockdowns.

We now have some more detail on the news the NHS has written to local health organisations warning of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" of coronavirus vaccines for a month from the week beginning 29 March. The BBC's politics editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told the problem has been caused by there being fewer AstraZeneca vaccines available than expected. The BBC understands no one who has booked a vaccination should lose a slot. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about the letter during the Downing Street coronavirus briefing. He said ""vaccine supply is always lumpy"", and added the NHS regularly sends out ""technical letters"" explaining the ""ups and downs"" of supply.

Disney has announcedplans to reopen its two theme parksin California next month, after more than a year. New rules will be in place, with the number of visitors limited and everyone over the age of two having to wear a mask. There will be temperature screenings at some locations. An industry trade group has also advised against actions that could cause a potential risk - including screaming on rides. Disney has already opened properties in other locations, such as Florida and Beijing, at reduced capacity. Its parks in Paris and Hong Kong Kong have reopened, only to be shut again. But in California, its parks remained shut - in part due to disagreements with unions over safety measures for staff, a dispute the two sides resolved last autumn. Disney says the reopening in California will mean the return of roughly 10,000 jobs. ""While it may be a bit different from the last time you visited, together we can find new ways to create magical moments togetherâand memories to treasure forever,"" the company is telling potential visitors on its website.

state of emergency curbs expire on schedule on Sunday, less than five months before the postponed Tokyo Olympics are due to begin. ""The figures have moved in the direction of lifting (the
emergency measures),"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""I will make a final decision towards ending the curbs after
listening to the views of experts,"" he added. The government declared the state of emergency around the turn of the year amid a surge in cases. The nationwide Olympic torch relay kicks off in northeastern Fukushima on 25 March, while the games are due to begin on 23 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It is unclear what has caused this drop in vaccine supply from 29 March. Government sources are suggesting the amount produced by manufacturers is below the expected yields. Vaccine production is a biological process so you cannot guarantee just how much is grown. But given we do rely on supply from Europe for Pfizer and, certainly in the past, some AstraZeneca doses, the fact it comes on the day the EU has warned it may restrict exports has raised questions about whether this might be part of the cause. The number of doses available may drop below two million a week in April - that is a little below what has been available in the past couple of weeks. Because significant numbers of second doses will need to be given from the start of next month, this has prompted the NHS to tell vaccination clinics not to think about inviting the under-50s for a jab. The focus instead will be on ensuring maximum uptake in the over-50s. The government is still adamant the target to offer all adults a vaccine by the end of July will be met. But given the vaccination rollout has been ahead of schedule there had been growing hopes it would have been achieved earlier than that. We have always been warned the supply chain in precarious. This latest news is a reminder of just how true that is. Today's Downing Street press conference, fronted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, has come to an end. Here's a recap of what was covered: The final question comes from Emily Ashton from Bloomberg. She asks if the dates for easing lockdown are absolutely set in stone, or if they can be brought sooner if the vaccine roll-out continues to be ahead of schedule. She asks what he wants to say to people who are going out and playing sport after their vaccines. Hancock says playing football in the park with your family ""is absolutely fine"" and most people are being ""unbelievably supportive of the rules and doing their bit"". Professor Jonathan Van-Tam adds that ""it takes quite a while for antibodies to become measurable in the blood stream after vaccination"". He says that looking at data, vaccine effectiveness continues to improve after 21 days but protection is not immediate after a vaccine dose. He asks for people to ""hold the line"" so the UK only has to have one successful rollout of vaccines, rather than further lockdowns. Dr Mary Ramsay says people must continue to follow the rules and keep their distance. Mr Hancock finishes by saying the government is following the dates in the UK's roadmap out of lockdown. Matt Hancock is now asked why calls for a public inquiry
into the government's handling of the pandemic haven't been answered. He says âweâre learning lessons all the timeâ, such as from the vaccination rollout. âWe constantly look at the actions we takeâ and look at how
the response âcan be as good as possibleâ, Hancock adds. Jonathan
Van-Tam says the timing of a public inquiry is a political matter â not
one for physicians. He says he is âvery focusedâ on the vaccination programme
and an inquiry would be an âextra burdenâ that wasnât necessary. However, he says looking back on lessons learnt is an important
process for the NHS and he is âsure lessons will emergeâ. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Matt Hancock has attempted to play down the news of a ""significant reduction in weekly supply"" which the NHS has announced to local health teams. He referred to interruptions in supply from the start of the pandemic and glossed over the news that no new appointments will be offered in April. The government's focus is, suddenly, on making sure those in the most vulnerable categories get both jabs as soon as possible. But it will be hard for ministers to continue to dismiss the interruption as part of expected ""ups and downs"" if it calls their ambitious target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July into doubt. The Daily Mail's political editor Jason Groves says Hancock ""skated over"" the issue of vaccine supply as if it were a ""technical issue"". The health secretary is asked to tell the under-50s when they will get the jab. Hancock reiterates that supply is ""always lumpy"" and the UK remains on course to deliver the offer that everyone who is 50 and above will be able to get the jab by 15 April. He says supply schedules have ""moved up and down"" throughout the rollout. ""It's absolutely par for the course,"" he says. He adds the letter is a ""normal operational letter"". Romilly Weeks from ITV says Dominic Cummings has blamed the Department for Health for poor PPE performance, while also saying the department had nothing to do with the success of the vaccine rollout.

"Customers who pay too much to their energy supplier through their monthly direct debit payment should receive automatic annual refunds, Ofgem says. For years, customers have complained that energy firms can hoard thousands of pounds of overpayments and would only return it on request. Now the regulator has proposed balances are cleared once a year, claiming suppliers held a surplus of Â£1.4bn. It said some were using the money for ""unsustainable business practices"". Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said direct debits evened out bills even though domestic gas and electricity use varied considerably during the year. For the millions of customers paying by direct debit, energy firms set a sum to be collected each month. The amount is based on predictions of how much gas and electricity will be used, taking previous records into account. Often the balances go into credit in the summer, when less energy is used, before moving back closer to parity during the colder months. However, meter readings may show that direct debits have been set too high, meaning a customer has consistently overpaid. This can build up, in some cases, to thousands of pounds. In 2016, the BBC reported how one customerwas shocked to discover that his energy supplier owed him Â£3,049- with similar complaints having been made for years. Current rules state the onus is on the customer to request a refund of the money. The process can take months. Now, Ofgem has proposed that, from next year, companies automatically refund customers on the anniversary of the start of payments or their contract. That would mean a customer who signed up with a firm in April, for example, would see their excess balance the following April automatically refunded into their bank account. Ofgem estimates that people would receive Â£65 on average, under the latest calculations. ""These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers' money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers' money,"" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem. ""This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship."" Energy prices to rise for millions of households The regulator said it had evidence that excess payments were being used by some suppliers to prop up parts of the business that would otherwise be unsustainable. To prevent firms simply increasing direct debits during a year, the regulator is proposing a threshold for these payments. The methodology will be discussed during consultation. Any customers who owe money at the end of the year will, as is currently the case, receive a catch-up bill or see regular direct debits increased over the following year. The Energy Ombudsman received 1,000 complaints about credit balances last year. ""Just as people are expected to pay their energy bills on time, we think it's fair to expect energy suppliers to do the same with refunds,"" said Ed Dodman, director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman. ""We know from looking at complaints that suppliers can sometimes take too long to issue refunds, which can be stressful for consumers."" On behalf of suppliers, Energy UK said: ""Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year. ""Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem's proposals.""

"A government scheme to house rough sleepers during the pandemic ""exposed the scale"" of the issue, say MPs. The Public Accounts Committee praised the Everyone In initiative, brought in due to Covid, which took over 37,000 people off the streets by January 2021. But they said the number was nearly nine times official estimates of rough sleepers, showing a ""much larger"" issue than the government had ""acknowledged"". The government said it had ""ambitious plans"" to end rough sleeping. However, the committee expressed concern that the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government ""still does not have a plan"" to achieve this commitment. In January, the National Audit Office called on the government to review its rough sleeping strategy in light of the figures from Everyone In, claiming it was ""out of step"" with the problem. All rough sleepers in England 'to be housed' 'I was living in a tent in a graveyard' Government's rough sleeping strategy 'out of step' Everyone In was an emergency scheme launched in March 2020 as the pandemic hit the country. It saw local councils in England given an initial share of Â£3.2m to provide accommodation for rough sleepers, often in hotels or hostels. Overall, councils in England have received over Â£700m to help tackle homelessness during 2020-21, including providing accommodation for rough sleepers. The Everyone In programme received widespread praise for helping the vulnerable group and protecting them from coronavirus - with the committee saying it helped avert more than 20,000 infections. But the group of MPs said it also showed how serious a problem rough sleeping was in the country. The latest official estimate from the government of the number of people sleeping rough was 2,688, down from 4,266 in autumn 2019. But the figure is based on a snapshot survey where councils in England either count rough sleepers on one night each year between 1 October and 30 November or give an estimate based on information from ""local agencies"", often charities. The number also does not include people in night shelters or assessment centres, and could miss people sleeping hidden from view. The estimate was far outstripped by the number of homeless people given accommodation through the Everyone In scheme over the course of the crisis, which hit 37,430 in January. This video can not be played How the UK's homeless are coping during the coronavirus pandemic Ahead of the 2019 election, the Conservative Party pledged to end rough sleeping in England by the end of the Parliament in 2024. But with the reality of the situation laid bare, the committee is concerned whether that target will be met, claiming a plan is not yet in place. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said: ""Everyone In was a success with local authorities and voluntary organisations working to help people living on the street into hostels and hotel rooms in a matter of days. ""But the Everyone In initiative has exposed the scale of the task the Ministry of Housing faces to meet the government's commitment to end rough sleeping in three years."" The committee also questioned whether a government target to provide 3,300 homes for people sleeping rough by the end of March 2021 would be reached, accusing it of ""disappointing evasiveness"" around the plan. And it raised concerns over long term funding of local authorities, especially giving them permission to help people with no recourse to public funds - a term used for some immigrants who are not entitled to certain government benefits. Ms Hillier added: ""Rough sleeping was a massive public health issue long before the pandemic, and much larger than government has previously publicly acknowledged. ""[The ministry] now has a huge opportunity to capitalise on this success in the pandemic response and begin to reverse its long record of failed and abandoned housing targets and policies. ""People without recourse to public funds are still left exposed and risk losing support. Support for these people is urgent."" A spokeswoman for the government said it rejected the ""unfounded criticisms in this report"" arguing that the committee ""misuses different data to provide an inaccurate picture"". She added that the government was providing ""over Â£700m this year and Â£750m next year"" to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.

"Withdrawals from cash machines in the UK have fallen by Â£37bn during the 12 months of the Covid pandemic, renewing the debate over the future of cash. Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, said the number of visits to ATMs had fallen by 43% compared with the previous 12 months. But the amount withdrawn on each cash machine visit has gone up, from an average of Â£67 to Â£84. Less demand and Covid restrictions mean 4,000 fewer free ATMs are in operation. Some may be restored, such those at a busy supermarket which may have temporarily cordoned off for social distancing, but other cost pressures will still exist for providers. It still remains likely that further cuts to the 41,000 free-to-use machines will come in the next few years, prompting concern that some vulnerable people will be unable to access their favoured way to pay. Many shops are still keen to accept cash The first national lockdown starting in March 2020 led to a massive cut in cash machine use, according to the Link data. ATM visits were down by 80% in some areas. This recovered to a degree when restrictions were eased, and particularly when some hospitality venues such as pubs reopened. However, there is little doubt that shops, consumers, and venues have become more accustomed to taking cards rather than cash. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the Budget thatthe limit on a single contactless card payment would risefrom Â£45 to Â£100 later this year. This was met with a mixed response, ranging from those celebrating the added convenience to warnings about theft and fraud. Goodbye ATMs. How local shops offer access to cash The coin you really want to find in your change Natalie Ceeney, who chaired an independentreview on access to cash,external, recently said that cash refusal by retailers was""creeping into the UK economy"". She said that much would depend on whether old habits will return to places such as pubs and hairdressers, which have traditionally seen high cash use. ""It is crucial to understand that cash remains vital for millions of people. Not everyone has a bank account and not everyone can use digital,"" she said. ""Cash allows you to budget to the last penny. Fewer ATMs, bank branch closures and shops going cashless may be seen as progress to some, but there are still a lot of people out there where it makes life more difficult, expensive and uncertain.""

"Police outside a spa on Piedmont Road in Atlanta Eight people, many of them women of Asian descent, have been killed in shootings at spas in the US state of Georgia. Police say the shootings took place at a massage parlour in Acworth, a suburb north of Atlanta, and two spas in the city itself. South Korea later confirmed that four of the victims were of Korean descent. Officials say a 21-year-old man was arrested and is suspected of involvement in all of the attacks. No motive has yet been established, but there are fears the crimes may have deliberately targeted people of Asian descent. Hate crimes against Asian-Americans spiked in recent months, fuelled by rhetoric that blames them for the spread of Covid-19. In an address last week, President Joe Biden condemned ""vicious hate crimes against Asian-Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated."" The first happened at about 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Cherokee County. Two people died at the scene and three were taken to hospital, where two more died, sheriff's office spokesman Capt Jay Baker said. He later confirmed the victims were two Asian women, a white woman and a white man, and said a Hispanic man had been wounded. Less than an hour later, police were called to a ""robbery in progress"" at Gold Spa in north-east Atlanta. ""Upon arrival, officers located three females deceased inside the location from apparent gunshot wounds,"" police said. While there, officers were called to a spa across the street, called Aromatherapy Spa, where they found another woman shot dead. Police quoted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said all four Atlanta victims were Asian women. Investigators who had studied CCTV footage then released images of a suspect near one of the spas. Police said that, after a manhunt, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, was arrested in Crisp County, about 150 miles (240km) south of Atlanta. Robert Aaron Long was taken into custody Capt Baker said investigators were ""very confident"" that the same suspect was the gunman in all three shootings. The identities of the victims have not yet been made public. Authorities in South Korea said they were working to confirm the nationalities of the four women of Korean descent. Authorities say it is too early in the investigation to know if the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity. The advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, said it was not clear ""whether or not the shootings were related or motivated by hate. But right now there is a great deal of fear and pain in the Asian-American community that must be addressed"". It called the shootings ""an unspeakable tragedy"" for both the victims' families and the Asian-American community, which has ""been reeling from high levels of racist attacks"". From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise ""A motive is still not clear, but a crime against any community is a crime against us all,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that she had been in communication with the White House. Ben Crump, a leading civil rights lawyer, also took to Twitter, saying: ""Today's tragic killings in #Atlanta reaffirm the need for us to step up and protect ALL of America's marginalised minorities from racism."" Two of the spas were across the road from each other in Atlanta Atlanta police said they were increasing patrols around businesses similar to those attacked. The New York Police Department's counter-terrorism branch said that while there was no known connection to New York city, it would ""be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the city out of an abundance of caution"". The police department in Seattle also said it would increase patrols and outreach to support its Asian-American community. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp praised law enforcement officials for their response to the shootings, and said: ""Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence."" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the shootings ahead of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Wednesday. ""We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere,"" he said. ""We will stand up for the right of our fellow Americans, Korean Americans, to be safe, to be treated with dignity."" The White House said Mr Biden had been briefed on the ""horrific"" shootings. In 2018, Asians made up 28% of the US foreign-born population The figure represents a large increase from the 4% recorded in 1960 Starting in 2010, more Asian than Hispanics immigrants have arrived in the US each year They represent the fastest growing racial or ethnic segment of the US electorate, with more than 11m people eligible to vote in the last presidential election As of 2015, nearly 5m Chinese, 4m Indians and 1.9m Vietnamese, 1.8m Korean and 1.4m Japanese - as well as millions more who descend from more than 20 Asian countries - were living in the US Data compiled by the Pew Research Center This video can not be played Tracy Win Liu says she bought a gun after being faced with coronavirus-related racism From insults to murder - anti-Asian hate on rise Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?
