"The well-dressed lady who introduced the film was friendly but firm: ""Anyone who doesn't like spandex, glitter or Abba"", she said, ""should leave"". Nobody did. The mood of the audience just got even more excitable. It was the world premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again and the cinema was packed full of worshippers of kitsch entertainment for whom spandex, glitter and Abba are the Holy Trinity. Her advice stands, though. If lightweight, escapist, cheesy, tongue-in-cheek summer movies are not your bag this review probably isn't for you. If, however, you are one of the millions of people who enjoyed the 2008 film Mamma Mia! and want to know if the sequel is any good, then read on. It starts like my old 50cc Suzuki moped, which is to say, badly. We're back on the idyllic Greek island of Kalokairi where Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is once again sending out invitations to her ""dads"" asking them to join her for a celebration. The two lovers: Sky (Dominic Cooper) and Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) She then sings a dreary version of Thank You For The Music, which is wetter than Skegness in February, before having a whiny transatlantic phone call with her partner Sky (Dominic Cooper). I've had more enjoyable hospital appointments. But then, just as I was reaching for my jacket, salvation came in the all-singing, all-dancing, scene-grabbing, screen-igniting presence of the wonderful Lily James. Lily James as Young Donna, ignites the screen with her presence If Meryl Streep owned the 2008 version playing the middle-aged beatnik Donna who had settled on a Greek island, then Lily James makes this prequel/sequel hers as the recently graduated, free-loving young Donna who goes through men quicker than Donald Trump hires special advisers. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) together with her dearest mum Donna (Meryl Streep) The plot is very similar to the original both in terms of quality (it's as rickety as the shack Donna does up) and storyline. This time though, its focus isn't Donna's present but her past. We meet the three young men she slept with in rapid succession, which forms the dramatic basis of both movies: anyone of them could be her daughter Sophie's dad. Hugh Skinner does what he always does and plays a clueless toff, which in this instance is the young Harry. Josh Dylan (who can hold a note) is the young Bill, and Jeremy Irvine makes up the trio as young Sam. All three play their part, which is to let Lily James get on with it and bring the film to life. Lily James (Young Donna) with Josh Dylan (Young Bill), who plays one of her three lovers Along the way she is helped by her besties, Tanya and Rosie; played as twenty-somethings by Jessica Keenan Wynn and Alexa Davies, and in later life - in a very welcome return - by the brilliant Julie Walters and vampish Christine Baranski. Best friends: Christine Baranski (Tanya), Amanda Seyfried (Sophie) and Julie Walters (Rosie) And so the film moves tidily towards its inevitable conclusion: a grand finale back on the island where everybody gathers for a feel-good finish. The risk here is of adding a pinch too much saccharine, which leaves even the most ardent camp comedy consumer feeling a little sick. The film avoids this (just) by introducing a new character: Sophie's diva of a grandmother, played in a perfectly pitched cameo by Cher. Cher plays perfectly pitched grandmother, Ruby When she breaks out into a full-throttled rendition of Fernando, the audience spontaneously applauded, and then could hold itself back no longer and launched into a group sing-along. It is a mark of the producers' astute management of their blockbuster musical franchise: they know how to hit all the right notes, from self-parody to star casting. The slickness of their operation is reflected in Ol Parker's direction, which is right on the Money, Money, Money.

"Michel Barnier has said Theresa May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. The EU Brexit negotiator said the White Paper opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"". He questioned whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical. Earlier, Theresa May urged the EU to ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals. May: EU must 'evolve' Brexit position What would a 'no deal' Brexit look like? Brexit: All you need to know What does UK White Paper reveal? Mrs May is hoping the White Paper - which sparked two cabinet resignations - will allow the two sides to reach a deal on post-Brexit relations by the autumn, so the UK can avoid leaving the EU without a deal in March next year. The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but Mrs May says it will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. Mr Barnier did not reject the White Paper out of hand, saying ""several elements"" of it were ""very useful"". This video can not be played Theresa May was speaking during a visit to Northern Ireland on Friday. But there were parts that Brussels did not understand which would need further clarification. He said his main aim was to protect the integrity of the EU single market, and the UK proposals - which would see frictionless trade in goods but not services - risked undermining that. ""We are not going to negotiate on the basis of the White Paper because that's the British paper but we could use many elements of the White Paper,"" said Mr Barnier. ""There's not an awful lot of justification for the EU running the risk of weakening the single market. ""That is our main asset. There's no justification for us to create additional burdens on business just because the UK wants to leave."" Mr Barnier questioned the UK's plans for a ""common rulebook"" for EU-UK trade as it only referred to goods checked at the border, not areas like pesticide use, adding: ""How can we protect consumers in Europe?"" He also questioned whether the plans were workable without additional bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected - under the UK's plan, EU member states would collect tariffs on the UK's behalf and vice versa. But Mr Barnier suggested the EU's controversial ""backstop"" proposal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border could be changed: ""There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop. ""It's not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop ... But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later."" Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg described Mr Barnier's speech as ""aggressive"" in a tweet: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On a visit to Belfast on Friday, Theresa May said the ""seamless border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic was ""a foundation stone on which the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement rests"" and the concept of a hard border was now ""almost inconceivable"". But she reiterated her opposition to the EU's ""backstop"" proposal, that would see Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market for goods and the customs union, as ""something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". And she dismissed suggestions made by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson that technology could be used to avoid the need for a hard border: ""No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border."" Leadsom: Chequers plan is final offer IMF: Ireland faces economic hit from 'no deal' Brexit Q&A: The Irish border backstop Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? She said the White Paper was a ""significant development"" of the UK's position and offered a ""coherent package"". ""It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind. ""And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions."" Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Ireland's RTE radio there had been a ""lukewarm"" response in Brussels to the UK White Paper. He added: ""We don't have any British proposal in terms of a functioning backstop in its entirety. We have bits and pieces of ideas.""

"A fireball rises from Gaza city following an Israeli air strike on Friday Israel says it has attacked military targets in the Gaza Strip, after its soldiers came under gunfire at the border. The Israeli military announced that one soldier had died from his wounds, the first in the most recent clashes. Gaza officials said four Palestinians were killed in the strikes, three of them members of militant group Hamas. They said a fourth Palestinian was shot dead during protests along the border. Hamas, who run Gaza, later said a ceasefire had been agreed with Israel. ""With Egyptian and United Nations efforts it has been agreed to return to the era of calm between (Israel) and Palestinian factions,"" Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters news agency. Israel has yet to comment on a ceasefire. The military said it had struck 15 Hamas military targets in the northern Gaza Strip and an additional 25 in Khan Yunis in the south, adding that the strikes were continuing. The operation came during another Friday of protests by Palestinians at the border between Israel and Gaza. The Israeli army said three projectiles had been fired into Israel by Palestinian militants. Israel last week carried out its biggest attack against Hamas targets in Gaza since the war in 2014, in response to more than 200 rockets and mortars fired into the country. A relative of a Palestinian killed by Israeli troops on Friday reacts at a hospital in the central Gaza Strip Palestinians have now been protesting at the border for 17 weeks. Gaza health officials say more than 130 Palestinians have been killed and 15,000 injured by Israeli forces during that time. The death of a soldier on Friday is the first Israeli fatality in the exchanges. Human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force. Israel says it has only opened fire in self-defence, or on people trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the demonstrations. Following Friday's clashes, the UN's envoy for the Israel-Palestinian conflict called on all sides to ""step back from the brink"" of war. ""Everybody understands that unless the situation is defused we will very quickly be back to another confrontation,"" said Nickolay Mladenov. ""I expect all parties, all sides to do their best right now. Not next month, not next week, right now, to prevent this escalation."" Mr Mladenov called specifically on Hamas and Islamic Jihad - the two largest militant factions in Gaza - to end the launch of rockets and prevent attempts by Palestinians to breach the border fence. A Palestinian protester taking part in violent protests at the Gaza border on Friday Israel resumed air attacks on Gaza after last week's projectile attacks, warning that it would take whatever action necessary to stop incendiary kites and balloons being flown over the border. It accuses Hamas of controlling the makeshift devices, which have set fields in Israel ablaze, as well as orchestrating the protests at the border, which Israel regards as a threat to its border communities. The past week had seen efforts to try to keep the situation under control, but Israel's Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned on Friday of a ""much tougher"" response against Hamas if continued to fire rockets from the Gaza Strip. ""If Hamas continues to fire rockets then Israel will respond in a much tougher way than they think,"" Mr Lieberman said in a statement. Israel deals 'hardest blow' to Hamas Gaza barrage triggers Israeli air strikes Israel strikes Gaza after mortar barrage Israel: Iran behind Gaza border violence Thousands attend funeral for Gaza medic Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests?

"Clare O'Neill was injured when car-jackers made off in her Audi from her driveway in Acocks Green A mother was run over as she ""battled"" to stop car-jackers driving off with her four-week-old baby. Clare O'Neill, 39, said the two men who stole her Audi ""clearly knew"" daughter Eliza was in the back seatwhen they fled the scene in Birmingham. The pair had, Ms O'Neill said, put their ""personal greed"" before the life of her baby girl. Mum and daughter were reunited after Eliza was found in her car seat, dumped at a health centre three miles away. Ms O'Neill suffered facial injuries, a broken tooth and ""severe pain"" to her arm when the wheel of her car ran over her. Midlands Live: Man charged after 'long bow' seized; Homes evacuated after large grassland fire Her wounds had left her struggling to hold Eliza, she said. Ms O'Neill arrived home in Marie Drive, Acocks Green, at about 16:00 BST, where two men confronted her and demanded the keys to her car. As she tried to get her daughter out of the vehicle, the men drove off, leaving her injured. Ms O'Neill, who has been discharged from hospital, said she was ""extremely shaken"" by what happened and the family was still ""trying to come to terms with what happened"". She appealed for anyone with information to come forward, and said: ""The life of my daughter was endangered by the reckless behaviour of those involved"". ""Eliza is thankfully safe and well, but the people responsible clearly knew she was in my car when it was taken, putting the life of our four-week-old baby at risk as a result of their personal greed"". Officers are continuing to search for the stolen grey Audi A3 S-line, registration BJ66 YLV. Police said the car-jackers in Marie Drive had put the mother through a ""45-minute nightmare she will never forget"" West Midlands Police said one line of inquiry involves looking into a similar car-jacking on Jameson Road, in Nechells at 13:30 BST on 16 July, but said they are ""not definitely linked"".

"North-west England is set for a hosepipe ban due to low reservoir levels After weeks of hot and sunny weather, it's official - the UK is experiencing its driest start to a summer since modern records began in 1961. Just 50.8mm of rain fell between 1 June and 19 July, comfortably lower than the previous record of 58mm set in 2013. England has been particularly dry, with only 21.4mm of rain since the beginning of June. A Met Office spokesman told the BBC there was no ""significant sign"" of change ""any time soon"". There is the possibility for some heavy showers and thunderstorms in parts of southern and eastern England on Friday evening, the Met Office says - but this will be no more than a temporary relief. In pictures: The dramatic effect of the UK heatwave Fruit 'left to rot' in fields due to labour shortages Although many Britons are cheering a sustained period when they can confidently leave their umbrellas gathering dust, the dry spell has led to lower reservoir levels. The grass in Hyde Park, London, has been scorched yellow In north-west England that means a hosepipe ban will be introduced on 5 August -  unless there is a dramatic change in the weather between now and then. United Utilities, which supplies north-west England, has asked for permission to take more water from three lakes in Cumbria to safeguard supplies. Following a winter that saw the ""beast from the East"" bring severe cold weather to the UK, a build-up of high pressure over the country since late May has led to a summer at the other end of the weather scale. The Met Office explained those circumstances had ""suppressed the development of cloud, creating dry and sunny conditions"". Wayoh Reservoir at Edgworth, near Bolton, is one many depleted reservoirs The east of England has seen just 1% of its long-term average rainfall in July so far, while no region has had more than one-fifth. Data from the Environment Agency shows six areas of England have seen ""exceptionally low"" daily river flows over the past week. Another six have seen ""notably low"" levels. The agency has taken to aeration to sustain oxygen levels for fish in some rivers during the hot spell.

"Charlie Rowley collapsed in his home in Amesbury after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok Novichok victim Charlie Rowley has been discharged from hospital, three weeks after being exposed to the nerve agent. Salisbury District Hospital said he had been through an ""appalling experience most of us could never imagine"". Mr Rowley, 45, and his partner Dawn Sturgess, 44, collapsed at his house in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on 30 June, where police found a bottle containing the nerve agent. Ms Sturgess later died on 8 July and a murder inquiry has been launched. Lorna Wilkinson, Salisbury District Hospital's director of nursing, said the day was ""tinged with sadness"" after the death of Ms Sturgess. ""We continue to think both of Charlie and of Dawn's family, and support them as they go through the difficult process of coming to terms with her death,"" she said. Police 'identify Novichok suspects' Novichok victim's sister recalls 'goodbye' Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Ms Wilkinson added that Mr Rowley had been decontaminated to ensure the nerve agent could no longer affect him or anyone who comes into contact with him. There have only been five victims of Novichok poisoning to be treated at Salisbury District Hospital, she said. Public Health England's medical director Paul Cosford said Mr Rowley's discharge from hospital ""creates no risk to anyone in the community"". He reiterated that the public should not pick up items such as syringes, needles, cosmetics or objects made of plastic, metal, or glass. Wiltshire Police said it would ""continue to coordinate activity at a local level to ensure that Mr Rowley continues to receive the support he needs in his ongoing recovery"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned in March, but both survived The poisoning is thought to be linked to the attack onRussian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were discovered slumped on a bench on 4 March in nearby Salisbury. They have since been discharged from hospital. The UK government has blamed Russia for the incident, but the country's authorities deny any involvement. Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July after being taken ill on 30 June Mr Rowley's brother Matthew has said his siblingpicked up a perfume bottle containing the toxic substance. The Metropolitan Police, which is leading the investigation, refused to confirm the claim but the force had previously said the substance was found in a ""small bottle"". On Thursday, a coroner's inquest was opened and adjourned for mother-of-three Ms Sturgess. Her sister Stephanie told the hearing she was present when doctors informed her of the decision to switch off her sibling's life support. ""I then said my goodbyes to Dawn before leaving hospital,"" she said. Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on Friday 29 June. They both then fell ill on Saturday 30 June, and Ms Sturgess died eight days later. Counter-terrorism police are investigating five sites in Salisbury and Amesbury, in an attempt to identify where the couple came into contact with the nerve agent. On Wednesday, internationalchemical weapons experts completed their investigationsin Amesbury, where they sought to identify whether the substance that poisoned the couple was from the same batch used against the Skripals. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will analyse the substance before reporting back its conclusions. Police are believed to have identified the perpetrators of the Novichok poisoning on the Skripals,according to Press Association sources. The news agency reported several Russians were thought to be involved in their attempted murder in Salisbury. They are believed to have been identified through CCTV, cross-checked with border entry data.

"The government wants to increase the amount of time under-18s can be used undercover Children are used undercover in criminal investigations only when necessary, the government has said. The House of Lordsraised concerns about the use,externalof ""juvenile covert human intelligence sources"" after the government wanted to increase the amount of time under-18s could operate. The Lords called for more information amid fears extending this from one month to four could harm welfare. The government said extra time reduces the pressure to get fast results. The practice of using under-18s to gather information in serious criminal and terrorism investigations was revealed by the Lords' secondary legislation scrutiny committee in response to the government's extension plan. Currently, a child can be used in an operation for up to a month before their involvement would need to be renewed. In their report, the committee said the explanations offered by the government on the scheme lacked important detail, for example why they want to extend the time. In response, the Home Office said the ""pressure to obtain results"" within a month ""could be unhelpful"" to the children and the law enforcement agencies they are working with. The government also said operations would be reviewed each month to look at any welfare or safety concerns. It also said a child under 16 would be accompanied by a parent or guardian when meeting law enforcement and children could not be deployed to gather intelligence on their parents. The Lords said they had not been given enough information about the welfare support available for the children. Their report said: ""We are concerned that enabling a young person to participate in covert activity associated with serious crime for an extended period of time may increase the risks to their mental and physical welfare."" The report said the Lords ""may want to seek reassurance"" from a responsible minister. In a statement, the Home Office said undercover under-18s help prevent and prosecute problems such as gang violence and dealing drug, ""all of which have a devastating impact on young people, vulnerable adults and local communities"". The statement added: ""Juvenile covert human intelligence sources are used very rarely and only ever when it is necessary and proportionate and when there is no other less intrusive way to get the information needed to convict criminals or terrorist suspects. ""Their use is governed by a strict legal framework. ""Throughout any deployment and beyond, the welfare of the young person is the paramount consideration.""

"People who have smart meters installed are expected to save an average of Â£11 annually on their energy bills, much less than originally hoped. A report from a parliamentary group now predicts a dual fuel saving of Â£26. In a critical report, the 92 MPs and peers also saidthe government was likely to miss its own deadline,externalto have the Â£11bn switchover completed. Up to 53 million smart meters were to be installed in 30 million homes and businesses by the end of 2020. A smart meter is designed to replace traditional gas and electricity meters. It automatically sends usage data to suppliers via the mobile phone network, and comes with a display showing users how much energy they are using - and the cost in pounds and pence. Conservative MP Grant Shapps, the chairman of the British Infrastructure Group (BIG), said the programme had been ""plagued by repeated delays and cost increases, with suppliers now almost certain to miss the 2020 deadline, and programme benefits likely to be slashed even further"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Shapps said one of the reasons for the ""mess"" was that ""first generation"" smart meters, which do not always work when a customer switches supplier, will continue to be rolled out until next year. He added: ""We need to shift to a reliable timetable, we need to quit installing obsolete old meters... and we need to have the regulator become a lot tougher."" The government said smart meters were already putting consumers in control of their energy use, while industry body Energy UK said suppliers were committed to meeting the deadline of seeing all households and businesses offered a smart meter by 2020. Watchdog to review smart meter roll-out Will smart meters be worth the money? Smart Energy GB, which is promoting the roll out of the smart meters, said: ""All smart meters mean an end to estimated billing and give people a greater understanding of their energy use. ""Smart meters are also making prepay cheaper and more convenient, bringing the way we pay for our energy up-to-date, enabling customers to top up online or over the phone."" This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Messy delivery means households are losing out on smart meter benefits Customers have financed the smart meter programme by paying a levy on their energy bills, while suppliers have frequently blamed the levy for rising costs. However, the report claimed most of the eventual savings would be made by energy firms, rather than consumers. ""The roll-out is consequently at serious risk of becoming yet another large scale public infrastructure project delivered well over time and budget, and which fails to provide energy customers with a meaningful return on their investment,"" said Mr Shapps. By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst Smart meters are supposed to play a major part in the UK's clean vehicle revolution by allowing electric cars to charge overnight when wind power is strong, demand is low, and energy is cheap. It's just as well, as by 2030 the government wants half of new cars to be powered by electricity or fuel cells as part of a global move to combat climate change and clean up pollution. The promise of variable charging has encouraged National Grid to re-assure the public that supplying extra energy for vehicles won't be a big deal. So far so good. But it's alleged that many of the first generation smart meters won't be intelligent enough to offer sophisticated variable rate charging. Energy saving expert Andrew Warren says that means extra energy will need to be generated to charge electric cars - which will put up costs for everyone. Follow Rogeron Twitter,external The MPs also said some suppliers had been engaging in ""scare tactics"" to convince customers to have a meter installed, in order for targets to be reached. Such tactics included firms telling customers that their bills would go up unless they agreed to have a meter, or that their old meter was dangerous. The report also said that: More than half of smart meters ""go dumb"" after switching, meaning they stop communicating with the supplier Up to 10% of smart meters don't work, because they are in areas where mobile phone signals are not strong enough By the end of the year only 22% of households will have the meters installed, meaning the 2020 deadline is certain to be missed The eventual cost of the programme could even outweigh the benefits The report said the government should now plan for the roll-out to be completed by 2022, and that supply of the new generation of smart meters should be sped up. They also said customers should be automatically compensated for each day their meter malfunctions. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the smart meter roll out was part of plans to drive more competition and consumer choice. He said an annual saving of Â£11 per bill equated to an overall reduction of Â£300m, and this was expected reach Â£1.2bn, or Â£47 per household, by 2030. However the government said it was wrong to call dumb meters ""obsolete"". ""They offer smart services now and will continue do so as they are enrolled into the smart metering network,"" he said. ""However we welcome ideas on how to ensure the ongoing success of the smart meter roll out and are already working with Ofgem on issues raised in the report."" The National Audit Office is already investigating the economic case for the roll-out of smart meters, and is due to report sometime this summer. Energy UK said: ""Suppliers have installed more than 11 million smart meters. However, as with any large and complex infrastructure programme there will be challenges to overcome.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May was speaking during a visit to Northern Ireland on Friday The European Union must ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals regarding the Irish border, Theresa May has said. The prime minister made the remarks in Belfast on Friday, during a two-day visit to Northern Ireland. The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in Brexit talks so far. The UK and EU have agreed that there should be no hard border in Ireland, but are at odds over how to achieve it. IMF: Ireland faces hit from 'no deal' Brexit Leadsom: Chequers plan is 'final offer' Barnier questions May's Brexit plan Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The backstop solution is effectively an insurance policy -  to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if appropriate customs arrangements cannot be agreed by the EU and UK in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020. The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. However, the UK said that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea. On Friday, Mrs May again repeated her opposition to that, saying: ""The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal 'third country' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". She also said both sides in the negotiation  ""share a determination never to see a hard border in Northern Ireland"". ""And no technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet, or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border"". However,EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has questioned Mrs May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU,saying it could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. Michel Barnier has asked the UK for clarification on its Brexit White Paper He saidthe UK's Brexit White Paper, published on 12 July, opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"". Mr Barnier questioned whether plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical. Earlier this week, the government backed anamendment to its Customs Billthat would make it illegal for Northern Ireland to be outside the UK's customs territory. Mrs May said the EU's backstop proposal would be a breach of the Belfast Agreement - and that her plan, agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers earlier this month, was the best way forward.

""What I've said to the EU is that the legal text they've produced is not acceptable, that's why we proposed an alternative to that,"" she said. She said there now needed to be a renewed focus on EU-UK negotiations with ""increased pace and intensity"". The prime minister also met several of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the visit was ""anything but reassuring"". Arlene Foster called on the EU to show more flexibility in the negotiations around the border ""In fact it's now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,"" Mrs McDonald said. However, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, defended the prime minister. ""What she has done is set out her agenda, that's very important. She talked about working together to find solutions, and the need to work collaboratively,"" she said. Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the government was committed to getting a legal text for a backstop. Earlier, the Irish TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney tweeted that if the UK did not accept the EU wording on a backstop in the draft withdrawal agreement, they would have to propose an  alternative that would deliver the same result.

Reacting to his comments, Mrs Bradley said while the EU had put forward a legal text, ""we do not accept it"". ""We've put forward a counter proposal and we're now working on how we get a backstop that we are committed to delivering but it has to be a backstop that respects the integrity of the whole UK and does not put a border in the Irish sea."" The PSNI and GardaÃ­ (Irish police) stand exactly on the border in Belleek, County Fermanagh, ahead of Theresa May's visit The Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, told the BBC Labour had always been ""very clear"" that the UK should be part of the customs union. EU and UK negotiators have been meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the border issue. Irish PM steps up Brexit preparations Brexit: All you need to know What do the EU's 'no deal' preparations say? The PM and the DUP leader visited Belleek Pottery near the Irish border on Thursday Friday's speech in Northern Ireland marks the prime minister's first major attempt to sell the Chequers agreement since it was reached by her cabinet earlier this month. She is due to tour other parts of the UK over the summer in an attempt to persuade businesses and citizens of its benefits. Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit. The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards. But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching. The Republic of Ireland will remain within the EU and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"". Mrs May also addressed the impasse at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without a government for 18 months, after power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. She added that until devolution is restored, the government would fulfil its responsibilities but warned interventions from Westminster were ""no substitute"" in the long-term.

"Plans to install smart meters in millions of British homes will be reviewed by the government spending watchdog, the BBC has learned. The National Audit Office says it will investigate whether the planned Â£11bn rollout will save customers money. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says it will work with the NAO to ""help review the progress of this important programme"". Smart meters show how much energy is being used and the cost in real time. The technology is projected to save Â£16.7bn through reduced energy use, with the cost of the scheme funded through energy bills. Meter readings are sent back to the supplier, with the promise of energy bills based on accurate use, rather than estimates. But some users have experienced problems with installations, inaccurate bills or loss of the meter's 'smart' features when they switch suppliers. Now the National Audit Office says it will review the project. Smart Energy has used the 'Gaz' and 'Leccy' cartoon characters to market smart meters Its study will ""assess the current economic case for the rollout of smart meters and look at whether the government is on track to achieve its target to roll out meters by 2020"". The deadline for the government's plan to install 53 million smart meters by 2020 has been questioned by MPs, with 8.6 million fitted so far. The IT system that allows meters to communicate with suppliers, the Data Communications Company (DCC), has not launched yet, despite being due to go live in 2015. The industry body responsible for promoting smart meters, Smart Energy GB, defends the pace of the rollout. Its chief executive Sacha Deshmukh told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme that 8 out of 10 people with smart meters were ""very happy with the meters and would recommend them to their friends and family"". The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has also defended the plans. A spokesperson said: ""Smart meters are a vital upgrade to bring our energy infrastructure into the 21st Century."" The National Audit Office is expected to publish its report in summer 2018.

"The new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab unveiled the White Paper on Thursday The government has published its long-awaitedBrexit White Paper,external. The document is 104 pages long and follows last week's Chequers agreement which set out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the EU after Brexit. TheWhite Paper is split into four chapters,external: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. Most of the debate surrounds the first section, the future economic relationship. So here are the key excerpts from the chapter on ""economic partnership"" and what they mean. This is a line that emerged in the Chequers statement last Friday, and it is one of the most important in this White Paper. It is the UK government's answer to the concerns expressed by businesses that rely on ""just-in-time"" manufacturing supply chains (such as car manufacturers), and to the need toavoid the reimposition of a hard border in Ireland. The White Paper proposes a free trade area for goods - but it is very close to single market membership for goods in all but name. The suggestion of a common rulebook sounds very collaborative, but it does - in effect - mean the UK agreeing to take on the EU's rules and regulations in all these areas. If the UK parliament chose not to sign up to any of those rules, the idea of frictionless trade would begin to fall apart. The other big sensitivity in this section will be the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The White Paper says the role of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end, and it sets out detailed proposals for joint institutional arrangements to police future economic ties. But the ECJ is the ultimate legal authority on EU rules with which the UK proposes to harmonise. There's more detail here about how the UK proposes to combine bits of its two previous customs proposals, to create an entirely new customs relationship with the EU. It would take advantage of new technologies to make trade as frictionless as possible, but it would still involve the UK collecting EU tariffs (taxes on imports) at UK borders on the EU's behalf - something which isn't done anywhere else in the world on any significant scale. The White Paper says the UK would also apply its own tariffs, and an independent trade policy, for goods intended for consumption in the UK. In other words, it would still seek to strike its own trade deals around the world, even though it would be bound by EU rules and regulations. For once, Brexiteers and the EU appear united - neither thinks the proposal has much chance of working because of its sheer complexity. Unsurprisingly the UK government disputes that, and says it wants to be at the cutting edge of global customs policy. But it's also worth noting that the White Paper says the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) would have to be phased in - which is code for saying that it wouldn't be ready by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Reality Check: Why services matter in any Brexit deal? Reality Check: The Brexit challenge for Irish trade The White Paper confirms that the UK will seek active participation in (if not full membership of) the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The government is keen to address business demands that they only need to go through one approval mechanism to access both markets, in highly regulated parts of the economy. The EU has previously ruled out full UK membership of these agencies, and noted that it would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice if it were to sign up to their rules and regulations. The White Paper accepts that the UK would not have any voting rights in the way the agencies go about their business, and that it would have to make appropriate financial contributions to them. This is part of the pragmatic Brexit the government is now advocating, but it is not the resumption of full UK sovereignty that some leading leave campaigners had promised. The section on services confirms that the UK is seeking a looser relationship with the EU forroughly 80% of the UK economy. Financial and other services will no longer be able to take advantage of passporting, which gives them automatic access to other EU markets (the UK's Financial Conduct Authority says about 5,500 UK financial firms currently have EU passporting rights). The government has abandoned plans for a new relationship based on the concept of mutual recognition of financial regulations, partly because it had been so comprehensively rejected by the EU. But it is still seeking something more ambitious than the ""equivalence' regime"" that the EU has with most other third countries (part of the problem with that is that it can be withdrawn, by either side, with just 30 days notice). So, the UK argues that the importance of the City of London to the EU's entire financial system means a more ambitious solution needs to be found. The trouble with a lot of these proposals though is that the EU will see them as cherry-picking from the four freedoms that underpin the single market. It has already said that the UK cannot have full access to the single market for goods and not services, especially if it is determined to end the free movement of people. The White Paper emphasises repeatedly that free movement of people will come to an end. Full details of a new immigration policy are due to be published in a separate White Paper, which has already been delayed several times. But there are hints in this document of what could be to come - it sets out proposals for a mobility framework, which is pretty standard in trade agreements. It could - among other things - ""allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity."" But some Brexiteers fear that what will eventually emerge will be free movement under another name, and they are already suspicious that this is just an opening bid from the government. The EU will certainly push for further concessions if the UK is to get anything close to the economic relationship it wants. Part of the problem for the UK is that it is asking the EU to be a little bit more flexible in the way it interprets its rules-based system. But that request is being made at a time when the EU thinks its rules are under threat from external sources like President Trump, and internal sources like governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland.

"The smart meters project risks being a wasted opportunity for households if they are just fitted and forgotten, a committee of MPs has said. The new real-time meters will only save consumers a small amount of money on their energy bills, the Science and Technology Committee said. The government must do more to convince people of the extra benefits that the system can bring, it said. These included a smarter energy grid and less pollution. The government wants every home and business to be offered a smart meter by the end of 2020. That requires 53 million meters to be fitted in more than 30 million premises over the next four years. The meters will measure gas and electricity use and automatically send meter readings to energy suppliers, ending manual meter readings. However, there have been mishaps during the major installation programme. The communication system that links meters to energy suppliers has been delayed. The committee also pointed out that there was an ""unresolved"" problem of early meters installed in the first phase of the rollout losing their ""smart"" function when the customer switches supplier. The committee's interim chairwoman, Tania Mathias, said: ""The government has known for years that early smart meters can lose their smartness if the customer switches supplier. ""Ministers merely have an 'ambition' to fix this by 2020. Taxpayers will be unimpressed with this situation, and timely action is needed.

"People who have smart meters installed are expected to save an average of Â£11 annually on their energy bills, much less than originally hoped. A report from a parliamentary group now predicts a dual fuel saving of Â£26. In a critical report, the 92 MPs and peers also saidthe government was likely to miss its own deadline,externalto have the Â£11bn switchover completed. Up to 53 million smart meters were to be installed in 30 million homes and businesses by the end of 2020. A smart meter is designed to replace traditional gas and electricity meters. It automatically sends usage data to suppliers via the mobile phone network, and comes with a display showing users how much energy they are using - and the cost in pounds and pence. Conservative MP Grant Shapps, the chairman of the British Infrastructure Group (BIG), said the programme had been ""plagued by repeated delays and cost increases, with suppliers now almost certain to miss the 2020 deadline, and programme benefits likely to be slashed even further"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Shapps said one of the reasons for the ""mess"" was that ""first generation"" smart meters, which do not always work when a customer switches supplier, will continue to be rolled out until next year. He added: ""We need to shift to a reliable timetable, we need to quit installing obsolete old meters... and we need to have the regulator become a lot tougher."" The government said smart meters were already putting consumers in control of their energy use, while industry body Energy UK said suppliers were committed to meeting the deadline of seeing all households and businesses offered a smart meter by 2020. Watchdog to review smart meter roll-out Will smart meters be worth the money? Smart Energy GB, which is promoting the roll out of the smart meters, said: ""All smart meters mean an end to estimated billing and give people a greater understanding of their energy use. ""Smart meters are also making prepay cheaper and more convenient, bringing the way we pay for our energy up-to-date, enabling customers to top up online or over the phone."" This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Messy delivery means households are losing out on smart meter benefits Customers have financed the smart meter programme by paying a levy on their energy bills, while suppliers have frequently blamed the levy for rising costs. However, the report claimed most of the eventual savings would be made by energy firms, rather than consumers. ""The roll-out is consequently at serious risk of becoming yet another large scale public infrastructure project delivered well over time and budget, and which fails to provide energy customers with a meaningful return on their investment,"" said Mr Shapps. By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst Smart meters are supposed to play a major part in the UK's clean vehicle revolution by allowing electric cars to charge overnight when wind power is strong, demand is low, and energy is cheap. It's just as well, as by 2030 the government wants half of new cars to be powered by electricity or fuel cells as part of a global move to combat climate change and clean up pollution. The promise of variable charging has encouraged National Grid to re-assure the public that supplying extra energy for vehicles won't be a big deal. So far so good. But it's alleged that many of the first generation smart meters won't be intelligent enough to offer sophisticated variable rate charging. Energy saving expert Andrew Warren says that means extra energy will need to be generated to charge electric cars - which will put up costs for everyone. Follow Rogeron Twitter,external The MPs also said some suppliers had been engaging in ""scare tactics"" to convince customers to have a meter installed, in order for targets to be reached. Such tactics included firms telling customers that their bills would go up unless they agreed to have a meter, or that their old meter was dangerous. The report also said that: More than half of smart meters ""go dumb"" after switching, meaning they stop communicating with the supplier Up to 10% of smart meters don't work, because they are in areas where mobile phone signals are not strong enough By the end of the year only 22% of households will have the meters installed, meaning the 2020 deadline is certain to be missed The eventual cost of the programme could even outweigh the benefits The report said the government should now plan for the roll-out to be completed by 2022, and that supply of the new generation of smart meters should be sped up. They also said customers should be automatically compensated for each day their meter malfunctions. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the smart meter roll out was part of plans to drive more competition and consumer choice. He said an annual saving of Â£11 per bill equated to an overall reduction of Â£300m, and this was expected reach Â£1.2bn, or Â£47 per household, by 2030. However the government said it was wrong to call dumb meters ""obsolete"". ""They offer smart services now and will continue do so as they are enrolled into the smart metering network,"" he said. ""However we welcome ideas on how to ensure the ongoing success of the smart meter roll out and are already working with Ofgem on issues raised in the report."" The National Audit Office is already investigating the economic case for the roll-out of smart meters, and is due to report sometime this summer. Energy UK said: ""Suppliers have installed more than 11 million smart meters. However, as with any large and complex infrastructure programme there will be challenges to overcome.""

"James Gunn has worked on the Guardians of the Galaxy films and the Avengers franchise Disney has removed James Gunn as director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 after a number of offensive social media posts resurfaced online. The American filmmaker apologised after old tweets in which he appeared to joke about paedophilia and rape were unearthed and widely shared. But Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn announced his sacking on Friday. ""The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible,"" he said in a statement. ""[They are] inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him."" Gunn wrote and directed both of the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films, which starred the likes of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper. Off-screen heroes reveal Marvel magic Who could follow The Avengers' success? The first instalment was one of Marvel's most successful films, making more than $771m (Â£540m) at the worldwide box office. Gunn has also worked on the hugely-successful Avengers franchise. There has been no immediate response from the filmmaker, but in a series of tweets posted on Thursday he addressed the controversy surrounding his old posts. ""I viewed myself as a provocateur, making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo,"" he said. ""I am very, very different than I was a few years ago."" ""I have apologized for humor of mine that hurt people. I truly felt sorry and meant every word of my apologies,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A fireball rises from Gaza city following an Israeli air strike on Friday Israel says it has attacked military targets in the Gaza Strip, after its soldiers came under gunfire at the border. The Israeli military announced that one soldier had died from his wounds, the first in the most recent clashes. Gaza officials said four Palestinians were killed in the strikes, three of them members of militant group Hamas. They said a fourth Palestinian was shot dead during protests along the border. Hamas, who run Gaza, later said a ceasefire had been agreed with Israel. ""With Egyptian and United Nations efforts it has been agreed to return to the era of calm between (Israel) and Palestinian factions,"" Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters news agency. Israel has yet to comment on a ceasefire. The military said it had struck 15 Hamas military targets in the northern Gaza Strip and an additional 25 in Khan Yunis in the south, adding that the strikes were continuing. The operation came during another Friday of protests by Palestinians at the border between Israel and Gaza. The Israeli army said three projectiles had been fired into Israel by Palestinian militants. Israel last week carried out its biggest attack against Hamas targets in Gaza since the war in 2014, in response to more than 200 rockets and mortars fired into the country. A relative of a Palestinian killed by Israeli troops on Friday reacts at a hospital in the central Gaza Strip Palestinians have now been protesting at the border for 17 weeks. Gaza health officials say more than 130 Palestinians have been killed and 15,000 injured by Israeli forces during that time. The death of a soldier on Friday is the first Israeli fatality in the exchanges. Human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force. Israel says it has only opened fire in self-defence, or on people trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the demonstrations. Following Friday's clashes, the UN's envoy for the Israel-Palestinian conflict called on all sides to ""step back from the brink"" of war. ""Everybody understands that unless the situation is defused we will very quickly be back to another confrontation,"" said Nickolay Mladenov. ""I expect all parties, all sides to do their best right now. Not next month, not next week, right now, to prevent this escalation."" Mr Mladenov called specifically on Hamas and Islamic Jihad - the two largest militant factions in Gaza - to end the launch of rockets and prevent attempts by Palestinians to breach the border fence. A Palestinian protester taking part in violent protests at the Gaza border on Friday Israel resumed air attacks on Gaza after last week's projectile attacks, warning that it would take whatever action necessary to stop incendiary kites and balloons being flown over the border. It accuses Hamas of controlling the makeshift devices, which have set fields in Israel ablaze, as well as orchestrating the protests at the border, which Israel regards as a threat to its border communities. The past week had seen efforts to try to keep the situation under control, but Israel's Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned on Friday of a ""much tougher"" response against Hamas if continued to fire rockets from the Gaza Strip. ""If Hamas continues to fire rockets then Israel will respond in a much tougher way than they think,"" Mr Lieberman said in a statement. Israel deals 'hardest blow' to Hamas Gaza barrage triggers Israeli air strikes Israel strikes Gaza after mortar barrage Israel: Iran behind Gaza border violence Thousands attend funeral for Gaza medic Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests?

"Thomas Wyllie and Alex Bolland said they would eliminate students who were ""infecting the gene pool"" Two teenage boys who plotted a Columbine-style shooting at a school have been detained. Thomas Wyllie and Alex Bolland, both 15, planned to shoot and kill pupils and teachers at the school in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. Wyllie was handed a 12-year custodial sentence while his co-defendant was given 10 years. The teenagers, who were 14 at the time, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder at Leeds Crown Court in May. Yorkshire breaking news: Iron Age settlement found under roundabout, part of canal closed to save water Jurors heard they were motivated by their ""worship"" of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 13 people and themselves at Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999. Items including petrol, a bag of screws and a balaclava were found in an abandoned shed used by the boys as a hideaway Following their arrests in October 2017, both boys tried to claim the Yorkshire plot was nothing more than a fantasy. But sentencing the pair, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a ""firm plan with specific targets in mind"" using ""indiscriminate explosives"". She described the pair's friendship as ""a noxious relationship"", adding ""those two saw themselves as anti-heroes, with the power to choose who lives and who died."" The judge concluded Wyllie and Bolland intended to cause ""terror on the scale of the school shootings that have been seen in America"". Wyllie wrote in his diary about his desire to carry out an attack Prosecutors said Wyllie, who was described as the ring-leader, was motivated by a ""far right-wing"" and ""twisted ideology"" which he had discussed in a diary - along with a desire to carry out a school attack. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described his journal entries as ""desperately sad words"" for a boy with a family. The pair downloaded bomb-making manuals, researched weapons online and had drawn up a ""hit-list"" of targets that included students who had bullied and wronged them, as well as teachers. Wyllie also had a rucksack filled with screws, boards and flammable liquid that he kept in a secret hideout in Catterick Garrison. Prosecutors suggested they were instruments for making an explosive device which was to be used in the plot. Detectives recovered messages between the pair plotting the shooting, while another chat revealed Bolland telling a friend ""no-one innocent will die"" The jury heard Wyllie told a female friend he wanted to become a ""natural born killer"". In court, the girl's mother described him as ""primitive, devious and controlling"". The boys were interviewed by police after Bolland, who was bullied at school, messaged a friend in September 2017 to tell her about the plan. In the message, he claimed he and Wyllie were doing a ""service to society"" and would eliminate students who were ""infecting the gene pool"". The next day, Bolland made ""clear and unvarnished confessions"" to a teacher and to police officers. In a series of message exchanges, Wyllie told Bolland: ""If you're gonna kill yourself, shoot up the school."" Prosecutor Paul Greaney QC told the court the bullying suffered by Bolland was a motivation for the attack and said the pair ""were driven by a desire for revenge"". Police searched a number of locations in Northallerton when the teenagers were arrested and a secret hideout was found by officers Boys, 15, guilty of 'Columbine' plot School attack plot not 'childish fantasy' School gun plot accused boy 'is caring' School shooting plot 'service to society' Gun plot teen 'fled house with knife' 'Shooting plot teen had kill list' Teens 'plotted Columbine-style attack' HM Courts Service Popular seaside town with 'dramatic coastline' sees winter holiday 'boom' Crash on key road in York has been cleared Dog walker sexually assaulted in York village Country pub shuts doors suddenly, citing 'disastrous budget' IN PICTURES: Here are the photos that made the news in Scarborough back in 2005 Crash on key road in York - traffic in both directions LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Karen McDougal says she was tricked into staying silent about the alleged affair US President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen secretly recorded his client discussing payments to a former Playboy model, US media report. The tapes were reportedly discovered during an FBI raid on Mr Cohen's property earlier this year in New York. The New York Times reports that on the recording Mr Trump and Mr Cohen discuss paying Karen McDougal, who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. The tape was reportedly made two months before the election. The Department of Justice is looking into alleged hush money paid to women who claim they had a relationship with Mr Trump. Mr Cohen, who has not been charged, is reportedly under investigation for possible bank and tax fraud, as well as potential violation of election law. His lawyer Lanny J Davis said in a brief statement on Friday that he was ""sensitive"" to the ongoing investigation but added: ""Suffice it to say that when the recording is heard, it will not hurt Mr Cohen. Any attempt at spin cannot change what is on the tape."" The president has said that Mr Cohen is no longer his personal lawyer In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Ms McDougal sold her story to the National Enquirer, which is owned by a personal friend of Mr Trump. She says the $150,000 (Â£115,000) agreement gave the tabloid exclusive story rights and banned her from talking publicly about the alleged affair. But the Enquirer did not publish her kiss-and-tell, and she says she was tricked. On Friday, another Trump lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, initially told the New York Times that the president and Mr Cohen had discussed payments to Ms McDougal on the tape. But he said no money was actually ever transferred, and the recording itself amounted to ""powerful exculpatory evidence"". Who is Michael Cohen? Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' He later told the New York Times that the two men had in fact spoken about paying the Enquirer for rights to the story, thereby repaying the tabloid the amount it had given to Ms McDougal. The Washington Post,externalreported that Mr Trump and Mr Cohen discussed possibly paying American Media Inc, the parent company of the National Enquirer, for the rights to Ms McDougal's story. The Wall Street Journal,externalreported that the taped September 2016 conversation took place in person rather than over the phone, and the recording cut off after less than two minutes. Federal investigators have reportedly demanded the tabloid's records on the McDougal payment. This video can not be played Was Trump's Stormy Daniels payment legal? Ms McDougal says she had a 10-month affair with Mr Trump in 2006, a year after he wed Melania Trump. When questioned about the allegations, President Trump has denied the affair and said he had no knowledge of any payment. In May, President Trump admitted that he had reimbursed Mr Cohen for a payment he made to another woman to hush up her claims of an affair. Why the raid on Trump's lawyer is a big deal Mr Trump had previously denied all knowledge of the $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels as part of a non-disclosure agreement. Ms Daniels says she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006. Non-disclosure agreements of the type signed by Ms Daniels and allegedly by Ms McDougal are not in themselves illegal. It is a potential problem for Mr Trump because undisclosed payments to bury embarrassing stories about a political candidate can be treated as a violation of US campaign finance laws. Mr Cohen once famously vowed he would take a bullet for Mr Trump. But he told ABC News this month that his loyalty to his family and country came before his old boss. His comments stoked speculation that he might co-operate with investigators against Mr Trump, although there has been no confirmation so far that he has done so. The president has said that Mr Cohen is no longer his personal lawyer.

"This video can not be played The victims were remembered at a candlelit vigil The 17 victims who died when a tour boat sank in a Missouri lake on Thursday included nine members of one family, officials in the US state say. A surviving relative told US media that the boat's captain had told the 31 passengers not to put on life jackets. The amphibious ""duck boat"" capsized during a rapidly deteriorating thunderstorm on Table Rock Lake, a popular tourist attraction. Missouri Highway Patrol said the ages of the deceased range from one to 70. The woman who says she lost nine members of her family has been named as Tia Coleman. She is one of two in her family to have survived. ""I lost all my children, I lost my husband, I lost my mother-in-law, I lost my father-in-law, I lost my uncle, I lost my sister-in-law - she was my sister - and I lost my nephew, I'm OK, but this is really hard,"" she told Fox News. ""The captain told us 'Don't worry about grabbing the life jackets, you won't need them,' so nobody grabbed them because we listened to the captain and he told us to stay seated. ""However in doing that, when it was time to grab them it was too late. I believe that a lot of people could have been spared."" A relative who was not on the boat told WSB-TV that the other member of the family who survived was a boy, the station said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

One of the boats made it to shore but the other was driven back by the wind and eventually overwhelmed.

The vessel sank in 40ft (12m) of water before plunging to a final depth of 80ft. 'Placid'lake The vessel was on the water after a weather warning was issued. But the owner of the tour boat company, Jim Pattison, said he had been told by employees that the storm had ""came out of basically nowhere"". ""Usually the lake is very placid and it's not a long tour, they go in and kind of around an island and back. We had other boats in the water earlier and it had been a great, sort of calm experience,"" he said.

The accident happened as thunderstorms rolled through the American Midwest, uprooting trees and felling power lines. At the time of the accident, winds reached around 65mph (104 km/h), according to the National Weather Service. There are hundreds of so-called duck boats in use around the world. The amphibious vehicles are popular with tourists and have been providing tours for decades. Five people were killed when a bus collided with a tour vehicle in Seattle The most serious incident was in 1999, whena duck boat listed and sank just minutes after entering Lake Hamilton in Arkansas,external. Thirteen people were killed, including three children, after they became trapped beneath the vehicle's canopy. The cause was later reported to be ""uncontrolled flooding"" due to a loose part. The sightseeing vehicles are based on a design used during World War Two to transport personnel and supplies over land and water - known as the DUKW. The DUKW, a six-wheel-drive amphibious truck, was first made in the US in the mid-1940s to deliver people and materials ashore where no port facilities existed. Some 21,000 DUKWs were produced for use during the war. Many served on D-Day and in the Normandy landings.

"Britons heading abroad at the start of the summer are being hit by the poorest exchange rates for almost nine months. On Friday, the Moneycorp bureau at Stansted airport was offering just â¬0.89 for each pound on Friday, one of the lowest rates ever seen. Holidaymakers heading to the US were getting just one dollar for each pound. Both are far below the wholesale rate at which banks are buying and selling the currencies between each other. On the official foreign exchange market, the pound was worth â¬1.1169, whilst against the dollar it was worth $1.3043. Tourists offered 86 cents for a pound How to get the best foreign exchange rates The pound fell below $1.30 on Thursday - its lowest level since September last year -after a surprise fall in retail sales in June, confounding expectations of an increase. What's the pound exchange rate near you? Please tweet your pictures of currency exchange rate boards to @BBCBusiness and let us know A survey of airport bureaux de change by the currency firm Fair FX has found that the average rate being offered across the UK is â¬0.97 for each pound. The poor rates once again represent unfortunate timing for holidaymakers. Last summer, travellers going through Southampton airport were offered just 86 euro centsfor each pound sterling, thought to be the lowest rate on record. It comes on the same day that figures were published by the Office for National Statistics, showing that Britons spenta record Â£44.84bn,externalabroad last year, a rise of 2.4% on 2016. Advice for travellers trying to save money on exchange rates includes pre-ordering cash on the internet, or using specialist cards with low fees to take money abroad. ""If you pre-order online, and collect the cash when you get to the airport, you will still get the online rate,"" said Sally Francis-Miles, money spokesperson at Moneysupermarket. ""If you're going abroad in the next month, you've still got time to order a specialist overseas credit card. If you're going in the next week, cash is probably best,"" she told the BBC. Some firms also allow you to lock in to an exchange rate, months before you travel.

"Seeing how NHS staff feel ""undervalued"" is ""heartbreaking"", the new Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. In his first speech since taking the job, Mr Hancock said he was horrified at the level of bullying reported by staff. The British Medical Association welcomed the sentiment but said it needed to be underpinned by action. Mr Hancock, the former digital and culture secretary, also pledged Â£487m for technology in the NHS. Of the money pledged, Â£412m will be used to improve technology in hospitals and to give more patients access to health services at home. The remaining Â£75m will be put towards replacing paper systems with electronic ones - a move intended to reduce medication errors. It comes after it was revealed last weekthat some hospitals are still reliant on fax machines. Addressing staff at West Suffolk Hospital on Friday, Mr Hancock said: ""Let this be clear: tech transformation is coming."" Some of the funding will go towards replacing paper systems with electronic ones Mr Hancock also spoke about his love for the NHS, which he credited with saving his sister's life after she had a horse-riding accident. Professional rider Emily Gilruth, 41, was in a coma for four days after she fell and hit her head while competing at Badminton Horse Trials in May last year. Speaking publicly about the accident for the first time, Mr Hancock said: ""Last summer my sister sustained a very severe head injury. It was touch and go and her life was saved by the intensive care unit at Bristol's Southmead Hospital, where she stayed for a week, most of it in a coma. ""Thanks to their care she has now recovered."" He added: ""I love my sister and the NHS saved her life, so when I say I love the NHS, I really mean it."" NHS still reliant on 'archaic' fax machines 'Tax rise needed' to fund NHS spending boost 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Addressing NHS staff concerns, Mr Hancock pledged to champion the workforce and announced a consultation exercise on workforce issues. The British Medical Association has previously saidthat GPs are leaving the profession at an increasing rate due to feeling undervalued, fuelling a crisis in the sector. Mr Hancock also called for an end to the ""over-prescription of unsophisticated drugs"", focusing instead on approaches that address a person's physical and mental well-being. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said patients would feel ""sorely let down"" that reducing waiting lists ""isn't the first priority of the new health secretary"". ""Investment in technology is welcome but years of Tory austerity has seen hospitals build up a Â£5bn repair backlog, resulting in clinicians nationwide using hundreds of pieces of equipment that are years out of date, as recently revealed by Labour. ""And commitments to prevention will ring hollow without reversing the substantial cuts to public health budgets, which are set to reach Â£800m by 2020/21."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Mr Hancock takes on the job of health secretary as the NHS develops its 10-year plan. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas pledged to increase health spendingby Â£20bn a year in real terms by 2024. After the speech the new health secretary was asked whether he had any plans to change existing NHS targets. This video can not be played Matt Hancock said the NHS has asked for ""a set of targets that are more clinically appropriate"" These include treating, assessing or discharging 95% of patients within four hours of arriving at A&E in England. The target has not been met since 2015. Mr Hancock said he had been asked by the NHS to consider whether they were still ""clinically appropriate"".

"US President Donald Trump says he is ready to intensify his trade war with China by slapping tariffs on all $500bn of imports from the country. ""I'm ready to go to 500,"" he said in an interview with the CNBC channel. Mr Trump's comments come before the most recent round of US tariffs has had time to take effect. Last week, Washington listed $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of additional Chinese products it intends to place tariffs on as soon as September. The list named more than 6,000 items,externalincluding food products, minerals and consumer goods such as handbags, to be subject to a 10% tariff. It is still under public consultation, to last until the end of August. The President has also been complaining that a strengthening dollar has been hurting US business. In a series of tweets he blamed the higher dollar on currency ""manipulation"" by China and the European Union. Mr Trump also criticised the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. ""The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all we have done,"" he said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Trade war: Why you should care The US and China have already imposed tit-for-tat tariffs of $34bn on each other's goods. The President's threat to raise that to $500bn represents a major escalation. ""We're down a tremendous amount,"" Mr Trump told CNBC, reiterating his view that China's trade surplus with the US amounts to unfair trading practices. When asked if the move might cause a stock market sell-off, he responded: ""Well, if it does, it does. Look, I'm not doing this for politics. I'm doing this to do this right thing for our country."" The US also wants China to stop practices that allegedly encourage transfer of intellectual property - design and product ideas - to Chinese companies, such as requirements that foreign firms share ownership with local partners to access the Chinese market. Mr Trump has previously hinted at such an escalation, telling reporters two weeks ago that there was ""$300bn in abeyance"" after the $200bn of goods covered by the latest list, but this is his most explicit threat yet. Many companies in the US are opposed to the administration's use of tariffs against China, saying they risk hurting business and the economy without being likely to change behaviour. European stock markets fell after the interview was broadcast, with the FTSE 100 down 0.4% in afternoon trade. ""It's proof, if it were needed, that the president is prepared to go all the way in the trade war to exact concessions from China, which simply cannot match the US firepower,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. ""In light of the EU and others saying they are ready to respond to tariffs on cars, the stakes are rising fast. Whether we get to the point where there is a full-blown trade war remains debatable, but the odds are shortening by the day.""

"Khalid Ali was found guilty of preparing an act of terrorism in the UK and two counts of possessing an explosive substance with intent A plumber has been jailed for life for planning a terror attack in Westminster and making bombs for the Taliban. Khalid Ali, 28, from Edmonton in north London, was arrested on 27 April 2017 in Parliament Street, London, where he was caught carrying three knives. It was later revealed that he had spent five years in Afghanistan making bombs. He will serve with a minimum term of 40 years for preparing an act of terrorism in the UK and two counts of possessing an explosive substance with intent. Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said that all three convictions were ""very grave indeed"". Taliban bomb-maker guilty of Westminster plot Plumber's terror plan foiled by fingerprints How police foiled Khalid Ali's Westminster terror plot Ali had been ""part of a very substantial operation engaged in terrorist activity in Afghanistan"", he said. The judge said the UK plot was designed to attract ""maximum publicity and instil terror"". He added: ""I am sure your plan was to attack and kill someone in central London. ""Your preparations were complete and you very simply had to identify your precise target and his or her death was very likely to be caused by a knife attack. ""I think you would have killed any police officer you could."" Judge Hilliard passed life sentences with minimum terms of 40 years for the explosives offences, and life with a minimum term of 25 years for planning an attack in the UK - which will run concurrently. On 22 April last year - one month after the Westminster terror attack - Ali was seen on CCTV walking past a number of high profile locations in central London, including the MI6 building, Westminster Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and Whitehall. Five days later, his mother called police and said she had found four knives in his bedroom. He was arrested later that day, just metres from Downing Street. This video can not be played Khalid Ali was arrested in Whitehall on 27 April 2017 The court heard how Ali had travelled to Afghanistan in 2011 and spent five years making bombs to maim and kill coalition troops. He returned to the UK in early November 2016 and was stopped at Heathrow airport, interviewed by police and had his fingerprints and DNA samples taken. His fingerprints were found on component parts of explosive devices that were handed in to US forces in Afghanistan in 2012. During police interviews, Ali admitted having ""pressed the button"" on more than 300 remote controlled bombs in Afghanistan and said he had returned to the UK to deliver a ""message"" to those in power. Addressing the judge on Friday, prosecutor Brian Altman QC said the explosives convictions included the ""likelihood of multiple deaths being caused"", and the preparatory offence relating to Westminster was ""a fully-fledged plan nipped in the bud by the authorities"". Police earlier defended the decision not to arrest Ali until April 2017, saying security services had been ""managing any potential risk he posed"" and that he was arrested at the most appropriate time"".

"Rising temperatures in the Arctic are encouraging Barnacle geese to speed up their migration journeys north every spring, says a new study. But their efforts to go faster are leaving them too drained to lay their eggs early when they arrive. This is bad news for the species as their chicks are hatched too late to take advantage of the best food, so fewer are surviving. The scientists involved say the birds will have to adapt and migrate earlier. Wanted: Inspiring name for Mars rover DNA shows Iceland whale was rare hybrid Slower ocean current to boost warming Every spring these geese set out from their temperate wintering grounds in the North Sea, often stopping off in the Baltic to rest on their way to their breeding areas in the Russian Arctic. However climate change is seeing spring arrive earlier in the Arctic, something the geese are blissfully unaware of, until about half way through their journeys. ""The greening of vegetation as they fly probably gives them information about the earlier spring - as they see things more green that's a cue for them to hurry up, that's what we think,"" author Bart Nolet from the Netherlands Institute of Ecology told BBC News. In their rush, the geese are not making their normal detour to the Baltic where they refuel. This is leaving them in a bad state when they finally arrive in Russia. ""The female sits on the eggs for three weeks almost in a row, so she really needs to arrive there with enough body stores - but by skipping a stopover she arrives with too little reserves to start laying immediately,"" said Prof Nolet. Normally the geese hatch before the spring and can take advantage of what the scientists term ""peak food"", when the quality and the quantity of foraging are at their height. As they are now missing this moment, fewer goslings are surviving over the summer. To adapt to this critical problem, the geese will have to learn how to leave their wintering grounds earlier. This is difficult as they seem to decide when to fly based on day length, something that isn't changing with the rise in temperatures. Barnacle goslings are struggling as they are born at the wrong time One possibility might be moonlight grazing. ""They could be able to do that if they forage on moonlit nights as they sometimes do,"" said Prof Nolet. ""They would then be able to fuel up earlier and depart earlier and that would solve the problem of arriving too late,"" he said. Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal, Current Biology.

"This video can not be played Russia released military footage - including its new ultra-fast missiles Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has raided a space research facility after a suspected leak of hypersonic missile secrets to Western spies. The state space agency Roskosmos said its security staff were co-operating with FSB officers on a criminal case. Russia's Kommersant daily says about 10 staff at a Roskosmos facility called TsNIIMash are under suspicion. A director's office was searched. Hypersonic missiles fly at more than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5). On Thursday the Russia defence ministry released video of two new hypersonic missile systems - called Kinzhal and Avangard. Both can deliver nuclear warheads. But Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer told the BBC he was very sceptical about their effectiveness and dismissed the video as ""propaganda"". He called the spy investigation ""politically embarrassing"". The suspects in the secrets case could be charged with high treason, Kommersant reports. A Kinzhal missile is seen here carried by a MiG-31 jet over Moscow in May ""It was established that the leak came from TsNIIMash employees,"" a source close to the FSB investigation told the paper. ""A lot of heads will roll, and for sure this case won't end just with a few dismissals,"" the source said. TsNIIMash is a top scientific subsidiary of Roskosmos.

They are like the tradition of dragging enormous missiles through Red Square for show. It's propaganda, and President Putin loves it when the Russian military feeds him that stuff. Guys were working on these projects in Soviet times, but they were put on hold in the 1990s. Western armed forces also have a need to scare their own parliaments to get more money, so they always exaggerate tenfold the Russian threat. Kinzhal is just an Iskander [short-range] missile attached to a plane - that creates problems, as it was not designed for such a range. It doesn't have a detachable warhead, and the probability of it disintegrating on re-entry into the atmosphere is much higher. Nor can it hit moving targets. The targeting data has to be put into the missile before launch. The Avangard gliding warhead is a re-entry vehicle designed to perform erratic hypersonic manoeuvres to baffle defence systems. But that design increases the risk of it disintegrating and it loses accuracy. These systems add nothing to the Russian nuclear deterrent. The problem is, there is no missile defence to baffle - the systems Mr Putin is talking about do not exist in Western armies. Pavel Felgenhauer covers military issues for Russia's Novaya Gazeta daily. He spoke to the BBC from Moscow Russia's defence ministry has broadcast video of what it calls a new generation of nuclear-capable missiles. Some are launched by bombers, others are shown being launched from silos or mobile launch vehicles. President Vladimir Putin spoke about the systems in March, including the Kinzhal missile, which can reach Mach 10 - about 12,000km/h (7,456mph) - with a range of 2,000km. The Russian video blurred out engineers' faces and all identification numbers The Kinzhal, already in service, is launched from MiG-31 or Tu-22M3 jets. Interfax news agency says Kinzhal-armed MiGs patrol over the Caspian Sea. The FSB also searched offices at the United Rocket and Space Corporation (ORKK) in Moscow. Kommersant says a state corporation called Tactical Missile Arms handles hypersonic projects, but TsNIIMash works very closely with it.

"Charlie Rowley collapsed in his home in Amesbury after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok Novichok victim Charlie Rowley has been discharged from hospital, three weeks after being exposed to the nerve agent. Salisbury District Hospital said he had been through an ""appalling experience most of us could never imagine"". Mr Rowley, 45, and his partner Dawn Sturgess, 44, collapsed at his house in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on 30 June, where police found a bottle containing the nerve agent. Ms Sturgess later died on 8 July and a murder inquiry has been launched. Lorna Wilkinson, Salisbury District Hospital's director of nursing, said the day was ""tinged with sadness"" after the death of Ms Sturgess. ""We continue to think both of Charlie and of Dawn's family, and support them as they go through the difficult process of coming to terms with her death,"" she said. Police 'identify Novichok suspects' Novichok victim's sister recalls 'goodbye' Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Ms Wilkinson added that Mr Rowley had been decontaminated to ensure the nerve agent could no longer affect him or anyone who comes into contact with him. There have only been five victims of Novichok poisoning to be treated at Salisbury District Hospital, she said. Public Health England's medical director Paul Cosford said Mr Rowley's discharge from hospital ""creates no risk to anyone in the community"". He reiterated that the public should not pick up items such as syringes, needles, cosmetics or objects made of plastic, metal, or glass. Wiltshire Police said it would ""continue to coordinate activity at a local level to ensure that Mr Rowley continues to receive the support he needs in his ongoing recovery"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned in March, but both survived The poisoning is thought to be linked to the attack onRussian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were discovered slumped on a bench on 4 March in nearby Salisbury. They have since been discharged from hospital. The UK government has blamed Russia for the incident, but the country's authorities deny any involvement. Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July after being taken ill on 30 June Mr Rowley's brother Matthew has said his siblingpicked up a perfume bottle containing the toxic substance. The Metropolitan Police, which is leading the investigation, refused to confirm the claim but the force had previously said the substance was found in a ""small bottle"". On Thursday, a coroner's inquest was opened and adjourned for mother-of-three Ms Sturgess. Her sister Stephanie told the hearing she was present when doctors informed her of the decision to switch off her sibling's life support. ""I then said my goodbyes to Dawn before leaving hospital,"" she said. Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on Friday 29 June. They both then fell ill on Saturday 30 June, and Ms Sturgess died eight days later. Counter-terrorism police are investigating five sites in Salisbury and Amesbury, in an attempt to identify where the couple came into contact with the nerve agent. On Wednesday, internationalchemical weapons experts completed their investigationsin Amesbury, where they sought to identify whether the substance that poisoned the couple was from the same batch used against the Skripals. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will analyse the substance before reporting back its conclusions. Police are believed to have identified the perpetrators of the Novichok poisoning on the Skripals,according to Press Association sources. The news agency reported several Russians were thought to be involved in their attempted murder in Salisbury. They are believed to have been identified through CCTV, cross-checked with border entry data. This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera considers how likely is it Russia poisoned the Skripals The Met Police, which is leading the investigation, and the Home Office have both declined to comment.

"A bus sits at the side of the road in LÃ¼beck after a knife attack A man armed with a knife has attacked passengers on a bus in the northern German city of LÃ¼beck, wounding several people, one seriously, police say. A 34-year-old local man was arrested and taken into custody. Police said there was no indication the suspect had been politically radicalised. They said on Twitter that 10 people were known to have been hurt. Local media reports put the number at 14. An area around a bus stop in the city's KÃ¼cknitz neighbourhood was sealed off. Police said a smoking backpack was found in the bus, containing a ""fire accelerant"" but no explosives. Police declared a ""major operation"" ""The exact number of injured is still unclear. There were no dead,"" police said in a statement. ""The background to the crime is still unclear and is the subject of the ongoing investigation."" The statement added: ""The identity of the perpetrator has been clarified: a 34-year-old German citizen resident in LÃ¼beck. There are currently no indications the man was political radicalised and no signs of a terrorist background."" The attack took place at 13:47 local time (11:47 GMT). An eyewitness told the local LÃ¼becker Nachrichten newspaper that a passenger had just given up his seat for an older woman, when the attacker stabbed him in the chest. The bus driver pulled over to the side of the road and passengers fled. Police said the suspect was overpowered by officers at the scene. In April, a man drove a camper van into a group of people outside a restaurant in the German city of MÃ¼nster, killing two people before shooting himself dead. Police said there was no link to terrorism in that case. In Berlin in December 2016, a Tunisian who had links to Islamist militants hijacked a truck and ploughed into a Christmas marketplace, killing 12 people.

"Brussels must be told that the prime minister's blueprint for future UK-EU relations is ""the final offer"", Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has said. Mrs Leadsomtold The House magazine,externalthe Chequers plan must be taken seriously or the EU risked a ""no deal"" Brexit. Boris Johnson and David Davis quit the cabinet over the prime minister's plan. Theresa May has denied claims the trade proposals were ""dead in the water"" after accepting Brexiteers' changes to the Customs Bill this week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. Cliff-edge Brexit fears back in boardrooms Reality check: EU's 'no deal' plans Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan May: White Paper 'delivers Brexit people voted for' After a meeting of the cabinet at Chequers, last week the government published a White Paper setting out its preferred trading relationship with the EU. The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. But the proposals, including a ""common rule book"" between the two sides, angered many Tory MPs. Mrs Leadsom, who campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum, told The House the prime minister was ""planning to engage quite strongly"" with Brexiteers over the next few days to ""help them to understand"" why the Irish border is a serious issue. She said it was incumbent on the government to ""make the case"" for the Chequers agreement - but that the EU must know that it was a final offer. ""The EU has simply not taken us seriously so far in terms of the future agreement. ""What this deal does is it says to them, 'right, now we can have a free trading area where there won't be the need for border checks and controls'. ""It's saying to the EU, 'you better take this seriously'. In my view, it's take this seriously or we are heading for no deal. The message to the EU has to be, 'this is the final offer'."" Please upgrade your browser She said the EU were not going to ""wriggle away at it and we're going to accept it. It is a very hard and fast offer to the EU that makes sense for them. ""But if they don't accept it, we're also ramping up our no deal preparations. That's where we will be heading and they will have forced us to do that. ""My message to the EU is, 'take this seriously because otherwise, you're forcing us down the road of no deal'."" Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit. The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards. But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date fast approaching.

"Artwork: The ExoMars rover would land on the Red Planet in early 2021 Here's your chance to name the European rover that will go to Mars in 2020. Currently called ExoMars, the six-wheeled robot needs something a bit more engaging and inspiring for when it lands on the Red Planet. Astronaut Tim Peake is leading the hunt for a great moniker. He wants everyone to go toa special website,externalset up for the purpose and enter a suggestion. But don't think ""Spacey McSpaceFace"" is a goer because this is not an online poll. All ideas will be put before an expert panel and it is they who will make the final choice. Fetch, rover! Robot to retrieve Mars rocks What's it like to ride a rocket to Mars? Curiosity sees Mars methane swing European Space Agency astronaut Tim Peake at Friday's air show event The vehicle is currently being assembled at the Airbus factory in Stevenage. Its job when it lands on Mars in 2021 will be to seek out signs of present or past microbial life. The robot will even have a drill to dig 2m into the ground to see if any bugs are hiding away from the surface. Tim says thinking about the rover's mission might be the source for a great name. ""I often get asked, 'is there life out there beyond Earth?'. It's a very fundamental question, and it's one that this rover is going to try to answer,"" he told BBC News. Dr David Parker, the director of human spaceflight and robotics at the European Space Agency, agreed: ""The Americans called their Mars rovers Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity. We've tended in the past to name our missions after famous scientists. ""But, yes, perhaps this time we go with a name connected with the search for life - biology, genetics, DNA, whatever. Who knows? We just want a great name."" Rover development is being led from Airbus in the UK Britain acquired the naming rights for the rover at Esa's Ministerial Council in 2014. It got them because the country is the key financial contributor to the rover; part of Europe's two-part ExoMars project. The other part is a satellite that is already orbiting the planet studying its atmosphere. However, the UK Space Agency says it wants the search for a name to be as wide as possible. This means anyone resident in an Esa member state can put forward a suggestion (including associates, eg Canada). There's a big push on to develop the engineers of tomorrow Tim Peake launched the name search at the Farnborough International Air Show on Friday. He used the same event to kick off theHoliday Makers campaign,external- an initiative aimed at getting children making, inventing and exploring engineering. The campaign is running a series of free family-friendly activities and events across the country as part of the government'sYear of Engineering,external. The Esa man was helped by Dr Suzie Imber, from the University of Leicester's Department of Physics and Astronomy. Suzie won the BBC show Astronauts: Do You Have What It Takes?"" She said: ""It's always a delight to open young people's eyes to how exciting engineering and science can be and the government's Year of Engineering campaign is a fantastic way that scientists like Tim and me can share some of the amazing research that is happening in labs across the country, and the vital role engineers play in this."" The naming website,externalis hosted by Airbus.Full T&Cs are available [PDF],external. The name can be a single word, a short combination of words, or an acronym. It must not have been used for a past, current or proposed space mission. Ideas should be accompanied by an explanation of no more than 150 words. If a person's name, that person must have died on/before 10 October 1993. The search website will close to entries at 23:59 BST on 10 October 2018. A UK Space Agency expert panel will choose the best suggestion. The winning entry will earn a tour of the Airbus factory building the rover. Think hard! Only one name suggestion will be accepted from each entrant.

Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said all bodies have now been recovered from Thursday's accident. The vessel was carrying 31 people when it overturned on Table Rock Lake, a popular tourist attraction near the town of Branson. The captain of the amphibious boat survived, but the driver did not.

"The closure is likely to last throughout August unless there is significant rainfall A 55-mile section of Britain's longest canal could close for a month unless there is significant rainfall. From 30 July, the Canal and River Trust will close locks along the Leeds & Liverpool route amid water supply concerns. While the closure will prevent boats travelling from Wigan, through Lancashire, and up to Gargrave, near Skipton, the towpath will stay open. The trust said the closure is likely to last throughout August. Trust spokesman Daniel Greenhalgh said it had been ""a difficult decision"" to close the canal, and that it had been working with boating businesses to offer alternative routes. Sarah Toole, who often visits the canal at Barrowford in Lancashire, said it was a ""necessary evil"" to maintain water levels. Daniel Greenhalgh from the Canal and River Trust said it had been ""a difficult decision"" But Martin Cleaver, who runs a day-trip boat on the canal at Foulridge near Colne, said tourism would suffer. He said: ""We pass 10 or 12 boats a day, that's quite a lot of people on holiday, and when you're on holiday you spend money.

"This video can not be played Theresa May was speaking during a visit to Northern Ireland on Friday The European Union must ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals regarding the Irish border, Theresa May has said. The prime minister made the remarks in Belfast on Friday, during a two-day visit to Northern Ireland. The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in Brexit talks so far. The UK and EU have agreed that there should be no hard border in Ireland, but are at odds over how to achieve it. IMF: Ireland faces hit from 'no deal' Brexit Leadsom: Chequers plan is 'final offer' Barnier questions May's Brexit plan Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The backstop solution is effectively an insurance policy -  to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if appropriate customs arrangements cannot be agreed by the EU and UK in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020. The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. However, the UK said that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea. On Friday, Mrs May again repeated her opposition to that, saying: ""The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal 'third country' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". She also said both sides in the negotiation  ""share a determination never to see a hard border in Northern Ireland"". ""And no technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet, or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border"". However,EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has questioned Mrs May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU,saying it could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. Michel Barnier has asked the UK for clarification on its Brexit White Paper He saidthe UK's Brexit White Paper, published on 12 July, opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"". Mr Barnier questioned whether plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical. Earlier this week, the government backed anamendment to its Customs Billthat would make it illegal for Northern Ireland to be outside the UK's customs territory. Mrs May said the EU's backstop proposal would be a breach of the Belfast Agreement - and that her plan, agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers earlier this month, was the best way forward.

""What I've said to the EU is that the legal text they've produced is not acceptable, that's why we proposed an alternative to that,"" she said. She said there now needed to be a renewed focus on EU-UK negotiations with ""increased pace and intensity"". The prime minister also met several of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the visit was ""anything but reassuring"". Arlene Foster called on the EU to show more flexibility in the negotiations around the border ""In fact it's now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,"" Mrs McDonald said. However, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, defended the prime minister. ""What she has done is set out her agenda, that's very important. She talked about working together to find solutions, and the need to work collaboratively,"" she said. Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the government was committed to getting a legal text for a backstop. Earlier, the Irish TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney tweeted that if the UK did not accept the EU wording on a backstop in the draft withdrawal agreement, they would have to propose an  alternative that would deliver the same result.

Reacting to his comments, Mrs Bradley said while the EU had put forward a legal text, ""we do not accept it"". ""We've put forward a counter proposal and we're now working on how we get a backstop that we are committed to delivering but it has to be a backstop that respects the integrity of the whole UK and does not put a border in the Irish sea."" The PSNI and GardaÃ­ (Irish police) stand exactly on the border in Belleek, County Fermanagh, ahead of Theresa May's visit The Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, told the BBC Labour had always been ""very clear"" that the UK should be part of the customs union. EU and UK negotiators have been meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the border issue. Irish PM steps up Brexit preparations Brexit: All you need to know What do the EU's 'no deal' preparations say? The PM and the DUP leader visited Belleek Pottery near the Irish border on Thursday Friday's speech in Northern Ireland marks the prime minister's first major attempt to sell the Chequers agreement since it was reached by her cabinet earlier this month. She is due to tour other parts of the UK over the summer in an attempt to persuade businesses and citizens of its benefits. Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit. The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards. But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching. The Republic of Ireland will remain within the EU and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"". Mrs May also addressed the impasse at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without a government for 18 months, after power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. She added that until devolution is restored, the government would fulfil its responsibilities but warned interventions from Westminster were ""no substitute"" in the long-term.

"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

"The future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is proving to be a massive challenge in the Brexit negotiations, and talk of ""no deal"" is making a lot of people nervous. But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important. The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead. How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Officereleased figures on 29 June,external, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself. That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports. Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea. Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction. One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage. When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit."" ""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years."" Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain. But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone. So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does.

"A bus sits at the side of the road in LÃ¼beck after a knife attack A man armed with a knife has attacked passengers on a bus in the northern German city of LÃ¼beck, wounding several people, one seriously, police say. A 34-year-old local man was arrested and taken into custody. Police said there was no indication the suspect had been politically radicalised. They said on Twitter that 10 people were known to have been hurt. Local media reports put the number at 14. An area around a bus stop in the city's KÃ¼cknitz neighbourhood was sealed off. Police said a smoking backpack was found in the bus, containing a ""fire accelerant"" but no explosives. Police declared a ""major operation"" ""The exact number of injured is still unclear. There were no dead,"" police said in a statement. ""The background to the crime is still unclear and is the subject of the ongoing investigation."" The statement added: ""The identity of the perpetrator has been clarified: a 34-year-old German citizen resident in LÃ¼beck. There are currently no indications the man was political radicalised and no signs of a terrorist background."" The attack took place at 13:47 local time (11:47 GMT). An eyewitness told the local LÃ¼becker Nachrichten newspaper that a passenger had just given up his seat for an older woman, when the attacker stabbed him in the chest. The bus driver pulled over to the side of the road and passengers fled. Police said the suspect was overpowered by officers at the scene. In April, a man drove a camper van into a group of people outside a restaurant in the German city of MÃ¼nster, killing two people before shooting himself dead. Police said there was no link to terrorism in that case. In Berlin in December 2016, a Tunisian who had links to Islamist militants hijacked a truck and ploughed into a Christmas marketplace, killing 12 people.

"Clare O'Neill was injured when car-jackers made off in her Audi from her driveway in Acocks Green A mother was run over as she ""battled"" to stop car-jackers driving off with her four-week-old baby. Clare O'Neill, 39, said the two men who stole her Audi ""clearly knew"" daughter Eliza was in the back seatwhen they fled the scene in Birmingham. The pair had, Ms O'Neill said, put their ""personal greed"" before the life of her baby girl. Mum and daughter were reunited after Eliza was found in her car seat, dumped at a health centre three miles away. Ms O'Neill suffered facial injuries, a broken tooth and ""severe pain"" to her arm when the wheel of her car ran over her. Midlands Live: Man charged after 'long bow' seized; Homes evacuated after large grassland fire Her wounds had left her struggling to hold Eliza, she said. Ms O'Neill arrived home in Marie Drive, Acocks Green, at about 16:00 BST, where two men confronted her and demanded the keys to her car. As she tried to get her daughter out of the vehicle, the men drove off, leaving her injured. Ms O'Neill, who has been discharged from hospital, said she was ""extremely shaken"" by what happened and the family was still ""trying to come to terms with what happened"". She appealed for anyone with information to come forward, and said: ""The life of my daughter was endangered by the reckless behaviour of those involved"". ""Eliza is thankfully safe and well, but the people responsible clearly knew she was in my car when it was taken, putting the life of our four-week-old baby at risk as a result of their personal greed"". Officers are continuing to search for the stolen grey Audi A3 S-line, registration BJ66 YLV. Police said the car-jackers in Marie Drive had put the mother through a ""45-minute nightmare she will never forget"" West Midlands Police said one line of inquiry involves looking into a similar car-jacking on Jameson Road, in Nechells at 13:30 BST on 16 July, but said they are ""not definitely linked"".

"Hackers have stolen personal data in Singapore belonging to some 1.5 million people, or about a quarter of the population, officials say. They broke into the government health database in a ""deliberate, targeted and well-planned"" attack, according to a government statement. Those targeted visited clinics between 1 May 2015 and 4 July of this year. Data taken include names and addresses but not medical records, other than medicines dispensed in some cases. ""Information on the outpatient dispensed medicines of about 160,000 of these patients"" was taken,the statement,externalsays. ""The records were not tampered with, ie no records were amended or deleted. No other patient records, such as diagnosis, test results or doctors' notes, were breached. We have not found evidence of a similar breach in the other public healthcare IT systems."" The data of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, including information on his outpatient dispensed medicines, was ""specifically and repeatedly targeted"". Mr Lee has survived cancer twice. Singapore, a wealthy city state, prides itself on its stability and security. Singapore PM's website is hacked Singapore profile What are malware, patches and worms? It appears that a computer belonging to SingHealth, one of the state's two major government healthcare groups, was infected with malware through which the hackers gained access to the database. They struck some time between 27 June and 4 July, according to the government. SingHealth has temporarily banned staff from accessing the internet on all 28,000 of its work computers, according to the Straits Times.,external The move is aimed at plugging leaks from work e-mails and shared documents as well as guarding against possible cyber-attacks. Other public healthcare institutions are expected to do the same. The government has previously warned of cyber-attacks, saying it has been the target of international hackers, but most attacks were foiled. It has stepped up measures in recent years, including disconnecting computers for certain key ministries in the civil service from the internet, so that they operate on intranet only. A cyber-attack last year targeted the defence ministry but only got basic information on military conscripts. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's website was hacked in 2013 In 2013, Mr Lee's official website was ""compromised"" by people claiming to be members of the hacking group Anonymous. The hackers posted an image of a Guy Fawkes mask - the symbol of the Anonymous group - on the prime minister's site with the words: ""It's great to be Singaporean today."" Anonymous had earlier threatened to target infrastructure in Singapore in what it said was a protest against licensing regulations on news websites. Singapore is not the only country to be subjected to high-profile attacks by hacking groups. Others include: Earlier this year, Germany's government IT network was attacked by hackers targeting the interior ministries' private networks. It was reported that a group known as Fancy Bear was responsible In February, the US and UK said that the Russian military was behind a ""malicious"" cyber-attack on Ukraine last year that spread globally. Moscow denied being behind the attack A cyber-attack crippled the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and other organisations around the world in May last year. A hacking group in North Korea known as Lazarus is believed to have launched the attack, which involved malware known as WannaCry In 2014, the US claimed that North Korea was behind cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures, after the entertainment company released a film featuring the fictional killing of its leader Kim Jong-un Health records are often targeted because they contain valuable information to governments, says Eric Hoh, the Asia Pacific president of security company FireEye. ""Nation states increasingly collect intelligence through cyber espionage operations which exploit the very technology we rely upon in our daily lives,"" he says, adding: ""Many businesses and governments in South East Asia face cyber threats, but few recognise the scale of the risks they pose.""

Thirteen people were killed, including three children, after they became trapped beneath the vehicle's canopy. The cause was later reported to be ""uncontrolled flooding"" due to a loose part. The sightseeing vehicles are based on a design used during World War Two to transport personnel and supplies over land and water - known as the DUKW. The DUKW, a six-wheel-drive amphibious truck, was first made in the US in the mid-1940s to deliver people and materials ashore where no port facilities existed. Some 21,000 DUKWs were produced for use during World War Two. Many served on D-Day and in the Normandy landings.

"Hackers have stolen personal data in Singapore belonging to some 1.5 million people, or about a quarter of the population, officials say. They broke into the government health database in a ""deliberate, targeted and well-planned"" attack, according to a government statement. Those targeted visited clinics between 1 May 2015 and 4 July of this year. Data taken include names and addresses but not medical records, other than medicines dispensed in some cases. ""Information on the outpatient dispensed medicines of about 160,000 of these patients"" was taken,the statement,externalsays. ""The records were not tampered with, ie no records were amended or deleted. No other patient records, such as diagnosis, test results or doctors' notes, were breached. We have not found evidence of a similar breach in the other public healthcare IT systems."" The data of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, including information on his outpatient dispensed medicines, was ""specifically and repeatedly targeted"". Mr Lee has survived cancer twice. Singapore, a wealthy city state, prides itself on its stability and security. Singapore PM's website is hacked Singapore profile What are malware, patches and worms? It appears that a computer belonging to SingHealth, one of the state's two major government healthcare groups, was infected with malware through which the hackers gained access to the database. They struck some time between 27 June and 4 July, according to the government. SingHealth has temporarily banned staff from accessing the internet on all 28,000 of its work computers, according to the Straits Times.,external The move is aimed at plugging leaks from work e-mails and shared documents as well as guarding against possible cyber-attacks. Other public healthcare institutions are expected to do the same. The government has previously warned of cyber-attacks, saying it has been the target of international hackers, but most attacks were foiled. It has stepped up measures in recent years, including disconnecting computers for certain key ministries in the civil service from the internet, so that they operate on intranet only. A cyber-attack last year targeted the defence ministry but only got basic information on military conscripts. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's website was hacked in 2013 In 2013, Mr Lee's official website was ""compromised"" by people claiming to be members of the hacking group Anonymous. The hackers posted an image of a Guy Fawkes mask - the symbol of the Anonymous group - on the prime minister's site with the words: ""It's great to be Singaporean today."" Anonymous had earlier threatened to target infrastructure in Singapore in what it said was a protest against licensing regulations on news websites. Singapore is not the only country to be subjected to high-profile attacks by hacking groups. Others include: Earlier this year, Germany's government IT network was attacked by hackers targeting the interior ministries' private networks. It was reported that a group known as Fancy Bear was responsible In February, the US and UK said that the Russian military was behind a ""malicious"" cyber-attack on Ukraine last year that spread globally. Moscow denied being behind the attack A cyber-attack crippled the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and other organisations around the world in May last year. A hacking group in North Korea known as Lazarus is believed to have launched the attack, which involved malware known as WannaCry In 2014, the US claimed that North Korea was behind cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures, after the entertainment company released a film featuring the fictional killing of its leader Kim Jong-un Health records are often targeted because they contain valuable information to governments, says Eric Hoh, the Asia Pacific president of security company FireEye. ""Nation states increasingly collect intelligence through cyber espionage operations which exploit the very technology we rely upon in our daily lives,"" he says, adding: ""Many businesses and governments in South East Asia face cyber threats, but few recognise the scale of the risks they pose.""

""That's going to be special!"" said Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, when he was told about the invitation during a live interview.

The Republican president's 18 months in office have been dogged by investigations into whether any of his aides colluded with alleged Russian attempts to sway the 2016 election in his favour. Mr Trump and Mr Putin have poured scorn on the claims. In a CNBC interview televised on Friday, Mr Trump said he and Mr Putin ""get along well"", even if they did not always see eye to eye. ""It wasn't always conciliatory in that meeting,"" Mr Trump said. ""We discussed lots of great things for both countries, frankly."" He did not offer further details. Mr Trump also vowed to be the Russian leader's ""worst nightmare"" if their relationship ever turns sour, and said former President Barack Obama had been Mr Putin's ""total patsy"". By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump has tweeted that the summit with Mr Putin was a ""great success"" and people at ""higher ends of intelligence"" loved his Helsinki news conference. As if to underline that point, plans are already under way for a sequel - this time in Washington DC. Never mind that the White House has spent three days trying to clean up the political fallout from the summit amid bipartisan criticism, or that the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in 2016 continues apace. This video can not be played Trump says he ""misspoke"" at Putin summit, but is it too late? Anthony Zurcher explains Mr Trump may have been encouraged by recent opinion polling showing that while the public at large is uneasy with Mr Trump's Russia policies, his Republican base - by a sizeable majority - is fine with his performance. The president campaigned on closer ties with Russia, a goal that had been thwarted during his first year in office. With his base still behind him, Mr Trump appears ready to press on with his efforts. Mr Putin, in power in Russia since 2000, last visited the US in 2015, when he met President Barack Obama, Mr Trump's predecessor, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York to discuss the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Mr Putin said he would meet the US ""halfway"" over access to indictees On Thursday, White House press secretarySarah Sanders tweeted,externalthat discussions about a visit by Mr Putin to Washington DC this autumn were already under way. Russia's ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, could not confirm whether an invitation had already been issued. He told the BBC: ""The problem is there's so much talk today, so much fake news, so much distortion, about what happened at this summit. ""Such negativity for some reason - I don't understand why the Western media think it's bad that two presidents are meeting. What's bad about it?"" The announcement of a second summit appeared to come as a surprise to Mr Trump's director of national intelligence. ""Say that again,"" Mr Coats said when an NBC News presenter broke the news to him during a live interview at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. He said he did not yet know what Mr Trump and Mr Putin had discussed during their meeting, at which only the pair and their interpreters were present. The White House is said to be furious about the director of national intelligence's remarks. ""Coats has gone rogue,"" one senior official told the Washington Post. At the post-summit news conference in Helsinki, Mr Putin offered access to 12 Russians indicted in absentia by the US authorities for allegedly hacking Democratic Party computers, on condition Moscow authorities could question 12 Americans over other matters. Mr Trump first praised the suggestion as an ""incredible offer"", but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders later said the president disagreed with it. No extradition treaty exists between the two countries. Mr Putin singled out US-born financier Bill Browder, accusing him of massive tax fraud, which he denies. Mr Browder was instrumental in the US imposing sanctions in 2012 on top Russian officials accused of corruption inthe Magnitsky affair. ""I'm thankful that Donald Trump has no intention of handing me over to Vladimir Putin to have me killed in a Russian prison,"" Mr Browder told the BBC on Thursday. One of the other Americans on Russia's list was a former US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul. This video can not be played Russian ambassadors react to Trump remarks at Helsinki summit The idea of allowing Russia to quiz US citizens sparked outrage and the US Senate voted 98-0 against it.

"The US mid-term elections will take place on 6 November At least three congressional candidates have been targeted by hackers ahead of the US mid-term elections, according to Microsoft. Tom Burt, an executive at the firm, made the revelationduring a security conference panel,externalin Colorado. The three candidates appear to have been targeted by phishing attacks, he told the audience. One cybersecurity expert said the hacking was probably an attempt to ""undermine the democratic process"". US voters will go to the polls on 6 November to elect a swathe of new members of Congress, senators and state governors. The tech giant discovered the apparent foul play after checking fake Microsoft web domains that had been associated with espionage in 2016. A group exploiting the domains is known by many as ""Fancy bear"" but has been dubbed ""Strontium"" by Microsoft. Some cybersecurity firms, including SecureWorks and Mandiant, believe the hackers are linked to Russian intelligence. Russia has consistently denied allegations of hacking. Mr Burt told the Aspen Security Forum attendees: ""Earlier this year, we did discover that a fake Microsoft domain had been established as the landing page for phishing attacks and we saw metadata that suggested those phishing attacks were being directed at three candidates who were all standing for election in the mid-term elections."" In other words, the hackers tried to trick the candidates into visiting a bogus Microsoft web page. This video can not be played The US Director of National Intelligence reacts to Putin visit news: 'That's going to be special...' Mr Burt did not name the affected candidates but said they were all potentially ""interesting targets from an espionage standpoint"". He added that the hackers were not successful in accessing the three candidates and that the fake Microsoft domain had been taken down. The hackers might have been trying to gain access to the candidates' personal messages or emails, for example, said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey. ""If you can grab emails... you can start making people look bad,"" he said. ""I think the primary motive is to undermine the democratic process so it doesn't matter which candidate they manage to subvert."" In comments to the press during his visit to Helsinki earlier in the week, President Trump said ""no"" when asked if he thought that Russia was continuing to interfere in American elections. However, his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that the president actually had responded ""no"" to a query of whether he would be taking further questions. Last week, the US Director of National Intelligence said Russian attempts at hacking US targets remained ""persistent... regardless of whether it is election time or not"". Prof Woodward told the BBC: ""Every single intelligence agency, including the British ones, have said it's ongoing, it's an ongoing onslaught and the finger seems to point at Russia.""

" Words and photography: Marc EllisonIllustrations: Ozo Ezeogu Warning: Disturbing content Sitting on a chipped wooden bench, the three-year-old swings her legs excitedly. Her sandals barely touch the floor as she watches a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon. It is hard to believe Comfort is a witch. Yet this is why she and her two older siblings are now living in an emergency shelter in the city of Calabar, in the southeast corner of Nigeria. It's little more than a basement with a television and half a dozen threadbare mattresses. The door is locked most of the time for the children’s own safety. The shelter was intended to be a temporary solution - a stop-gap until the children could be placed with extended family. But no-one wants to risk bringing the children - all of whom have been branded witches - into their homes. Once her cartoon has finished, Comfort totters outside and lifts her shirt to reveal a sea of whitened welts across her back. These ragged scars trace the outlines of the red-hot machete that a neighbour used to force her to “confess”. Names of the children in this story have been changed.Illustrations are superimposed on top of photos to protect identities. In early February, Comfort and her sister Hope, 15, and five-year-old brother Godbless had been living with their grandmother Christiana in nearby Akampka. Their parents had died suddenly in unexplained circumstances, and while this had made Christiana wary of the children, she had agreed to take them in. Already diagnosed as HIV positive and not taking her anti-retroviral drugs, Christiana's health was failing and she was becoming increasingly thin and frail. Blaming the children for her ailing health, Christiana took them to her local church for guidance. There, a so-called prophet confirmed her worst fears - the children were branded witches. For Christiana, this explained everything - the death of her daughter and son-in-law, her sickness, and the children’s rowdy behaviour. Shortly afterwards, a neighbour called Rankin overheard Christiana accusing the children of cutting the rope of the washing line in the family compound - blaming their witchcraft for their actions. After talking to Christiana and finding out more about the accusations, Rankin returned the next day with a friend. “He started beating us and told us to untie our grandmother from the witchcraft world,” says Hope. The children tried to escape through the surrounding palm trees but were quickly rounded up by the two men and taken to the neighbour’s house. Their hands and feet were bound, and Rankin heated up a machete blade in the coals of a nearby fire. “They then asked us if we were witches,” says Hope from the safehouse in Calabar. “We said, ‘No’.” “So he started beating us in turn with the hot machete, from morning until afternoon.” Blood bloomed black on the ground as again and again they were asked to confess. “We eventually said, ‘Yes’,” says Hope. “Then they asked us if we are the ones that killed our father and mother - we said, ‘Yes’. “They asked us if all these troubles in our family - we are the ones who caused them - we said, ‘Yes’.” When I visit the mud-walled church where the children say they were branded and beaten, the prophet they say labelled them as witches is not there. Instead I meet pastor Israel Ubi. He claims no-one at the church makes such accusations, or conducts deliverance ceremonies to exorcise alleged witches. “There is no witchcraft here,” he says. When pushed on the subject, he acknowledged that the church did deal with “marine spirits and demons” that many in the Niger Delta believe live in and around oceans, seas and rivers. It was the children’s uncle Sunday who reported the machete incident to the police. The taxi driver, who says he doesn’t believe in witchcraft, angrily dismisses the “prophet” who branded the children. “As a result of her health, my mother believed in [his] words. Prophets - they are criminals, they are people who are destroying people’s lives.” The stigmatisation of children as witches is a recent phenomenon in the Niger Delta region, which suddenly exploded in the 1990s. Before that, elderly women were the main targets of witchcraft accusations. By 2008, it was estimated that 15,000 children had been branded in the southeastern states of Akwa Ibom and Cross Rivers. According to research from that period, cases that had been documented included children and babies who had had nails driven into their heads, been forced to drink cement, set on fire, scarred by acid, poisoned, and even buried alive. A separate 2010 Unicef report notes it is typically vulnerable children with physical disabilities, or illnesses such as epilepsy, who are targeted. Others are branded for appearing withdrawn, lazy, or unruly. Nigeria’s criminal code prohibits accusing, or even threatening to accuse, someone of being a witch. And the Child Rights Act of 2003 makes it an offence to subject any child to physical or emotional torture, or submit them to any inhuman or degrading treatment. However, while this piece of legislation was enacted at the national level, the country’s 36 states are still required to formally ratify it. This not only gives individual states exclusive responsibility - it allows them to make laws relevant to their specific situations. Only about three-quarters of Nigeria’s states have domesticated the Child Rights Act, and to date only the state of Akwa Ibom has included specific provisions concerning the abuse of alleged child witches. Its 2008 law made witch branding punishable by a custodial sentence of up to 10 years. And despite lobbying attempts, Cross River State has yet to amend its own 2009 version of the legislation to specifically outlaw the offence. But regardless of the fragmented attempt to criminalise it, witch-branding continues under the noses of the state governments and police of Akwa Ibom and Cross River states. Oliver Orok, minister of sustainable development and social welfare for the Cross River State government, told the BBC the ministry was “working assiduously to eliminate these practices”. “The state government in partnership with Unicef and other development partners organised a summit to deliberate on amending the law to include, among other things, the issue of branding children as witches and its consequences,” says Mr Orok. The minister says ""criminal law has abolished such practices"". However, 10 years on, no-one has been successfully prosecuted in the courts. There has been an increase in advocacy across the state to deal with the issue, Mr Orok says, and that money had been made available to build a home for children at risk. He adds that if the government was made aware of cases, it “would move against such churches and their prophets”. Lawyer James Ibor argues that the police are poorly funded, and not equipped to carry out these types of investigations. “Often we have to push for investigations,” he says.Ibor runs a local organisation in Calabar called Basic Rights Counsel Initiative (BCRI), which specialises in legal cases concerning child rights abuse - it also runs the emergency shelter where Comfort and her siblings are staying. He tells me about two children who were poisoned by their father, who believed they were witches. He pleaded guilty, but there were no resources to send blood samples to Lagos to confirm the children’s cause of death. One year on, their bodies remain in the morgue, and the father has yet to be tried. Ibor claims that cases have stalled for years. He says his job is made harder by the reluctance of the police and government to investigate controversial issues combined with a lack of willingness from families and communities to provide evidence. About a quarter of his ongoing cases relate to witchcraft, he says. But this phenomenon is not just restricted to Nigeria's more remote regions. Just six months ago, the Nigerian media reported on 40 children who were rescued from a witchdoctor’s “torture camp” in the capital of Abuja. And this May in Lagos, a boy was badly beaten by his mother with a koboko, or horsewhip. “So we have the laws,” says Ibor. “The problem is not the laws - the problem is implementing these laws and until then our children are not safe.” And he blames some of the “prophets” and “pastors” for sowing fear across the Niger Delta region where poverty and a belief in witchcraft are widespread. Sweat slaloms down the girl’s face as she pirouettes across the cement floor. A man catches her by the waist, before twirling her around the airless hall. But this is no dance recital – this is a brutal ballet designed to deliver the child from witchcraft. Welcome to the deliverance of Joy. Welcome to the Streams of Life Ministry. It is a Friday evening and suffocatingly hot inside the hall of the Pentecostal church. Three pastors have formed a tag-team to heal the 15-year-old.Over the course of 30 minutes they take turns slapping her head, pinching her earlobes, and grabbing at her stomach. “Your clothes are on fire, your head is on fire, your belly is on fire,” they repeatedly scream in her face as they twist her around and around. Joy raises her hands in self-defence. Four children have been identified by Pastor Eunice Emmanuel to be “exorcised” this evening. The youngest is just eight years old. “The power comes from the Holy Spirit,” she explains before the ritual begins. “He empowers us to do His work, to administer salvation to the children. “When you pray for the children you see the spirits manifest, speaking through them - you will hear them speaking.” “By the time the deliverance is complete, the child becomes like a madman who has recovered his sanity.” The pastor explains that her Calabar-based ministry is ultimately offering a service to the wider community. These deliverances not only stop parents from disowning their children, they stop the spirits from leading them astray, she says. “And who knows, they may go to marry your daughter,” she adds, “So before you know it, the witchcraft we are running away from is already in your house.” Pastor Eunice addresses the spirit she accuses Joy of harbouring. “Do you go to a coven? Are you a witch? Do you drink blood? Do you eat flesh? Do you kill?” “I have destroyed one person,” Joy finally cries.Only when the girl finally collapses on to the floor is the deliverance considered a success. Lawyer James Ibor says Pentecostal churches like these encourage their congregations to blame witchcraft for their misfortune or personal failures. One recent case involved a boy who was beaten when the family motorbike broke down; in another, a girl was accused, and flogged by her father after he lost his job. “They sell fear so that they can keep members who continually pay offerings and tithes (weekly donations). “That is the only way they will stay relevant and keep making money.” Last year the UN convened its first workshop focused on witchcraft, both in Nigeria and other countries. In its final report, it stated that “the exact number of victims of such abuse is unknown, and is widely believed to be underreported”. It also recognised the role that “supernatural entrepreneurs” play in diffusing and legitimising fears related to witchcraft, and in particular, child witches. Bassey recalls how two girls were accused by a pastor two years ago at the Divine Zion of God Church in the small town of Akpabuyo in Cross River State. A pregnant congregant had gone past her due date by several weeks, and the seven and 10-year-old girls were held to be responsible and branded witches. The woman had approached a pastor at her local church and paid for a consultation. Although she gave birth successful shortly after, the damage had been done. A week later, Bassey heard the girls' screams as he returned from his fields. They had been tied to a palm tree, and were being beaten with canes and machetes by three men. Ebe Ukara, a desk officer for the Child Rights Implementation Committee in Akamkpa, says that 60% of the child abuse cases that cross her desk are witchcraft-related, and more often than not prompted by a pastor’s declaration. Those pastors, she says, can make a tidy profit from people who turn to them for help, although she stresses that not all Pentecostal churches are out to hoodwink their followers. But for the “fake prophets”, children are the easy targets who can be blamed for the poverty and misfortunes that plague families and communities. Judging from the billboards that adorn roundabouts - from the capital of Abuja to the Niger Delta - beer and salvation are big businesses in Nigeria, commodities to be bought and sold. Every other poster promises some miracle - how to get that job, find a spouse, deal with miscarriages, cure infertility, and of course, eradicate witchcraft. But these posters underline the two keycharacteristics of the Pentecostal doctrine that has spread throughout Nigeria since the 1970s. Firstly, this form of Christianity emphasises success and plenty - if someone is failing in life then this is a sign that something is suspiciously awry. Secondly, Pentecostal churches portray the world as a literal battleground between Godly forces and demonic spirits. So the new Pentecostal movement has since popularised the notion that material fortune is universally available, but that access to it can be blocked by supernatural forces. But these Nigerian church leaders are not acting out any traditional African religion or superstition. On the contrary, Nigerian Pentecostal leaders have copied their American televangelist counterparts whose churches often behave more like builders of economic empires than religious organisations. This has resulted in a religious hybridisation where indigenous beliefs in the supernatural world have been combined with an extreme form of Christianity that critics say manipulates their congregants. “Those ‘mushroom’ churches are a big problem - their prophets operate in profits,” says Ukara. This phrase mushroom churches is often used to describe the smaller and more informal prayer houses that seem to sprout up quickly almost overnight. These are largely unregulated. One such church is the Ark of Noah, which operates from a house in Calabar South. The tiny Winnie the Pooh slippers outside the front door are the only hint that a deliverance is underway inside. In a canary yellow shirt, Prophet Gideon Okon stands praying over the three children accused of being witches. “God opens my eyes to see people’s problems,” Okon says. “That’s how I know who is a witch.” He says that nobody brings children to him, that his revelations come to him when he fasts. “If that person is ready and willing to be delivered, then we start talking a price,” he says. Okon says that the final figure varies depending on the type of ritual that needs to be performed. “The strongest and hardest to kill are marine spirits,” he says. “For that I would charge about 200,000 Naira ($556), but that’s negotiable with the parents.” In the Niger Delta region, the average person is lucky to make a pound a day. But Okon, who used to work for a construction company, later denies that he charges for his services. He says he accepts “donations”. After several hours of prayers and singing, the three children - aged between 10 and 15 - are forced to drink a green, viscous liquid from a soft drink bottle. It is the first thing they have been allowed to consume after three days of forced fasting. Okon tells me it is a blend, of water, palm oil, sand, leaves and seven ground centipedes. “God told me what ingredients to use”, he says. “They are specific to the person.” Only when they vomit, are the children deemed to have been “healed”. The film industry in Nigeria - known colloquially as Nollywood - is booming. It pumps out more than 2,500 movies a year, making it the second-largest producer after Bollywood in India. These movies typically fall into five distinct genres - romance, comedy, historical epics, gangster stories, and the so-called “hallelujah” category which promotes strong religious messages. They can be seen in beauty parlours, bars, restaurants and on buses. They are not only popular in Nigeria, but across Africa and in the diaspora. Evil School, Family of Witches, School of Witches are but a few of the more recent examples of Nollywood movies that negatively portray children as witches. The most infamous is End of the Wicked, which focuses on the Amadi family which is living with the father’s mother - who we find out is a witch in a coven. The family’s children are influenced to join the cult, and in the movie are shown eating flesh and plotting to murder their parents. Produced by the Liberty Gospel Church, the 1999 movie also starred the church’s leader Helen Ukpabio as the pastor who ends up heroically exposing and destroying the coven. The film was hugely controversial and, at the time, was widely blamed for the surge in witchcraft accusations against children in the years that followed. It was criticised for blurring the line between fact and fiction. It not only used the real-life pastor starring as herself, but the film begins with a note that this is part of an expository series. Nigerians themselves have criticised such movies for proliferating pernicious stereotypes about the continent. In a recent book chapter on the influence of Nollywood films on culture, academic Françoise Ugochukwu references the viewpoint of one frustrated Nigerian in an online forum. “Films of this type have painted an even more negative image of Nigeria...making it appear to be a nation bogged down by superstitions and primitive beliefs,” reads one post on the forum. “Isn’t it bad enough for the West to demonise every aspect of our traditions, and now we are doing it to ourselves? “Does anyone seriously think that all our ancestors did was sit around performing so called satanic rituals all day?” Lawyer James Ibor argues it was movies like End of the Wicked that not only popularised the notion that children could be witches, but that people could easily become witches by eating tainted food. “The narrative changed with the influx of Nollywood in the 90s,” he claims. “Walk into any movie shop here, and select randomly 50 different films and I bet you 80% of them are on witchcraft and juju.” But paradoxically one of the main reasons for the popularity of Nollywood films is that they provide a platform for Africans to tell their own stories. One Nollywood film producer, Orok Atim, says that however “negative” the theme of witchcraft may be, it is an issue that affects the lives of Nigerians - hence they expect to encounter it when watching Nigerian films. Orok Atim is sat in front of a makeshift shrine on the set of his latest movie. While his latest film is actually a love story (pictured), Atim has a passion for making movies about the supernatural. His next movie will be about a deceased friend’s experience of witchcraft. “Witchcraft exists in our society today,” he says. “If you don’t show what is happening in society then you are just wasting your time. “I use my movies to educate, entertain, and to tell the world that witchcraft is real.” None of his films explicitly portrays children as witches. Atim argues that, far from perpetuating traditional beliefs in the supernatural, his movies allow Nigerian audiences to face their fears. Through special effects, his movies make the invisible visible; they give people a visual perception of something spiritual that is rarely seen but is regularly talked about. And Atim baulks at the idea that movies like End of the Wicked could be responsible for a rise in child witchcraft accusations. “[But what you are saying is] just a rumour to kill the Nollywood movie industry,” he adds. “No-one would just come up with a story that does not exist.” Diana-Abasi Udua Akanimoh, who works for the NGO Way to the Nations in Akwa Ibom state, says she has witnessed first-hand the ripple effect witchcraft-themed films can have. “I went to a church here in Eket and the pastor was talking about stopping marine spirits and witchcraft,” she says. “He started telling his congregation that he had seen such things recently in a movie.” “So people who are ignorant will be thinking, ‘Oh, if the pastor is saying this then that means this is the truth’.” Akanimoh, who manages a safe house for children accused of being witches, says that while films may not be the root cause of these accusations, they certainly build upon tradition to justify their actions. And social worker Ebe Ukara claims that “people watch these movies and imitate what they see these advanced prophets doing”. Ukara was involved in the rescue of Comfort and her siblings after they were beaten by the prophet and attacked with the machete. “Movies today are teaching a lot of things that were never practised before,” she says. “Carrying a child to a church to beat them - that never used to exist.” But minister Oliver Orok says the government doesn't believe Nollywood is to blame for the problem, but rather the “long customs and traditions of some communities”. Charity is just one of the many children now living on the streets after being accused of witchcraft. For the past two years, the 13-year-old has been living in a makeshift hut in the middle of a dump site on the outskirts of Calabar. Inside four girls of a similar age are still curled up sleeping - there are no mattresses, there are no mosquito nets. Life here is hard, but on a good day she can make 1,500 Naira ($4) foraging for recyclable plastic soda bottles and tin cans among the piles of trash at the site. “I feel good living here,” Charity whispers. “Going back to live at my uncle’s house would be like putting me inside the fire.” After her father died, she went to live with her uncle. When he tried to sleep with her, she was accused by his wife of bewitching him. “They tied my hands, and threatened to throw me down the pit latrine,” she says. “They kept me like that for a day,” she says. “So I just told that I am a witch so that they would untie me.” After her “confession” her uncle stopped feeding her, and she decided to run away. The Lemna dump is home to a few hundred skolombo - street children - like Charity. Many share a similar story - they were either thrown out or fled their homes after being accused of sorcery. A handful of Nigerian organisations such as the Basic Rights Counsel Initiative (BRCI) and Way to Nations try to do more than just rescue youngsters accused of witchcraft - they try to reunite them with the very relatives who have ostracised them. Such attempts are rarely successful, even with extended family members. Back in Calabar, James Ibor is facing the dilemma of what to do with Comfort and her two siblings. They want to leave the shelter, but none of their relatives wants them. “How do we break the news to these children that your aunties, your uncles are not willing to even see you?” he says. “These kids then maybe start to even think that they are witches.” This article was made possible by funding from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

"The US mid-term elections will take place on 6 November At least three congressional candidates have been targeted by hackers ahead of the US mid-term elections, according to Microsoft. Tom Burt, an executive at the firm, made the revelationduring a security conference panel,externalin Colorado. The three candidates appear to have been targeted by phishing attacks, he told the audience. One cybersecurity expert said the hacking was probably an attempt to ""undermine the democratic process"". US voters will go to the polls on 6 November to elect a swathe of new members of Congress, senators and state governors. The tech giant discovered the apparent foul play after checking fake Microsoft web domains that had been associated with espionage in 2016. A group exploiting the domains is known by many as ""Fancy bear"" but has been dubbed ""Strontium"" by Microsoft. Some cybersecurity firms, including SecureWorks and Mandiant, believe the hackers are linked to Russian intelligence. Russia has consistently denied allegations of hacking. Mr Burt told the Aspen Security Forum attendees: ""Earlier this year, we did discover that a fake Microsoft domain had been established as the landing page for phishing attacks and we saw metadata that suggested those phishing attacks were being directed at three candidates who were all standing for election in the mid-term elections."" In other words, the hackers tried to trick the candidates into visiting a bogus Microsoft web page. This video can not be played The US Director of National Intelligence reacts to Putin visit news: 'That's going to be special...' Mr Burt did not name the affected candidates but said they were all potentially ""interesting targets from an espionage standpoint"". He added that the hackers were not successful in accessing the three candidates and that the fake Microsoft domain had been taken down. The hackers might have been trying to gain access to the candidates' personal messages or emails, for example, said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey. ""If you can grab emails... you can start making people look bad,"" he said. ""I think the primary motive is to undermine the democratic process so it doesn't matter which candidate they manage to subvert."" In comments to the press during his visit to Helsinki earlier in the week, President Trump said ""no"" when asked if he thought that Russia was continuing to interfere in American elections. However, his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that the president actually had responded ""no"" to a query of whether he would be taking further questions. Last week, the US Director of National Intelligence said Russian attempts at hacking US targets remained ""persistent... regardless of whether it is election time or not"". Prof Woodward told the BBC: ""Every single intelligence agency, including the British ones, have said it's ongoing, it's an ongoing onslaught and the finger seems to point at Russia.""

"The Public Health Agency has warned of the dangers of sunburn More than 200 people were treated for sunburn in Northern Ireland hospitals during the recent heatwave. The Belfast Trust saw the highest number of patients, with 69 needing treatment for sun-related issues. The Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) said the extra patients added pressure to the local health service. The Public Health Agency has warned that one episode of sunburn could double the risk of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. The significantly higher number of patients in the Belfast Trust reflects those who sought treatment at Belfast City, Royal Victoria and Mater hospitals. The HSCB urged people to be careful in the sun, reminding them that emergency and 999 services were for life-threatening and serious conditions. ""By choosing the right care for you, this will help ensure that emergency departments are used appropriately and ease pressures on the service,"" said the board. Many common ailments can be treated effectively through self-care at home or by seeking advice from a pharmacist, it added. ""However, those with serious concerns about their health should of course always consult their GP or an out-of-hours service."" Sunburn can have dangerous consequences for children ""Being active and having fun outside is good for our health,"" said the PHA's senior health improvement officer, Denise McCallion. ""Not only can it lift our mood and allow us to get more active, but it provides Vitamin D, an essential vitamin for everyone to help develop and maintain healthy bones, teeth and muscles. ""But for most people, just a few minutes' exposure to the sun is enough to top up vitamin D levels, she added, and the sun could cause permanent skin damage if precautions are not taken. ""Just one episode of sunburn, especially in childhood, doubles the lifetime risk of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.""

"Spending time with nature offers ""precious breathing space"" from modern life, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called on the public to join the world's biggest butterfly count. The naturalist said watching butterflies in his garden takes his mind off ""the woes of Brexit"". The exercise involves spending 15 minutes counting butterflies and submitting the sightings online. The majority of butterfly species have been in decline for the past 40 years. However, this year, weather in the UK - a cold winter followed by settled weather during a late spring and summer - have created the right conditions for butterflies to flourish. Species expected to do particularly well include the holly blue and red admiral. This year could be a good one for the red admiral butterfly But if the hot conditions create a drought, the results could be ""catastrophic"" as plants wither and insects die through lack of food, said the charity Butterfly Conservation, which organises the count. This happened in 1976 when the butterfly population collapsed after the hot summer. In pictures: Brilliant butterflies in your back garden Butterfly origins pushed back in time Reality Check: Are butterflies getting rarer? As part of the Big Butterfly Count, Butterfly Conservationis asking the public,externalto spot and record 17 species of butterfly for the next three weeks. In addition to contributing to conservation knowledge, mental health charity Mind says spending time in nature can help alleviate problems such as depression and anxiety. The Big Butterfly Count takes place between 20 July and 12 August Sir David said being in nature ""offers us all precious breathing space away from the stresses and strains of modern life"". ""Some of my most memorable experiences have happened when I've been simply sitting and watching the wildlife that lives where I do,"" he added. And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm asking people turn their mind away from squabbles and problems about what's facing us with Brexit, sit in a quiet place where the sun is shining and see how many butterflies come. Butterfly Conservation President Sir David with a south east Asian Great Mormon Butterfly on his nose in 2012 ""That simple pleasures of looking at butterflies in the garden is calming to the soul and spirit and good for us all."" Asked on BBC Breakfast whether he had discussed the issue of plastics with the Queen when he met her, Sir David said he had not - and declined to be drawn on the royal family's attitude to the environment. Extinct butterfly to be reintroduced 'Eerie' caterpillar tree spotted Last year's big butterfly count,externalwas the largest ever with a record number of people - over 60,000 - submitting sightings. But despite this, the average number of butterflies seen per 15 minute count was the lowest recorded since the survey started in 2010. The reduced numbers of butterflies was partly due to ""topsy-turvy"" weather last summer, which was one of the wettest summers for 100 years. According toButterfly Conservation,,externalthree-quarters of British butterflies are in decline. Five species of butterfly have become extinct in the past 150 years.

"Dr Furtado described the death as a ""tragic accident"" A celebrity Brazilian cosmetic surgeon known as Dr Bumbum has been arrested after four days on the run following the death of one of his patients. Police say Dr Denis Furtado was detained in Rio de Janeiro thanks to an anonymous tip. His patient Lilian Calixto died following injections he gave her to enlarge her buttocks. Dr Furtado faces murder charges. His mother was also arrested and is accused of being an accomplice. Investigators say Dr Furtado carried out the procedure on Ms Calixto, a 46-year-old bank manager and mother-of-two, at his home in Rio de Janeiro - but she fell ill during the procedure. Dr Furtado took her to a hospital where her condition worsened and she died some hours later, police said. Local media reported that she arrived at the hospital suffering from an abnormally fast heart rate. Dr Furtado then disappeared. On Wednesday his lawyer said he was innocent and had not turned himself in to police because he was panicking. Rio police posted a photo of him alongside his mother, Maria de FÃ¡tima Barros Furtado, after their arrest. His girlfriend, Renata Fernandes, had already been arrested on suspicion of taking part in the procedure. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brazilian media said that his registration from the Federal Medical Council showed that he was licensed as a doctor in BrasÃ­lia and the nearby state of GoiÃ¡s, but he was not recorded as a specialist. The Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society said he was not a trained plastic surgeon. In a statement on its website, it said procedures should never be carried out in private homes, and it warned against using PMMA - a synthetic resin also known as acrylic glass filler - for any aesthetic purposes. In a Facebook post earlier this month, Dr Furtado had called PMMA ""a minimally invasive procedure, offering immediate and definitive results, using local anaesthesia and therefore painless, without much need of rest after the procedure"". It is believed that Ms Calixto had booked in for this treatment. Lilian Calixto went to Dr Furtado's apartment for the procedure to enhance her buttocks Ms Calixto had travelled 2,000km (1,250 miles) from her home in CuiabÃ¡, central Brazil, to undergo buttock enhancement by Dr Furtado on Saturday evening, reports said.

"Dr Furtado described the death as a ""tragic accident"" A celebrity Brazilian cosmetic surgeon known as Dr Bumbum has been arrested after four days on the run following the death of one of his patients. Police say Dr Denis Furtado was detained in Rio de Janeiro thanks to an anonymous tip. His patient Lilian Calixto died following injections he gave her to enlarge her buttocks. Dr Furtado faces murder charges. His mother was also arrested and is accused of being an accomplice. Investigators say Dr Furtado carried out the procedure on Ms Calixto, a 46-year-old bank manager and mother-of-two, at his home in Rio de Janeiro - but she fell ill during the procedure. Dr Furtado took her to a hospital where her condition worsened and she died some hours later, police said. Local media reported that she arrived at the hospital suffering from an abnormally fast heart rate. Dr Furtado then disappeared. On Wednesday his lawyer said he was innocent and had not turned himself in to police because he was panicking. Rio police posted a photo of him alongside his mother, Maria de FÃ¡tima Barros Furtado, after their arrest. His girlfriend, Renata Fernandes, had already been arrested on suspicion of taking part in the procedure. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Spending time with nature offers ""precious breathing space"" from modern life, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called on the public to join the world's biggest butterfly count. The naturalist said watching butterflies in his garden takes his mind off ""the woes of Brexit"". The exercise involves spending 15 minutes counting butterflies and submitting the sightings online. The majority of butterfly species have been in decline for the past 40 years. However, this year, weather in the UK - a cold winter followed by settled weather during a late spring and summer - have created the right conditions for butterflies to flourish. Species expected to do particularly well include the holly blue and red admiral. This year could be a good one for the red admiral butterfly But if the hot conditions create a drought, the results could be ""catastrophic"" as plants wither and insects die through lack of food, said the charity Butterfly Conservation, which organises the count. This happened in 1976 when the butterfly population collapsed after the hot summer. In pictures: Brilliant butterflies in your back garden Butterfly origins pushed back in time Reality Check: Are butterflies getting rarer? As part of the Big Butterfly Count, Butterfly Conservationis asking the public,externalto spot and record 17 species of butterfly for the next three weeks. In addition to contributing to conservation knowledge, mental health charity Mind says spending time in nature can help alleviate problems such as depression and anxiety. The Big Butterfly Count takes place between 20 July and 12 August Sir David said being in nature ""offers us all precious breathing space away from the stresses and strains of modern life"". ""Some of my most memorable experiences have happened when I've been simply sitting and watching the wildlife that lives where I do,"" he added. And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm asking people turn their mind away from squabbles and problems about what's facing us with Brexit, sit in a quiet place where the sun is shining and see how many butterflies come. Butterfly Conservation President Sir David with a south east Asian Great Mormon Butterfly on his nose in 2012 ""That simple pleasures of looking at butterflies in the garden is calming to the soul and spirit and good for us all."" Asked on BBC Breakfast whether he had discussed the issue of plastics with the Queen when he met her, Sir David said he had not - and declined to be drawn on the royal family's attitude to the environment. Extinct butterfly to be reintroduced 'Eerie' caterpillar tree spotted Last year's big butterfly count,externalwas the largest ever with a record number of people - over 60,000 - submitting sightings. But despite this, the average number of butterflies seen per 15 minute count was the lowest recorded since the survey started in 2010. The reduced numbers of butterflies was partly due to ""topsy-turvy"" weather last summer, which was one of the wettest summers for 100 years. According toButterfly Conservation,,externalthree-quarters of British butterflies are in decline. Five species of butterfly have become extinct in the past 150 years. The charity says that habitats being destroyed or deteriorating are the prime causes of long-term decline.

"MPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions over failings in the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases. A number of rape trials collapsed last year after it emerged vital evidence had not been given to defence lawyers. The Justice Select Committee said,externalAlison Saunders did not recognise the severity of the issue and there was ""insufficient leadership"". Ms Saunders said addressing problems in the system was her ""top priority"". She is due to stand down from her post in October at the end of a five-year contract. Police apologise for rape case errors All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed Evidence withheld in 47 sex assault cases In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case. But the Justice Committee's report said there have been ""persistent problems with the practice of disclosure"". ""We have seen at least six reports in as many years that have highlighted issues and made recommendations,"" it said. The committee said that despite this insight, Ms Saunders failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings. Their report also said the Crown Prosecution Service may have underestimated the number of cases halted because of issues with disclosing evidence. Data from the CPS showed 841 cases in 2017/18 had to be stopped. But the committee said it knows that the true figure is higher - saying the CPS may have underestimated the number by 90%. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said the police and CPS often see the disclosure of evidence as an ""administrative headache"" - a view which was ""not acceptable"". Mr Neill, a former barrister, added: ""Disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact. ""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result."" The committee found failings in the ""application of disclosure by police officers and prosecutors on the ground"" and called for a culture change, so it was seen as a ""core justice duty"", rather than an ""administrative add-on"". When it came to Ms Saunders, the committee said there was ""insufficient focus and leadership"" in dealing with the problem and that she ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the process. The report, published on Friday, also called on the government to look at whether there is sufficient funding for the system. Mr Neill said: ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all. ""The failings are symptomatic of a system under immense strain: without change, we cannot expect the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system."" Responding to the report, Ms Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority. ""There is an unprecedented focus on finding solutions, and extensive action has been under way over the past year to bring about the necessary change not just in how cases are handled, but in the wider culture within the CPS and policing. ""This is not a quick fix. We will evaluate the measures taken, and agree further commitments to ensure there is continuous improvement.""

Another review into disclosure is being carried out by the attorney general and a National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being put into place. In January, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered a review of more than 3,600 cases in England and Wales after four cases were thrown out of court due to a lack of disclosure.

The vessel sank in 40ft (12m) of water before rolling to a final depth of 80ft. Sheriff Rader said divers have located the sunken boat and will probably recover it later today. Rescue personnel continue to search Table Rock Lake for victims of the duck boat accident. Missouri Governor Mike Parson said at the news conference, ""now is just a time for thoughts and prayers"". US President Donald Trump offered his ""deepest sympathies"" in a Friday morning tweet. A spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center in Branson, Brandei Clifton, said that four adults and three children had arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. It happened as a line of powerful thunderstorms rolled through the American Midwest, uprooting trees and felling power lines. At the time of the accident, winds reached around 65mph (104 km/h), according to the National Weather Service. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thirteen people were killed, including three children, after they became trapped beneath the vehicle's canopy. The cause was later reported to be ""uncontrolled flooding"" due to a loose part. The sightseeing vehicles are based on a design used during World War Two to transport personnel and supplies over land and water - known as the DUKW. The DUKW, a six-wheel-drive amphibious truck, was first made in the US in the mid-1940s to deliver people and materials ashore where no port facilities existed. Some 21,000 DUKWs were produced for use during World War Two. Many served on D-Day and in the Normandy landings.

"Spending time with nature offers ""precious breathing space"" from modern life, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called on the public to join the world's biggest butterfly count. The naturalist said watching butterflies in his garden takes his mind off ""the woes of Brexit"". The exercise involves spending 15 minutes counting butterflies and submitting the sightings online. The majority of butterfly species have been in decline for the past 40 years. However, this year, weather in the UK - a cold winter followed by settled weather during a late spring and summer - have created the right conditions for butterflies to flourish. Species expected to do particularly well include the holly blue and red admiral. This year could be a good one for the red admiral butterfly But if the hot conditions create a drought, the results could be ""catastrophic"" as plants wither and insects die through lack of food, said the charity Butterfly Conservation, which organises the count. This happened in 1976 when the butterfly population collapsed after the hot summer. In pictures: Brilliant butterflies in your back garden Butterfly origins pushed back in time Reality Check: Are butterflies getting rarer? As part of the Big Butterfly Count, Butterfly Conservationis asking the public,externalto spot and record 17 species of butterfly for the next three weeks. In addition to contributing to conservation knowledge, mental health charity Mind says spending time in nature can help alleviate problems such as depression and anxiety. The Big Butterfly Count takes place between 20 July and 12 August Sir David said being in nature ""offers us all precious breathing space away from the stresses and strains of modern life"". ""Some of my most memorable experiences have happened when I've been simply sitting and watching the wildlife that lives where I do,"" he added. And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm asking people turn their mind away from squabbles and problems about what's facing us with Brexit, sit in a quiet place where the sun is shining and see how many butterflies come. Butterfly Conservation President Sir David with a south east Asian Great Mormon Butterfly on his nose in 2012 ""That simple pleasures of looking at butterflies in the garden is calming to the soul and spirit and good for us all."" Asked on BBC Breakfast whether he had discussed the issue of plastics with the Queen when he met her, Sir David said he had not - and declined to be drawn on the royal family's attitude to the environment. Extinct butterfly to be reintroduced 'Eerie' caterpillar tree spotted Last year's big butterfly count,externalwas the largest ever with a record number of people - over 60,000 - submitting sightings. But despite this, the average number of butterflies seen per 15 minute count was the lowest recorded since the survey started in 2010. The reduced numbers of butterflies was partly due to ""topsy-turvy"" weather last summer, which was one of the wettest summers for 100 years. According toButterfly Conservation,,externalthree-quarters of British butterflies are in decline. Five species of butterfly have become extinct in the past 150 years. The charity says that habitats being destroyed or deteriorating are the prime causes of long-term decline.

"MPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions over failings in the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases. A number of rape trials collapsed last year after it emerged vital evidence had not been given to defence lawyers. The Justice Select Committee said,externalAlison Saunders did not recognise the severity of the issue and there was ""insufficient leadership"". Ms Saunders said addressing problems in the system was her ""top priority"". She is due to stand down from her post in October at the end of a five-year contract. Police apologise for rape case errors All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed Evidence withheld in 47 sex assault cases In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case. But the Justice Committee's report said there have been ""persistent problems with the practice of disclosure"". ""We have seen at least six reports in as many years that have highlighted issues and made recommendations,"" it said. The committee said that despite this insight, Ms Saunders failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings. Their report also said the Crown Prosecution Service may have underestimated the number of cases halted because of issues with disclosing evidence. Data from the CPS showed 841 cases in 2017/18 had to be stopped. But the committee said it knows that the true figure is higher - saying the CPS may have underestimated the number by 90%. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said the police and CPS often see the disclosure of evidence as an ""administrative headache"" - a view which was ""not acceptable"". Mr Neill, a former barrister, added: ""Disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact. ""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result."" The committee found failings in the ""application of disclosure by police officers and prosecutors on the ground"" and called for a culture change, so it was seen as a ""core justice duty"", rather than an ""administrative add-on"". When it came to Ms Saunders, the committee said there was ""insufficient focus and leadership"" in dealing with the problem and that she ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the process. The report, published on Friday, also called on the government to look at whether there is sufficient funding for the system. Mr Neill said: ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all. ""The failings are symptomatic of a system under immense strain: without change, we cannot expect the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system."" Responding to the report, Ms Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority. ""There is an unprecedented focus on finding solutions, and extensive action has been under way over the past year to bring about the necessary change not just in how cases are handled, but in the wider culture within the CPS and policing. ""This is not a quick fix. We will evaluate the measures taken, and agree further commitments to ensure there is continuous improvement."" This video can not be played Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders tells Today it was her decision to leave The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for criminal justice, Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, defended Ms Saunders, saying she was ""fully aware of the extent and seriousness of the disclosure failures"" and ""fully committed"" to working with them. Another review into disclosure is being carried out by the attorney general and a National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being put into place. In January, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered a review of more than 3,600 cases in England and Wales after four cases were thrown out of court due to a lack of disclosure. The trial of Liam Allan was stopped in December at Croydon Crown Court, days before the prosecution of Isaac Itiary at Inner London Crown Court was halted. This video can not be played Liam Allan had been on bail for two years before his trial collapsed And in January, the case against Samson Makele was stopped at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, while Oxford student Oliver Mears - who had spent two years on bail - had the case against him dropped days before his trial was set to start. The review found that 47 cases of rape and sexual assault had important evidence withheld from the defence.

" Words and photography: Marc EllisonIllustrations: Ozo Ezeogu Warning: Disturbing content Sitting on a chipped wooden bench, the three-year-old swings her legs excitedly. Her sandals barely touch the floor as she watches a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon. It is hard to believe Comfort is a witch. Yet this is why she and her two older siblings are now living in an emergency shelter in the city of Calabar, in the southeast corner of Nigeria. It's little more than a basement with a television and half a dozen threadbare mattresses. The door is locked most of the time for the children’s own safety. The shelter was intended to be a temporary solution - a stop-gap until the children could be placed with extended family. But no-one wants to risk bringing the children - all of whom have been branded witches - into their homes. Once her cartoon has finished, Comfort totters outside and lifts her shirt to reveal a sea of whitened welts across her back. These ragged scars trace the outlines of the red-hot machete that a neighbour used to force her to “confess”. Names of the children in this story have been changed.Illustrations are superimposed on top of photos to protect identities. In early February, Comfort and her sister Hope, 15, and five-year-old brother Godbless had been living with their grandmother Christiana in nearby Akampka. Their parents had died suddenly in unexplained circumstances, and while this had made Christiana wary of the children, she had agreed to take them in. Already diagnosed as HIV positive and not taking her anti-retroviral drugs, Christiana's health was failing and she was becoming increasingly thin and frail. Blaming the children for her ailing health, Christiana took them to her local church for guidance. There, a so-called prophet confirmed her worst fears - the children were branded witches. For Christiana, this explained everything - the death of her daughter and son-in-law, her sickness, and the children’s rowdy behaviour. Shortly afterwards, a neighbour called Rankin overheard Christiana accusing the children of cutting the rope of the washing line in the family compound - blaming their witchcraft for their actions. After talking to Christiana and finding out more about the accusations, Rankin returned the next day with a friend. “He started beating us and told us to untie our grandmother from the witchcraft world,” says Hope. The children tried to escape through the surrounding palm trees but were quickly rounded up by the two men and taken to the neighbour’s house. Their hands and feet were bound, and Rankin heated up a machete blade in the coals of a nearby fire. “They then asked us if we were witches,” says Hope from the safehouse in Calabar. “We said, ‘No’.” “So he started beating us in turn with the hot machete, from morning until afternoon.” Blood bloomed black on the ground as again and again they were asked to confess. “We eventually said, ‘Yes’,” says Hope. “Then they asked us if we are the ones that killed our father and mother - we said, ‘Yes’. “They asked us if all these troubles in our family - we are the ones who caused them - we said, ‘Yes’.” When I visit the mud-walled church where the children say they were branded and beaten, the prophet they say labelled them as witches is not there. Instead I meet pastor Israel Ubi. He claims no-one at the church makes such accusations, or conducts deliverance ceremonies to exorcise alleged witches. “There is no witchcraft here,” he says. When pushed on the subject, he acknowledged that the church did deal with “marine spirits and demons” that many in the Niger Delta believe live in and around oceans, seas and rivers. It was the children’s uncle Sunday who reported the machete incident to the police. The taxi driver, who says he doesn’t believe in witchcraft, angrily dismisses the “prophet” who branded the children. “As a result of her health, my mother believed in [his] words. Prophets - they are criminals, they are people who are destroying people’s lives.” The stigmatisation of children as witches is a recent phenomenon in the Niger Delta region, which suddenly exploded in the 1990s. Before that, elderly women were the main targets of witchcraft accusations. By 2008, it was estimated that 15,000 children had been branded in the southeastern states of Akwa Ibom and Cross Rivers. According to research from that period, cases that had been documented included children and babies who had had nails driven into their heads, been forced to drink cement, set on fire, scarred by acid, poisoned, and even buried alive. A separate 2010 Unicef report notes it is typically vulnerable children with physical disabilities, or illnesses such as epilepsy, who are targeted. Others are branded for appearing withdrawn, lazy, or unruly. Nigeria’s criminal code prohibits accusing, or even threatening to accuse, someone of being a witch. And the Child Rights Act of 2003 makes it an offence to subject any child to physical or emotional torture, or submit them to any inhuman or degrading treatment. However, while this piece of legislation was enacted at the national level, the country’s 36 states are still required to formally ratify it. This not only gives individual states exclusive responsibility - it allows them to make laws relevant to their specific situations. Only about three-quarters of Nigeria’s states have domesticated the Child Rights Act, and to date only the state of Akwa Ibom has included specific provisions concerning the abuse of alleged child witches. Its 2008 law made witch branding punishable by a custodial sentence of up to 10 years. And despite lobbying attempts, Cross River State has yet to amend its own 2009 version of the legislation to specifically outlaw the offence. But regardless of the fragmented attempt to criminalise it, witch-branding continues under the noses of the state governments and police of Akwa Ibom and Cross River states. Oliver Orok, minister of sustainable development and social welfare for the Cross River State government, told the BBC the ministry was “working assiduously to eliminate these practices”. “The state government in partnership with Unicef and other development partners organised a summit to deliberate on amending the law to include, among other things, the issue of branding children as witches and its consequences,” says Mr Orok. The minister says ""criminal law has abolished such practices"". However, 10 years on, no-one has been successfully prosecuted in the courts. There has been an increase in advocacy across the state to deal with the issue, Mr Orok says, and that money had been made available to build a home for children at risk. He adds that if the government was made aware of cases, it “would move against such churches and their prophets”. Lawyer James Ibor argues that the police are poorly funded, and not equipped to carry out these types of investigations. “Often we have to push for investigations,” he says.Ibor runs a local organisation in Calabar called Basic Rights Counsel Initiative (BCRI), which specialises in legal cases concerning child rights abuse - it also runs the emergency shelter where Comfort and her siblings are staying. He tells me about two children who were poisoned by their father, who believed they were witches. He pleaded guilty, but there were no resources to send blood samples to Lagos to confirm the children’s cause of death. One year on, their bodies remain in the morgue, and the father has yet to be tried. Ibor claims that cases have stalled for years. He says his job is made harder by the reluctance of the police and government to investigate controversial issues combined with a lack of willingness from families and communities to provide evidence. About a quarter of his ongoing cases relate to witchcraft, he says. But this phenomenon is not just restricted to Nigeria's more remote regions. Just six months ago, the Nigerian media reported on 40 children who were rescued from a witchdoctor’s “torture camp” in the capital of Abuja. And this May in Lagos, a boy was badly beaten by his mother with a koboko, or horsewhip. “So we have the laws,” says Ibor. “The problem is not the laws - the problem is implementing these laws and until then our children are not safe.” And he blames some of the “prophets” and “pastors” for sowing fear across the Niger Delta region where poverty and a belief in witchcraft are widespread. Sweat slaloms down the girl’s face as she pirouettes across the cement floor. A man catches her by the waist, before twirling her around the airless hall. But this is no dance recital – this is a brutal ballet designed to deliver the child from witchcraft. Welcome to the deliverance of Joy. Welcome to the Streams of Life Ministry. It is a Friday evening and suffocatingly hot inside the hall of the Pentecostal church. Three pastors have formed a tag-team to heal the 15-year-old.Over the course of 30 minutes they take turns slapping her head, pinching her earlobes, and grabbing at her stomach. “Your clothes are on fire, your head is on fire, your belly is on fire,” they repeatedly scream in her face as they twist her around and around. Joy raises her hands in self-defence. Four children have been identified by Pastor Eunice Emmanuel to be “exorcised” this evening. The youngest is just eight years old. “The power comes from the Holy Spirit,” she explains before the ritual begins. “He empowers us to do His work, to administer salvation to the children. “When you pray for the children you see the spirits manifest, speaking through them - you will hear them speaking.” “By the time the deliverance is complete, the child becomes like a madman who has recovered his sanity.” The pastor explains that her Calabar-based ministry is ultimately offering a service to the wider community. These deliverances not only stop parents from disowning their children, they stop the spirits from leading them astray, she says. “And who knows, they may go to marry your daughter,” she adds, “So before you know it, the witchcraft we are running away from is already in your house.” Pastor Eunice addresses the spirit she accuses Joy of harbouring. “Do you go to a coven? Are you a witch? Do you drink blood? Do you eat flesh? Do you kill?” “I have destroyed one person,” Joy finally cries.Only when the girl finally collapses on to the floor is the deliverance considered a success. Lawyer James Ibor says Pentecostal churches like these encourage their congregations to blame witchcraft for their misfortune or personal failures. One recent case involved a boy who was beaten when the family motorbike broke down; in another, a girl was accused, and flogged by her father after he lost his job. “They sell fear so that they can keep members who continually pay offerings and tithes (weekly donations). “That is the only way they will stay relevant and keep making money.” Last year the UN convened its first workshop focused on witchcraft, both in Nigeria and other countries. In its final report, it stated that “the exact number of victims of such abuse is unknown, and is widely believed to be underreported”. It also recognised the role that “supernatural entrepreneurs” play in diffusing and legitimising fears related to witchcraft, and in particular, child witches. Bassey recalls how two girls were accused by a pastor two years ago at the Divine Zion of God Church in the small town of Akpabuyo in Cross River State. A pregnant congregant had gone past her due date by several weeks, and the seven and 10-year-old girls were held to be responsible and branded witches. The woman had approached a pastor at her local church and paid for a consultation. Although she gave birth successful shortly after, the damage had been done. A week later, Bassey heard the girls' screams as he returned from his fields. They had been tied to a palm tree, and were being beaten with canes and machetes by three men. Ebe Ukara, a desk officer for the Child Rights Implementation Committee in Akamkpa, says that 60% of the child abuse cases that cross her desk are witchcraft-related, and more often than not prompted by a pastor’s declaration. Those pastors, she says, can make a tidy profit from people who turn to them for help, although she stresses that not all Pentecostal churches are out to hoodwink their followers. But for the “fake prophets”, children are the easy targets who can be blamed for the poverty and misfortunes that plague families and communities. Judging from the billboards that adorn roundabouts - from the capital of Abuja to the Niger Delta - beer and salvation are big businesses in Nigeria, commodities to be bought and sold. Every other poster promises some miracle - how to get that job, find a spouse, deal with miscarriages, cure infertility, and of course, eradicate witchcraft. But these posters underline the two keycharacteristics of the Pentecostal doctrine that has spread throughout Nigeria since the 1970s. Firstly, this form of Christianity emphasises success and plenty - if someone is failing in life then this is a sign that something is suspiciously awry. Secondly, Pentecostal churches portray the world as a literal battleground between Godly forces and demonic spirits. So the new Pentecostal movement has since popularised the notion that material fortune is universally available, but that access to it can be blocked by supernatural forces. But these Nigerian church leaders are not acting out any traditional African religion or superstition. On the contrary, Nigerian Pentecostal leaders have copied their American televangelist counterparts whose churches often behave more like builders of economic empires than religious organisations. This has resulted in a religious hybridisation where indigenous beliefs in the supernatural world have been combined with an extreme form of Christianity that critics say manipulates their congregants. “Those ‘mushroom’ churches are a big problem - their prophets operate in profits,” says Ukara. This phrase mushroom churches is often used to describe the smaller and more informal prayer houses that seem to sprout up quickly almost overnight. These are largely unregulated. One such church is the Ark of Noah, which operates from a house in Calabar South. The tiny Winnie the Pooh slippers outside the front door are the only hint that a deliverance is underway inside. In a canary yellow shirt, Prophet Gideon Okon stands praying over the three children accused of being witches. “God opens my eyes to see people’s problems,” Okon says. “That’s how I know who is a witch.” He says that nobody brings children to him, that his revelations come to him when he fasts. “If that person is ready and willing to be delivered, then we start talking a price,” he says. Okon says that the final figure varies depending on the type of ritual that needs to be performed. “The strongest and hardest to kill are marine spirits,” he says. “For that I would charge about 200,000 Naira ($556), but that’s negotiable with the parents.” In the Niger Delta region, the average person is lucky to make a pound a day. But Okon, who used to work for a construction company, later denies that he charges for his services. He says he accepts “donations”. After several hours of prayers and singing, the three children - aged between 10 and 15 - are forced to drink a green, viscous liquid from a soft drink bottle. It is the first thing they have been allowed to consume after three days of forced fasting. Okon tells me it is a blend, of water, palm oil, sand, leaves and seven ground centipedes. “God told me what ingredients to use”, he says. “They are specific to the person.” Only when they vomit, are the children deemed to have been “healed”. The film industry in Nigeria - known colloquially as Nollywood - is booming. It pumps out more than 2,500 movies a year, making it the second-largest producer after Bollywood in India. These movies typically fall into five distinct genres - romance, comedy, historical epics, gangster stories, and the so-called “hallelujah” category which promotes strong religious messages. They can be seen in beauty parlours, bars, restaurants and on buses. They are not only popular in Nigeria, but across Africa and in the diaspora. Evil School, Family of Witches, School of Witches are but a few of the more recent examples of Nollywood movies that negatively portray children as witches. The most infamous is End of the Wicked, which focuses on the Amadi family which is living with the father’s mother - who we find out is a witch in a coven. The family’s children are influenced to join the cult, and in the movie are shown eating flesh and plotting to murder their parents. Produced by the Liberty Gospel Church, the 1999 movie also starred the church’s leader Helen Ukpabio as the pastor who ends up heroically exposing and destroying the coven. The film was hugely controversial and, at the time, was widely blamed for the surge in witchcraft accusations against children in the years that followed. It was criticised for blurring the line between fact and fiction. It not only used the real-life pastor starring as herself, but the film begins with a note that this is part of an expository series. Nigerians themselves have criticised such movies for proliferating pernicious stereotypes about the continent. In a recent book chapter on the influence of Nollywood films on culture, academic Françoise Ugochukwu references the viewpoint of one frustrated Nigerian in an online forum. “Films of this type have painted an even more negative image of Nigeria...making it appear to be a nation bogged down by superstitions and primitive beliefs,” reads one post on the forum. “Isn’t it bad enough for the West to demonise every aspect of our traditions, and now we are doing it to ourselves? “Does anyone seriously think that all our ancestors did was sit around performing so called satanic rituals all day?” Lawyer James Ibor argues it was movies like End of the Wicked that not only popularised the notion that children could be witches, but that people could easily become witches by eating tainted food. “The narrative changed with the influx of Nollywood in the 90s,” he claims. “Walk into any movie shop here, and select randomly 50 different films and I bet you 80% of them are on witchcraft and juju.” But paradoxically one of the main reasons for the popularity of Nollywood films is that they provide a platform for Africans to tell their own stories. One Nollywood film producer, Orok Atim, says that however “negative” the theme of witchcraft may be, it is an issue that affects the lives of Nigerians - hence they expect to encounter it when watching Nigerian films. Orok Atim is sat in front of a makeshift shrine on the set of his latest movie. While his latest film is actually a love story (pictured), Atim has a passion for making movies about the supernatural. His next movie will be about a deceased friend’s experience of witchcraft. “Witchcraft exists in our society today,” he says. “If you don’t show what is happening in society then you are just wasting your time. “I use my movies to educate, entertain, and to tell the world that witchcraft is real.” None of his films explicitly portrays children as witches. Atim argues that, far from perpetuating traditional beliefs in the supernatural, his movies allow Nigerian audiences to face their fears. Through special effects, his movies make the invisible visible; they give people a visual perception of something spiritual that is rarely seen but is regularly talked about. And Atim baulks at the idea that movies like End of the Wicked could be responsible for a rise in child witchcraft accusations. “[But what you are saying is] just a rumour to kill the Nollywood movie industry,” he adds. “No-one would just come up with a story that does not exist.” Diana-Abasi Udua Akanimoh, who works for the NGO Way to the Nations in Akwa Ibom state, says she has witnessed first-hand the ripple effect witchcraft-themed films can have. “I went to a church here in Eket and the pastor was talking about stopping marine spirits and witchcraft,” she says. “He started telling his congregation that he had seen such things recently in a movie.” “So people who are ignorant will be thinking, ‘Oh, if the pastor is saying this then that means this is the truth’.” Akanimoh, who manages a safe house for children accused of being witches, says that while films may not be the root cause of these accusations, they certainly build upon tradition to justify their actions. And social worker Ebe Ukara claims that “people watch these movies and imitate what they see these advanced prophets doing”. Ukara was involved in the rescue of Comfort and her siblings after they were beaten by the prophet and attacked with the machete. “Movies today are teaching a lot of things that were never practised before,” she says. “Carrying a child to a church to beat them - that never used to exist.” But minister Oliver Orok says the government doesn't believe Nollywood is to blame for the problem, but rather the “long customs and traditions of some communities”. Charity is just one of the many children now living on the streets after being accused of witchcraft. For the past two years, the 13-year-old has been living in a makeshift hut in the middle of a dump site on the outskirts of Calabar. Inside four girls of a similar age are still curled up sleeping - there are no mattresses, there are no mosquito nets. Life here is hard, but on a good day she can make 1,500 Naira ($4) foraging for recyclable plastic soda bottles and tin cans among the piles of trash at the site. “I feel good living here,” Charity whispers. “Going back to live at my uncle’s house would be like putting me inside the fire.” After her father died, she went to live with her uncle. When he tried to sleep with her, she was accused by his wife of bewitching him. “They tied my hands, and threatened to throw me down the pit latrine,” she says. “They kept me like that for a day,” she says. “So I just told that I am a witch so that they would untie me.” After her “confession” her uncle stopped feeding her, and she decided to run away. The Lemna dump is home to a few hundred skolombo - street children - like Charity. Many share a similar story - they were either thrown out or fled their homes after being accused of sorcery. A handful of Nigerian organisations such as the Basic Rights Counsel Initiative (BRCI) and Way to Nations try to do more than just rescue youngsters accused of witchcraft - they try to reunite them with the very relatives who have ostracised them. Such attempts are rarely successful, even with extended family members. Back in Calabar, James Ibor is facing the dilemma of what to do with Comfort and her two siblings. They want to leave the shelter, but none of their relatives wants them. “How do we break the news to these children that your aunties, your uncles are not willing to even see you?” he says. “These kids then maybe start to even think that they are witches.” This article was made possible by funding from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.
