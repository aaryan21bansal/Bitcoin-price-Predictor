Countries around the world are taking steps to ease the restrictions Here's a final round-up of some of the day's main developments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington The pandemic has had an impact on the initiation rites of the Amish, a group of about 340,000 fundamentalist Christians who belong to a church that is known as Old Order. The Amish are known for their plain dress, their aversion to technology and for the horse-drawn buggies they ride in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in other towns in states across the US. In the Amish world, young people in their teens begin to move from the domestic realm and their families to the sphere outside of the home by spending time on the weekends with people their age. They go to parties, gatherings that are part of a tradition known as ""rumspringa"", which translates roughly as ""running around"". At some point the young people decide whether to join the church in a formal manner. If so, they are baptized and become adult members of the Amish community. With the advent of social distancing, the young people have cut back on their outings, however, and slowed down the rites of rumspringa. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Public Health England (PHE) says an antibody test for coronavirus has been evaluated and is a ""very positive development"". The product made by the drug company Roche was assessed by PHE at its Porton Down laboratories last week. Sources say it is the first such test to offer serious potential. Such a test looks for antibodies in the bloodstream to see whether an individual has in the past had the virus and has gained immunity. It is understood talks are now underway between Roche and the Department of Health over possible supply to the NHS. Previous antibody tests have proved unreliable according to health officials. Some are still being assessed. This video can not be played Venezuelans struggling with fuel shortage Venezuela is already a country in crisis and doctors fear an increase in the spread of coronavirus would be catastrophic. The South American nation has seen the price of food increase by 80% and a shortage of fuel since the lockdown. Teacher Sonia Pantes says sometimes she does not eat so her young daughter can. Rafael Barrios Armas, a surgeon who treats cancer patients, says he has queued overnight for fuel, sometimes for almost 13 hours, and still not been able to fill up his car. Lin-Manuel Miranda created the hit Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical Hamilton, has been recruited to join an organisation tasked with figuring out how to revive New York City's tourist trade. The Coalition for NYC Hospitality and Tourism Recovery has been established by NYC & Company, New York City's marketing organization and convention and visitors bureau, to figure out a plan to get tourists to come to the city when it eventually reopens. Miranda is known for creating hits like Hamilton and In The Heights, both set in New York, as well as writing the music for Disney's Moana. ""Together, we will create a next act for our city,"" he said. ""After this intermission, we will be ready to welcome the world back with open arms, so people can fall in love with New York over and over again."" Update 20 May: This post has been updated to clarify that the coalition was formed by NYC & Company Countries around the world are starting to ease the restrictions imposed because of the virus More now on the warnings from the World Health Organization emergencies expert Mike Ryan, who said Covid-19 ""may never go away"" - we had more on that a bit earlier. While much of the world hopes the worst of the virus has passed, Ryan said the global community needed to brace itself for a long battle. ""I think it's important we're realistic and I don't think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear,"" he said. ""I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be."" If a vaccine is found, implementing globally would require a ""massive effort"", he added. As many countries start easing lockdown measures, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The trajectory is in our hands, and itâs everybody's business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic."" For many firms, coronavirus has been one of the toughest problems they have ever faced. But, stuck at home, thousands of young people have been encouraged to started their own businesses during lockdown. Radio 4 Money Box Live talked to the new entrepreneurs about the successes and challenges they encountered along the way. Listen back to the episode here. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington Will you tip more? When cleaner JosÃ© Zaragoza finished his job at a home, he was surprised to find he had received a $100 tip on Venmo. ""I was like 'hey you made a mistake' - you sent an extra zero,"" but the customer told him he had given him a large tip ""to help you and your family in these tough times."" There have been similar reports of generous tipping - sometimes extremely generous - across the US, as states start to reopen. In Austin, Texas, one restaurant reopened on 30 April - and founda customer left $1,300 to staff,externalas a ""welcome back"" tip. Some delivery apps have also noticed an increase in tips since the pandemic began. Is the coronavirus making us more generous?

BBC Panorama has been filming the distressing story of one funeral director in England who has taken extraordinary measures to provide storage for hundreds of bodies. Dean Floyd, of Floyd & Son in Essex, has bought refrigerated containers and converted most of his premises to take care of the dead. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa is starting to ease its lockdown South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases in Africa (11,350), and one of the world's strictest lockdowns. It is starting to ease restrictions, but some of the new rules are being queried -  particularly those around what clothes shops can and cannot sell. The new regulations are impressively detailed: shoes may now be sold - but not if they are opened toed. T-shirts are okay - but only if advertised and sold as undergarments. The same goes for sleeveless knitted topsâ¦ and so on. There is a logic to all this. Winter is coming here - hence the green light for the sale of winter clothes. But Dean MacPherson from the opposition Democratic Alliance is unimpressed. He called the regulations ""quite frankly ridiculous and mad. More likely the sort of rules found in the Soviet Union and East Germany"". The crisis has exposed deep rifts in government - between ministers more inclined to authoritarian solutions, including an ongoing ban on all alcohol and cigarette sales, and those who now believe South Africans should be trusted with more individual freedoms - including the right to buy sandals and exposed knitwear. Buzzfeed set up a London office in 2013 Online media giantBuzzfeed is to close its UK and Australian news operations. The US company, which set up its London office in 2013, said the decision had been made ""both for economic and strategic reasons"". The move comes as the media industry is facing an advertising downturn caused by the pandemic. Buzzfeed said it would be focusing on news that ""hits big in the United States during this difficult period"". In the UK, some staff will stay on to cover social news, celebrity and investigations for US readers, but it is thought about 10 jobs are affected. BBC News media editor Amol Rajan said the affected UK staff had been furloughed. Some pupils may return to school on 1 June Plans to reopen primary schools in England do not have adequate safety measures and need to be halted,warns an alliance of school teachers' unions. A joint education union statement called on the government to ""step back"" from a 1 June start date and said ""classrooms of four and five-year olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread"". In the House of Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against ""scaremongering"" over safety, although his department's chief scientific adviser cast doubt on suggestions the virus spreads less among children. ""Sometimes scaremongering, making people fear, is really unfair and not a welcome pressure to be placed on families, children and teachers alike,"" Williamson told MPs. Santiago has experienced a worrying spike in new infections The Chilean government is to impose a total lockdown across the capital, Santiago, following a spike in the number of coronavirus infections. A total of 2,260 new infections and 12 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The current death toll is about 350. The new restrictions will affect eight million people and come into effect on Friday evening. Chile had limited lockdown measures to areas with higher rates of infection. The authorities were considering partially reopening the economy, but the country has now reported a 60% rise in the number of daily cases. A few minutes ago we told you about the World Health Organization's warning that Covid-19 ""may never go away"". As we know, a vaccine would provide some protection, by training people's immune systems to fight the virus. But how easy is it to create a vaccine and when could we expect one to be ready? Our health correspondent Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How close are we to getting a vaccine? London's transport network needs to reach a deal with the government this week because of financial problems, said the deputy mayor for transport. Speaking to Eddie Nestorâs Drivetime show on BBC Radio London, Heidi Alexander said City Hall was in ""very live negotiations"" with the government and hoped to have a deal soon. Alexander denied a suggestion that Transport for London (TfL) only had ""24 to 48 hours worth of money left"". But, when asked if the Tube would be operating next week, she replied: ""I'm sure TfL will be running this time next week. Let's hope by the end of this week we have a deal on the table with the government so that money is there."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least nine women and girls have been killed in domestic homicides in Canada since the pandemic, a new report says. There is no federal database, but the Battered Womenâs Support Services, a non-profit, has been tracking them and tallied the numbers,which were confirmed by the Globe and Mail newspaper.,external It said three of the men involved also killed themselves. On average one woman is killed by a domestic partner ever six days in Canada. The government says some parts of the country have seen a 20-30% increase in rates of gender-based violence and domestic violence. The government has provided an additional $28m (Â£23.2m) to help address domestic violence during Covid-19. Alison RobertsLisbon For the first time in more than a century, the Catholic shrine at FÃ¡tima in Portugal has held a pilgrimage without pilgrims. On 12 May every year, hundreds of thousands flock to attend mass at the famed shrine to mark the anniversary of reported sightings of the Virgin Mary by three children in 1917. But due to the coronavirus, ceremonies have been livestreamed this year. The bishop of FÃ¡tima called for solidarity to combat ""the virus"" of indifference and individualism that he said could only be defeated ""with the antibodies of compassion and solidarity"". Lockdown measures have been loosened in France The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Covid-19 may be here to stay. ""This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away,"" Michael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, told a virtual press conference in Geneva. ""HIV has not gone away - but we have come to terms with the virus."" He said that, without a vaccine, it could take years for the population to build up sufficient levels of immunity to the virus. There are many attempts being carried out around the world to develop a vaccine but experts say there is a risk that one may never be created. Meanwhile, as countries across the globe start easing lockdown measures, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the process could trigger new waves of infections. Ryan said there was lots of ""magical thinking"" surrounding countries opening back up. He added that there was a ""long, long way to go"" on the path to returning to normal. Countries are hoping that technology will be an ally in curbing the spread of the virus Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing appwill trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19. That puts it at odds with the NHS app in the UK, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire. UK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a ""centralised"" design despite privacy campaigners' protests, although Germany ditched that model in April. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a ""much higher level of acceptance"" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity. Â© 2025 BBC.

"There are more than 100 potential vaccines currently in development The coronavirus ""may never go away"", the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Speaking at a briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies director Dr Mike Ryan warned against trying to predict when the virus would disappear. He added that even if a vaccine is found, controlling the virus will require a ""massive effort"". Almost 300,000 people worldwide are reported to have died with coronavirus, and more than 4.3m cases recorded. The UN meanwhile warned the pandemic was causing widespread distress and mental ill health - particularly in countries where there's a lack of investment in mental healthcare. The UN urged governments to make mental health considerations part of their overall response. ""It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,"" Dr Ryan told the virtual press conference from Geneva. ""HIV has not gone away - but we have come to terms with the virus."" Dr Ryan then said he doesn't believe ""anyone can predict when this disease will disappear"". There are currentlymore than 100 potential vaccinesin development - but Dr Ryan noted there are other illnesses, such as measles, that still haven't been eliminated despite there being vaccines for them. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed it was still possible to control the virus, with effort. ""The trajectory is in our hands, and it's everybody's business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic,"" he said. WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove also told the briefing: ""We need to get into the mindset that it is going to take some time to come out of this pandemic.""

A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? Their stark remarks come as several countries began to gradually ease lockdown measures, and leaders consider the issue of how and when to reopen their economies. Dr Tedros warned that there was no guaranteed way of easing restrictions without triggering a second wave of infections. ""Many countries would like to get out of the different measures,"" the WHO boss said. ""But our recommendation is still the alert at any country should be at the highest level possible."" Dr Ryan added: ""There is some magical thinking going on that lockdowns work perfectly and that unlocking lockdowns will go great. Both are fraught with dangers.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has mistakenly joined a Tory rebellion against the government over post-Brexit food import standards. Mr Sunak voted digitally for a change to the Agriculture Bill that would have guaranteed a ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef. The amendment was defeated by 277 to 328, a majority of 51. A source close to the chancellor blamed ""teething problems"" with a new online voting system. ""The chancellor did not intentionally vote against the government. He called the chief whip straight away to explain,"" added the source. MPs urge UK ban on chlorinated chicken MPs warn of 'premature' return to normal Commons Several MPs made the same mistake in what was only the second time they have voted digitally. The system - brought in to allow MPs to continue working during the coronavirus lockdown - does not allow MPs to change their vote once it has been cast. Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing said she had been told some MPs had mistakenly voted the wrong way and ""that their use of technology was not quite as good as they felt that it ought to be"". But she told MPs she was ""satisfied"" the mistakes had not affected the outcome of the vote. Ministers say the issue of protecting food standards in post-Brexit trade will be dealt with in the upcoming Trade Bill. But opponents of practices such chlorine-washing chicken say that could lead to farm standards being bargained away in negotiations. Instead, they wanted ministers to guarantee food standards in the Agriculture Bill. Leading rebel, Tory MP Simon Hoare, warned MPs that without changes to the bill ""food imports to this country would be cheap for no other reason bar the fact that they were raised to lower standards"". Fellow rebel Neil Parish, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, told MPs it was time to support such measures. Tory rebels called on American farmers to improve their standards He said: ""I'd say to the Americans, why don't you upgrade your production? Why don't you reduce the density of population of your chicken? ""Why don't you reduce the amount of antibiotics you're using and then you can actually produce better chicken not only for America, it can also come into this country? ""Let's not be frightened of putting clauses into this bill that protect us to have the great environment and welfare that the whole bill wants to have and farmers want to have."" But Environment Minister Victoria Prentis warned of ""unintended consequences"" of amending the bill and insisted all EU import standards will be converted into domestic law by the end of the December 2020 transition period. She told MPs all existing import requirements would continue to apply, including ""a ban on using artificial growth hormones in beef"". She added: ""Nothing apart from potable water may be used to clean chicken carcasses and any changes to these standards would have to come before this Parliament. ""We will be doing our own inspections to ensure that these import conditions are met."" Shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said not including food standards in the bill could lead to a ""race to the bottom"". During the third reading vote, Labour spokesman Mr Pollard could be heard asking in the Commons chamber: ""How many members of the Cabinet voted the wrong way?"" Government deputy chief whip Stuart Andrew was heard replying: ""Just the one. He's a very busy man.""

"Manafort (centre) was sentenced last year Ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been released from prison to serve the remainder of his sentence at home due to Covid-19 fears. He had served a little over a year of a seven-and-a-half year sentence in jail. Manafort, 71, was convicted of conspiracy and fraud charges that stemmed from a justice department inquiry into Russian election meddling. There are over 2,800 confirmed Covid-19 cases among US federal prisoners and 50 deaths. According tothe latest data,externalfrom the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), there are 139,584 federal inmates in federal custody, and another 11,235 in community facilities, plus around 36,000 staff. According to the BOP, 2,818 inmates and 262 staff have tested positive for coronavirus. There have not been any confirmed cases of the disease at Manafort's prison, FCI Loretto in Pennsylvania. Last month, Manafort's lawyers sought for his release to home confinement in Northern Virginia, arguing that his ""age and pre-existing health conditions"" put him at high risk for infection in prison. At the end of March, Attorney General William Barr told the BOP to grant home confinement to virus-vulnerable, low-risk inmates. His memo noted ""some offenses, such as sex offenses, will render an inmate ineligible for home detention"". In April, Mr Barr directed the BOP to transfer inmates at risk for Covid-19 out of three federal facilities grappling with outbreaks, and told officials to review inmates at other similar facilities where the virus was affecting operations. The BOP reports 2,471 inmates have been moved to home confinement due to the pandemic since 26 March. US jails begin releasing prisoners amid pandemic In Pennsylvania, the governor ordered its corrections department to allow nonviolent and at-risk inmates to be momentarily released. Though the administration said as many as 1,800 people would be eligible, just 150 have been released as of 12 May,according to state corrections data,external. US jails and prisons, both federal and state, have been criticised for their handling of virus outbreaks and advocates continue to call for non-violent inmates to be released. Critics say prisoners are uniquely at-risk for the disease given overcrowding and unhygienic conditions. Inmates often lack soap and hand sanitiser is banned due to its alcohol content. The American Civil Liberties Union,externalpredicts 100,000 more Covid-19 deaths than current projections ""if jail populations are not dramatically and immediately reduced"", noting conditions in American facilities are ""substantially inferior"" to other Western nations. Another ex-Trump aide, the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen, 53, is said to be expecting home release from prison in New York later this month. A number of other high-profile convicts, including financial fraudster Bernie Madoff, 82, and comedian Bill Cosby, 82, have also appealed for release due to the virus. Manafort served as President Trump's campaign chairman from June to August 2016, when he was forced to resign over his previous work in Ukraine. He was convicted on a range of banking fraud, tax evasion, conspiracy and witness tampering charges from two separate cases relating to his work as a political consultant. Manafort said the case had taken everything from him Manafort also agreed to co-operate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in a deal for a possible lighter sentence. However, just two months later that plea deal collapsed as investigators said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the government. He was sentenced in March 2019 and his prison term was to have ended in 2024. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Do white-collar criminals get lighter sentences?

David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter BBC Scotland's The Nine has seen NHS guidance sent to care homes that
advises staff âdo not meet criteria for testingâ even if they show symptoms of
coronavirus. The document, sent to care homes in Fife, says that if the
staff member works in a team big enough to âabsorb the workloadâ they should
isolate for 14 days instead. But Scottish government guidance states âall symptomatic key
workersâ can be tested. A Scottish government spokesperson told us âall residents
and staff will be offered testing, whether they are symptomatic or not, in
homes where there has been a confirmed caseâ. For the final question, Colin asked Ms Hyslop when garden centres will open given they have now done so in England and Wales. The economy secretary said that she expected outdoor activity to be ""much easier"" given the examples set in other countries. She highlighted the R number - the virus infection rate - is different in Scotland and that the first case arrived in Scotland much later than in London. She said: ""The public health interest means that Scotland has to make its own decisions in terms of what we do. ""I do think because garden centres work outside means we can open them first, but that's in phasing discussions."" Paul's firm has a head office in Scotland but employees in England - he asked should he develop different policies for each office. Fiona Hyslop said that the UK government framework was helpful ""in principal"" for different types of workplaces but all businesses should refer to devolved administrations for issues like the timing of reopening. She said: ""I want Scotland to be known as safe. I think it's possible to do what many companies do working over the world adapting policies to different places."" David asked the economy secretary how we handle practicalities such as training new staff for when businesses reopen. Fiona Hyslop told BBC Scotland that businesses would need to adapt to training staff online and support different types of training, while work was being done to bring together colleges and workplaces. She said there is a ""need to share best practice and experience"", and that she expected ""far more collaboration between businesses than competition"" because it is in ""everyone's interest to stimulate demand"". Ms Hyslop added the furlough scheme would be useful in enabling firms to conduct training, allow part time working and carry out phased returns. She said the Scottish government was working with the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive to make sure there was ""institutional capability"" to give advice to employers and workers on the matter. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop has been taking questions from viewers around Scotland, during Coronavirus: Scotland's Response, on BBC One Scotland. The first question was from Mark who wants to know how Scotland plans to help businesses going forward. Ms Hyslop highlighted the Scottish government's four-point economic plan, as well as ""big uptake"" on grants for which letters are being issued this week. She said the country would have to ""rethink and re-emerge into a world where digital will be more prevalent"", as well as making sure jobs and training opportunities exist. Guidance on how different industries can operate a phased return in a ""planned, orderly"" fashion will be issued, she said, adding the government is attempting to understand to issues such as transport and childcare for working parents. Suzi asked what plans would be in place to prevent the tourism industry from collapsing. Ms Hyslop said the extension of the furlough scheme announced yesterday was ""welcome"" and said she had argued that the events sector would need a ""longer tail"" in terms of the support it requires.

Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter The owner of one of the oldest cinemas in Scotland says he hopes to be able to reopen its doors in mid-July. The coronavirus lockdown forced the family-run Dominion Cinema in Edinburgh to close for only the second time in its 82-year history.  Director Alastair Cameron said they had ""battened down the hatches"" to make sure the business survived. But he said everything had now been put in place to enable the cinema to open safely when the time came.

Homes for Scotland (HFS) and the SGA Fishing Group have both written to Holyrood ministers asking for restrictions around their industries to be lifted, following changes south of the border. ""Our industry contributes significantly to Scotlandâs social and economic wellbeing and we are ready and willing to reopen safely with additional measures in place to help protect our employees and customers, while also supporting the struggling economy,"" said HFS chief executive Nicola Barclay. Meanwhile, the SGA Fishing Group wants Scotland's rivers to be accessible again, saying that salmon fishing brings Â£135m to the nation's economy. ""Angling is relatively solitary,"" said member Robert White. ""It has known physical and mental health benefits. It would also allow some fisheries to get at least some income in, too."" Nicola Sturgeon was asked about the report by the Scottish Tory leader during FMQs. The first minister replied that it was possible the number of deaths in England and Wales was being under reported.

The Dundee Courier get the last question at today's UK government briefing. Housing minister Robert Jenrick is asked what will happen to the government's job retention or furlough scheme for workers in Scotland if it remains in effective lockdown longer than the rest of the UK. Could the Treasury step in to pay for the scheme if the Scottish government's borrowing powers are too stretched? Jenrick says it is a UK-wide scheme and the government will have regard to how it is working in all parts of the UK, adding that it has recently been extended to October. A woman who spent 45 days in hospital after being admitted with coronavirus has been applauded by nurses to mark her recovery. Maureen Deuchars, from Dundee, left Ninewells Hospital in the city earlier today.

"The first minister has indicated there could be some easing of lockdown measures in Scotland from 28 May. More detail on the plan is expected to be published later this week, which is likely to allow some outdoor work and activities such as golf. Ms Sturgeon has given an indication of what might happen in Scotland in her""looking beyond lockdown"",externaldocument. The UK government has issued its""our plan to rebuild"",externalstrategy. How do the rules in Scotland differ from the UK's other nations - and how similar will they be after the end of the month? In England, people who cannot work from home are now ""actively encouraged to go to work"", with construction and manufacturing being explicitly mentioned by the prime minister. They should still avoid public transport if possible because of social distancing and employers should make workplaces ""Covid-secure"" - for instance by staggering shifts, rethinking shared equipment and planning safe walking routes. On Monday 18 May, Northern Ireland introduced ""step one"" of the loosening of restrictions, which also encouraged those unable to work from home to go back to work on a phased basis. However in Scotland, the government says businesses should only open if what they do is essential to the effort of tackling the virus or the wellbeing of society. Tradespeople such as plumbers can carry out maintenance and essential repairs if they are not showing symptoms but no work should be carried out in a household that is self-isolating. The Scottish government is looking at how some outdoor work may be able to resume safely after 28 May. People in England are now advised to wear face coverings on public transport or in shops - advice that wasfirst issued in Scotland almost a fortnight earlier. In England, thenew social distancing guidelines,externalmean that people can take ""unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise"" and generally spend more time outdoors for leisure purposes. Sports such as basketball, tennis and fishing are allowed  - as long as they involve members of the same household. Golf courses and bowling greens can be used alone or with household members - or with one non-household member if social distancing is maintained. People are also free to sit in parks, and to ""play sports"" with people from the same household. Driving to a beach or park is also permitted - but people are being told not travel to other parts of the UK where different rules apply. Social distancing rules - keeping at least 2m apart from non-household members - must still be adhered to. In Northern Ireland, phase one of its lockdown easing sees outdoor spaces and public sports amenities reopen. Water sports, golf and tennis as well as angling are permitted. Golf is now also allowed in Wales, which made the change to bring it into line with England. Wales also made other ""modest"" changes, allowing people to exercise outside more than once a day, and reopening some garden centres. In Scotland, people are now allowed to go outside more than once a day to exercise - but this should continue to take place close to home, either alone or with members of their household. The change does not allow people to mix with other households or relax outdoors, for instance by sunbathing in a park. The key message remains that people should stay at home. But the first minister has indicated that, after 28 May, people will be allowed some outdoor activities such as sitting in a park. Some sports, such as golf, tennis and fishing, could also be set to resume. The new guidelines for England say that two people from different households can now meet in outdoor settings such as parks as long as they stay more than 2m apart. New rules in Northern Ireland allow groups of up to six people who do not share a household to meet up outdoors while maintaining social distancing. However, NI ministers did not reach agreement to allow visits to immediate family indoors yet, despite it being part of the first step of the recovery plan. In Scotland the advice remains that members of different households should not be meeting up. The measures being considered for introduction after 28 May are likely to include allowing people to meet others from outside their own household in an outdoor setting - but still keeping 2m apart. While food stores and other ""essential outlets"" have remained open, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the ""phased reopening"" of other shops may begin at the start of June at the earliest. This will only happen where social distancing rules can be followed. Garden centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have already reopened and Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland is likely to go down the same route at the end of May. No date has yet been suggested for the reopening of non-essential retail outlets in Scotland. Waste recycling facilities are also likely to open in Scotland, as they have in the other three nations. Primary schools in England may be able to reopen ""in stages"" from 1 June at the earliest, according to Boris Johnson. He says it is also an ""ambition"" to give secondary pupils doing exams next year some time with their teachers before the summer holidays. Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford said the ""ambition"" was to get some children ""back into school before the summer break"". In Northern Ireland, ministers had already ruled out a return of schools before the summer and a phased return is planned for September, to tie in with the start of a new educational year. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has saidshe does not expect schools to reopen as early as 1 June. The Scottish government has also talked about a phased reopening, with priority given to primary pupils transitioning to secondary and those starting national qualification courses in S3 to S6. However, Ms Sturgeon has previously warned it is possible there will be no return to school before the summer holidays. In Scotland, these start in late June or early July, a little earlier than in England. At Monday's briefing, the first minister said she hoped it would be possible to give more information shortly on a likely timetable towards reopening schools. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""In common with pretty much every economy...we're facing severe impact from the coronavirus"" The chancellor has said it is ""very likely"" the UK is in a ""significant recession"", as figures show the economy contracting at the fastest pace since the financial crisis. The economy shrankby 2% in the first three months,externalof 2020, as coronavirus forced the country into lockdown. Rishi Sunak told the BBC that just ""a few days of impact from the virus"" in March pushed the economy into decline. Economists expect an even bigger slump in the current quarter. Mr Sunak said: ""It is now very likely that the UK economy will face a significant recession this year, and we're already in the middle of that as we speak."" The first quarter drop was driven by a record fall in March output, and comes after the economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2019. How big is the UK's economy? Bank of England warns of sharpest recession on record UK furlough scheme extended by four months What is the UK's GDP? Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures showed the UK economy was ""already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect"". She added: ""With the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse."" While analysts expected a larger quarterly decline of 2.6% in the first three months of the year, it still represents the biggest contraction since the end of 2008, when the world's major economies sank into recession. To put the fall in context, Ms Gregory said that ""in just one month the economy has tumbled by as much as it did in the year and a half after the global financial crisis"". That crisis, sparked by over-zealous lending and heavily-indebted businesses and consumers, led governments to impose austerity measures lasting years. In 2008, the UK bailed out some major banks by taking multi-billion-pound stakes in them. But without access to state support, many companies folded. The lockdown measures announced by Mr Sunak mark a more radical intervention in the economy, with the state paying the wages of vast swathes of the workforce and guaranteeing loans to businesses. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there had been ""widespread"" declines across the services, manufacturing and construction sectors. This includes a record 1.9% fall in services output, which includes retailers, travel agents and hotels. Household spending shrank at the fastest pace in more than 11 years as restaurants and high street shops remained shut. The ONS said a rise in spending on food, alcohol and new TVs only partially offset the decline. On Wednesday, the government stepped in to underwrite trade credit insurance, to ensure the insurance market can continue to function. The insurance is taken out by companies to enable them to avoid the financial impact if the firms they do business with collapse before they have paid for goods or services. According to recent data from Morgan Stanley, insurers worldwide could have to pay up to $46bn (Â£37.6bn) in trade credit insurance claims due to the coronavirus lockdown. Insurers had warned the government that they might not be able to survive if they have to pay out huge claims due to struggling British businesses failing to pay their bills. The figures come assome of the lockdown restrictions are starting to be eased. Some employees in England who cannot work from home are now being encouraged to return to their workplaces. Sectors ""allowed to be open, should be open"", the government says. These include food production, construction and manufacturing. Like so many companies, Spinder could not operate in a world of social distancing - but the founder has re-invented the business. Formed more than three years ago by Rich Allsop, Spinder is a London-based gym and exercise class aimed at the gay community. ""Things changed very quickly in mid-March,"" he says. ""The full lockdown hit, and Spinder in its pure form had to end. I refused to give in. I refused to let my business and livelihood die and our wonderful community disperse."" Within 24 hours he re-imagined what Spinder classes could be in an online world, and SpinderCast was born. ""I was pleased to see that a lot of the regulars have come with me. Now that we are online, our classes are even more accessible, attracting members from all over the UK and as far away as Cape Town."" He's no plan to give up on the gym studio itself, ""as everyone keeps telling me how they can't wait to get back"". But Mr Allsop is worried about the financial impact of recession on customers. ""We'll see how we can pull together to help them continue to attend our classes,"" says. Still, the lockdown crisis hasn't ended his business, but created a successful offshoot. ""The strength and support of Spinder's community and the Spinder brand means we will survive,"" he says. In other developments,estate agents in England can now reopen, viewings can take place and removal firms and conveyancers can re-start operations, so long as social-distancing and workplace safety rules are followed. On Tuesday, Mr Sunakannounced an extension of the furlough schemesubsidising wages to the end of October. Mr Sunak said Wednesday's GDP data underlined why the government had taken ""unprecedented action"" to support jobs, incomes and livelihoods"" at a time of severe disruption. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? France and Italy saw much bigger contractions of 5.8% and 4.7% respectively in the first quarter, where lockdowns were imposed up to two weeks earlier. However, analysts expect a double-digit drop in UK gross domestic product (GDP) in the coming quarter. The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is likely tosuffer its sharpest recession on record this year, even if the lockdown is completely lifted by the end of September. While the Bank said the economy could shrink by 14% in 2020, it expects the downturn to be short and sharp, with growth of 15% predicted in 2021. The decline is also expected to be less prolonged than during the financial crisis, when the economy kept shrinking for more than a year. The economy also took five years to get back to the size it was before the meltdown. The Bank of England expects the UK to rebound more quickly this time, returning to its pre-crisis size within two years. Today's figure shows that the UK economy has already undeniably entered recession, although that will not be officially confirmed until August. In and of itself the loss of 2% of the value of the economy in one quarter is very rare, it is one of the five worst three month periods since modern records began in 1955. But this was the consequence of an already stagnant economy hit by just over a week of official shutdown at the end of March. That led to a record monthly fall in the economy of 6%, about the same fall seen over a much longer period in the last recession in 2008. It means that the current second quarter between April and June is set to see truly incredible record falls in excess of of 20 to 30% - perhaps a quarter of the whole economy. The chancellor said that it was too early to speculate on the shape of any rebound, but fears are growing that it can no longer be presumed as rapid. And as welcome as the unprecedented support has been, the government is likely to come under pressure from industry over further support, delaying travel quarantines, and the need for a post Brexit trade deal. The global economic impact of the crisis was underlined on Wednesday in a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), It warned that world trade in goods is set to slump at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009, with estimates becoming increasingly gloomy over the past weeks. Trade is seen down 3% in the first quarter from the final three months of 2019 and by a further 26.9% in the second quarter, UNCTAD said. ""There were falls of a similar magnitude in 2009 during the global financial crisis, although the decline was not as steep as in 2020. At that time, global trade rebounded just as quickly, in line with global economic recovery,"" UNCTAD said. No, we're not, although we can be pretty sure that the lockdown has been bad for the economy overall. This is the first estimate of the change in the value of stuff produced by the UK economy, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), between January and March. The first estimate is published pretty soon after the end of the period it is measuring, and it tends to rely on more reliable data for the first couple of months of the quarter-year, and less on what happened in the third month. That's a problem for this set of figures, because the period we are most interested in is the last week in March, when lockdown had started. Also, a lot of the data behind these figures comes from surveys, and the ONS says that as a result of the coronavirus measures, fewer companies responded to its surveys. And the ONS is facing just the same challenges when doing its work as any other business. It warns that this estimate is ""subject to more uncertainty than usual"".

"Allowing family gatherings is an ""important public health issue"", England's deputy chief medical officer has said - but it is ""complicated"" to make the rules fair. Dr Jenny Harries said such a move could provide a ""mental health boost"". But she said if two large families wanted to meet ""you end up effectively with quite a large gathering"". Some lockdown measures have been eased in England but restrictions on how many people you can meet remain in place. Two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings, such as parks - as long as they stay more than two metres apart. But any larger meetings between different households at the same time are currently banned. The UK government has said this means someone cannot see both parents at the same time. All you need to know about new lockdown measures Who am I allowed to meet now? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Why the lockdown ended in garden centres first Moving home allowed as curbs lift on estate agents At the daily No 10 briefing earlier, Dr Harries was asked whether this could be expanded to allow different households to meet as ""bubbles"" or ""clusters"". She said such a move would be particularly beneficial to those ""who have been on their own or who are isolated from others"". But she added that any such step had to be ""fair"" and ""consistent with public health advice"". ""So for example if you have families with large numbers already in their families who want to meet up, you end up effectively with quite a large gathering even if it's just two families meeting. ""I think it's really important that we think through the implications of that, particularly across families in different circumstances. If your family is a long way away, for example, you may be less able to do that."" Understandably meeting up with family is something we miss dearly. The government has tried to offer some flexibility in England by allowing people to meet outside in twos where the risk of infection is low because of the ability to keep your distance and the fact you are in the fresh air. But, of course, that is not the same as having people round for a Sunday lunch or visiting relatives for a weekend. The problem the government and its advisers face is that the risk coronavirus presents differs hugely depending if you are the grandparent or grandchild. The average 80-year-old has a nearly one in 10 chance of dying if they are infected, whereas for children the risk is virtually zero. It's not just about individual risk either. A spike in infections among older people would overwhelm the health service. Around a quarter of people over 70 who are infected need hospital treatment. Family gatherings, involving multiple generations, where people are in close proximity, are simply too dangerous until we know more about the virus and who in particular among the older generations - and younger people with health conditions for that matter - is most at risk. Meanwhile, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick defended the government'sdecision to allow potential home buyers to view properties in England.The property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remain shut. Speaking at Wednesday's briefing, he said he had been asked why the government would allow people to ""look around a stranger's home but not visit their loved ones or parents"". Mr Jenrick said he understood ""why this can seem confusing at first glance"" but said estate agents must follow new guidelines during viewings. These include: Viewings should first happen ""virtually"" Physical visits by appointments only - no open house Speculative viewings are ""highly discouraged"" All internal doors should be opened where possible The current occupier should vacate the building during the viewing, for example standing in the garden Hand washing upon entering the property And all surfaces, including door handles should be ""thoroughly cleaned"" afterwards This video can not be played ""This may seem confusing at first glance especially when people have been separated from their loved ones for so long"" - Jenrick It is estimated there are 450,000 buyers and renters with plans on hold. Property website Zoopla previously estimated that about 373,000 property sales had been put on hold during lockdown - with a total value of Â£82bn. Mr Jenrick added that it was ""essential that we cautiously open up parts of our economy where it's safe to do so"". His call came as the number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UKhas reached 33,186,,externala rise of 494 on the previous day. In other developments: Ministers are looking at ways to allow private prayer in places of worship before the buildings are fully opened on 4 July ""at the earliest"" Construction site opening hours are to be extended - staying open until 21:00 BST, Monday to Saturday, subject to local authority approval, Mr Jenrick said The government is working ""very closely with our main cultural institutions"" to see how they might reopen with social distancing in place The government again missed its 100,000 daily coronavirus testing target, with 87,063 tests on Tuesday The prime minister has been accused of misleading MPsover advice to care homes at the start of the pandemic on controlling infections Up to 8,000 jobs are at risk at travel firm Tui,as it pledges to ""reinvent the holiday in 2020"" amid the pandemic Teacher unions have warned that schoolsdo not have adequate safety measures in place to reopen, after the government told them prepare to open for more children from 1 June The Transport Salaried Staffs Association is urging the government to extend the coronavirus compensation scheme for NHS and care workers who die with coronavirus to transport workers.

"The last thing Wales needs is a culture of people being ""shamed"" because they are not wearing masks, the country's chief medical officer Frank Atherton has said. Wales is the only UK nation that has not recommended the use of face coverings. People in England are being advised to wear coverings insome enclosed spaces. Dr Atherton said their benefits had been potentially ""oversold"" and there were ""practical drawbacks"". The Welsh Government is not telling the public to refrain from wearing masks - but it is not making it mandatory, or recommending their use. Officials think the potential benefits are low, and are worried about any impact on supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the NHS. Face masks: How does advice differ in Wales? Lockdown confusion for those living on the borders Closing Wales-England border not a 'real option' Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, Dr Atherton argued basic hygiene and social distancing can make more of a difference than the compulsory use of face masks. ""My advice is that people should use them if they choose to, but they shouldn't be mandatory,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be saying that people have to wear face masks here in Wales, but if they choose to do so then obviously that'sâ¦ their right."" He said the benefits are ""quite small"". The UK government SAGE advisory group had ""drawn the conclusion there is a small benefit but it's based on very weak evidence"", he said. Dr Atherton said he is worried about creating a culture of mistrust But he said people who have symptoms ""shouldn't feel that they can put on a face mask and go about their business going to a supermarket. ""That will be extremely risky. People who have symptoms really should be staying home,"" he said. He said there is a risk ""people could start to use supplies which really should be going into the NHS"". ""And the third thing that I really worry about is creating a culture of mistrust,"" he added. ""The last thing I think we need in Wales is a kind of mask shaming, because somebody hasn't got a mask. ""We have to focus on basic hygiene, on the social distancing measures, not touching our face when we can avoid it, and keeping our distance.

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says the government was âtoo slowâ to protect people in care homes from coronavirus. Boris Johnson must account for official figures showing 10,000 ""unexplained"" deaths in care homes last month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Sir Keir said there were 18,000 more deaths in April than the average for that month, but only 8,000 were recorded as coronavirus-related. He said the government had been ""too slow to protect people in care homes"". Mr Johnson said there ""is much more to do but we are making progress"" on reducing the pandemic in care homes. And he announced a further Â£600m to fight infections in care homes in England. The money will be funnelled through local councils to help improve infection control by measures such as reducing staff rotation between homes, increasing testing and ensuring small independent homes have access to expert advice. Mr Johnson and Sir Keir also clashed at Prime Minister's Questions over government advice issued at the start of the pandemic. PM announces extra Â£600m for care homes in England Care home virus deaths 'starting to decline' Sir Keir said that up until 12 March care homes were being told it was ""very unlikely"" anyone would become infected. The prime minister said ""it wasn't true the advice said that"". Sir Keir wrote to the PM after the session, to accuse him of misleading MPs and asking him to return to the Commons to correct the record. But in a letter responding to Sir Keir, Mr Johnson said he stood by his comments and accused the Labour leader of ""selectively and misleadingly"" quoting guidance from Public Health England. The advice that was withdrawn in mid-March was based on the assumption at the time that the virus was not spreading widely in the community. In hindsight, that assumption was wrong and the fear that the virus had taken hold was part of the reason the government ordered the lockdown. At that point the advice was withdrawn. But the large death toll in care homes is also related to what happened after that point. Because we did not have a testing network or the right stocks of personal protective equipment care homes have undoubtedly suffered. The NHS became the major priority and even now not all staff or residents have been tested. The deaths being reported in care homes have also been a source of concern and confusion for a number of weeks. Sir Keir Starmer is right to say a large number of deaths are unaccounted for. There are a number of possible explanations for this. They could be coronavirus cases that have been under-reported - the lack of testing in care homes may mean doctors have missed the presence of the virus when they have filled in the death certificates. They could be ""indirect deaths"" related to the fact that residents have been unable to get care for other conditions, such as heart disease. Finally, some are likely to be people who in previous years would have been taken to hospital to die but were kept in care homes - the ONS data also shows that the number of non-coronavirus deaths in hospital have actually fallen. The guidance at the centre of the row,externalwas issued on 25 February and withdrawn on 13 March, a time when the virus was not thought to be spreading in the community. It said: ""This guidance is intended for the current position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of COVID-19 in the community. ""It is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected."" The guidance went on: ""There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present."" The prime minister's letter accused Sir Keir of ""neglecting"" to provide the context of the guidance. Mr Johnson said deaths in care homes were too high In his letter to Mr Johnson, the Labour leader said: ""At this time of national crisis it is more important than ever that government ministers are accurate in the information they give."" He added that: ""I expect you to come to the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the record."" In his letter to Sir Keir, Mr Johnson said he had sought engagement and consultation with opposition parties and added: ""The public expect us to work together."" At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said the government had brought in the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown but that there was ""unquestionably an appalling epidemic"" in that setting. He added that the number of deaths in care homes had been ""too high"", but that ""the number of outbreaks is down and the number of fatalities well down"". Sir Keir pointed to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed at least 40% of Covid-19 deaths in England and Wales occurred in care homes. And he quoted a cardiologist who had told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that hospitals had ""actively seeded"" the virus into the ""most vulnerable"" population by discharging ""known, suspected and unknown cases into care homes"". Mr Johnson said: ""The number of discharges from hospitals into care homes went down in March and April and we had a system of testing people going into care homes and that testing is now being ramped up.""

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""In common with pretty much every economy...we're facing severe impact from the coronavirus"" The chancellor has said it is ""very likely"" the UK is in a ""significant recession"", as figures show the economy contracting at the fastest pace since the financial crisis. The economy shrankby 2% in the first three months,externalof 2020, as coronavirus forced the country into lockdown. Rishi Sunak told the BBC that just ""a few days of impact from the virus"" in March pushed the economy into decline. Economists expect an even bigger slump in the current quarter. Mr Sunak said: ""It is now very likely that the UK economy will face a significant recession this year, and we're already in the middle of that as we speak."" The first quarter drop was driven by a record fall in March output, and comes after the economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2019. How big is the UK's economy? Bank of England warns of sharpest recession on record UK furlough scheme extended by four months What is the UK's GDP? Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures showed the UK economy was ""already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect"". She added: ""With the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse."" While analysts expected a larger quarterly decline of 2.6% in the first three months of the year, it still represents the biggest contraction since the end of 2008, when the world's major economies sank into recession. To put the fall in context, Ms Gregory said that ""in just one month the economy has tumbled by as much as it did in the year and a half after the global financial crisis"". That crisis, sparked by over-zealous lending and heavily-indebted businesses and consumers, led governments to impose austerity measures lasting years. In 2008, the UK bailed out some major banks by taking multi-billion-pound stakes in them. But without access to state support, many companies folded. The lockdown measures announced by Mr Sunak mark a more radical intervention in the economy, with the state paying the wages of vast swathes of the workforce and guaranteeing loans to businesses. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there had been ""widespread"" declines across the services, manufacturing and construction sectors. This includes a record 1.9% fall in services output, which includes retailers, travel agents and hotels. Household spending shrank at the fastest pace in more than 11 years as restaurants and high street shops remained shut. The ONS said a rise in spending on food, alcohol and new TVs only partially offset the decline. On Wednesday, the government stepped in to underwrite trade credit insurance, to ensure the insurance market can continue to function. The insurance is taken out by companies to enable them to avoid the financial impact if the firms they do business with collapse before they have paid for goods or services. According to recent data from Morgan Stanley, insurers worldwide could have to pay up to $46bn (Â£37.6bn) in trade credit insurance claims due to the coronavirus lockdown. Insurers had warned the government that they might not be able to survive if they have to pay out huge claims due to struggling British businesses failing to pay their bills. The figures come assome of the lockdown restrictions are starting to be eased. Some employees in England who cannot work from home are now being encouraged to return to their workplaces. Sectors ""allowed to be open, should be open"", the government says. These include food production, construction and manufacturing. Like so many companies, Spinder could not operate in a world of social distancing - but the founder has re-invented the business. Formed more than three years ago by Rich Allsop, Spinder is a London-based gym and exercise class aimed at the gay community. ""Things changed very quickly in mid-March,"" he says. ""The full lockdown hit, and Spinder in its pure form had to end. I refused to give in. I refused to let my business and livelihood die and our wonderful community disperse."" Within 24 hours he re-imagined what Spinder classes could be in an online world, and SpinderCast was born. ""I was pleased to see that a lot of the regulars have come with me. Now that we are online, our classes are even more accessible, attracting members from all over the UK and as far away as Cape Town."" He's no plan to give up on the gym studio itself, ""as everyone keeps telling me how they can't wait to get back"". But Mr Allsop is worried about the financial impact of recession on customers. ""We'll see how we can pull together to help them continue to attend our classes,"" says. Still, the lockdown crisis hasn't ended his business, but created a successful offshoot. ""The strength and support of Spinder's community and the Spinder brand means we will survive,"" he says. In other developments,estate agents in England can now reopen, viewings can take place and removal firms and conveyancers can re-start operations, so long as social-distancing and workplace safety rules are followed. On Tuesday, Mr Sunakannounced an extension of the furlough schemesubsidising wages to the end of October. Mr Sunak said Wednesday's GDP data underlined why the government had taken ""unprecedented action"" to support jobs, incomes and livelihoods"" at a time of severe disruption. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? France and Italy saw much bigger contractions of 5.8% and 4.7% respectively in the first quarter, where lockdowns were imposed up to two weeks earlier. However, analysts expect a double-digit drop in UK gross domestic product (GDP) in the coming quarter. The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is likely tosuffer its sharpest recession on record this year, even if the lockdown is completely lifted by the end of September. While the Bank said the economy could shrink by 14% in 2020, it expects the downturn to be short and sharp, with growth of 15% predicted in 2021. The decline is also expected to be less prolonged than during the financial crisis, when the economy kept shrinking for more than a year. The economy also took five years to get back to the size it was before the meltdown. The Bank of England expects the UK to rebound more quickly this time, returning to its pre-crisis size within two years. Today's figure shows that the UK economy has already undeniably entered recession, although that will not be officially confirmed until August. In and of itself the loss of 2% of the value of the economy in one quarter is very rare, it is one of the five worst three month periods since modern records began in 1955. But this was the consequence of an already stagnant economy hit by just over a week of official shutdown at the end of March. That led to a record monthly fall in the economy of 6%, about the same fall seen over a much longer period in the last recession in 2008. It means that the current second quarter between April and June is set to see truly incredible record falls in excess of of 20 to 30% - perhaps a quarter of the whole economy. The chancellor said that it was too early to speculate on the shape of any rebound, but fears are growing that it can no longer be presumed as rapid. And as welcome as the unprecedented support has been, the government is likely to come under pressure from industry over further support, delaying travel quarantines, and the need for a post Brexit trade deal. The global economic impact of the crisis was underlined on Wednesday in a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), It warned that world trade in goods is set to slump at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009, with estimates becoming increasingly gloomy over the past weeks. Trade is seen down 3% in the first quarter from the final three months of 2019 and by a further 26.9% in the second quarter, UNCTAD said. ""There were falls of a similar magnitude in 2009 during the global financial crisis, although the decline was not as steep as in 2020. At that time, global trade rebounded just as quickly, in line with global economic recovery,"" UNCTAD said. No, we're not, although we can be pretty sure that the lockdown has been bad for the economy overall. This is the first estimate of the change in the value of stuff produced by the UK economy, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), between January and March. The first estimate is published pretty soon after the end of the period it is measuring, and it tends to rely on more reliable data for the first couple of months of the quarter-year, and less on what happened in the third month. That's a problem for this set of figures, because the period we are most interested in is the last week in March, when lockdown had started. Also, a lot of the data behind these figures comes from surveys, and the ONS says that as a result of the coronavirus measures, fewer companies responded to its surveys. And the ONS is facing just the same challenges when doing its work as any other business. It warns that this estimate is ""subject to more uncertainty than usual"".

"Some passengers at Canning Town underground station in east London wore masks for their commute on Wednesday morning Some people in England who cannot work from home are returning to their workplaces today, as the government begins easing some lockdown measures. The government urged people to avoid public transport if possible. But some commuters said Tube trains and buses were still too busy to observe social distancing rules. Meanwhile,new guidance issued by the College of Policing,externalsaid officers had ""no powers to enforce two-metre distancing"" in England. Under the new rules in England, people can now spend more time outside and move house. Garden centres can reopen and sports that are physically distanced - such as golf - are now permitted. Two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings, such as parks, as long as they stay more than 2m apart. However, government guidance on maintaining a 2m distance, avoiding public transport and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces is ""not enforceable"" by officers in England, according to the fresh guidelines from the College of Policing. All you need to know about new lockdown measures Who am I allowed to meet now? What can the police fine you for doing? Why the lockdown ended in garden centres first It follows a speech by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday in which heunveiled a ""conditional plan"" aimed at reopening society. This has led to a divergence in lockdown rules between the UK government and the devolved administrations, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland keeping stricter measures in place and retaining the message to stay at home. It comes as figures from the Office for National Statisticsshowed the UK economy shrank at the fastest pace since the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2020. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC it was ""very likely"" the UK would face a ""significant recession"" as a result of the pandemic. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UKhas reached 33,186,,externala rise of 494 on the previous day. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick led the Downing Street daily briefing and was joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries. The lockdown has brought immense challenges for the police service. Although crime has plummeted and police sickness rates have been far lower than expected, officers have found themselves caught in the middle of a web of hastily-drawn up regulations and guidelines. The latest police guidance for England suggests their job won't be any easier as it makes clear they can only enforce the law - not government advice. That means, for example, you can be stopped or fined if you go on an overnight trip or meet up with two or more people from outside your home - because that's the law. But officers can't prevent you from standing close to a stranger or travelling by train without a face mask on - because two-metre distancing and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces are guidance. In England, employers have been issued withguidelines on keeping workplaces as safe as possible,external, including staggering shifts and frequent cleaning. Those who flout the rules could face criminal proceedings, the Health and Safety Executive watchdog has warned. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the new guidelines for employers were ""a step in the right direction"" but ""the real test will be delivery"". She said employers should publish a risk assessment and if workers had any concerns they could contact the Health and Safety Executive hotline. ""It's really important to remember that workers do have that right in law not to work if it would put them in imminent danger,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Some commuters were not able to maintain a 2m distance on a Victoria Line Tube into central London By contrast, one commuter pictured this almost-deserted Tyne and Wear Metro carriage in Newcastle There was some traffic on the M1 in Northamptonshire on Wednesday morning York Tennis Club opened for players on Wednesday after restrictions were eased Asked how it was possible for people to maintain social distancing on public transport as more people returned to work, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government was urging people to cycle and walk where possible. ""The absolute key here is for anybody who can to make alternative arrangements for travel,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He added that, even if the public transport network was running at full capacity, only one in 10 passengers would be able to travel while keeping to social distancing rules. Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Bus drivers' safety fears as lockdown eases LIVE: First day of eased lockdown across England Passenger numbers across the UK's major railway stations were up 10% up compared with the same day last week, BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said. Transport for London (TfL) said the number of passengers using the Tube from the start of service to 06:00 was up by 8.7% compared with the same period last week. As of 10:00 the number of Tube passengers was about 7.3% higher. However both figures are still a fraction of the normal numbers and Downing Street said TfL was ""not reporting significant increases"" on the London network compared to the last few days. One commutertold the BBC it was ""next to impossible"" to socially distance on the London Undergroundand most people were not wearing masks. In Blackpool, a hospital worker said the downstairs of her bus was ""packed"" during her morning commute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Buzzfeed News staff in New York: The company says it is to focus on US stories Online media firm Buzzfeed is to close its UK and Australian news operations. The US company, which set up its London office in 2013, said the decision had been made ""both for economic and strategic reasons"".

Some staff will stay on to cover social news, celebrity and investigations, but it is thought about 10 jobs are affected. BBC News media editor Amol Rajan said the affected UK staff had been furloughed. He added that the title ""did much outstanding work"" and its closure showed that the coronavirus crisis had ""claimed a high-profile journalistic institution"".

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has mistakenly joined a Tory rebellion against the government over post-Brexit food import standards. Mr Sunak voted digitally for a change to the Agriculture Bill that would have guaranteed a ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef. The amendment was defeated by 277 to 328, a majority of 51. A source close to the chancellor blamed ""teething problems"" with a new online voting system. ""The chancellor did not intentionally vote against the government. He called the chief whip straight away to explain,"" added the source. MPs urge UK ban on chlorinated chicken MPs warn of 'premature' return to normal Commons Several MPs made the same mistake in what was only the second time they have voted digitally. The system - brought in to allow MPs to continue working during the coronavirus lockdown - does not allow MPs to change their vote once it has been cast. Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing said she had been told some MPs had mistakenly voted the wrong way and ""that their use of technology was not quite as good as they felt that it ought to be"". But she told MPs she was ""satisfied"" the mistakes had not affected the outcome of the vote. Ministers say the issue of protecting food standards in post-Brexit trade will be dealt with in the upcoming Trade Bill. But opponents of practices such chlorine-washing chicken say that could lead to farm standards being bargained away in negotiations. Instead, they wanted ministers to guarantee food standards in the Agriculture Bill. Leading rebel, Tory MP Simon Hoare, warned MPs that without changes to the bill ""food imports to this country would be cheap for no other reason bar the fact that they were raised to lower standards"". Fellow rebel Neil Parish, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, told MPs it was time to support such measures. Tory rebels called on American farmers to improve their standards He said: ""I'd say to the Americans, why don't you upgrade your production? Why don't you reduce the density of population of your chicken? ""Why don't you reduce the amount of antibiotics you're using and then you can actually produce better chicken not only for America, it can also come into this country? ""Let's not be frightened of putting clauses into this bill that protect us to have the great environment and welfare that the whole bill wants to have and farmers want to have."" But Environment Minister Victoria Prentis warned of ""unintended consequences"" of amending the bill and insisted all EU import standards will be converted into domestic law by the end of the December 2020 transition period. She told MPs all existing import requirements would continue to apply, including ""a ban on using artificial growth hormones in beef"". She added: ""Nothing apart from potable water may be used to clean chicken carcasses and any changes to these standards would have to come before this Parliament. ""We will be doing our own inspections to ensure that these import conditions are met."" Shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said not including food standards in the bill could lead to a ""race to the bottom"". During the third reading vote, Labour spokesman Mr Pollard could be heard asking in the Commons chamber: ""How many members of the Cabinet voted the wrong way?"" Government deputy chief whip Stuart Andrew was heard replying: ""Just the one. He's a very busy man.""

"Manafort (centre) was sentenced last year Ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been released from prison to serve the remainder of his sentence at home due to Covid-19 fears. He had served a little over a year of a seven-and-a-half year sentence in jail. Manafort, 71, was convicted of conspiracy and fraud charges that stemmed from a justice department inquiry into Russian election meddling. There are over 2,800 confirmed Covid-19 cases among US federal prisoners and 50 deaths. According tothe latest data,externalfrom the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), there are 139,584 federal inmates in federal custody, and another 11,235 in community facilities, plus around 36,000 staff. According to the BOP, 2,818 inmates and 262 staff have tested positive for coronavirus. There have not been any confirmed cases of the disease at Manafort's prison, FCI Loretto in Pennsylvania. Last month, Manafort's lawyers sought for his release to home confinement in Northern Virginia, arguing that his ""age and pre-existing health conditions"" put him at high risk for infection in prison. At the end of March, Attorney General William Barr told the BOP to grant home confinement to virus-vulnerable, low-risk inmates. His memo noted ""some offenses, such as sex offenses, will render an inmate ineligible for home detention"". In April, Mr Barr directed the BOP to transfer inmates at risk for Covid-19 out of three federal facilities grappling with outbreaks, and told officials to review inmates at other similar facilities where the virus was affecting operations. The BOP reports 2,471 inmates have been moved to home confinement due to the pandemic since 26 March. US jails begin releasing prisoners amid pandemic In Pennsylvania, the governor ordered its corrections department to allow nonviolent and at-risk inmates to be momentarily released. Though the administration said as many as 1,800 people would be eligible, just 150 have been released as of 12 May,according to state corrections data,external. US jails and prisons, both federal and state, have been criticised for their handling of virus outbreaks and advocates continue to call for non-violent inmates to be released. Critics say prisoners are uniquely at-risk for the disease given overcrowding and unhygienic conditions. Inmates often lack soap and hand sanitiser is banned due to its alcohol content. The American Civil Liberties Union,externalpredicts 100,000 more Covid-19 deaths than current projections ""if jail populations are not dramatically and immediately reduced"", noting conditions in American facilities are ""substantially inferior"" to other Western nations. Another ex-Trump aide, the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen, 53, is said to be expecting home release from prison in New York later this month. A number of other high-profile convicts, including financial fraudster Bernie Madoff, 82, and comedian Bill Cosby, 82, have also appealed for release due to the virus. Manafort served as President Trump's campaign chairman from June to August 2016, when he was forced to resign over his previous work in Ukraine. He was convicted on a range of banking fraud, tax evasion, conspiracy and witness tampering charges from two separate cases relating to his work as a political consultant. Manafort said the case had taken everything from him Manafort also agreed to co-operate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in a deal for a possible lighter sentence. However, just two months later that plea deal collapsed as investigators said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the government. He was sentenced in March 2019 and his prison term was to have ended in 2024. Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Do white-collar criminals get lighter sentences?

Bruce Allison, 73, from Harrogate teed off at 07:40 this morning - making him one of the first golfers back on the course since the government allowed some sports to resume under social distancing rules to keep players safe. Mr Allison said his club, in Pannal, organised a charity draw to find out who had the privilege of being one of the first to tee off. He said: ""It was wonderful. For members it was terrific and great to be back on the course. ""We have distance markings around the tee and you have to turn up five minutes before your tee time for when you've booked. ""You don't touch the pin and clearly you can't shake hands with your partner after the game,â he added.

"Allowing family gatherings is an ""important public health issue"", England's deputy chief medical officer has said - but it is ""complicated"" to make the rules fair. Dr Jenny Harries said such a move could provide a ""mental health boost"". But she said if two large families wanted to meet ""you end up effectively with quite a large gathering"". Some lockdown measures have been eased in England but restrictions on how many people you can meet remain in place. Two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings, such as parks - as long as they stay more than two metres apart. But any larger meetings between different households at the same time are currently banned. The UK government has said this means someone cannot see both parents at the same time. All you need to know about new lockdown measures Who am I allowed to meet now? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Why the lockdown ended in garden centres first Moving home allowed as curbs lift on estate agents At the daily No 10 briefing earlier, Dr Harries was asked whether this could be expanded to allow different households to meet as ""bubbles"" or ""clusters"". She said such a move would be particularly beneficial to those ""who have been on their own or who are isolated from others"". But she added that any such step had to be ""fair"" and ""consistent with public health advice"". ""So for example if you have families with large numbers already in their families who want to meet up, you end up effectively with quite a large gathering even if it's just two families meeting. ""I think it's really important that we think through the implications of that, particularly across families in different circumstances. If your family is a long way away, for example, you may be less able to do that."" Understandably meeting up with family is something we miss dearly. The government has tried to offer some flexibility in England by allowing people to meet outside in twos where the risk of infection is low because of the ability to keep your distance and the fact you are in the fresh air. But, of course, that is not the same as having people round for a Sunday lunch or visiting relatives for a weekend. The problem the government and its advisers face is that the risk coronavirus presents differs hugely depending if you are the grandparent or grandchild. The average 80-year-old has a nearly one in 10 chance of dying if they are infected, whereas for children the risk is virtually zero. It's not just about individual risk either. A spike in infections among older people would overwhelm the health service. Around a quarter of people over 70 who are infected need hospital treatment. Family gatherings, involving multiple generations, where people are in close proximity, are simply too dangerous until we know more about the virus and who in particular among the older generations - and younger people with health conditions for that matter - is most at risk. Meanwhile, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick defended the government'sdecision to allow potential home buyers to view properties in England.The property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remain shut. Speaking at Wednesday's briefing, he said he had been asked why the government would allow people to ""look around a stranger's home but not visit their loved ones or parents"". Mr Jenrick said he understood ""why this can seem confusing at first glance"" but said estate agents must follow new guidelines during viewings. These include: Viewings should first happen ""virtually"" Physical visits by appointments only - no open house Speculative viewings are ""highly discouraged"" All internal doors should be opened where possible The current occupier should vacate the building during the viewing, for example standing in the garden Hand washing upon entering the property And all surfaces, including door handles should be ""thoroughly cleaned"" afterwards This video can not be played ""This may seem confusing at first glance especially when people have been separated from their loved ones for so long"" - Jenrick It is estimated there are 450,000 buyers and renters with plans on hold. Property website Zoopla previously estimated that about 373,000 property sales had been put on hold during lockdown - with a total value of Â£82bn. Mr Jenrick added that it was ""essential that we cautiously open up parts of our economy where it's safe to do so"". His call came as the number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UKhas reached 33,186,,externala rise of 494 on the previous day. In other developments: Ministers are looking at ways to allow private prayer in places of worship before the buildings are fully opened on 4 July ""at the earliest"" Construction site opening hours are to be extended - staying open until 21:00 BST, Monday to Saturday, subject to local authority approval, Mr Jenrick said The government is working ""very closely with our main cultural institutions"" to see how they might reopen with social distancing in place The government again missed its 100,000 daily coronavirus testing target, with 87,063 tests on Tuesday The prime minister has been accused of misleading MPsover advice to care homes at the start of the pandemic on controlling infections Up to 8,000 jobs are at risk at travel firm Tui,as it pledges to ""reinvent the holiday in 2020"" amid the pandemic Teacher unions have warned that schoolsdo not have adequate safety measures in place to reopen, after the government told them prepare to open for more children from 1 June The Transport Salaried Staffs Association is urging the government to extend the coronavirus compensation scheme for NHS and care workers who die with coronavirus to transport workers.

Like McDonald's, the burger chain is serving a limited menu. Customers have to order via food delivery mobile apps Just Eat and Deliveroo, even when visiting drive-through restaurants. There has been high demand at some Burger King outlets, with a newly reopened Burger King restaurant in Moray having to close on Wednesdaydue to long queues of traffic. A newly reopened Burger King restaurant in Moray, Scotland had to close after long queues by the restaurant caused traffic congestion on Wednesday Coffee chain Starbucks will also from Thursday begin a phased reopening of 150 of its drive-through locations and some takeaway-only stores.

"Some passengers at Canning Town underground station in east London wore masks for their commute on Wednesday morning Some people in England who cannot work from home are returning to their workplaces today, as the government begins easing some lockdown measures. The government urged people to avoid public transport if possible. But some commuters said Tube trains and buses were still too busy to observe social distancing rules. Meanwhile,new guidance issued by the College of Policing,externalsaid officers had ""no powers to enforce two-metre distancing"" in England. Under the new rules in England, people can now spend more time outside and move house. Garden centres can reopen and sports that are physically distanced - such as golf - are now permitted. Two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings, such as parks, as long as they stay more than 2m apart. However, government guidance on maintaining a 2m distance, avoiding public transport and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces is ""not enforceable"" by officers in England, according to the fresh guidelines from the College of Policing. All you need to know about new lockdown measures Who am I allowed to meet now? What can the police fine you for doing? Why the lockdown ended in garden centres first It follows a speech by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday in which heunveiled a ""conditional plan"" aimed at reopening society. This has led to a divergence in lockdown rules between the UK government and the devolved administrations, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland keeping stricter measures in place and retaining the message to stay at home. It comes as figures from the Office for National Statisticsshowed the UK economy shrank at the fastest pace since the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2020. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC it was ""very likely"" the UK would face a ""significant recession"" as a result of the pandemic. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UKhas reached 33,186,,externala rise of 494 on the previous day. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick led the Downing Street daily briefing and was joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries. The lockdown has brought immense challenges for the police service. Although crime has plummeted and police sickness rates have been far lower than expected, officers have found themselves caught in the middle of a web of hastily-drawn up regulations and guidelines. The latest police guidance for England suggests their job won't be any easier as it makes clear they can only enforce the law - not government advice. That means, for example, you can be stopped or fined if you go on an overnight trip or meet up with two or more people from outside your home - because that's the law. But officers can't prevent you from standing close to a stranger or travelling by train without a face mask on - because two-metre distancing and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces are guidance. In England, employers have been issued withguidelines on keeping workplaces as safe as possible,external, including staggering shifts and frequent cleaning. Those who flout the rules could face criminal proceedings, the Health and Safety Executive watchdog has warned. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the new guidelines for employers were ""a step in the right direction"" but ""the real test will be delivery"". She said employers should publish a risk assessment and if workers had any concerns they could contact the Health and Safety Executive hotline. ""It's really important to remember that workers do have that right in law not to work if it would put them in imminent danger,"" she told BBC Breakfast.

""The absolute key here is for anybody who can to make alternative arrangements for travel,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He added that, even if the public transport network was running at full capacity, only one in 10 passengers would be able to travel while keeping to social distancing rules. Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Bus drivers' safety fears as lockdown eases LIVE: First day of eased lockdown across England Passenger numbers across the UK's major railway stations were up 10% up compared with the same day last week, BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said. Transport for London (TfL) said the number of passengers using the Tube from the start of service to 06:00 was up by 8.7% compared with the same period last week. As of 10:00 the number of Tube passengers was about 7.3% higher. However both figures are still a fraction of the normal numbers and Downing Street said TfL was ""not reporting significant increases"" on the London network compared to the last few days. One commutertold the BBC it was ""next to impossible"" to socially distance on the London Undergroundand most people were not wearing masks. In Blackpool, a hospital worker said the downstairs of her bus was ""packed"" during her morning commute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Asked about reports of busy rush hour trains and buses during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want to see crowding on public transport in our capital or anywhere else."" He said the government was ""working very actively"" with TfL to increase capacity and lay on more Tube trains when necessary. ""We also want to see proper marshalling at stations to prevent crowding of trains,"" he added. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

The updated lockdown regulations, which were presented to Parliament on Tuesday, also allow people to leave their homes to collect goods ordered from businesses or to travel to waste or recycling centres. Some outdoor sports can get under way again, with golf clubs and tennis courts expected to reopen to the public. Playgrounds, however, will stay shut. Restrictions have also been lifted on how far people can travel to get to the countryside, national parks and beaches in England. However, people have been warned to respect local communities, keep their distance from others and avoid busy areas. The government reiterated that staying overnight at a holiday or second home was not allowed. Those who break the rules will now face fines starting at Â£100 in England, and this will double on each further repeat offence up to Â£3,200. National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt said officers would ""continue to use common sense and discretion"". He told BBC Breakfast police would be ""encouraging"" people to go home if they were not out for a ""legitimate reason"" and enforcement and fines would be used ""only as a last resort"".

"Wanda Cooper-Jones (left), Ahmaud Arbery's mother, and his sister, Jasmine (right) The mother of Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed while out for a jog near his home in Georgia, believes ""there will be justice"". The 25-year-old was shot by a white father and son in an attack his family say was clearly racist. ""He was African-American, he was jogging in a predominantly white neighbourhood - he was targeted for the colour of his skin,"" says Wanda Cooper-Jones. Gregory and Travis McMichael were charged with murder last week. It was the first time any arrests had been made in the case, despite Ahmaud being killed on 23 February. The McMichaels admitted to killing Ahmaud in the initial police report,claiming they acted in self-defence. What we know about the case Ahmaud had dreams of being an electrician Given the time that had passed, the arrests surprised Wanda. ""In the very beginning, when it first occurred, I thought it was going to be covered up. Everything was working in that direction. If we didn't find the right resources to push the issue we wouldn't have an arrest today."" She adds: ""They visited a crime scene where there was a man dead. And all parties that were responsible were able to return home while my son was taken to the morgue."" The Glynn County Police Department says it has ""sought justice in this case from the beginning"". Ahmaud, from Brunswick in Georgia, was ""humble, happy and well-mannered"", according to his mum. ""He loved life. He was love. To know Ahmaud was to love Ahmaud."" He had dreams of being a ""very successful electrician, like his uncles are"". ""Ahmaud was young. He loved - so I'm quite sure he dreamed of having a wife and kids. ""All that was taken away."" Demonstrators have been able to go out on to the streets in support of the Arberys in the last week Wanda says it's been ""long, stressful and hopeless"" trying to get Ahmaud's name out there in the months since his death. Ordinarily with cases like this we would expect to see pictures of demonstrators out on the streets. But Ahmaud was killed as coronavirus began its spread and the lockdown started. ""I really was getting to a point where I never thought I would receive justice."" The family set up the #RunWithMaud Facebook page, which encouraged people to dedicate their workouts to the 25-year-old and share the hashtag. But it was a video of the shooting going viral that changed things. It was filmed from a vehicle following Ahmaud and shows him jogging towards a stationary truck ahead of him. He tries to bypass the truck and is seen struggling with a man carrying a shotgun. There is muffled shouting and three gunshots. Two days later the first arrests came. Memorials have been set up in Ahmaud's neighbourhood ""I haven't viewed the video, but I think it's good that it came out,"" says Wanda, who was ""really surprised"" by the arrests. Lawyer for the family Lee Merritt says ""we shouldn't have needed a video"" for an arrest to be made, adding that it's ""not something that should be for this kind of public consumption. I don't think it's helpful for the African-American community"". ""If nothing else, that video has angered, frightened, and stirred up emotions in a lot of different people... it obviously was a catalyst to get us to justice,"" he says. William Bryan, who filmed the video, is being investigated. In America, district attorneys are the people in charge of prosecuting people in different counties. Ahmaud's case is now on its fourth, which lawyer Lee says is unheard of. Two district attorneys removed themselves from the case due to professional connections to Gregory McMichael. The 64-year-old is a former police officer who also worked as an investigator for the local district attorney for years and had retired in 2019. Jackie Johnson and George Barnhill's handling of the investigation is now being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. And the federal government, which operates across the whole of the USA rather than just in individual states, is now involved too - with Donald Trump saying he is ""disturbed"" by the case. ""We are assessing all of the evidence to determine whether federal hate crime charges are appropriate,"" Department of Justice (DOJ) spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, adding that the FBI is also involved. Georgia, where Ahmaud was killed, is one of four states in America with no hate crime statutes, but the federal government can file those charges. Travis McMichael (left) and Gregory McMichael were detained on 7 May Lee Merritt says the response Ahmaud's case has received is ""extremely rare"". ""I represent a lot of victims of high-profile police shootings - and Gregory McMichael is a police officer. ""I always ask for a special prosecutor and almost never get one. I almost always ask for a DOJ investigation and almost never get one. And to have the people who failed to act, to have them being investigated? Almost never happens."" He says that things in South Georgia and all over the country ""are very tense"" due to coronavirus. ""There has been an increase in police violence, particularly against African Americans, as they tried to enforce social distancing.

"The UK's economy had zero growth in the third quarter of 2024, according to the latest official figures. The strength of the economy affects things like pay increases for workers and the amount of tax the government can raise to pay for services. GDP stands for gross domestic product, and is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishesnew GDP figures every month,external. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. That's because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. When GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which can be bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known asa recession, which can lead to pay freezes and job losses. The UK briefly fell into recession at the end of 2023, when the economy shrank in the last two quarters of the year. It rebounded in the first half of 2024, when GDP increased 0.7% between January and March, and0.5% between April and June,external. However, the economy had zero growth betweenJuly and September. The latest monthly figures show that GDPshrank by 0.1% in October. Analysts said the unexpected fall was linked to measures announcedin that month's Budget, including a rise in employernational insurance contributions (NICs)and ahigher minimum wage. In early December, the influential think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its growth forecast for the UK for 2024. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.9% across the year as a whole, down from its previous prediction of 1.1%. That would make it the fourth best performer in the G7 group of rich nations,according to the OECD,external, behind the US, Canada and France, but ahead of Italy, Germany and Japan. However, economic forecasts are not always accurate. If GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government, which it can choose to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Governments tend to get less money in tax, which means they may decide to freeze or cut public spending, or put taxes up. In 2020, the Covid pandemic caused the most severe UK recession for more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. How much money does the UK government raise and spend each year? Where does the government borrow billions from? GDP can be measured in three ways: Output: The total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction, the service sector and government Expenditure:The value of goods and services bought by households and by government, investment in machinery and buildings - this also includes the value of exports, minus imports Income: The value of the income generated, mostly in terms of profits and wages In the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question. At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in. The ONS publishes more information about thison its website,external. GDPdoesn't tell the whole story: the hidden economy:unpaid work such as caring for children or elderly relatives isn't captured inequality:it also doesn't show how income is split across a population - rising GDP could result from the richest getting richer, rather than everyone becoming better off, and some people could be worse off To try and address this, the ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. In fact, when you strip out inflation and population growth, the latest quarterly figures show thatGDP per capita actually fell by 0.1% between July and September 2024,external. Official GDP figures don't take into account unpaid work like looking after children Some critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable,or the environmental damage it might do. Alternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. Since 2010,the ONS has also measured well-being,externalalongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. But despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.

"People wearing masks has become an ubiquitous sight in many places in Asia, including China Step outside your door without a face mask in Hong Kong, Seoul or Tokyo, and you may well get a disapproving look. In recent weeks, many European nations have issued advisories to wear a mask in certain public settings, and in England the latest advice is to wear a face coveringin ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"", such as public transport and some shops. Several US states have also given similar advice, and even the White House now makes it compulsory for all staff to wear face masks - though President Donald Trump still refuses to wear one. How to make your own face mask Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Many people are still not wearing masks despite official advice though, and some governments remain unconvinced about the science. Why some people embrace masks while others shun them is not just about government directives and medical advice - it's also about culture and history, a debate over evidence, and even about personal liberties. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the official advice from the World Health Organization has been that only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are suspected to have the coronavirus. Nobody else needs to wear a mask, and experts have given several reasons for that. One is that a mask is not seen as reliable protection as other methods, given that current research shows the virus is spread by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. So it could protect you, but only in certain situations such as when you're in close quarters with others where someone infected might sneeze or cough near your face. This is why experts say frequent hand washing with soap and water is far more effective. This video can not be played With face masks in high demand, we look at whether they really can protect people from the virus Removing a mask requires special attention to avoid hand contamination, and it could also breed a false sense of security where you end up ignoring or forgetting to practice good hygiene. Yet in some parts of Asia everyone wears a mask by default - it is seen as safer and more considerate. In mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, the broad assumption is that anyone could be a carrier of the virus, even healthy people. So in the spirit of solidarity, you need to protect others from yourself. Some places take this idea very seriously: in some parts of China, you could be arrested or punished for not wearing a mask. In Singapore, which used to discourage citizens from wearing masks, it's now compulsory to wear one outside or risk a fine of S$300 (Â£170, $210). Meanwhile in Indonesia and the Philippines, where there are suspicions that there are many under-reported cases, most people in major cities wear masks to protect themselves from others. For many of these countries, mask-wearing was a cultural norm even before the coronavirus outbreak. They've even become fashion statements - at one point Hello Kitty face masks were all the rage in the street markets of Hong Kong. How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared What can the West learn from Asia's coronavirus fight? In East Asia, many people are used to wearing masks when they are sick or when it's hay fever season, because it's considered impolite to be sneezing or coughing openly. In Hong Kong, you can buy different designs of masks The 2003 Sars virus outbreak, which affected several countries in the region, also drove home the importance of wearing masks, particularly in Hong Kong, where many died as a result of the virus. So one key difference between these societies and Western ones, is that they have experienced contagion before - and the memories are still fresh and painful. In some parts of Asia, seasonal air pollution or heavy traffic pollution in crowded cities have also made it pretty normal for people to wear masks outside. Some argue that ubiquitous mask wearing, as a very visual reminder of the dangers of the virus, could actually act as a ""behavioural nudge"" to you and others for overall better personal hygiene. ""Putting on a mask every day before you go out is like a ritual, like putting on a uniform, and in ritual behaviour you feel you have to live up to what the uniform stands for, which is more hygienic behaviour like not touching your face or avoiding crowded places and social distancing,"" said Donald Low, a behavioural economist and professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Can wearing a mask act as a daily reminder to yourself and others to practise better hygiene? Then, there's the idea that every little bit counts in the war the world is waging against the virus. ""We can't say if face masks are ineffective, but we presume they have some effect because that's the protection we give to healthcare workers,"" said Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist with Hong Kong University. ""If face masks are used on a lot of people in crowded areas, I think it would have some effect on public transmission, and at the moment we're looking for every small measure we can to reduce transmission - it adds up."" But there are down sides of course. Some places such as Japan, Indonesia and Thailand have faced shortages, and South Korea has had to ration out surgical masks. There is the fear that people may end up re-using disposable masks, which is unhygienic, or use inferior masks sold on the black market. Japan and Singapore have since given out reusable masks to its citizens. People who do not wear masks in these places have also been stigmatised, to the point that they are shunned and blocked from shops and buildings. In Hong Kong, some tabloids have splashed pictures on their covers of Westerners not wearing masks and congregating in groups in the city's nightlife district, and criticised expatriates and tourists for not taking enough precautions. But the discrimination works both ways. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In places where mask wearing is still not the norm despite government advisories, those who do wear masks have been shunned or even attacked. It hasn't helped that many of these mask wearers are Asians. In the US, it's become an issue of personal freedoms, with some arguing that making everyone wear face masks infringes on civil liberties. The city of Stillwater in Oklahoma was forced to soften a mask law to an advisory after threats of violence, while a Michigan security guard was killedafter he barred a shopper who didn't have a mask from entering a store. But those societies that do advocate everyone wearing a mask may have a point and increasingly,experts are now questioning the official WHO advice,external. Firstly, there is some emerging evidence that there are more ""silent carriers"", or healthy people with the virus who show little or no symptoms, than experts initially thought. In China,it is estimated that a third of all positive cases show no symptoms,external, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. On the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, about half of the more than 600 positive cases found onboard were found to have no symptoms.  A similar proportion of asymptomatic cases has been reported in Iceland. In Wuhan and Guangzhou, Chinese authorities have said those not wearing masks could face arrest The prevailing belief has been that because these people do not exhibit symptoms, they are not very contagious. But some are questioning this now. A recently published study of cases in China found that ""undocumented cases of infection"", or those with either mild or no symptoms, were significantly contagious andcould have been responsible for nearly 80% of positive virus cases,external. Meanwhile a Hong Kong study estimates thatup to 44% of virus transmission from an infected person can happen before that person starts showing any symptoms,external. So does that mean if everyone wore a mask, these silent carriers wouldn't turn into spreaders? The jury is still out on this issue, with various studies proving and disproving the effectiveness of a mask in stopping transmission of the coronavirus.  This is why some places have so far held back from mask laws and advisories, such as New Zealand which successfully controlled its outbreak andis holding back on advising citizens to wear masks because of the lack of scientific consensus,externaland clinical trials. Research is ongoing, and future studies will no doubt add nuance to the overall picture. The face mask may be a product of recent history, experience with contagion, and cultural norm. But as this pandemic evolves, along with evidence and research, our behaviour may change again.

"This video can not be played The BBC's political editor asks Rishi Sunak if the UK is looking at a recession due to the coronavirus outbreak. The UK scheme to pay wages of workers on leave because of coronavirus will be extended to October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. Mr Sunak confirmed that employees will continue to receive 80% of their monthly wages up to Â£2,500. But he said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August. A quarter of the workforce, some 7.5 million people, are now covered by the scheme, which has cost Â£14bn a month. The chancellor said that from August, the scheme would continue for all sectors and regions of the country but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work. Employers currently using the scheme will then be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. Mr Sunak will attempt slowly to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the subsidy scheme, but full details are still to be worked out. However, sources have told the BBC the Treasury stills expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October. Later on Tuesday,in an interview with the BBC, Mr Sunak said the number of job losses ""breaks my heart"", adding: ""That's why I'm working night and day to limit the amount of job losses."" Mr Sunak told the Commons said: ""I'm extending the scheme because I won't give up on the people who rely on it. ""Our message today is simple: we stood behind Britain's workers and businesses as we came into this crisis, and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side."" There has been growing concern about the cost of the scheme, and last week Mr Sunak said it could not continue in its current form. However, he was under pressure to announce changes soon to avoid a so-called ""cliff edge"" in which employers begin mass redundancies. Any company seeking to cut more than 100 jobs must run a 45-day consultation, meaning 18 May was the last date employers could start this process before the furlough scheme ended in June. The chancellor rejected suggestions some people might get ""addicted"" to furlough if it was extended. ""Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme,"" the chancellor said. ""People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, it's not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home."" Hard decisions over the economy loom What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Why payday is different during the crisis PM 'not expecting' flood of people back to work Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said broadly welcomed the changes, saying ""at least we are moving in the right direction"". But she said the ""big elephant in the room"" is over what the government's employer contribution will involve, adding that the ""critical point is that any changes to the scheme must not result in any spike in unemployment"". Despite the extension of the furlough scheme, Patrick Langmaid said it's still unlikely to stop him making people redundant from his Mother Ivey's Bay holiday park, at Padstow. He has furloughed seven staff and has nine still working. The handful of staff he would usually employ seasonally he has let go. ""There is no income - and huge costs,"" he says. ""We are very worried about how we, as employers, are going to make contributions through August, September and October [when employers will be expected to share the costs of the scheme]"", he said. ""I am very, very worried about how I am going to cope in the winter. ""I've already started briefing my team that there will have to be redundancies,"" he says. He reckons four or five jobs may have to go, depending how long the lockdown lasts. Dealing with redundancy is ""horrible"", he says, adding: ""It is really not a nice time to be running a business."" Businesses largely welcomed the extension, with business group the British Chambers of Commerce saying the move would bring ""significant relief"" to employers and workers, And Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturing group Make UK, said it would avoid ""a looming cliff edge triggering significant redundancies for many companies and recognises the need for greater flexibility as the economy fires up."" However, he warned that there was no ""silver bullet"" and that both government and industry would have to be flexible. There was also support from the TUC, with general secretary Frances O'Grady saying the extension ""will be a big relief for millions"". But she added: ""As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job."" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies economic think tank, estimates the scheme will have cost nearly Â£100bn by October. It is thought that about 935,000 businesses signed up for the scheme in total. Reports of the demise of the furlough scheme have been somewhat exaggerated. It was never going to be scrapped, especially after the Bank of England stressed the scheme's importance for economic recovery. Over a quarter of all jobs - 27%, 7.5 million in total - are now paid for by the taxpayer, potentially for eight months. After that, the level of subsidy from taxpayer will be lowered, with employers expected to pay a contribution. By August, the scheme could start to look quite similar to longer standing wage subsidy schemes seen in continental Europe. The cost of the scheme to date is already over Â£10bn. This extension will be tens of billions more, but difficult to put a precise number on this given the lack of detail on the ""employer contribution"". Expensive yes. But what is also costly is letting unemployment sky rocket, as, without the extension, many businesses would have begun 45-day redundancy consultations this week. The question now is how many businesses still see this as a bridge to some sort of normality where furloughed staff can be phased back into their old jobs. Unfortunately some in industries which will not return to normal have already started to fire staff. This announcement buys most workers more time. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"This video can not be played No quick return to normality, says Bank of England chief The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is heading towards its sharpest recession on record. The coronavirus impact would see the economy shrink 14% this year, based on the lockdown being relaxed in June. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank to illustrate the economic impact said Covid-19 was ""dramatically reducing jobs and incomes in the UK"". Bank governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC there would be no quick return to normality. He described the downturn as ""unprecedented"", and said consumers would remain cautious even when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Mr Bailey said: ""Not all of the economic activity comes back. There's quite a sharp recovery. But we've also factored that people will be cautious of their own choice. ""They don't re-engage fully, and so it's really only until next summer that activity comes fully back."" Bailey: Coronavirus bounce back 'could be fast' EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workers' wages? UK-US trade talks will not be an easy ride Also on Thursday, policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. However, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on whether to inject more stimulus into the economy. Two of its nine members voted to increase the latest round of quantitative easing by Â£100bn to Â£300bn. The Bank's analysis, published on Thursday, was based on the assumption that social distancing measures are gradually phased out between June and September. Its latestMonetary Policy Report,externalshowed the UK economy plunging into its first recession in more than a decade. The economy shrinks by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, followed by an unprecedented 25% decline in the three months to June. This would push the UK into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. The Bank said the housing market had come to a standstill, while consumer spending had dropped by 30% in recent weeks. For the year as a whole, the economy is expected to contract by 14%. This would be the biggest annual decline on record, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data dating back to 1949. It would also be the sharpest annual contraction since 1706, according to reconstructed Bank of England data stretchingÂ back to the 18th Century. While UK growth is expected to rebound in 2021 to 15%, the size of the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-virus peak until the middle of next year. The UK government isexpected to start easing lockdown restrictions next week. The Bank stressed that the outlook for the economy was ""unusually uncertain"" at present and would depend on how households and businesses responded to the pandemic. It also assumes: The government's jobs retention scheme covering 80% of wages is phased out with the lockdown. Companies stop or scale back their operations for some time. Cautious consumers voluntarily maintain social distancing until mid-2021. Mr Bailey said he expected any permanent damage from the pandemic to be ""relatively small"". The economy was likely to recover ""much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis,"" he said. He also praised the action by the government to support workers and businesses through wage subsidies, loans and grants. He said the success of these schemes and the Bank's own stimulus meant there would be ""limited scarring to the economy"". ""The furloughing scheme really does enable people to come back into the economyÂ more quickly so it's a much quicker recoveryÂ that we've seen in the past."" James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the hit to the economy this year was equivalent to Â£9,000 for every family in Britain. He said: ""Faced with this huge economic hit, both the Bank and the government have made the right call in taking bold action to protect firms and families as much as possible."" Average weekly earnings are expected to shrink by 2% this year, reflectingÂ the fall in wages for furloughed workers. The Bank said sharp increases in benefit claims were ""consistent with a pronounced rise in the unemployment rate"", which is expected to climb above 9% this year, from the current rate of 4%. Under the Bank's scenario, inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) falls to zero at the start of next year amid the sharp drop in energy prices.It is also expected to remain well below the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. The Bank's latest Financial Stability Report said the Bank's scenario was consistent with a 16% drop in house prices. Latest figures published by UK finance show one in seven mortgage holders has taken a payment holiday due to the coronavirus. The Bank said the number of new mortgage deals on offer had halved in just over a month as banks focused on the deluge of payment holiday requests. This includes a huge contraction in deals for buyers with a deposit of less than 40% of the purchase price. The MPC also highlighted the stark drop in consumer spending. It said spending on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment had dropped to a fifth of their previous levels. Shopping at High Street retailers had dropped by 80%, while business confidence was described as ""severely depressed"". Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, described the Bank's scenario as ""optimistic"", particularly its assumption that unemployment would fall back to its pre-crisis low in two years. ""Exactly how the economy evolves will depend critically on how the government calibrates its policies and how they are unwound and tapered,"" he said. ""There is plenty that could go wrong."" The Bank of England itself has minimal staff, but they have applied themselves to try to work out what is happening in the economy. They are not sufficiently confident that the numbers they have run, the charts that they have published, constitute what they would call a ""forecast"". But they do give the clearest indication that we are in recession, after the sharpest, fastest economic contraction in the three-century history of the Bank looking at these things. Faster than the financial crisis, and the Great Depression, and the earlier 1920s depression just before, the only things which come close. ""It is unprecedented in the recent history of this institution,"" Governor Andrew Bailey told me. ""What it really means is that obviously the very sharp sort of downturn, a product of the situation we've been in since March, and the restrictions that are in place, affect economic activity very severely,"" A recession? ""Yes,"" he replied. Read Faisal's blog here. Islam: Bounce back could be fast, says Bank's Bailey EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workersâ wages?

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says the government was âtoo slowâ to protect people in care homes from coronavirus. Boris Johnson must account for official figures showing 10,000 ""unexplained"" deaths in care homes last month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Sir Keir said there were 18,000 more deaths in April than the average for that month, but only 8,000 were recorded as coronavirus-related. He said the government had been ""too slow to protect people in care homes"". Mr Johnson said there ""is much more to do but we are making progress"" on reducing the pandemic in care homes. And he announced a further Â£600m to fight infections in care homes in England. The money will be funnelled through local councils to help improve infection control by measures such as reducing staff rotation between homes, increasing testing and ensuring small independent homes have access to expert advice. Mr Johnson and Sir Keir also clashed at Prime Minister's Questions over government advice issued at the start of the pandemic. PM announces extra Â£600m for care homes in England Care home virus deaths 'starting to decline' Sir Keir said that up until 12 March care homes were being told it was ""very unlikely"" anyone would become infected. The prime minister said ""it wasn't true the advice said that"". Sir Keir wrote to the PM after the session, to accuse him of misleading MPs and asking him to return to the Commons to correct the record. But in a letter responding to Sir Keir, Mr Johnson said he stood by his comments and accused the Labour leader of ""selectively and misleadingly"" quoting guidance from Public Health England. The advice that was withdrawn in mid-March was based on the assumption at the time that the virus was not spreading widely in the community. In hindsight, that assumption was wrong and the fear that the virus had taken hold was part of the reason the government ordered the lockdown. At that point the advice was withdrawn. But the large death toll in care homes is also related to what happened after that point. Because we did not have a testing network or the right stocks of personal protective equipment care homes have undoubtedly suffered. The NHS became the major priority and even now not all staff or residents have been tested. The deaths being reported in care homes have also been a source of concern and confusion for a number of weeks. Sir Keir Starmer is right to say a large number of deaths are unaccounted for. There are a number of possible explanations for this. They could be coronavirus cases that have been under-reported - the lack of testing in care homes may mean doctors have missed the presence of the virus when they have filled in the death certificates. They could be ""indirect deaths"" related to the fact that residents have been unable to get care for other conditions, such as heart disease. Finally, some are likely to be people who in previous years would have been taken to hospital to die but were kept in care homes - the ONS data also shows that the number of non-coronavirus deaths in hospital have actually fallen. The guidance at the centre of the row,externalwas issued on 25 February and withdrawn on 13 March, a time when the virus was not thought to be spreading in the community. It said: ""This guidance is intended for the current position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of COVID-19 in the community. ""It is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected."" The guidance went on: ""There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present."" The prime minister's letter accused Sir Keir of ""neglecting"" to provide the context of the guidance. Mr Johnson said deaths in care homes were too high In his letter to Mr Johnson, the Labour leader said: ""At this time of national crisis it is more important than ever that government ministers are accurate in the information they give."" He added that: ""I expect you to come to the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the record."" In his letter to Sir Keir, Mr Johnson said he had sought engagement and consultation with opposition parties and added: ""The public expect us to work together."" At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said the government had brought in the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown but that there was ""unquestionably an appalling epidemic"" in that setting. He added that the number of deaths in care homes had been ""too high"", but that ""the number of outbreaks is down and the number of fatalities well down"". Sir Keir pointed to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed at least 40% of Covid-19 deaths in England and Wales occurred in care homes. And he quoted a cardiologist who had told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that hospitals had ""actively seeded"" the virus into the ""most vulnerable"" population by discharging ""known, suspected and unknown cases into care homes"". Mr Johnson said: ""The number of discharges from hospitals into care homes went down in March and April and we had a system of testing people going into care homes and that testing is now being ramped up.""

"Travel firm Tui is pressing for tourism to resume to countries where the coronavirus threat has abated. It plans to reopen some hotels in Germany ""in the coming days"". The company, which says it has 27 million customers, added operations in other European destinations were also ready to welcome holidaymakers. Tui has identified Austria, Greece and Cyprus as being more viable among European destinations because the virus there appears to be contained. It was forced to cancel the majority of its travel programme in March and on Wednesday warned that up to 8,000 jobs would go as it strives to cut costs by 30% in a major restructuring. TUI has cancelled all holidays until June and cruises until July. It would normally be running hundreds of flights a week at this time of year. Travel restrictions across Europe and further afield mean that the crucial summer season for many though is still in doubt, leaving millions of holidaymakers unsure of their plans. In the UK, the Foreign Office is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was unlikely that""big, lavish international holidays""were going to be possible this summer. A spokesman for Tui said countries were ""knocking at its door"", eager to see it reopen hotels and bring back tourists. Tui said it was trying hard to resume operations and had worked out a number of protocols to make its holidays safe. It has a 10-point plan of guidance on how to reopen safely, including limited buffet services, restrictions on some sports and games and longer opening times at restaurants. But the company said blanket travel restrictions were making resumption impossible. Spain, for example, is introducing a 14-day quarantine period for incomers - which covers the length of most package holidays. The issue of holiday travel is becoming politically sensitive as parts of Europe begin to either recover from or emerge as less affected by the first onslaught of the virus. The European Commission said on Wednesday a summer holiday season shouldn't be ruled out this year, contrasting with the UK health secretary's comment on the unlikelihood of a trip abroad this summer. Coronavirus: What are the new travel quarantine rules? Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said: ""The demand for holidays is still very high. People want to travel. ""Our integrated business model allows us to start travel activities as soon as this is possible again. The season starts later, but could last longer. ""For 2020, we will also reinvent the holiday: new destinations, changed travel seasons, new local offerings, more digitalisation."" Tui said it was ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures. ""The health and well-being of both customers and colleagues remain paramount and we are assessing how we can responsibly adapt to measures so that leisure travel can resume,"" the firm said. ""We are preparing new procedures for the airport process, on board our aircraft, in hotels and on our ships, so that any social distancing recommendations or guidelines can be implemented, without compromising customer enjoyment and travel experience."" Tui said its restructuring would affect its airline business and would also involve selling off ""non-profitable activities"". ""We are targeting to permanently reduce our overhead cost base by 30% across the entire group. This will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced,"" it said in a statement. Last month it told its UK workforce they would face a cut of up to 50% in hours worked, with a matching cut in basic pay. The firm said its turnover and earnings would be significantly lower in the current financial year, with cost savings only partly compensating for the slump. Tui, which has a global workforce of 70,000, was recently bolstered by a â¬1.8bn (Â£1.6bn) state-backed loan in Germany, where it has its headquarters.

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says the government was âtoo slowâ to protect people in care homes from coronavirus. Boris Johnson must account for official figures showing 10,000 ""unexplained"" deaths in care homes last month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Sir Keir said there were 18,000 more deaths in April than the average for that month, but only 8,000 were recorded as coronavirus-related. He said the government had been ""too slow to protect people in care homes"". Mr Johnson said there ""is much more to do but we are making progress"" on reducing the pandemic in care homes. And he announced a further Â£600m to fight infections in care homes in England. The money will be funnelled through local councils to help improve infection control by measures such as reducing staff rotation between homes, increasing testing and ensuring small independent homes have access to expert advice. Mr Johnson and Sir Keir also clashed at Prime Minister's Questions over government advice issued at the start of the pandemic. PM announces extra Â£600m for care homes in England Care home virus deaths 'starting to decline' Sir Keir said that up until 12 March care homes were being told it was ""very unlikely"" anyone would become infected. The prime minister said ""it wasn't true the advice said that"". Sir Keir wrote to the PM after the session, to accuse him of misleading MPs and asking him to return to the Commons to correct the record. But in a letter responding to Sir Keir, Mr Johnson said he stood by his comments and accused the Labour leader of ""selectively and misleadingly"" quoting guidance from Public Health England. The advice that was withdrawn in mid-March was based on the assumption at the time that the virus was not spreading widely in the community. In hindsight, that assumption was wrong and the fear that the virus had taken hold was part of the reason the government ordered the lockdown. At that point the advice was withdrawn. But the large death toll in care homes is also related to what happened after that point. Because we did not have a testing network or the right stocks of personal protective equipment care homes have undoubtedly suffered. The NHS became the major priority and even now not all staff or residents have been tested. The deaths being reported in care homes have also been a source of concern and confusion for a number of weeks. Sir Keir Starmer is right to say a large number of deaths are unaccounted for. There are a number of possible explanations for this. They could be coronavirus cases that have been under-reported - the lack of testing in care homes may mean doctors have missed the presence of the virus when they have filled in the death certificates. They could be ""indirect deaths"" related to the fact that residents have been unable to get care for other conditions, such as heart disease. Finally, some are likely to be people who in previous years would have been taken to hospital to die but were kept in care homes - the ONS data also shows that the number of non-coronavirus deaths in hospital have actually fallen.

"Travel firm Tui is pressing for tourism to resume to countries where the coronavirus threat has abated. It plans to reopen some hotels in Germany ""in the coming days"". The company, which says it has 27 million customers, added operations in other European destinations were also ready to welcome holidaymakers. Tui has identified Austria, Greece and Cyprus as being more viable among European destinations because the virus there appears to be contained. It was forced to cancel the majority of its travel programme in March and on Wednesday warned that up to 8,000 jobs would go as it strives to cut costs by 30% in a major restructuring. TUI has cancelled all holidays until June and cruises until July. It would normally be running hundreds of flights a week at this time of year. Travel restrictions across Europe and further afield mean that the crucial summer season for many though is still in doubt, leaving millions of holidaymakers unsure of their plans. In the UK, the Foreign Office is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was unlikely that""big, lavish international holidays""were going to be possible this summer. A spokesman for Tui said countries were ""knocking at its door"", eager to see it reopen hotels and bring back tourists. Tui said it was trying hard to resume operations and had worked out a number of protocols to make its holidays safe. It has a 10-point plan of guidance on how to reopen safely, including limited buffet services, restrictions on some sports and games and longer opening times at restaurants. But the company said blanket travel restrictions were making resumption impossible. Spain, for example, is introducing a 14-day quarantine period for incomers - which covers the length of most package holidays. The issue of holiday travel is becoming politically sensitive as parts of Europe begin to either recover from or emerge as less affected by the first onslaught of the virus. The European Commission said on Wednesday a summer holiday season shouldn't be ruled out this year, contrasting with the UK health secretary's comment on the unlikelihood of a trip abroad this summer. Coronavirus: What are the new travel quarantine rules? Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said: ""The demand for holidays is still very high. People want to travel. ""Our integrated business model allows us to start travel activities as soon as this is possible again. The season starts later, but could last longer. ""For 2020, we will also reinvent the holiday: new destinations, changed travel seasons, new local offerings, more digitalisation."" Tui said it was ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures. ""The health and well-being of both customers and colleagues remain paramount and we are assessing how we can responsibly adapt to measures so that leisure travel can resume,"" the firm said. ""We are preparing new procedures for the airport process, on board our aircraft, in hotels and on our ships, so that any social distancing recommendations or guidelines can be implemented, without compromising customer enjoyment and travel experience."" Tui said its restructuring would affect its airline business and would also involve selling off ""non-profitable activities"". ""We are targeting to permanently reduce our overhead cost base by 30% across the entire group. This will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced,"" it said in a statement. Last month it told its UK workforce they would face a cut of up to 50% in hours worked, with a matching cut in basic pay. The firm said its turnover and earnings would be significantly lower in the current financial year, with cost savings only partly compensating for the slump. Tui, which has a global workforce of 70,000, was recently bolstered by a â¬1.8bn (Â£1.6bn) state-backed loan in Germany, where it has its headquarters.

"Wanda Cooper-Jones (left), Ahmaud Arbery's mother, and his sister, Jasmine (right) The mother of Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed while out for a jog near his home in Georgia, believes ""there will be justice"". The 25-year-old was shot by a white father and son in an attack his family say was clearly racist. ""He was African-American, he was jogging in a predominantly white neighbourhood - he was targeted for the colour of his skin,"" says Wanda Cooper-Jones. Gregory and Travis McMichael were charged with murder last week. It was the first time any arrests had been made in the case, despite Ahmaud being killed on 23 February. The McMichaels admitted to killing Ahmaud in the initial police report,claiming they acted in self-defence. What we know about the case Ahmaud had dreams of being an electrician Given the time that had passed, the arrests surprised Wanda. ""In the very beginning, when it first occurred, I thought it was going to be covered up. Everything was working in that direction. If we didn't find the right resources to push the issue we wouldn't have an arrest today."" She adds: ""They visited a crime scene where there was a man dead. And all parties that were responsible were able to return home while my son was taken to the morgue."" The Glynn County Police Department says it has ""sought justice in this case from the beginning"". Ahmaud, from Brunswick in Georgia, was ""humble, happy and well-mannered"", according to his mum. ""He loved life. He was love. To know Ahmaud was to love Ahmaud."" He had dreams of being a ""very successful electrician, like his uncles are"". ""Ahmaud was young. He loved - so I'm quite sure he dreamed of having a wife and kids. ""All that was taken away."" Demonstrators have been able to go out on to the streets in support of the Arberys in the last week Wanda says it's been ""long, stressful and hopeless"" trying to get Ahmaud's name out there in the months since his death. Ordinarily with cases like this we would expect to see pictures of demonstrators out on the streets. But Ahmaud was killed as coronavirus began its spread and the lockdown started. ""I really was getting to a point where I never thought I would receive justice."" The family set up the #RunWithMaud Facebook page, which encouraged people to dedicate their workouts to the 25-year-old and share the hashtag. But it was a video of the shooting going viral that changed things. It was filmed from a vehicle following Ahmaud and shows him jogging towards a stationary truck ahead of him. He tries to bypass the truck and is seen struggling with a man carrying a shotgun. There is muffled shouting and three gunshots. Two days later the first arrests came. Memorials have been set up in Ahmaud's neighbourhood ""I haven't viewed the video, but I think it's good that it came out,"" says Wanda, who was ""really surprised"" by the arrests. Lawyer for the family Lee Merritt says ""we shouldn't have needed a video"" for an arrest to be made, adding that it's ""not something that should be for this kind of public consumption. I don't think it's helpful for the African-American community"". ""If nothing else, that video has angered, frightened, and stirred up emotions in a lot of different people... it obviously was a catalyst to get us to justice,"" he says. William Bryan, who filmed the video, is being investigated. In America, district attorneys are the people in charge of prosecuting people in different counties. Ahmaud's case is now on its fourth, which lawyer Lee says is unheard of. Two district attorneys removed themselves from the case due to professional connections to Gregory McMichael. The 64-year-old is a former police officer who also worked as an investigator for the local district attorney for years and had retired in 2019. Jackie Johnson and George Barnhill's handling of the investigation is now being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. And the federal government, which operates across the whole of the USA rather than just in individual states, is now involved too - with Donald Trump saying he is ""disturbed"" by the case. ""We are assessing all of the evidence to determine whether federal hate crime charges are appropriate,"" Department of Justice (DOJ) spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, adding that the FBI is also involved. Georgia, where Ahmaud was killed, is one of four states in America with no hate crime statutes, but the federal government can file those charges. Travis McMichael (left) and Gregory McMichael were detained on 7 May Lee Merritt says the response Ahmaud's case has received is ""extremely rare"". ""I represent a lot of victims of high-profile police shootings - and Gregory McMichael is a police officer. ""I always ask for a special prosecutor and almost never get one. I almost always ask for a DOJ investigation and almost never get one. And to have the people who failed to act, to have them being investigated? Almost never happens."" He says that things in South Georgia and all over the country ""are very tense"" due to coronavirus. ""There has been an increase in police violence, particularly against African Americans, as they tried to enforce social distancing. I think this was a bridge too far and the powers that be understand they have to respond accordingly."" Last week, 8 May, would have been Ahmaud's 26th birthday. On the day Wanda received a phone call from Oprah Winfrey, something she says ""really meant a lot"". ""Ahmaud's gone, but people are actually supporting us nationally - so that makes me feel good.""

Countries around the world are taking steps to ease the restrictions Here's a final round-up of some of the day's main developments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington The pandemic has had an impact on the initiation rites of the Amish, a group of about 340,000 fundamentalist Christians who belong to a church that is known as Old Order. The Amish are known for their plain dress, their aversion to technology and for the horse-drawn buggies they ride in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in other towns in states across the US. In the Amish world, young people in their teens begin to move from the domestic realm and their families to the sphere outside of the home by spending time on the weekends with people their age. They go to parties, gatherings that are part of a tradition known as ""rumspringa"", which translates roughly as ""running around"". At some point the young people decide whether to join the church in a formal manner. If so, they are baptized and become adult members of the Amish community. With the advent of social distancing, the young people have cut back on their outings, however, and slowed down the rites of rumspringa. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Public Health England (PHE) says an antibody test for coronavirus has been evaluated and is a ""very positive development"". The product made by the drug company Roche was assessed by PHE at its Porton Down laboratories last week. Sources say it is the first such test to offer serious potential. Such a test looks for antibodies in the bloodstream to see whether an individual has in the past had the virus and has gained immunity. It is understood talks are now underway between Roche and the Department of Health over possible supply to the NHS. Previous antibody tests have proved unreliable according to health officials. Some are still being assessed. This video can not be played Venezuelans struggling with fuel shortage Venezuela is already a country in crisis and doctors fear an increase in the spread of coronavirus would be catastrophic. The South American nation has seen the price of food increase by 80% and a shortage of fuel since the lockdown. Teacher Sonia Pantes says sometimes she does not eat so her young daughter can. Rafael Barrios Armas, a surgeon who treats cancer patients, says he has queued overnight for fuel, sometimes for almost 13 hours, and still not been able to fill up his car. Lin-Manuel Miranda created the hit Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical Hamilton, has been recruited to join an organisation tasked with figuring out how to revive New York City's tourist trade. The Coalition for NYC Hospitality and Tourism Recovery has been established by NYC & Company, New York City's marketing organization and convention and visitors bureau, to figure out a plan to get tourists to come to the city when it eventually reopens. Miranda is known for creating hits like Hamilton and In The Heights, both set in New York, as well as writing the music for Disney's Moana. ""Together, we will create a next act for our city,"" he said. ""After this intermission, we will be ready to welcome the world back with open arms, so people can fall in love with New York over and over again."" Update 20 May: This post has been updated to clarify that the coalition was formed by NYC & Company Countries around the world are starting to ease the restrictions imposed because of the virus More now on the warnings from the World Health Organization emergencies expert Mike Ryan, who said Covid-19 ""may never go away"" - we had more on that a bit earlier. While much of the world hopes the worst of the virus has passed, Ryan said the global community needed to brace itself for a long battle. ""I think it's important we're realistic and I don't think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear,"" he said. ""I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be."" If a vaccine is found, implementing globally would require a ""massive effort"", he added. As many countries start easing lockdown measures, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The trajectory is in our hands, and itâs everybody's business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic."" For many firms, coronavirus has been one of the toughest problems they have ever faced. But, stuck at home, thousands of young people have been encouraged to started their own businesses during lockdown.

BBC Panorama has been filming the distressing story of one funeral director in England who has taken extraordinary measures to provide storage for hundreds of bodies. Dean Floyd, of Floyd & Son in Essex, has bought refrigerated containers and converted most of his premises to take care of the dead. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa is starting to ease its lockdown South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases in Africa (11,350), and one of the world's strictest lockdowns. It is starting to ease restrictions, but some of the new rules are being queried -  particularly those around what clothes shops can and cannot sell. The new regulations are impressively detailed: shoes may now be sold - but not if they are opened toed. T-shirts are okay - but only if advertised and sold as undergarments. The same goes for sleeveless knitted topsâ¦ and so on. There is a logic to all this. Winter is coming here - hence the green light for the sale of winter clothes. But Dean MacPherson from the opposition Democratic Alliance is unimpressed. He called the regulations ""quite frankly ridiculous and mad. More likely the sort of rules found in the Soviet Union and East Germany"". The crisis has exposed deep rifts in government - between ministers more inclined to authoritarian solutions, including an ongoing ban on all alcohol and cigarette sales, and those who now believe South Africans should be trusted with more individual freedoms - including the right to buy sandals and exposed knitwear.

In the House of Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against ""scaremongering"" over safety, although his department's chief scientific adviser cast doubt on suggestions the virus spreads less among children. ""Sometimes scaremongering, making people fear, is really unfair and not a welcome pressure to be placed on families, children and teachers alike,"" Williamson told MPs. Santiago has experienced a worrying spike in new infections The Chilean government is to impose a total lockdown across the capital, Santiago, following a spike in the number of coronavirus infections. A total of 2,260 new infections and 12 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The current death toll is about 350. The new restrictions will affect eight million people and come into effect on Friday evening. Chile had limited lockdown measures to areas with higher rates of infection. The authorities were considering partially reopening the economy, but the country has now reported a 60% rise in the number of daily cases. A few minutes ago we told you about the World Health Organization's warning that Covid-19 ""may never go away"".

On 12 May every year, hundreds of thousands flock to attend mass at the famed shrine to mark the anniversary of reported sightings of the Virgin Mary by three children in 1917. But due to the coronavirus, ceremonies have been livestreamed this year. The bishop of FÃ¡tima called for solidarity to combat ""the virus"" of indifference and individualism that he said could only be defeated ""with the antibodies of compassion and solidarity"". Lockdown measures have been loosened in France The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Covid-19 may be here to stay. ""This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away,"" Michael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, told a virtual press conference in Geneva. ""HIV has not gone away - but we have come to terms with the virus."" He said that, without a vaccine, it could take years for the population to build up sufficient levels of immunity to the virus. There are many attempts being carried out around the world to develop a vaccine but experts say there is a risk that one may never be created. Meanwhile, as countries across the globe start easing lockdown measures, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the process could trigger new waves of infections. Ryan said there was lots of ""magical thinking"" surrounding countries opening back up. He added that there was a ""long, long way to go"" on the path to returning to normal. Countries are hoping that technology will be an ally in curbing the spread of the virus Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing appwill trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19. That puts it at odds with the NHS app in the UK, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire. UK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a ""centralised"" design despite privacy campaigners' protests, although Germany ditched that model in April. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a ""much higher level of acceptance"" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity. Â© 2025 BBC.

Countries around the world are taking steps to ease the restrictions Here's a final round-up of some of the day's main developments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington The pandemic has had an impact on the initiation rites of the Amish, a group of about 340,000 fundamentalist Christians who belong to a church that is known as Old Order. The Amish are known for their plain dress, their aversion to technology and for the horse-drawn buggies they ride in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in other towns in states across the US. In the Amish world, young people in their teens begin to move from the domestic realm and their families to the sphere outside of the home by spending time on the weekends with people their age. They go to parties, gatherings that are part of a tradition known as ""rumspringa"", which translates roughly as ""running around"". At some point the young people decide whether to join the church in a formal manner. If so, they are baptized and become adult members of the Amish community. With the advent of social distancing, the young people have cut back on their outings, however, and slowed down the rites of rumspringa. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Public Health England (PHE) says an antibody test for coronavirus has been evaluated and is a ""very positive development"". The product made by the drug company Roche was assessed by PHE at its Porton Down laboratories last week. Sources say it is the first such test to offer serious potential. Such a test looks for antibodies in the bloodstream to see whether an individual has in the past had the virus and has gained immunity. It is understood talks are now underway between Roche and the Department of Health over possible supply to the NHS. Previous antibody tests have proved unreliable according to health officials. Some are still being assessed. This video can not be played Venezuelans struggling with fuel shortage Venezuela is already a country in crisis and doctors fear an increase in the spread of coronavirus would be catastrophic. The South American nation has seen the price of food increase by 80% and a shortage of fuel since the lockdown. Teacher Sonia Pantes says sometimes she does not eat so her young daughter can. Rafael Barrios Armas, a surgeon who treats cancer patients, says he has queued overnight for fuel, sometimes for almost 13 hours, and still not been able to fill up his car. Lin-Manuel Miranda created the hit Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical Hamilton, has been recruited to join an organisation tasked with figuring out how to revive New York City's tourist trade. The Coalition for NYC Hospitality and Tourism Recovery has been established by NYC & Company, New York City's marketing organization and convention and visitors bureau, to figure out a plan to get tourists to come to the city when it eventually reopens. Miranda is known for creating hits like Hamilton and In The Heights, both set in New York, as well as writing the music for Disney's Moana. ""Together, we will create a next act for our city,"" he said. ""After this intermission, we will be ready to welcome the world back with open arms, so people can fall in love with New York over and over again."" Update 20 May: This post has been updated to clarify that the coalition was formed by NYC & Company Countries around the world are starting to ease the restrictions imposed because of the virus More now on the warnings from the World Health Organization emergencies expert Mike Ryan, who said Covid-19 ""may never go away"" - we had more on that a bit earlier. While much of the world hopes the worst of the virus has passed, Ryan said the global community needed to brace itself for a long battle. ""I think it's important we're realistic and I don't think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear,"" he said. ""I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be."" If a vaccine is found, implementing globally would require a ""massive effort"", he added. As many countries start easing lockdown measures, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The trajectory is in our hands, and itâs everybody's business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic."" For many firms, coronavirus has been one of the toughest problems they have ever faced. But, stuck at home, thousands of young people have been encouraged to started their own businesses during lockdown.

There have been similar reports of generous tipping - sometimes extremely generous - across the US, as states start to reopen. In Austin, Texas, one restaurant reopened on 30 April - and founda customer left $1,300 to staff,externalas a ""welcome back"" tip.

BBC Panorama has been filming the distressing story of one funeral director in England who has taken extraordinary measures to provide storage for hundreds of bodies. Dean Floyd, of Floyd & Son in Essex, has bought refrigerated containers and converted most of his premises to take care of the dead. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa is starting to ease its lockdown South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases in Africa (11,350), and one of the world's strictest lockdowns. It is starting to ease restrictions, but some of the new rules are being queried -  particularly those around what clothes shops can and cannot sell. The new regulations are impressively detailed: shoes may now be sold - but not if they are opened toed. T-shirts are okay - but only if advertised and sold as undergarments. The same goes for sleeveless knitted topsâ¦ and so on. There is a logic to all this. Winter is coming here - hence the green light for the sale of winter clothes. But Dean MacPherson from the opposition Democratic Alliance is unimpressed. He called the regulations ""quite frankly ridiculous and mad. More likely the sort of rules found in the Soviet Union and East Germany"". The crisis has exposed deep rifts in government - between ministers more inclined to authoritarian solutions, including an ongoing ban on all alcohol and cigarette sales, and those who now believe South Africans should be trusted with more individual freedoms - including the right to buy sandals and exposed knitwear. Buzzfeed set up a London office in 2013 Online media giantBuzzfeed is to close its UK and Australian news operations. The US company, which set up its London office in 2013, said the decision had been made ""both for economic and strategic reasons"". The move comes as the media industry is facing an advertising downturn caused by the pandemic. Buzzfeed said it would be focusing on news that ""hits big in the United States during this difficult period"". In the UK, some staff will stay on to cover social news, celebrity and investigations for US readers, but it is thought about 10 jobs are affected. BBC News media editor Amol Rajan said the affected UK staff had been furloughed. Some pupils may return to school on 1 June Plans to reopen primary schools in England do not have adequate safety measures and need to be halted,warns an alliance of school teachers' unions. A joint education union statement called on the government to ""step back"" from a 1 June start date and said ""classrooms of four and five-year olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread"". In the House of Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against ""scaremongering"" over safety, although his department's chief scientific adviser cast doubt on suggestions the virus spreads less among children. ""Sometimes scaremongering, making people fear, is really unfair and not a welcome pressure to be placed on families, children and teachers alike,"" Williamson told MPs. Santiago has experienced a worrying spike in new infections The Chilean government is to impose a total lockdown across the capital, Santiago, following a spike in the number of coronavirus infections. A total of 2,260 new infections and 12 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The current death toll is about 350. The new restrictions will affect eight million people and come into effect on Friday evening. Chile had limited lockdown measures to areas with higher rates of infection. The authorities were considering partially reopening the economy, but the country has now reported a 60% rise in the number of daily cases. A few minutes ago we told you about the World Health Organization's warning that Covid-19 ""may never go away"".

Thanks for following along today. You can find the live feeds of parliament at the top of this page. But please do join us again later for our coverage of today's daily briefing at Downing Street. You'll find us over here on the main coronavirus page. Sir Keir Starmer's letter to PM Boris Johnson As we reported earlier in our coverage of PMQs, Sir Keir Starmer has accused the PM of misleading MPs over advice to care homes at the start of the coronavirus pandemic on controlling infections. Sir Keir has written to the PM to ask him to return to the Commons to correct the record. Downing Street said Sir Keir Starmer had ""inaccurately and selectively"" quoted from guidance for care homes. Read more here House of CommonsParliament Shadow Commons leader
Valerie Vaz says she ""was alarmed"" to hearJacob Rees-Mogg say
yesterdaythat Parliament will return physically in the next few weeks. She says the House must ""lead the way"" by following public health advice ""to the letter"" and maintain social distancing. ""We are continuing to work - we may not be in the chamber but we
still are dealing with constituents,"" she says. ""What the leader has done is further confuse the message... itâs like a comms hokey cokey."" Mr Rees-Mogg says the government advice is ""quite clear - work from home if you can"" and some House staff will continue to do so. But, he says, holding the government to account is essential, as is other Commons' business. He questions whether they should stay at home while the government is urging schools to return. ""We are the leaders of our nation and we have a
responsibility,"" he says. ""We can observe social distancing. ""We, in reality, cannot [work from home] that is why we ought
to be coming back."" House of CommonsParliament Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has been making a statement to MPs following the publication of government guidance whicheases restrictions on estate agents in England. Mr Jenrick said: ""We want to be clear, each of the building blocks of the buying and the selling process are now back in business, as long as they can be done safely."" He added: ""This was not an easy decision to make. With few if any transactions there is no visibility and no precedent with which to accurately judge the state of the housing market. ""But I do know that in every economic recovery in modern British history the housing market has been key. ""So let me be clear to all who work in the sector, have started a business in it, have invested in it, or rely upon it, I'm doing everything I can to help the industry bounce back."" Reality Check When questioned at PMQs by Labour leader Sir Keir
Starmer about the transparency of the governmentâs scientific advice, Prime
Minister Boris Johnson said âall Sage advice is published in due courseâ. Sage is short for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. Some of the scientific evidence presented to Sageâs
57-person panel of experts has been published, the vast majority of it has not. Only 27 of the 120 pieces of evidence reviewed by Sage over the course of more than 20 meetings up to mid-April have been published,
and one of the documents released was heavily redacted. The government has released the names of the
unpublished documents â some of which date back as far back as early February - and examine topics as varied as âComparing interventions in Italy and UKâ and
âDoes the use of face masks in the general population make a difference to
spread of infection?â Sage leads the UK governmentâs scientific
response to the coronavirus pandemic and other health emergencies. Its
members include the Chief Medical Officer for England Professor Chris Whitty
and the Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance are members of Sage Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused the prime
minister of making inaccurate comments about government guidance on care homes
and asked him to âcorrect the recordâ in the House of Commons. Sir Keir has written to Boris Johnson regarding an exchange
at Prime Ministerâs Questions this afternoon in which Mr Johnson said âit
wasnât trueâ that advice had said it was unlikely that people in care homes
would become infected . In his letter the Labour leader says âat this time of
national crisis it is more important than ever that government ministers are
accurate in the information they giveâ adding that âI expect you to come to the
House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the recordâ. The government guidance referred to by the Labour leader, which was withdrawn on 13 March,can be found here.,external House of CommonsParliament Earlier, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said all teachers and school pupils will be able to be tested for Covid-19 if they develop symptoms when they return to school. Mr Williamson said new guidance for schools in England which was published on Monday will them ""begin to prepare"" to reopen. He added: ""This guidance sets out protective measures to minimise the risk of infection, including restricting class sizes and limiting mixing between groups. ""Crucially all children and staff will have access to testing if they develop symptoms of coronavirus. ""This will enable a track-and-trace approach to be taken to any confirmed cases."" Reality Check Earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson talked about testing for coronavirus. He said: âWe will go up to 200,000 by
the end of the month.â There has been considerable
confusion about this target, which was first announced as an
""ambition"" on 6 May. The prime minister sounds like he is promising
200,000 tests will be carried out per day, but the Department for Health and
Social Care (DHSC) says that the target is actually for testing capacity, which
is the number of tests that theoretically could be carried out per day. Statistical regulator the UK Statistics Authorityhas written
to Health Secretary Matt Hancock,externalto ask for clarification of whether
that target is for testing capacity, the number of tests administered, the
number of tests completed, or the number of people tested. This followed controversy after
the government announced it had met its 100,000 tests per day target on 30
April, when it turned out that 40,000 of the tests had been sent out but not
necessarily carried out on the day. House of CommonsParliament Shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey says guidance for schools does not provide ""clear assurances over safety that are needed"" - and says teaching staff are ""in fear"" of returning. She says instead of putting dates on when schools should reopen, ministers should instead set safety conditions to be met first. Gavin Williamson says the government is planning for a ""phased, sensible and controlled return"". He adds the government has given schools ""as much forward notice as possible in order for them to get ready"". With PMQs finished, MPs have been putting questions to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson about plans to reopen English schools. Conservative MP Robert Halfon - who chairs the Commons Education Committee - asks whether graduates, volunteers, and retired teachers could staff summer schools for vulnerable children - noting that ""close to 90%"" are currently not in education. Mr Williamson says the government is looking ""very closely"" at how the enthusiasm of those who want to help out can be harnessed. Reality Check The prime
minister was asked about a chart comparing coronavirus deaths in the UK with
those in other countries. He repeated his
assertion that it is too early to make such comparisons, although Labour leader
Sir Keir Starmer pointed out that the chart had been used in daily government
briefings for the past seven weeks. Many statisticians have said that
making precise comparisons between countries will not be possible until we have
figures for excess deaths for all the relevant countries. But Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter,
who both the prime minister and Labour leader have referred to in Prime
Ministerâs Questions, said it was still possible to identify
âthe bad countries in Europe: UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Italyâ, and said:
âClearly itâs important to note that group is way above in terms of their
mortality, a group like Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, who have
low fatality rates."" You can read more about the challenges of international
comparisonshere. House of CommonsParliament And that concludes today's PMQs. The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson now begins his reply to an urgent question on reopening schools. Conservative Peter Bone attacks the Electoral Commission for investigating those involved in the Vote Leave campaign and notes that the police have now said they were ""totally innocent"". ""For the sake of democracy will you ensure that that politically corrupt, totally biased and morally bankrupt quango is abolished,"" he asks. The PM replies that he hopes ""all those who spent so much time and energy drawing attention to their supposed guilt... will spend as much ink and drawing attention to their genuine innocence"". House of CommonsParliament Labour's John Spellar accuses the government of ""washing its hands"" of people with indefinite leave to remain in the UK - noting that ""many"" are still stranded abroad. Boris Johnson does not engage with the specific accusation, but says 1.3 million Britons have returned since Foreign Office advice changed. He says the government has aided this effort by providing Â£75m towards the cost of special charter flights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Wanda Cooper-Jones (left), Ahmaud Arbery's mother, and his sister, Jasmine (right) The mother of Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed while out for a jog near his home in Georgia, believes ""there will be justice"". The 25-year-old was shot by a white father and son in an attack his family say was clearly racist. ""He was African-American, he was jogging in a predominantly white neighbourhood - he was targeted for the colour of his skin,"" says Wanda Cooper-Jones. Gregory and Travis McMichael were charged with murder last week. It was the first time any arrests had been made in the case, despite Ahmaud being killed on 23 February. The McMichaels admitted to killing Ahmaud in the initial police report,claiming they acted in self-defence. What we know about the case Ahmaud had dreams of being an electrician Given the time that had passed, the arrests surprised Wanda. ""In the very beginning, when it first occurred, I thought it was going to be covered up. Everything was working in that direction. If we didn't find the right resources to push the issue we wouldn't have an arrest today."" She adds: ""They visited a crime scene where there was a man dead. And all parties that were responsible were able to return home while my son was taken to the morgue."" The Glynn County Police Department says it has ""sought justice in this case from the beginning"". Ahmaud, from Brunswick in Georgia, was ""humble, happy and well-mannered"", according to his mum. ""He loved life. He was love. To know Ahmaud was to love Ahmaud."" He had dreams of being a ""very successful electrician, like his uncles are"". ""Ahmaud was young. He loved - so I'm quite sure he dreamed of having a wife and kids. ""All that was taken away."" Demonstrators have been able to go out on to the streets in support of the Arberys in the last week Wanda says it's been ""long, stressful and hopeless"" trying to get Ahmaud's name out there in the months since his death. Ordinarily with cases like this we would expect to see pictures of demonstrators out on the streets. But Ahmaud was killed as coronavirus began its spread and the lockdown started. ""I really was getting to a point where I never thought I would receive justice."" The family set up the #RunWithMaud Facebook page, which encouraged people to dedicate their workouts to the 25-year-old and share the hashtag. But it was a video of the shooting going viral that changed things. It was filmed from a vehicle following Ahmaud and shows him jogging towards a stationary truck ahead of him. He tries to bypass the truck and is seen struggling with a man carrying a shotgun. There is muffled shouting and three gunshots. Two days later the first arrests came. Memorials have been set up in Ahmaud's neighbourhood ""I haven't viewed the video, but I think it's good that it came out,"" says Wanda, who was ""really surprised"" by the arrests. Lawyer for the family Lee Merritt says ""we shouldn't have needed a video"" for an arrest to be made, adding that it's ""not something that should be for this kind of public consumption. I don't think it's helpful for the African-American community"". ""If nothing else, that video has angered, frightened, and stirred up emotions in a lot of different people... it obviously was a catalyst to get us to justice,"" he says. William Bryan, who filmed the video, is being investigated. In America, district attorneys are the people in charge of prosecuting people in different counties. Ahmaud's case is now on its fourth, which lawyer Lee says is unheard of. Two district attorneys removed themselves from the case due to professional connections to Gregory McMichael. The 64-year-old is a former police officer who also worked as an investigator for the local district attorney for years and had retired in 2019. Jackie Johnson and George Barnhill's handling of the investigation is now being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. And the federal government, which operates across the whole of the USA rather than just in individual states, is now involved too - with Donald Trump saying he is ""disturbed"" by the case. ""We are assessing all of the evidence to determine whether federal hate crime charges are appropriate,"" Department of Justice (DOJ) spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, adding that the FBI is also involved. Georgia, where Ahmaud was killed, is one of four states in America with no hate crime statutes, but the federal government can file those charges. Travis McMichael (left) and Gregory McMichael were detained on 7 May Lee Merritt says the response Ahmaud's case has received is ""extremely rare"". ""I represent a lot of victims of high-profile police shootings - and Gregory McMichael is a police officer. ""I always ask for a special prosecutor and almost never get one. I almost always ask for a DOJ investigation and almost never get one. And to have the people who failed to act, to have them being investigated? Almost never happens."" He says that things in South Georgia and all over the country ""are very tense"" due to coronavirus. ""There has been an increase in police violence, particularly against African Americans, as they tried to enforce social distancing. I think this was a bridge too far and the powers that be understand they have to respond accordingly."" Last week, 8 May, would have been Ahmaud's 26th birthday. On the day Wanda received a phone call from Oprah Winfrey, something she says ""really meant a lot"". ""Ahmaud's gone, but people are actually supporting us nationally - so that makes me feel good.""

"Rihanna is now the richest woman in music Rihanna has made her debut appearance on The Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated fortune of Â£468 million. The Bajan pop star, who now resides in London, overtakes Sirs Elton John and Mick Jagger to claim third place on the list of Britain's richest musicians. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney are joint firston the list,external, with fortunes of Â£800m apiece. Rihanna's earnings are largely due to the Fenty Beauty cosmetics brand, where her reported 15% stake is worth Â£351m. ""She somewhat caught us by surprise,"" says Robert Watts, who compiles The Sunday Times' annual list. ""Very few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer. Now she's well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK,"" he tells the BBC. Rihanna, who turned 32 in February, is a youthful exception amongst Britain's richest musicians, most of whom found fame in the 1960s and 70s. Amongst the top 40 highest-earners, only Ed Sheeran and Adele are younger, with fortunes of Â£200m and Â£150m respectively. Further down the list, there are new entries for the next generation of pop stars, with Dua Lipa, 24, and George Ezra, 26, each said to be worth Â£16m. Theatre impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber, 72, is the only star on the list to see his valuation fall, with Watts calculating that the Covid-19 shutdown of theatres in the West End and Broadway has already wiped Â£20m off his fortune. Sir Paul, by contrast, receives a Â£50m boost to his finances, thanks to a lucrative world tour and his first children's book Hey Grandude!, which topped the New York Times' best-seller list last year. Sir Elton's farewell tour also added Â£40m to his fortune, putting him in fourth place; while Rolling Stone Sir Mick comes fifth with Â£285m. Ed Sheeran topped the young musicians (aged 30 or under) list, adding Â£40m to his overall wealth after completing a 255-date world tour last August. Harry Styles took second place, with a fortune of Â£63m. All five members of One Direction appear on the list, with Harry Styles just above his bandmate Niall Horan Eagle-eyed readers might spot that U2 have dropped off the Sunday Times' rankings entirely, despite taking third place last year with earnings of Â£583m. Their absence is solely due to coronavirus - as the pandemic has delayed the publication of the paper's Irish Rich List. When those figures are revealed later this year, the band is likely to knock Rihanna down to fourth place. Nonetheless, Watts says that Rihanna's presence is indicative of a ""seismic change"" in the make-up of the main Rich List which, since 1989, had been identifying the 1,000 wealthiest individuals or families living in the UK. ""The days when it was dominated by inherited wealth, the landed gentry and mass of largely white, middle-aged and elderly men, are changing,"" says Watts. ""For example, we've seen a big rise in the number of Asian entrepreneurs and in the number of self-made people. ""Rihanna is, I think, a very good example of someone who's come from a pretty tough upbringing in Barbados and who has a hunger and a determination to work, work work... which, I think, is one of her songs, isn't it?"" (It is,external). Rihanna's earnings from beauty and fashion eclipse those from her music career Although Rihanna made her name in music, she hasn't released an album since 2016's Anti, instead concentrating on her fashion empire. Fenty Beauty launched in September 2017, and was designed to cater to a wider range of skin types and tones than typical cosmetic brands. Thanks to the star's endorsement, and her 82 million Instagram followers, it was an immediate success, racking up sales of Â£78m in its first few weeks. The company is now valued at $3bn (Â£2.4bn). Rihanna also has a lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, and continues to receive royalties from hit songs like SOS, Umbrella and Only Girl In The World. Her Â£468m fortune makes her the richest female musician not just in the UK, but the world - ahead of Madonna (Â£462m), Celine Dion (Â£365m) and BeyoncÃ© (Â£325m). Watts notes that musicians' wealth ""held up better than many other ultra-high net worth individuals"" over the last 12 months, but says the impact of cancelled tours could impact next year's list. ""Their fortunes have held up a little better this year because they're coming off the back of big tours and their valuation is not affected by a plunging stock market,"" he says. ""But next year I would expect, for a lot of these musicians, their wealth to flatline - and some of them may even have to dip into their reserves.""

"The first minister has indicated there could be some easing of lockdown measures in Scotland from 28 May. More detail on the plan is expected to be published later this week, which is likely to allow some outdoor work and activities such as golf. Ms Sturgeon has given an indication of what might happen in Scotland in her""looking beyond lockdown"",externaldocument. The UK government has issued its""our plan to rebuild"",externalstrategy. How do the rules in Scotland differ from the UK's other nations - and how similar will they be after the end of the month? In England, people who cannot work from home are now ""actively encouraged to go to work"", with construction and manufacturing being explicitly mentioned by the prime minister. They should still avoid public transport if possible because of social distancing and employers should make workplaces ""Covid-secure"" - for instance by staggering shifts, rethinking shared equipment and planning safe walking routes. On Monday 18 May, Northern Ireland introduced ""step one"" of the loosening of restrictions, which also encouraged those unable to work from home to go back to work on a phased basis. However in Scotland, the government says businesses should only open if what they do is essential to the effort of tackling the virus or the wellbeing of society. Tradespeople such as plumbers can carry out maintenance and essential repairs if they are not showing symptoms but no work should be carried out in a household that is self-isolating. The Scottish government is looking at how some outdoor work may be able to resume safely after 28 May. People in England are now advised to wear face coverings on public transport or in shops - advice that wasfirst issued in Scotland almost a fortnight earlier. In England, thenew social distancing guidelines,externalmean that people can take ""unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise"" and generally spend more time outdoors for leisure purposes. Sports such as basketball, tennis and fishing are allowed  - as long as they involve members of the same household. Golf courses and bowling greens can be used alone or with household members - or with one non-household member if social distancing is maintained. People are also free to sit in parks, and to ""play sports"" with people from the same household. Driving to a beach or park is also permitted - but people are being told not travel to other parts of the UK where different rules apply. Social distancing rules - keeping at least 2m apart from non-household members - must still be adhered to. In Northern Ireland, phase one of its lockdown easing sees outdoor spaces and public sports amenities reopen. Water sports, golf and tennis as well as angling are permitted. Golf is now also allowed in Wales, which made the change to bring it into line with England. Wales also made other ""modest"" changes, allowing people to exercise outside more than once a day, and reopening some garden centres. In Scotland, people are now allowed to go outside more than once a day to exercise - but this should continue to take place close to home, either alone or with members of their household. The change does not allow people to mix with other households or relax outdoors, for instance by sunbathing in a park. The key message remains that people should stay at home. But the first minister has indicated that, after 28 May, people will be allowed some outdoor activities such as sitting in a park. Some sports, such as golf, tennis and fishing, could also be set to resume. The new guidelines for England say that two people from different households can now meet in outdoor settings such as parks as long as they stay more than 2m apart. New rules in Northern Ireland allow groups of up to six people who do not share a household to meet up outdoors while maintaining social distancing. However, NI ministers did not reach agreement to allow visits to immediate family indoors yet, despite it being part of the first step of the recovery plan. In Scotland the advice remains that members of different households should not be meeting up. The measures being considered for introduction after 28 May are likely to include allowing people to meet others from outside their own household in an outdoor setting - but still keeping 2m apart. While food stores and other ""essential outlets"" have remained open, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the ""phased reopening"" of other shops may begin at the start of June at the earliest. This will only happen where social distancing rules can be followed. Garden centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have already reopened and Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland is likely to go down the same route at the end of May. No date has yet been suggested for the reopening of non-essential retail outlets in Scotland. Waste recycling facilities are also likely to open in Scotland, as they have in the other three nations. Primary schools in England may be able to reopen ""in stages"" from 1 June at the earliest, according to Boris Johnson. He says it is also an ""ambition"" to give secondary pupils doing exams next year some time with their teachers before the summer holidays. Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford said the ""ambition"" was to get some children ""back into school before the summer break"". In Northern Ireland, ministers had already ruled out a return of schools before the summer and a phased return is planned for September, to tie in with the start of a new educational year. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has saidshe does not expect schools to reopen as early as 1 June. The Scottish government has also talked about a phased reopening, with priority given to primary pupils transitioning to secondary and those starting national qualification courses in S3 to S6. However, Ms Sturgeon has previously warned it is possible there will be no return to school before the summer holidays. In Scotland, these start in late June or early July, a little earlier than in England. At Monday's briefing, the first minister said she hoped it would be possible to give more information shortly on a likely timetable towards reopening schools. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

You'll find us over here on the main coronavirus page. Sir Keir Starmer's letter to PM Boris Johnson As we reported earlier in our coverage of PMQs, Sir Keir Starmer has accused the PM of misleading MPs over advice to care homes at the start of the coronavirus pandemic on controlling infections. Sir Keir has written to the PM to ask him to return to the Commons to correct the record. Downing Street said Sir Keir Starmer had ""inaccurately and selectively"" quoted from guidance for care homes. Read more here House of CommonsParliament Shadow Commons leader
Valerie Vaz says she ""was alarmed"" to hearJacob Rees-Mogg say
yesterdaythat Parliament will return physically in the next few weeks. She says the House must ""lead the way"" by following public health advice ""to the letter"" and maintain social distancing. ""We are continuing to work - we may not be in the chamber but we
still are dealing with constituents,"" she says. ""What the leader has done is further confuse the message... itâs like a comms hokey cokey."" Mr Rees-Mogg says the government advice is ""quite clear - work from home if you can"" and some House staff will continue to do so. But, he says, holding the government to account is essential, as is other Commons' business. He questions whether they should stay at home while the government is urging schools to return. ""We are the leaders of our nation and we have a
responsibility,"" he says. ""We can observe social distancing. ""We, in reality, cannot [work from home] that is why we ought
to be coming back."" House of CommonsParliament Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has been making a statement to MPs following the publication of government guidance whicheases restrictions on estate agents in England. Mr Jenrick said: ""We want to be clear, each of the building blocks of the buying and the selling process are now back in business, as long as they can be done safely."" He added: ""This was not an easy decision to make. With few if any transactions there is no visibility and no precedent with which to accurately judge the state of the housing market. ""But I do know that in every economic recovery in modern British history the housing market has been key. ""So let me be clear to all who work in the sector, have started a business in it, have invested in it, or rely upon it, I'm doing everything I can to help the industry bounce back."" Reality Check When questioned at PMQs by Labour leader Sir Keir
Starmer about the transparency of the governmentâs scientific advice, Prime
Minister Boris Johnson said âall Sage advice is published in due courseâ. Sage is short for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. Some of the scientific evidence presented to Sageâs
57-person panel of experts has been published, the vast majority of it has not. Only 27 of the 120 pieces of evidence reviewed by Sage over the course of more than 20 meetings up to mid-April have been published,
and one of the documents released was heavily redacted. The government has released the names of the
unpublished documents â some of which date back as far back as early February - and examine topics as varied as âComparing interventions in Italy and UKâ and
âDoes the use of face masks in the general population make a difference to
spread of infection?â Sage leads the UK governmentâs scientific
response to the coronavirus pandemic and other health emergencies. Its
members include the Chief Medical Officer for England Professor Chris Whitty
and the Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance are members of Sage Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused the prime
minister of making inaccurate comments about government guidance on care homes
and asked him to âcorrect the recordâ in the House of Commons. Sir Keir has written to Boris Johnson regarding an exchange
at Prime Ministerâs Questions this afternoon in which Mr Johnson said âit
wasnât trueâ that advice had said it was unlikely that people in care homes
would become infected . In his letter the Labour leader says âat this time of
national crisis it is more important than ever that government ministers are
accurate in the information they giveâ adding that âI expect you to come to the
House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the recordâ. The government guidance referred to by the Labour leader, which was withdrawn on 13 March,can be found here.,external House of CommonsParliament Earlier, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said all teachers and school pupils will be able to be tested for Covid-19 if they develop symptoms when they return to school. Mr Williamson said new guidance for schools in England which was published on Monday will them ""begin to prepare"" to reopen. He added: ""This guidance sets out protective measures to minimise the risk of infection, including restricting class sizes and limiting mixing between groups. ""Crucially all children and staff will have access to testing if they develop symptoms of coronavirus. ""This will enable a track-and-trace approach to be taken to any confirmed cases."" Reality Check Earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson talked about testing for coronavirus. He said: âWe will go up to 200,000 by
the end of the month.â There has been considerable
confusion about this target, which was first announced as an
""ambition"" on 6 May. The prime minister sounds like he is promising
200,000 tests will be carried out per day, but the Department for Health and
Social Care (DHSC) says that the target is actually for testing capacity, which
is the number of tests that theoretically could be carried out per day. Statistical regulator the UK Statistics Authorityhas written
to Health Secretary Matt Hancock,externalto ask for clarification of whether
that target is for testing capacity, the number of tests administered, the
number of tests completed, or the number of people tested. This followed controversy after
the government announced it had met its 100,000 tests per day target on 30
April, when it turned out that 40,000 of the tests had been sent out but not
necessarily carried out on the day. House of CommonsParliament Shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey says guidance for schools does not provide ""clear assurances over safety that are needed"" - and says teaching staff are ""in fear"" of returning. She says instead of putting dates on when schools should reopen, ministers should instead set safety conditions to be met first. Gavin Williamson says the government is planning for a ""phased, sensible and controlled return"". He adds the government has given schools ""as much forward notice as possible in order for them to get ready"". With PMQs finished, MPs have been putting questions to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson about plans to reopen English schools. Conservative MP Robert Halfon - who chairs the Commons Education Committee - asks whether graduates, volunteers, and retired teachers could staff summer schools for vulnerable children - noting that ""close to 90%"" are currently not in education. Mr Williamson says the government is looking ""very closely"" at how the enthusiasm of those who want to help out can be harnessed. Reality Check The prime
minister was asked about a chart comparing coronavirus deaths in the UK with
those in other countries. He repeated his
assertion that it is too early to make such comparisons, although Labour leader
Sir Keir Starmer pointed out that the chart had been used in daily government
briefings for the past seven weeks. Many statisticians have said that
making precise comparisons between countries will not be possible until we have
figures for excess deaths for all the relevant countries. But Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter,
who both the prime minister and Labour leader have referred to in Prime
Ministerâs Questions, said it was still possible to identify
âthe bad countries in Europe: UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Italyâ, and said:
âClearly itâs important to note that group is way above in terms of their
mortality, a group like Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, who have
low fatality rates."" You can read more about the challenges of international
comparisonshere. House of CommonsParliament And that concludes today's PMQs. The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson now begins his reply to an urgent question on reopening schools. Conservative Peter Bone attacks the Electoral Commission for investigating those involved in the Vote Leave campaign and notes that the police have now said they were ""totally innocent"". ""For the sake of democracy will you ensure that that politically corrupt, totally biased and morally bankrupt quango is abolished,"" he asks. The PM replies that he hopes ""all those who spent so much time and energy drawing attention to their supposed guilt... will spend as much ink and drawing attention to their genuine innocence"". House of CommonsParliament Labour's John Spellar accuses the government of ""washing its hands"" of people with indefinite leave to remain in the UK - noting that ""many"" are still stranded abroad. Boris Johnson does not engage with the specific accusation, but says 1.3 million Britons have returned since Foreign Office advice changed. He says the government has aided this effort by providing Â£75m towards the cost of special charter flights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Hormone-fed beef and chlorine-washed chicken should remain banned in England after Brexit, the government has been warned. Ministers say the issue will be dealt with in the upcoming Trade Bill. But opponents of these practices say that could lead to farm standards being bargained away in negotiations. Instead, they want ministers to guarantee food standards in the Agriculture Bill, which returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Some Conservative MPs have joined up with the opposition to demand protection for England's farmers from lower standard produce from countries like the US. Farmers there are allowed to feed beef with hormones and wash chickens with chlorine solution in order to maximise productivity. But both of these practices are currently banned in the EU. The US demands that ban should be lifted. A government spokesperson said existing protections would not be compromised in trade negotiations. How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? UK's chlorine-washed chicken ban 'to remain' US firms seek changes to UK beef standards US urges UK to embrace chlorinated chicken The issue is part of a great upheaval in UK farm and countryside policy â the biggest since World War II. The UK government wants to shift farm grants to reward activities that enhance the environment. Its opponents are concerned at the lack of clarity over exactly how the transformation will happen, and want the changes to be delayed. Minsters are likely to suffer huge pressure in the Commons on the question of food import standards. They face almost identical amendments to the Bill from some Conservative back-benchers; the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Select Committee; and the Labour and Liberal Democrat front benches. They are all calling for a level playing field on food standards. Jyoti Fernandes, from the Landworkers' Alliance, a union of farmers and other land-based workers, said: ""The Agriculture Bill is a historic moment to make or break our food system. There are concerns imports won't meet existing farm standards âIf we donât protect our farms from being undercut by cheap imports and make a firm commitment to supporting our farmers through this transition, we can wave goodbye to a humane and ecological domestic food supply for future generations."" Sally-Ann Spence, from the Nature Friendly Farming Network, runs a farm in Wiltshire. She said: âAs a farmer doing my best to protect our precious natural environment and heritage, the prospect of low-standard imports fills me with dread. âIn the UK, we are striving to deliver healthy food at world-leading standards whilst managing the land for wildlife and public goods. âI urge MPs to safeguard our high environmental and animal welfare standards in trade law.â With its huge majority, the government is not thought to be in danger of losing key votes. But Neil Parish, Conservative chair of the Efra committee, said: âWe (Tories) put high welfare standards in our manifesto so people will be expecting us to deliver on that. âThe government mustnât allow any trade deal with the US, or anyone else, to undermine British food standards.â A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is renowned for its high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards. ""We have been clear that in all of our trade negotiations we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards."" Agricultural policies in the UK are devolved.

"Rihanna is now the richest woman in music Rihanna has made her debut appearance on The Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated fortune of Â£468 million. The Bajan pop star, who now resides in London, overtakes Sirs Elton John and Mick Jagger to claim third place on the list of Britain's richest musicians. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney are joint firston the list,external, with fortunes of Â£800m apiece. Rihanna's earnings are largely due to the Fenty Beauty cosmetics brand, where her reported 15% stake is worth Â£351m. ""She somewhat caught us by surprise,"" says Robert Watts, who compiles The Sunday Times' annual list. ""Very few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer. Now she's well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK,"" he tells the BBC. Rihanna, who turned 32 in February, is a youthful exception amongst Britain's richest musicians, most of whom found fame in the 1960s and 70s. Amongst the top 40 highest-earners, only Ed Sheeran and Adele are younger, with fortunes of Â£200m and Â£150m respectively. Further down the list, there are new entries for the next generation of pop stars, with Dua Lipa, 24, and George Ezra, 26, each said to be worth Â£16m. Theatre impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber, 72, is the only star on the list to see his valuation fall, with Watts calculating that the Covid-19 shutdown of theatres in the West End and Broadway has already wiped Â£20m off his fortune. Sir Paul, by contrast, receives a Â£50m boost to his finances, thanks to a lucrative world tour and his first children's book Hey Grandude!, which topped the New York Times' best-seller list last year. Sir Elton's farewell tour also added Â£40m to his fortune, putting him in fourth place; while Rolling Stone Sir Mick comes fifth with Â£285m. Ed Sheeran topped the young musicians (aged 30 or under) list, adding Â£40m to his overall wealth after completing a 255-date world tour last August. Harry Styles took second place, with a fortune of Â£63m. All five members of One Direction appear on the list, with Harry Styles just above his bandmate Niall Horan Eagle-eyed readers might spot that U2 have dropped off the Sunday Times' rankings entirely, despite taking third place last year with earnings of Â£583m. Their absence is solely due to coronavirus - as the pandemic has delayed the publication of the paper's Irish Rich List. When those figures are revealed later this year, the band is likely to knock Rihanna down to fourth place. Nonetheless, Watts says that Rihanna's presence is indicative of a ""seismic change"" in the make-up of the main Rich List which, since 1989, had been identifying the 1,000 wealthiest individuals or families living in the UK. ""The days when it was dominated by inherited wealth, the landed gentry and mass of largely white, middle-aged and elderly men, are changing,"" says Watts. ""For example, we've seen a big rise in the number of Asian entrepreneurs and in the number of self-made people. ""Rihanna is, I think, a very good example of someone who's come from a pretty tough upbringing in Barbados and who has a hunger and a determination to work, work work... which, I think, is one of her songs, isn't it?"" (It is,external). Rihanna's earnings from beauty and fashion eclipse those from her music career Although Rihanna made her name in music, she hasn't released an album since 2016's Anti, instead concentrating on her fashion empire. Fenty Beauty launched in September 2017, and was designed to cater to a wider range of skin types and tones than typical cosmetic brands. Thanks to the star's endorsement, and her 82 million Instagram followers, it was an immediate success, racking up sales of Â£78m in its first few weeks. The company is now valued at $3bn (Â£2.4bn). Rihanna also has a lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, and continues to receive royalties from hit songs like SOS, Umbrella and Only Girl In The World. Her Â£468m fortune makes her the richest female musician not just in the UK, but the world - ahead of Madonna (Â£462m), Celine Dion (Â£365m) and BeyoncÃ© (Â£325m). Watts notes that musicians' wealth ""held up better than many other ultra-high net worth individuals"" over the last 12 months, but says the impact of cancelled tours could impact next year's list. ""Their fortunes have held up a little better this year because they're coming off the back of big tours and their valuation is not affected by a plunging stock market,"" he says. ""But next year I would expect, for a lot of these musicians, their wealth to flatline - and some of them may even have to dip into their reserves.""

"More than 110,000 self-employed people whose businesses are affected by coronavirus have already applied for government grants on the first day of the scheme's operation. The value of the claims made so far is more than Â£340m, said officials. The Self Employed Income Support Scheme is designed to match the support being given to furloughed employees. The grants will be calculated as 80% of average monthly profit over a period of up to three years. The government said the money would be paid into the accounts of eligible people six days after applying. The maximum payment will be Â£7,500, intended to cover March, April and May. 'I'm penalised because I took maternity leave' The self-employed missing out on financial aid UK government unveils aid for self-employed The scheme is the biggest direct financial support package for freelancers and the self-employed since lockdown started. The process is being run by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), which has been operating and overseeing loan schemes and the government's furlough payments. HMRC says most of the 3.5 million people affected should have been contacted, and invited to get ready to make a claim by using its eligibility checker. They will then have been given a time at which to apply, between Wednesday and 18 May, although if applicants are unable to file at that time HMRC says they can still go ahead and apply. Inevitably, some people's records will not be up to date or they may not be at their normal address. HMRC says anyone who thinks they are eligible but has not heard from it should go to its website and use the checker tool. Claims can then be made from 17 May. Most should receive any money they are entitled to from 25 May. The scheme was unveiled in March after the government faced criticism for failing to provide support for self-employed and freelance workers in itsearlier package of economic measures. Derek Cribb, chief executive of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, said the scheme extended ""a much-needed lifeline to those self-employed people who are eligible for it"". ""For the self-employed, coronavirus is not only a health crisis, but also a pressing income crisis, until now they've been coping either by applying for Universal Credit or by digging into their savings."" However, those who started in business from early April last year will miss out, as will those who pay themselves just with dividends from a limited company. Mr Cribb urged the government to extend the scheme to include those groups too. The government has not said whether the initiative will be extended into the autumn in line with the furlough scheme, which protects 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500 a month. On Tuesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that scheme was beingextended until the end of October. Mr Sunak said: ""With payments arriving before the end of this month, the self-employed across the UK will have money in their pockets to help them through these challenging times.""

"The government has set out plans to restart England's housing market, which has been in deep freeze since the coronavirus lockdown. Estate agents can now open, viewings can be carried out and removal firms and conveyancers can restart operations. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the changes must be carried out under social distancing and safety rules. It is estimated there are 450,000 buyers and renters with plans on hold. ""Our clear plan will enable people to move home safely, covering each aspect of the sales and letting process, from viewings to removals,"" Mr Jenrick said. ""This critical industry can now safely move forward, and those waiting patiently to move can now do so."" Meanwhile, the property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remain shut. Home viewings are not permitted under lockdown regulations and their land registries are either running a reduced service or are not registering transactions. Coronavirus: House moves and viewings to resume in England Coronavirus: Property sales worth Â£82bn 'on hold' amid lockdown Where can I afford to live? Alistair Elliott, chairman and senior partner at estate agents Knight Frank, told the BBC's Today programme the measures were ""a major first step"". ""We believe the public will have confidence to re-engage with the housing market,"" he said. Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of real estate consultants Garrington Property Finders, said: ""Few things are more likely to make people want to move than being cooped up in the same four walls for weeks on end, and property portals have seen traffic increase by up to a fifth."" This announcement by the government,externalwill test the housing sector's hope, and belief, that a wave of pent-up demand amongst buyers and renters is ready to be released. Yet, the reality is that many people's finances are now less secure than they were just a few months ago when they were preparing to move. Expect a lot more haggling over price from both sides if they have yet to have formally agreed what they will pay or accept, especially if getting a mortgage is harder. Estate agent Savills has already suggested that people who still have money to look for somewhere new, may now be rethinking their priorities. A spare room and good Wi-Fi may suddenly have become more appealing when working from home, and a large garden may be even more of a golden ticket for anyone with children. Housing Secretary Mr Jenrick said guidance from Public Health England must continue to be followed. For example, anyone advised to self-isolate should continue to do so and not move home. The move has raised questions over how social distancing would work during the viewing process to ensure people remain safe, particularly when tenants are still at home. Miles Shipside, from property portal Rightmove, said he expected digital viewings to remain popular. Property website Zoopla previously estimated that about 373,000 property sales had been put on hold during lockdown - with a total value of Â£82bn. Agreed sales were running at a 10th of the normal level for the time of year, and were akin to the activity seen in late December, it said. Spring is usually a busy time for the housing and mortgage markets. Buyers deserted the housing marketfor obvious reasons just before and after the introduction of virus restrictions, which began on 23 March.

Meanwhile, rental demand is 42% down since the start of March, according to Zoopla. The government has also outlined other measures to get the house building sector moving, including: Allowing builders to agree more flexible working hours with their local council, such as staggering arrival times to ease pressure on public transport Enabling local councils and developers to publicise planning applications through social media, instead of having to rely on posters and leaflets Providing support for smaller developers by allowing them to defer payments to local councils to ease cash flow The new guidance includes the permission for trades people to operate in homes, providing they follow social distancing advice. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said:  ""A resumption of work will play a major part in helping the economy recover, as well as delivering the homes the country needs.

"Childminders in England can reopen from Wednesday if they are caring for children from the same household, the government announced late on Tuesday. The move follows confusion about when childminders could reopen. ""Childminders have been told three different things about plans to reopen in a matter of days,"" said Neil Leitch of the Early Years Alliance (EYA). The EYA said it received news of the change to government guidance in an email just after 18:30 BST on Tuesday. The Department for Education says the updated guidance will allow childminders to look after children from one household from Wednesday and, depending on infection rates, to open to more children from 1 June. During lockdown, registered childminders across the UK have either been closed or providing care for vulnerable children or children of key workers and this remains the case in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Lack of childcare 'forcing key workers to stay at home' 'The nursery I run may not survive' On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to reopen the sector in England as part of his ""conditional plan"" to gradually end the lockdown. However, organisations representing childminders later sought clarification as separate documents issued by the government suggested both 13 May and 1 June as dates for when this could happen. In a meeting on Tuesday, the Department for Education appeared to confirm the 1 June date for all childminders, according to the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY). But in an email to childcare organisations, sent a few hours later, an official issued an update on childminder policy ""effective from tomorrow"". ""The government has amended its guidance to clarify that paid childcare can be provided to the children of one household in any circumstance,"" said the email. ""This would include nannies, for example, and childminders may also choose to provide childcare on this basis if not already providing care for vulnerable children and children of critical workers. ""This should enable more working parents to return to work."" Rebecca Martland, from Worthing, normally cares for children from several families and has no plans to reopen until 1 June. ""I don't think it's appropriate,"" she says. ""I have nothing in place. I need to rearrange my family home to accommodate safe working."" She also says she will need to amend her policies and working practices and consult with parents ""to make sure they feel happy and safe"". She points out inconsistencies in government policy: ""You can't have your grandchildren but you can welcome an unrelated family into your home which goes against everything we've been told  is safe to do,"" she says. The guidance so far has been ""a shambles"", she says. ""As a sector we've been very shabbily treated."" Rebecca Martland is a childminder in West Sussex PACEY chief executive Liz Bayram welcomed the clarification, saying the organisation had heard from thousands of its members who were unclear when they could reopen. ""It is up to you as an individual to decide whether you want to open now or take time to prepare to open to all children on 1 June,""PACEY advised its members on its web page.,external CORONAVIRUS NEWSCAST:All of the latest updates on the pandemic MINDFUL MIX:Calming tracks to help you relax Content available only in the UK Ms Bayram however warned that not all childminders could consider opening in June because of ongoing worries about infection. ""We also know many childminders are worried about reopening and placing their family at risk."" She called for better financial support from government for childminders whose businesses have been hit by the lockdown. Mr Leitch said childminders had ""frankly had enough of last-minute, contradictory guidance from this government"". He urged ministers to stop treating them as an ""afterthought"" and to recognise that they needed better support and guidance in meeting the challenge of providing childcare safely in their own homes.

"Some passengers at Canning Town underground station in east London wore masks for their commute on Wednesday morning Some people in England who cannot work from home are returning to their workplaces today, as the government begins easing some lockdown measures. The government urged people to avoid public transport if possible. But some commuters said Tube trains and buses were still too busy to observe social distancing rules. Meanwhile,new guidance issued by the College of Policing,externalsaid officers had ""no powers to enforce two-metre distancing"" in England. Under the new rules in England, people can now spend more time outside and move house. Garden centres can reopen and sports that are physically distanced - such as golf - are now permitted. Two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings, such as parks, as long as they stay more than 2m apart. However, government guidance on maintaining a 2m distance, avoiding public transport and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces is ""not enforceable"" by officers in England, according to the fresh guidelines from the College of Policing. All you need to know about new lockdown measures Who am I allowed to meet now? What can the police fine you for doing? Why the lockdown ended in garden centres first It follows a speech by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday in which heunveiled a ""conditional plan"" aimed at reopening society. This has led to a divergence in lockdown rules between the UK government and the devolved administrations, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland keeping stricter measures in place and retaining the message to stay at home. It comes as figures from the Office for National Statisticsshowed the UK economy shrank at the fastest pace since the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2020. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC it was ""very likely"" the UK would face a ""significant recession"" as a result of the pandemic. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UKhas reached 33,186,,externala rise of 494 on the previous day. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick led the Downing Street daily briefing and was joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries. The lockdown has brought immense challenges for the police service. Although crime has plummeted and police sickness rates have been far lower than expected, officers have found themselves caught in the middle of a web of hastily-drawn up regulations and guidelines. The latest police guidance for England suggests their job won't be any easier as it makes clear they can only enforce the law - not government advice. That means, for example, you can be stopped or fined if you go on an overnight trip or meet up with two or more people from outside your home - because that's the law. But officers can't prevent you from standing close to a stranger or travelling by train without a face mask on - because two-metre distancing and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces are guidance. In England, employers have been issued withguidelines on keeping workplaces as safe as possible,external, including staggering shifts and frequent cleaning. Those who flout the rules could face criminal proceedings, the Health and Safety Executive watchdog has warned. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the new guidelines for employers were ""a step in the right direction"" but ""the real test will be delivery"". She said employers should publish a risk assessment and if workers had any concerns they could contact the Health and Safety Executive hotline. ""It's really important to remember that workers do have that right in law not to work if it would put them in imminent danger,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Some commuters were not able to maintain a 2m distance on a Victoria Line Tube into central London By contrast, one commuter pictured this almost-deserted Tyne and Wear Metro carriage in Newcastle There was some traffic on the M1 in Northamptonshire on Wednesday morning York Tennis Club opened for players on Wednesday after restrictions were eased Asked how it was possible for people to maintain social distancing on public transport as more people returned to work, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government was urging people to cycle and walk where possible. ""The absolute key here is for anybody who can to make alternative arrangements for travel,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He added that, even if the public transport network was running at full capacity, only one in 10 passengers would be able to travel while keeping to social distancing rules. Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Bus drivers' safety fears as lockdown eases LIVE: First day of eased lockdown across England Passenger numbers across the UK's major railway stations were up 10% up compared with the same day last week, BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said. Transport for London (TfL) said the number of passengers using the Tube from the start of service to 06:00 was up by 8.7% compared with the same period last week. As of 10:00 the number of Tube passengers was about 7.3% higher. However both figures are still a fraction of the normal numbers and Downing Street said TfL was ""not reporting significant increases"" on the London network compared to the last few days. One commutertold the BBC it was ""next to impossible"" to socially distance on the London Undergroundand most people were not wearing masks. In Blackpool, a hospital worker said the downstairs of her bus was ""packed"" during her morning commute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Asked about reports of busy rush hour trains and buses during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want to see crowding on public transport in our capital or anywhere else."" He said the government was ""working very actively"" with TfL to increase capacity and lay on more Tube trains when necessary. ""We also want to see proper marshalling at stations to prevent crowding of trains,"" he added. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

The updated lockdown regulations, which were presented to Parliament on Tuesday, also allow people to leave their homes to collect goods ordered from businesses or to travel to waste or recycling centres. Some outdoor sports can get under way again, with golf clubs and tennis courts expected to reopen to the public. Playgrounds, however, will stay shut. Restrictions have also been lifted on how far people can travel to get to the countryside, national parks and beaches in England. However, people have been warned to respect local communities, keep their distance from others and avoid busy areas. The government reiterated that staying overnight at a holiday or second home was not allowed. Those who break the rules will now face fines starting at Â£100 in England, and this will double on each further repeat offence up to Â£3,200. National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt said officers would ""continue to use common sense and discretion"".

"Travel firm Tui is pressing for tourism to resume to countries where the coronavirus threat has abated. It plans to reopen some hotels in Germany ""in the coming days"". The company, which says it has 27 million customers, added operations in other European destinations were also ready to welcome holidaymakers. Tui has identified Austria, Greece and Cyprus as being more viable among European destinations because the virus there appears to be contained. It was forced to cancel the majority of its travel programme in March and on Wednesday warned that up to 8,000 jobs would go as it strives to cut costs by 30% in a major restructuring. TUI has cancelled all holidays until June and cruises until July. It would normally be running hundreds of flights a week at this time of year. Travel restrictions across Europe and further afield mean that the crucial summer season for many though is still in doubt, leaving millions of holidaymakers unsure of their plans. In the UK, the Foreign Office is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was unlikely that""big, lavish international holidays""were going to be possible this summer. A spokesman for Tui said countries were ""knocking at its door"", eager to see it reopen hotels and bring back tourists. Tui said it was trying hard to resume operations and had worked out a number of protocols to make its holidays safe. It has a 10-point plan of guidance on how to reopen safely, including limited buffet services, restrictions on some sports and games and longer opening times at restaurants. But the company said blanket travel restrictions were making resumption impossible. Spain, for example, is introducing a 14-day quarantine period for incomers - which covers the length of most package holidays. The issue of holiday travel is becoming politically sensitive as parts of Europe begin to either recover from or emerge as less affected by the first onslaught of the virus. The European Commission said on Wednesday a summer holiday season shouldn't be ruled out this year, contrasting with the UK health secretary's comment on the unlikelihood of a trip abroad this summer. Coronavirus: What are the new travel quarantine rules? Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said: ""The demand for holidays is still very high. People want to travel. ""Our integrated business model allows us to start travel activities as soon as this is possible again. The season starts later, but could last longer. ""For 2020, we will also reinvent the holiday: new destinations, changed travel seasons, new local offerings, more digitalisation."" Tui said it was ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures. ""The health and well-being of both customers and colleagues remain paramount and we are assessing how we can responsibly adapt to measures so that leisure travel can resume,"" the firm said. ""We are preparing new procedures for the airport process, on board our aircraft, in hotels and on our ships, so that any social distancing recommendations or guidelines can be implemented, without compromising customer enjoyment and travel experience."" Tui said its restructuring would affect its airline business and would also involve selling off ""non-profitable activities"". ""We are targeting to permanently reduce our overhead cost base by 30% across the entire group. This will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced,"" it said in a statement. Last month it told its UK workforce they would face a cut of up to 50% in hours worked, with a matching cut in basic pay. The firm said its turnover and earnings would be significantly lower in the current financial year, with cost savings only partly compensating for the slump. Tui, which has a global workforce of 70,000, was recently bolstered by a â¬1.8bn (Â£1.6bn) state-backed loan in Germany, where it has its headquarters.

"Perranporth Golf Club, in Cornwall, will be one of many courses to reopen on Wednesday - although people will not be able to play fourballs Phones have been ringing off the hook, venue bosses are working harder than ever and search engines are being sent into overdrive after some recreational sports were given the go-ahead to return in England. Golf, tennis, angling and basketball are among the sports taking tentative steps in allowing the general public to return to participation on Wednesday as coronavirus lockdown measures are eased. But each sport is also urging caution and vigilance as they seek to keep the spread of the virus under control while also helping protect people's mental health and wellbeing. So how has the first wave of the nation's sports begun to come out of hibernation after two months? BBC Sport has spoken to a number of clubs and organisations hoping to use fun and games as a vehicle for helping the country come gradually out of lockdown. Courses across England will once again be alive with the sound of golf balls being hit on Wednesday. Governing bodies have worked together to formulate how the game can be played safely during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. There is plenty of guidance on how to socially distance, new rules on course etiquette and phrases such as ""wash your hands, don't touch the flag"" which have now entered the golfing lexicon. Golf is back - but what are the differences? David Rickman, the R&A's executive director of governance, said everyone in the sport is ""conscious of the continued impact of the pandemic and that lives are still being lost"", but added that golf has a ""small part to play"" in the nation's wellbeing. ""We are fortunate that golf lends itself to social distancing, so by making a few relatively small changes to the rules and the environment in which we play, we can make it safe for golfers,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Already Perranporth Golf Course, in Cornwall, is fully booked for when play can resume on Wednesday. All tee times for the first day of play in more than seven weeks were snapped up in less than 24 hours after prime minister Boris Johnson announced that golfers could get back on the greens. Sue McDevitt, general manager of the course, said the ""booking system went crazy"" after the announcement. ""I had one of the busiest days of my working career on Monday,"" McDevitt told BBC Sport. Members will be able to play either the front or back nine at Perranporth Golf Club to double capacity on the course The booking of tee times, which was previously advisable at the club, has now become compulsory during the pandemic in an effort to help keep golfers safe and numbers on the course in check. While it is largely done online, McDevitt says she is also taking bookings from older members who simply don't have access to technology. It has been a busy two days getting ready to once again host golf at Perranporth, but with seven weeks of preparation the challenge has been met ""with ease"" considering the circumstances. ""We always knew it was going to come back at some point, so I've been really busy during these last few weeks coming up with a plan on how we are going to do it, "" McDevitt said. ""I even emailed what the plan was to the members so they would be ready."" Just hours after the government announced that recreational golf would be free to restart, the club published a nine-point notice on their social media channels outlining their approach. It is a basic roadmap back to the greens that was drawn up with the help of the major golfing bodies in England and in conjunction with neighbouring clubs, West Cornwall, Tehidy Park, Mullion and Newquay. ""We already had close working relationships so we decided between us that we would have similar plans so golfers in the area would all have similar options,"" McDevitt said. ""It is in all our interests to get as much golf going in Cornwall as possible."" As far as business goes, much of the club remains unable to open during the pandemic, with the course's accommodation, restaurant, bar, golf shop and practice facilities all shut. A majority of staff, including some green keepers, remain furloughed, which makes aspects of opening - including maintaining the course and keeping tabs on golfers - a challenge. ""The course is open and it looks absolutely beautiful, but it is perhaps not going to play as well as it normally would at this time of year because it hasn't had all those man hours manicuring it,"" McDevitt said. ""It is playable but the members may lose their ball in the rough initially. They are quite happy with that because they can play golf. It doesn't need to be at Championship standard yet, but we will get there."" Fishing is one of the sports that people can start to resume doing on Wednesday Angling has found itself thrust into the limelight since the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions was announced, with both fresh and saltwater recreational fishing being allowed to resume across England. But why has it been identified among the sports and pastimes deemed appropriate and suitable? According to Martin Salter, head of policy at the Angling Trust, it's the result of producing a detailed plan to demonstrate why angling is a Covid-19 compliant sport due to its general nature, and earning recognition from the government that it ""has potential to be part of the solution and not part of the problem"". ""Spending time outdoors and in fresh air can limit the spread of the virus rather than the other way round,"" Salter told BBC Sport. ""We can help disperse crowds and have a positive effect on people's mental health and wellbeing. ""But it really is incumbent on all of us to realise we're going to be ambassadors for our sport. The spotlight is going to be on us. ""The last thing I want to see is pictures in newspapers and other media outlets of anglers crowding around piers or breakwaters too close to each other. ""We must continue to respect the social distancing guidelines and ensure, when we say to both government and society that angling is a Covid-19 compliant sport, we demonstrate that responsibility to ourselves and each other."" The Angling Trust is also continuing to lobby government for clarity over when and how tackle and bait shops can reopen to support the angling infrastructure, in a similar way to  cycle shops being allowed to continue trading during lockdown. ""Those shops are where you pick up your permits, your licences, your day tickets, where you get your advice as anglers,"" he said. ""A lot of those retailers have been struggling so we've made direct representations to government and we hope they can grant an extension to allow those shops to reopen before June."" While recreational angling is free to resume from Wednesday, match fishing and competitions remain banned for the foreseeable future in line with other major sporting events and mass gatherings. The coarse fishing close season for rivers and some still waters also remains in place until 16 June. Some commercial fisheries across England will actually remain closed as they choose to ""wait and see"" how the sport's approach to coming out of lockdown unfolds. One that will be welcoming anglers back is Makins Fishery, near Nuneaton, in Warwickshire, but under a series of rules and guidelines, including only allowing pre-booked visits and operating strict daytime opening hours. Wendell Ward, manager of the three-lake facility, has had three phones ringing off the hook since Sunday evening, but stresses anglers will need to be responsible. ""We have to ensure people can return to fishing in a safe environment,"" he said. ""Initially I did think it might be a bit too soon to reopen and I would've been happy to wait a bit longer. But if we put the right measures in place and control numbers, people can get back to enjoying the sport. ""I know people have been chomping at the bit to get back out there since lockdown, but I don't want them being careless and reckless. ""Restrictions have been relaxed and reopening is vital for our business, but if people turn up in big groups and car loads, they will be sent away and we'll have to reconsider our choice."" Many tennis courts across England will reopen on Wednesday for the first time since being closed on 23 March because of the coronavirus pandemic With people in England allowed to exercise outside as many times as they wish, a variety of facilities can now be accessed. Although playgrounds, outdoor gyms and ticketed outdoor leisure venues will remain closed, playing one-on-one sports, including tennis, basketball and even a hit in the cricket nets, is permissible as long as social distancing rules are observed. Sunday's government announcement saw searches for venues ""go bonkers"" for Playfinder, an online booking portal for grassroots facilities. Where? How? Who with? Getting yourself back into playing tennis Jamie Foale, the founder and chief executive of the company which has 5,200 venues on its books across the UK, said Monday was the marketplace's busiest day since lockdown began. A new filter is poised to be added to their search options, distinguishing what venues are open to the public as not every court, course or venue is suitable or able to host people yet. ""As a result of the clarification given on Monday we are seeing almost all councils open their suitable venues to a degree,"" said Foale, whose company manages bookings for a number of councils, as well as schools and commercial sites. ""Councils recognise they a have a big part to play in helping people stay fit and healthy through this and I know that they want to be able to open facilities so they can do that. ""We had a number of bookings made on Monday and a lot of searches for free courts, which has always been a big part of what we do."" Foale said the most difficult part of helping people prepare for the resumption of recreational sports has been getting in touch with the venues themselves when huge swathes of employees in the sector have been furloughed. ""We've madly been calling up the venues to make sure we have a firm grip on what is available and what isn't,"" said Foale, whose company will not be taking booking fees during the pandemic. ""Communication has been hard when all these businesses are struggling, trying to work out how they will operate in a post-pandemic world. ""We need to keep the nation moving and active. We, as a business, set up to to help people play sport. And that service is now needed more than ever."" A sign of the times that many may end up seeing on their local court or around their favourite course will be signage reminding participants of the rules which have made a return to action possible. Governing bodies for each sport have different directives to best suit the game being played. All of them, however, have the same underlying message about maintaining social distance. Not every sporting venue will automatically open as a result, with this being a key message from the Lawn Tennis Association, which governs the game in Britain. Venues have been advised to take time to ensure they are set up to reopen safely, so players in certain places might have to wait a little longer before they can get back on court. The Queen's Club in London, one of the nation's most iconic clubs, for example, will not be at full capacity as they have chosen to open only nine of its 27 outdoor courts to members from Wednesday. It is a similar situation at the Northern Tennis Club, in Manchester, where only seven of their 18 outdoor courts will be opened to ensure social distancing is maintained. ""We're hugely relieved and excited that we're able to start reopening the courts, but we're also conscious that we must do it slowly and cautiously,"" chairman Neville Hewer told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We've been maintaining our courts during the lockdown period so we were in a position to go when we had the opportunity to, but we're mindful of the fact that in this circumstance we're walking on eggshells because of this unprecedented scenario.""

"More than 110,000 self-employed people whose businesses are affected by coronavirus have already applied for government grants on the first day of the scheme's operation. The value of the claims made so far is more than Â£340m, said officials. The Self Employed Income Support Scheme is designed to match the support being given to furloughed employees. The grants will be calculated as 80% of average monthly profit over a period of up to three years. The government said the money would be paid into the accounts of eligible people six days after applying. The maximum payment will be Â£7,500, intended to cover March, April and May. 'I'm penalised because I took maternity leave' The self-employed missing out on financial aid UK government unveils aid for self-employed The scheme is the biggest direct financial support package for freelancers and the self-employed since lockdown started. The process is being run by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), which has been operating and overseeing loan schemes and the government's furlough payments. HMRC says most of the 3.5 million people affected should have been contacted, and invited to get ready to make a claim by using its eligibility checker. They will then have been given a time at which to apply, between Wednesday and 18 May, although if applicants are unable to file at that time HMRC says they can still go ahead and apply. Inevitably, some people's records will not be up to date or they may not be at their normal address. HMRC says anyone who thinks they are eligible but has not heard from it should go to its website and use the checker tool. Claims can then be made from 17 May. Most should receive any money they are entitled to from 25 May. The scheme was unveiled in March after the government faced criticism for failing to provide support for self-employed and freelance workers in itsearlier package of economic measures. Derek Cribb, chief executive of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, said the scheme extended ""a much-needed lifeline to those self-employed people who are eligible for it"". ""For the self-employed, coronavirus is not only a health crisis, but also a pressing income crisis, until now they've been coping either by applying for Universal Credit or by digging into their savings."" However, those who started in business from early April last year will miss out, as will those who pay themselves just with dividends from a limited company. Mr Cribb urged the government to extend the scheme to include those groups too. The government has not said whether the initiative will be extended into the autumn in line with the furlough scheme, which protects 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500 a month. On Tuesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that scheme was beingextended until the end of October. Mr Sunak said: ""With payments arriving before the end of this month, the self-employed across the UK will have money in their pockets to help them through these challenging times.""

"Childminders in England can reopen from Wednesday if they are caring for children from the same household, the government announced late on Tuesday. The move follows confusion about when childminders could reopen. ""Childminders have been told three different things about plans to reopen in a matter of days,"" said Neil Leitch of the Early Years Alliance (EYA). The EYA said it received news of the change to government guidance in an email just after 18:30 BST on Tuesday. The Department for Education says the updated guidance will allow childminders to look after children from one household from Wednesday and, depending on infection rates, to open to more children from 1 June. During lockdown, registered childminders across the UK have either been closed or providing care for vulnerable children or children of key workers and this remains the case in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Lack of childcare 'forcing key workers to stay at home' 'The nursery I run may not survive' On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to reopen the sector in England as part of his ""conditional plan"" to gradually end the lockdown. However, organisations representing childminders later sought clarification as separate documents issued by the government suggested both 13 May and 1 June as dates for when this could happen. In a meeting on Tuesday, the Department for Education appeared to confirm the 1 June date for all childminders, according to the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY). But in an email to childcare organisations, sent a few hours later, an official issued an update on childminder policy ""effective from tomorrow"". ""The government has amended its guidance to clarify that paid childcare can be provided to the children of one household in any circumstance,"" said the email. ""This would include nannies, for example, and childminders may also choose to provide childcare on this basis if not already providing care for vulnerable children and children of critical workers. ""This should enable more working parents to return to work."" Rebecca Martland, from Worthing, normally cares for children from several families and has no plans to reopen until 1 June. ""I don't think it's appropriate,"" she says. ""I have nothing in place. I need to rearrange my family home to accommodate safe working."" She also says she will need to amend her policies and working practices and consult with parents ""to make sure they feel happy and safe"". She points out inconsistencies in government policy: ""You can't have your grandchildren but you can welcome an unrelated family into your home which goes against everything we've been told  is safe to do,"" she says. The guidance so far has been ""a shambles"", she says. ""As a sector we've been very shabbily treated."" Rebecca Martland is a childminder in West Sussex PACEY chief executive Liz Bayram welcomed the clarification, saying the organisation had heard from thousands of its members who were unclear when they could reopen. ""It is up to you as an individual to decide whether you want to open now or take time to prepare to open to all children on 1 June,""PACEY advised its members on its web page.,external CORONAVIRUS NEWSCAST:All of the latest updates on the pandemic MINDFUL MIX:Calming tracks to help you relax Content available only in the UK Ms Bayram however warned that not all childminders could consider opening in June because of ongoing worries about infection. ""We also know many childminders are worried about reopening and placing their family at risk."" She called for better financial support from government for childminders whose businesses have been hit by the lockdown. Mr Leitch said childminders had ""frankly had enough of last-minute, contradictory guidance from this government"". He urged ministers to stop treating them as an ""afterthought"" and to recognise that they needed better support and guidance in meeting the challenge of providing childcare safely in their own homes.

Oli ConstableBBC Yorkshire Live A golfer says practising shots in his living room helped for his first game back playing after the government eased some coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Bruce Allison, 73, from Harrogate teed off at 07:40 this morning - making him one of the first golfers back on the course since the government allowed some sports to resume under social distancing rules to keep players safe. Mr Allison said his club, in Pannal, organised a charity draw to find out who had the privilege of being one of the first to tee off. He said: ""It was wonderful. For members it was terrific and great to be back on the course. ""We have distance markings around the tee and you have to turn up five minutes before your tee time for when you've booked. ""You don't touch the pin and clearly you can't shake hands with your partner after the game,â he added. Some people in England unable to work from home are returning from their workplaces this afternoon, as the government begins easing some lockdown measures. However, despite the government urging people to avoid public transport if possible some commuters said trains and buses were still too busy to observe social distancing rules. Read more on thishere.

"Travel firm Tui is pressing for tourism to resume to countries where the coronavirus threat has abated. It plans to reopen some hotels in Germany ""in the coming days"". The company, which says it has 27 million customers, added operations in other European destinations were also ready to welcome holidaymakers. Tui has identified Austria, Greece and Cyprus as being more viable among European destinations because the virus there appears to be contained. It was forced to cancel the majority of its travel programme in March and on Wednesday warned that up to 8,000 jobs would go as it strives to cut costs by 30% in a major restructuring. TUI has cancelled all holidays until June and cruises until July. It would normally be running hundreds of flights a week at this time of year. Travel restrictions across Europe and further afield mean that the crucial summer season for many though is still in doubt, leaving millions of holidaymakers unsure of their plans. In the UK, the Foreign Office is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was unlikely that""big, lavish international holidays""were going to be possible this summer. A spokesman for Tui said countries were ""knocking at its door"", eager to see it reopen hotels and bring back tourists. Tui said it was trying hard to resume operations and had worked out a number of protocols to make its holidays safe. It has a 10-point plan of guidance on how to reopen safely, including limited buffet services, restrictions on some sports and games and longer opening times at restaurants. But the company said blanket travel restrictions were making resumption impossible. Spain, for example, is introducing a 14-day quarantine period for incomers - which covers the length of most package holidays. The issue of holiday travel is becoming politically sensitive as parts of Europe begin to either recover from or emerge as less affected by the first onslaught of the virus. The European Commission said on Wednesday a summer holiday season shouldn't be ruled out this year, contrasting with the UK health secretary's comment on the unlikelihood of a trip abroad this summer. Coronavirus: What are the new travel quarantine rules? Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said: ""The demand for holidays is still very high. People want to travel. ""Our integrated business model allows us to start travel activities as soon as this is possible again. The season starts later, but could last longer. ""For 2020, we will also reinvent the holiday: new destinations, changed travel seasons, new local offerings, more digitalisation."" Tui said it was ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures. ""The health and well-being of both customers and colleagues remain paramount and we are assessing how we can responsibly adapt to measures so that leisure travel can resume,"" the firm said. ""We are preparing new procedures for the airport process, on board our aircraft, in hotels and on our ships, so that any social distancing recommendations or guidelines can be implemented, without compromising customer enjoyment and travel experience."" Tui said its restructuring would affect its airline business and would also involve selling off ""non-profitable activities"". ""We are targeting to permanently reduce our overhead cost base by 30% across the entire group. This will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced,"" it said in a statement. Last month it told its UK workforce they would face a cut of up to 50% in hours worked, with a matching cut in basic pay. The firm said its turnover and earnings would be significantly lower in the current financial year, with cost savings only partly compensating for the slump. Tui, which has a global workforce of 70,000, was recently bolstered by a â¬1.8bn (Â£1.6bn) state-backed loan in Germany, where it has its headquarters.

But we don't know who is al-packing the bags. This video can not be played Llamas are delivering shopping Pembrokeshire The Welsh Government had not stockpiled surgical gowns despite a UK-wide recommendation. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said two weeks ago that gowns were included in the pandemic stockpile when the coronavirus reached the UK. But in a letter to Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were no gowns between June 2016 and February 2020. Mr Drakeford was challenged about PPE procurement by Mr Price in a virtual meeting of the Senedd. Mr Price said in 2016 the New and Emerging Virus Threats Advisory Group recommended the composition of PPE stockpile should be re-considered. He said: âEither the Welsh Government had seen sight of the recommendation and failed to act or the UK Government had failed to share 'life-saving information' with Wales.â The first minister said he ""couldnât answer that sort of detailed question"". A Welsh Government spokesman said: âWe have put enormous effort into securing new supplies of PPE and developing Welsh supply chains. ""Yesterday, the latest shipment arrived in Cardiff containing a further 600,000 fluid-resistant gowns.â A politician says he believes Wednesday's confirmed new cases of coronavirus show north Wales has yet to reach its infection peak. The figures released by Public Health Wales recorded 133 new infections, with 70 of those in north Wales, although the real figure is likely to be higher. Flintshire was the worst hit with 39 new cases, with other infections in Wrexham, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Conwy and Anglesey. Plaid Cymru's North Wales Member of the Senedd (MS) Llyr Gruffydd said: ""The rise in the proportion of confirmed cases in the north compared to the rest of Wales is a matter of huge concern. ""Of the 133 new cases announced in Wales, more than half were in the BCUHB (Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board) region. That amounts to 70 out of 133 announced today. ""It reinforces the point Plaid Cymru has been making for the past week that, in contrast to areas around Cardiff and Newport, the north has yet to hit a peak. ""It's vitally important that this key message informs the political decisions being made in Cardiff."" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in north Wales is the largest health organisation in Wales Gwent Police officers have been actively monitoring the Wales-England border to stop people travelling into Wales. The force has been in Tintern, Monmouthshire, where officers have been stopping ""leisure vehicles"". The recent bank holiday was the busiest period theyâve had for some time, officers said. They said most people were obeying the rules but expect more to cross into the country this weekend. PC James Heley has returned to work after contracting coronavirus. He said officers know what they were looking for: âAny leisure vehicles, motorcyclists or any vehicles with two or more occupants. ""Mostly people gave been sticking to the rules, but we have had to turn people around, including people from London.â The boss of bike share firm Nextbike has expressed her fury at vandals who wrecked bikes to be used by NHS workers. Nextbike had joined forces with Cardiff University and Cardiff Metropolitan University to fund the scheme so they could use them for free. Managing director Krysia Solheim said large numbers of bikes had been wrecked. This has crippled the service and cost thousands of pounds. Ms Solheim said: âWe have suffered from vandalism in the past but we didnât think anyone could stoop so low as to actively destroy bikes which are helping keep critical workers safe in these traumatic times."" A Cardiff University-led review is being used to inform pioneering
use of lung ultrasound to help in the management of patients with Covid-19. The academics were first tosummarise early evidence on
ultrasound imaging,external- more commonly used in pregnancy or for muscle
injury - and how to use it to assess and monitor lung damage. Lung damage is one of the most serious problems for patients with severe symptoms of Covid-19. Key decisions such as admitting a patient to hospital, moving a patient from a ward to a high dependency unit, or whether they should be put on mechanical ventilation or taken off it, are usually informed by CT scans, chest x-rays or by listening to the chest. But for infection control reasons these cannot be used in the monitoring of Covid-19. The review's lead author Dr Mike Smith, a senior lecturer from Cardiff Universityâs School of
Healthcare Sciences, said: âWe wanted to take the information that was flying around the research and
clinical communities and make it more useful for clinicians - right at the
beginning of the pandemic curve. ""Since then lung ultrasound has emerged as
critical to monitoring lung injury caused by Covid-19.â Simon Hayward, a specialist physiotherapist from Blackpool Teaching
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: âItâs an amazing tool because we can
observe the changes in lung damage - and use it to inform how we manage these
patients in real time."" Discussions are taking place this week about how long the Principality Stadium in Cardiff will be used as a field hospital. The current arrangement with the NHS and Welsh Government - which has seen the national stadium house the 2,000-bed Dragon's Heart Hospital - runs until 10 July. Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies said concerns about the possibility of a second coronavirus spike will be factored into talks over whether the stadiumâs time as a medical facility will be extended.

The council says that pre-booking visits will be ""essential"". On its website, it added: ""In this initial period of reopening the council has stressed that visits to the centre should only take place if classed as essential, if it is a risk to safety or health to keep the waste at home. ""If the items can be recycled by the regular collections, such as cardboard, then these items should still be placed in the appropriate red or purple recycling bags for collection."" The Welsh Government'schange in adviceto permit people to sit and eat outside as part of their daily exercise has ""nothing to do"" with a tabloid newspaper story about Health Minister Vaughan Gething, the first minister says. Mr Gething was pictured sitting eating chips with his family over the weekend, with his actions criticised by opposition politicians. Previous guidelines advised against ""having a picnic"" while out for the one permitted daily period of exercise. Monday's update said people in Wales are now allowed to exercise outside more than once a day, during which ""stopping to have something to eat or sit in a park, for example, is intended to be permitted"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said that a ""brief stop to allow a child to eat is not a picnic in anybody's language"". Tory Clwyd West MS Darren Millar suggested that ""many people may think"" the guidance was changed because of the story. Mr Drakeford, answered during a virtual Senedd session, that the updated guidelines were ""nothing to do with any incident that he's referring to"". ""The decisions that the Welsh Government made on the measures that we were going to change were made on Thursday of last week. They were made in a cabinet meeting,"" Mr Drakeford added.

The Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Sophie Howe, has called on the UK government to introduce universal basic income (UBI) in response to the coronavirus crisis. UBI is a no-strings-attached sum given from the state as regular payments to all adults to cover the basic cost of living and provide financial security. Another proposal included in Ms Howe's report is to pilot a four-day working week to reduce our carbon footprint and keep people well. ""Wage poverty, racial disparity, imbalances in property ownership and quality of housing, job insecurity along with deep structural inequalities in the economy have been laid bare by Covid-19,"" she said. ""We're at a crossroads. We can either go back to the old way of doing things, with the old problems still harming our most needy communities, or we can change to better things for the benefit of everyone. ""A healthy economy should deliver a fair distribution of health and wealth and wellbeing, while protecting the planet's resources for future generations and other species. ""That's a more realistic version of what prosperity looks like."" Ministers are hoping to use a test, track and trace strategy to ease the country from lockdown A thousand-strong workforce will be needed to test the public and trace coronavirus' spread in Wales,the Welsh Government said. Ministers are hoping to use a test, track and trace strategy to ease the country from lockdown. In the plan, published on Wednesday, officials estimated 20,000 tests-a-day may be needed. Daily capacity now stands at 5,000, the report said. Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies says there arecontingency plans being discussedfor an alternative programme of autumn international games. Wales are due to host New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa and Fiji in Cardiff in November but those matches are in doubt because of coronavirus. Mr Davies said a Six Nations-style tournament or games against the home nations were being considered. If games go ahead they could still be played behind closed doors. ""Every country is quite desperate to play in some form,"" Mr Davies said. ""The best-case scenario is the autumn series takes place, as long as southern hemisphere countries are prepared and allowed to travel, which again is a key variable. ""The next scenario you look at is games against Six Nations teams before Christmas, or perhaps a four nations because again, travelling to the continent brings another set of unknowns. ""The worst-case scenario is there's no rugby at all. The immediate consequence to that is the financial one, which  affects all parts of the game.""

"Some passengers at Canning Town underground station in east London wore masks for their commute on Wednesday morning Some people in England who cannot work from home are returning to their workplaces today, as the government begins easing some lockdown measures. The government urged people to avoid public transport if possible. But some commuters said Tube trains and buses were still too busy to observe social distancing rules. Meanwhile,new guidance issued by the College of Policing,externalsaid officers had ""no powers to enforce two-metre distancing"" in England. Under the new rules in England, people can now spend more time outside and move house. Garden centres can reopen and sports that are physically distanced - such as golf - are now permitted. Two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings, such as parks, as long as they stay more than 2m apart. However, government guidance on maintaining a 2m distance, avoiding public transport and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces is ""not enforceable"" by officers in England, according to the fresh guidelines from the College of Policing. All you need to know about new lockdown measures Who am I allowed to meet now? What can the police fine you for doing? Why the lockdown ended in garden centres first It follows a speech by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday in which heunveiled a ""conditional plan"" aimed at reopening society. This has led to a divergence in lockdown rules between the UK government and the devolved administrations, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland keeping stricter measures in place and retaining the message to stay at home. It comes as figures from the Office for National Statisticsshowed the UK economy shrank at the fastest pace since the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2020. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC it was ""very likely"" the UK would face a ""significant recession"" as a result of the pandemic. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UKhas reached 33,186,,externala rise of 494 on the previous day. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick led the Downing Street daily briefing and was joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries. The lockdown has brought immense challenges for the police service. Although crime has plummeted and police sickness rates have been far lower than expected, officers have found themselves caught in the middle of a web of hastily-drawn up regulations and guidelines. The latest police guidance for England suggests their job won't be any easier as it makes clear they can only enforce the law - not government advice. That means, for example, you can be stopped or fined if you go on an overnight trip or meet up with two or more people from outside your home - because that's the law. But officers can't prevent you from standing close to a stranger or travelling by train without a face mask on - because two-metre distancing and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces are guidance. In England, employers have been issued withguidelines on keeping workplaces as safe as possible,external, including staggering shifts and frequent cleaning. Those who flout the rules could face criminal proceedings, the Health and Safety Executive watchdog has warned. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the new guidelines for employers were ""a step in the right direction"" but ""the real test will be delivery"". She said employers should publish a risk assessment and if workers had any concerns they could contact the Health and Safety Executive hotline. ""It's really important to remember that workers do have that right in law not to work if it would put them in imminent danger,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Some commuters were not able to maintain a 2m distance on a Victoria Line Tube into central London By contrast, one commuter pictured this almost-deserted Tyne and Wear Metro carriage in Newcastle There was some traffic on the M1 in Northamptonshire on Wednesday morning York Tennis Club opened for players on Wednesday after restrictions were eased Asked how it was possible for people to maintain social distancing on public transport as more people returned to work, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government was urging people to cycle and walk where possible. ""The absolute key here is for anybody who can to make alternative arrangements for travel,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He added that, even if the public transport network was running at full capacity, only one in 10 passengers would be able to travel while keeping to social distancing rules. Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Bus drivers' safety fears as lockdown eases LIVE: First day of eased lockdown across England Passenger numbers across the UK's major railway stations were up 10% up compared with the same day last week, BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said. Transport for London (TfL) said the number of passengers using the Tube from the start of service to 06:00 was up by 8.7% compared with the same period last week. As of 10:00 the number of Tube passengers was about 7.3% higher. However both figures are still a fraction of the normal numbers and Downing Street said TfL was ""not reporting significant increases"" on the London network compared to the last few days. One commutertold the BBC it was ""next to impossible"" to socially distance on the London Undergroundand most people were not wearing masks. In Blackpool, a hospital worker said the downstairs of her bus was ""packed"" during her morning commute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The updated lockdown regulations, which were presented to Parliament on Tuesday, also allow people to leave their homes to collect goods ordered from businesses or to travel to waste or recycling centres. Some outdoor sports can get under way again, with golf clubs and tennis courts expected to reopen to the public. Playgrounds, however, will stay shut. Restrictions have also been lifted on how far people can travel to get to the countryside, national parks and beaches in England. However, people have been warned to respect local communities, keep their distance from others and avoid busy areas. The government reiterated that staying overnight at a holiday or second home was not allowed. Those who break the rules will now face fines starting at Â£100 in England, and this will double on each further repeat offence up to Â£3,200. National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt said officers would ""continue to use common sense and discretion"".

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""In common with pretty much every economy...we're facing severe impact from the coronavirus"" The chancellor has said it is ""very likely"" the UK is in a ""significant recession"", as figures show the economy contracting at the fastest pace since the financial crisis. The economy shrankby 2% in the first three months,externalof 2020, as coronavirus forced the country into lockdown. Rishi Sunak told the BBC that just ""a few days of impact from the virus"" in March pushed the economy into decline. Economists expect an even bigger slump in the current quarter. Mr Sunak said: ""It is now very likely that the UK economy will face a significant recession this year, and we're already in the middle of that as we speak."" The first quarter drop was driven by a record fall in March output, and comes after the economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2019. How big is the UK's economy? Bank of England warns of sharpest recession on record UK furlough scheme extended by four months What is the UK's GDP? Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures showed the UK economy was ""already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect"". She added: ""With the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse."" While analysts expected a larger quarterly decline of 2.6% in the first three months of the year, it still represents the biggest contraction since the end of 2008, when the world's major economies sank into recession. To put the fall in context, Ms Gregory said that ""in just one month the economy has tumbled by as much as it did in the year and a half after the global financial crisis"". That crisis, sparked by over-zealous lending and heavily-indebted businesses and consumers, led governments to impose austerity measures lasting years. In 2008, the UK bailed out some major banks by taking multi-billion-pound stakes in them. But without access to state support, many companies folded. The lockdown measures announced by Mr Sunak mark a more radical intervention in the economy, with the state paying the wages of vast swathes of the workforce and guaranteeing loans to businesses. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there had been ""widespread"" declines across the services, manufacturing and construction sectors. This includes a record 1.9% fall in services output, which includes retailers, travel agents and hotels. Household spending shrank at the fastest pace in more than 11 years as restaurants and high street shops remained shut. The ONS said a rise in spending on food, alcohol and new TVs only partially offset the decline. On Wednesday, the government stepped in to underwrite trade credit insurance, to ensure the insurance market can continue to function. The insurance is taken out by companies to enable them to avoid the financial impact if the firms they do business with collapse before they have paid for goods or services. According to recent data from Morgan Stanley, insurers worldwide could have to pay up to $46bn (Â£37.6bn) in trade credit insurance claims due to the coronavirus lockdown. Insurers had warned the government that they might not be able to survive if they have to pay out huge claims due to struggling British businesses failing to pay their bills. The figures come assome of the lockdown restrictions are starting to be eased. Some employees in England who cannot work from home are now being encouraged to return to their workplaces. Sectors ""allowed to be open, should be open"", the government says. These include food production, construction and manufacturing. Like so many companies, Spinder could not operate in a world of social distancing - but the founder has re-invented the business. Formed more than three years ago by Rich Allsop, Spinder is a London-based gym and exercise class aimed at the gay community. ""Things changed very quickly in mid-March,"" he says. ""The full lockdown hit, and Spinder in its pure form had to end. I refused to give in. I refused to let my business and livelihood die and our wonderful community disperse."" Within 24 hours he re-imagined what Spinder classes could be in an online world, and SpinderCast was born. ""I was pleased to see that a lot of the regulars have come with me. Now that we are online, our classes are even more accessible, attracting members from all over the UK and as far away as Cape Town."" He's no plan to give up on the gym studio itself, ""as everyone keeps telling me how they can't wait to get back"". But Mr Allsop is worried about the financial impact of recession on customers. ""We'll see how we can pull together to help them continue to attend our classes,"" says. Still, the lockdown crisis hasn't ended his business, but created a successful offshoot. ""The strength and support of Spinder's community and the Spinder brand means we will survive,"" he says. In other developments,estate agents in England can now reopen, viewings can take place and removal firms and conveyancers can re-start operations, so long as social-distancing and workplace safety rules are followed. On Tuesday, Mr Sunakannounced an extension of the furlough schemesubsidising wages to the end of October. Mr Sunak said Wednesday's GDP data underlined why the government had taken ""unprecedented action"" to support jobs, incomes and livelihoods"" at a time of severe disruption.

France and Italy saw much bigger contractions of 5.8% and 4.7% respectively in the first quarter, where lockdowns were imposed up to two weeks earlier. However, analysts expect a double-digit drop in UK gross domestic product (GDP) in the coming quarter. The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is likely tosuffer its sharpest recession on record this year, even if the lockdown is completely lifted by the end of September. While the Bank said the economy could shrink by 14% in 2020, it expects the downturn to be short and sharp, with growth of 15% predicted in 2021. The decline is also expected to be less prolonged than during the financial crisis, when the economy kept shrinking for more than a year. The economy also took five years to get back to the size it was before the meltdown. The Bank of England expects the UK to rebound more quickly this time, returning to its pre-crisis size within two years. Today's figure shows that the UK economy has already undeniably entered recession, although that will not be officially confirmed until August. In and of itself the loss of 2% of the value of the economy in one quarter is very rare, it is one of the five worst three month periods since modern records began in 1955. But this was the consequence of an already stagnant economy hit by just over a week of official shutdown at the end of March. That led to a record monthly fall in the economy of 6%, about the same fall seen over a much longer period in the last recession in 2008. It means that the current second quarter between April and June is set to see truly incredible record falls in excess of of 20 to 30% - perhaps a quarter of the whole economy. The chancellor said that it was too early to speculate on the shape of any rebound, but fears are growing that it can no longer be presumed as rapid. And as welcome as the unprecedented support has been, the government is likely to come under pressure from industry over further support, delaying travel quarantines, and the need for a post Brexit trade deal. The global economic impact of the crisis was underlined on Wednesday in a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), It warned that world trade in goods is set to slump at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009, with estimates becoming increasingly gloomy over the past weeks. Trade is seen down 3% in the first quarter from the final three months of 2019 and by a further 26.9% in the second quarter, UNCTAD said. ""There were falls of a similar magnitude in 2009 during the global financial crisis, although the decline was not as steep as in 2020. At that time, global trade rebounded just as quickly, in line with global economic recovery,"" UNCTAD said. No, we're not, although we can be pretty sure that the lockdown has been bad for the economy overall. This is the first estimate of the change in the value of stuff produced by the UK economy, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), between January and March. The first estimate is published pretty soon after the end of the period it is measuring, and it tends to rely on more reliable data for the first couple of months of the quarter-year, and less on what happened in the third month. That's a problem for this set of figures, because the period we are most interested in is the last week in March, when lockdown had started. Also, a lot of the data behind these figures comes from surveys, and the ONS says that as a result of the coronavirus measures, fewer companies responded to its surveys. And the ONS is facing just the same challenges when doing its work as any other business. It warns that this estimate is ""subject to more uncertainty than usual"".

"This video can not be played The BBC's political editor asks Rishi Sunak if the UK is looking at a recession due to the coronavirus outbreak. The UK scheme to pay wages of workers on leave because of coronavirus will be extended to October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. Mr Sunak confirmed that employees will continue to receive 80% of their monthly wages up to Â£2,500. But he said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August. A quarter of the workforce, some 7.5 million people, are now covered by the scheme, which has cost Â£14bn a month. The chancellor said that from August, the scheme would continue for all sectors and regions of the country but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work. Employers currently using the scheme will then be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. Mr Sunak will attempt slowly to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the subsidy scheme, but full details are still to be worked out. However, sources have told the BBC the Treasury stills expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October. Later on Tuesday,in an interview with the BBC, Mr Sunak said the number of job losses ""breaks my heart"", adding: ""That's why I'm working night and day to limit the amount of job losses."" Mr Sunak told the Commons said: ""I'm extending the scheme because I won't give up on the people who rely on it. ""Our message today is simple: we stood behind Britain's workers and businesses as we came into this crisis, and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side."" There has been growing concern about the cost of the scheme, and last week Mr Sunak said it could not continue in its current form. However, he was under pressure to announce changes soon to avoid a so-called ""cliff edge"" in which employers begin mass redundancies. Any company seeking to cut more than 100 jobs must run a 45-day consultation, meaning 18 May was the last date employers could start this process before the furlough scheme ended in June. The chancellor rejected suggestions some people might get ""addicted"" to furlough if it was extended. ""Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme,"" the chancellor said. ""People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, it's not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home."" Hard decisions over the economy loom What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Why payday is different during the crisis PM 'not expecting' flood of people back to work Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said broadly welcomed the changes, saying ""at least we are moving in the right direction"". But she said the ""big elephant in the room"" is over what the government's employer contribution will involve, adding that the ""critical point is that any changes to the scheme must not result in any spike in unemployment"". Despite the extension of the furlough scheme, Patrick Langmaid said it's still unlikely to stop him making people redundant from his Mother Ivey's Bay holiday park, at Padstow. He has furloughed seven staff and has nine still working. The handful of staff he would usually employ seasonally he has let go. ""There is no income - and huge costs,"" he says. ""We are very worried about how we, as employers, are going to make contributions through August, September and October [when employers will be expected to share the costs of the scheme]"", he said. ""I am very, very worried about how I am going to cope in the winter. ""I've already started briefing my team that there will have to be redundancies,"" he says. He reckons four or five jobs may have to go, depending how long the lockdown lasts. Dealing with redundancy is ""horrible"", he says, adding: ""It is really not a nice time to be running a business."" Businesses largely welcomed the extension, with business group the British Chambers of Commerce saying the move would bring ""significant relief"" to employers and workers, And Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturing group Make UK, said it would avoid ""a looming cliff edge triggering significant redundancies for many companies and recognises the need for greater flexibility as the economy fires up."" However, he warned that there was no ""silver bullet"" and that both government and industry would have to be flexible. There was also support from the TUC, with general secretary Frances O'Grady saying the extension ""will be a big relief for millions"". But she added: ""As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job."" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies economic think tank, estimates the scheme will have cost nearly Â£100bn by October. It is thought that about 935,000 businesses signed up for the scheme in total. Reports of the demise of the furlough scheme have been somewhat exaggerated. It was never going to be scrapped, especially after the Bank of England stressed the scheme's importance for economic recovery. Over a quarter of all jobs - 27%, 7.5 million in total - are now paid for by the taxpayer, potentially for eight months. After that, the level of subsidy from taxpayer will be lowered, with employers expected to pay a contribution. By August, the scheme could start to look quite similar to longer standing wage subsidy schemes seen in continental Europe. The cost of the scheme to date is already over Â£10bn. This extension will be tens of billions more, but difficult to put a precise number on this given the lack of detail on the ""employer contribution"". Expensive yes. But what is also costly is letting unemployment sky rocket, as, without the extension, many businesses would have begun 45-day redundancy consultations this week. The question now is how many businesses still see this as a bridge to some sort of normality where furloughed staff can be phased back into their old jobs. Unfortunately some in industries which will not return to normal have already started to fire staff. This announcement buys most workers more time. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"Some passengers at Canning Town underground station in east London wore masks for their commute on Wednesday morning Some people in England who cannot work from home are returning to their workplaces today, as the government begins easing some lockdown measures. The government urged people to avoid public transport if possible. But some commuters said Tube trains and buses were still too busy to observe social distancing rules. Meanwhile,new guidance issued by the College of Policing,externalsaid officers had ""no powers to enforce two-metre distancing"" in England. Under the new rules in England, people can now spend more time outside and move house. Garden centres can reopen and sports that are physically distanced - such as golf - are now permitted. Two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings, such as parks, as long as they stay more than 2m apart. However, government guidance on maintaining a 2m distance, avoiding public transport and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces is ""not enforceable"" by officers in England, according to the fresh guidelines from the College of Policing. All you need to know about new lockdown measures Who am I allowed to meet now? What can the police fine you for doing? Why the lockdown ended in garden centres first It follows a speech by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday in which heunveiled a ""conditional plan"" aimed at reopening society. This has led to a divergence in lockdown rules between the UK government and the devolved administrations, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland keeping stricter measures in place and retaining the message to stay at home. It comes as figures from the Office for National Statisticsshowed the UK economy shrank at the fastest pace since the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2020. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC it was ""very likely"" the UK would face a ""significant recession"" as a result of the pandemic. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UKhas reached 33,186,,externala rise of 494 on the previous day. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick led the Downing Street daily briefing and was joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries. The lockdown has brought immense challenges for the police service. Although crime has plummeted and police sickness rates have been far lower than expected, officers have found themselves caught in the middle of a web of hastily-drawn up regulations and guidelines. The latest police guidance for England suggests their job won't be any easier as it makes clear they can only enforce the law - not government advice. That means, for example, you can be stopped or fined if you go on an overnight trip or meet up with two or more people from outside your home - because that's the law. But officers can't prevent you from standing close to a stranger or travelling by train without a face mask on - because two-metre distancing and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces are guidance. In England, employers have been issued withguidelines on keeping workplaces as safe as possible,external, including staggering shifts and frequent cleaning. Those who flout the rules could face criminal proceedings, the Health and Safety Executive watchdog has warned. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the new guidelines for employers were ""a step in the right direction"" but ""the real test will be delivery"". She said employers should publish a risk assessment and if workers had any concerns they could contact the Health and Safety Executive hotline. ""It's really important to remember that workers do have that right in law not to work if it would put them in imminent danger,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Some commuters were not able to maintain a 2m distance on a Victoria Line Tube into central London By contrast, one commuter pictured this almost-deserted Tyne and Wear Metro carriage in Newcastle There was some traffic on the M1 in Northamptonshire on Wednesday morning York Tennis Club opened for players on Wednesday after restrictions were eased Asked how it was possible for people to maintain social distancing on public transport as more people returned to work, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government was urging people to cycle and walk where possible. ""The absolute key here is for anybody who can to make alternative arrangements for travel,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He added that, even if the public transport network was running at full capacity, only one in 10 passengers would be able to travel while keeping to social distancing rules. Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport? Bus drivers' safety fears as lockdown eases LIVE: First day of eased lockdown across England Passenger numbers across the UK's major railway stations were up 10% up compared with the same day last week, BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said. Transport for London (TfL) said the number of passengers using the Tube from the start of service to 06:00 was up by 8.7% compared with the same period last week. As of 10:00 the number of Tube passengers was about 7.3% higher. However both figures are still a fraction of the normal numbers and Downing Street said TfL was ""not reporting significant increases"" on the London network compared to the last few days. One commutertold the BBC it was ""next to impossible"" to socially distance on the London Undergroundand most people were not wearing masks. In Blackpool, a hospital worker said the downstairs of her bus was ""packed"" during her morning commute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Asked about reports of busy rush hour trains and buses during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want to see crowding on public transport in our capital or anywhere else."" He said the government was ""working very actively"" with TfL to increase capacity and lay on more Tube trains when necessary. ""We also want to see proper marshalling at stations to prevent crowding of trains,"" he added. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

The updated lockdown regulations, which were presented to Parliament on Tuesday, also allow people to leave their homes to collect goods ordered from businesses or to travel to waste or recycling centres. Some outdoor sports can get under way again, with golf clubs and tennis courts expected to reopen to the public. Playgrounds, however, will stay shut. Restrictions have also been lifted on how far people can travel to get to the countryside, national parks and beaches in England. However, people have been warned to respect local communities, keep their distance from others and avoid busy areas. The government reiterated that staying overnight at a holiday or second home was not allowed. Those who break the rules will now face fines starting at Â£100 in England, and this will double on each further repeat offence up to Â£3,200. National Police Chiefs' Council chairman Martin Hewitt said officers would ""continue to use common sense and discretion"". He told BBC Breakfast police would be ""encouraging"" people to go home if they were not out for a ""legitimate reason"" and enforcement and fines would be used ""only as a last resort"".

"Rihanna is now the richest woman in music Rihanna has made her debut appearance on The Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated fortune of Â£468 million. The Bajan pop star, who now resides in London, overtakes Sirs Elton John and Mick Jagger to claim third place on the list of Britain's richest musicians. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney are joint firston the list,external, with fortunes of Â£800m apiece. Rihanna's earnings are largely due to the Fenty Beauty cosmetics brand, where her reported 15% stake is worth Â£351m. ""She somewhat caught us by surprise,"" says Robert Watts, who compiles The Sunday Times' annual list. ""Very few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer. Now she's well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK,"" he tells the BBC. Rihanna, who turned 32 in February, is a youthful exception amongst Britain's richest musicians, most of whom found fame in the 1960s and 70s. Amongst the top 40 highest-earners, only Ed Sheeran and Adele are younger, with fortunes of Â£200m and Â£150m respectively. Further down the list, there are new entries for the next generation of pop stars, with Dua Lipa, 24, and George Ezra, 26, each said to be worth Â£16m. Theatre impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber, 72, is the only star on the list to see his valuation fall, with Watts calculating that the Covid-19 shutdown of theatres in the West End and Broadway has already wiped Â£20m off his fortune. Sir Paul, by contrast, receives a Â£50m boost to his finances, thanks to a lucrative world tour and his first children's book Hey Grandude!, which topped the New York Times' best-seller list last year. Sir Elton's farewell tour also added Â£40m to his fortune, putting him in fourth place; while Rolling Stone Sir Mick comes fifth with Â£285m. Ed Sheeran topped the young musicians (aged 30 or under) list, adding Â£40m to his overall wealth after completing a 255-date world tour last August. Harry Styles took second place, with a fortune of Â£63m. All five members of One Direction appear on the list, with Harry Styles just above his bandmate Niall Horan Eagle-eyed readers might spot that U2 have dropped off the Sunday Times' rankings entirely, despite taking third place last year with earnings of Â£583m. Their absence is solely due to coronavirus - as the pandemic has delayed the publication of the paper's Irish Rich List. When those figures are revealed later this year, the band is likely to knock Rihanna down to fourth place. Nonetheless, Watts says that Rihanna's presence is indicative of a ""seismic change"" in the make-up of the main Rich List which, since 1989, had been identifying the 1,000 wealthiest individuals or families living in the UK. ""The days when it was dominated by inherited wealth, the landed gentry and mass of largely white, middle-aged and elderly men, are changing,"" says Watts. ""For example, we've seen a big rise in the number of Asian entrepreneurs and in the number of self-made people. ""Rihanna is, I think, a very good example of someone who's come from a pretty tough upbringing in Barbados and who has a hunger and a determination to work, work work... which, I think, is one of her songs, isn't it?"" (It is,external). Rihanna's earnings from beauty and fashion eclipse those from her music career Although Rihanna made her name in music, she hasn't released an album since 2016's Anti, instead concentrating on her fashion empire. Fenty Beauty launched in September 2017, and was designed to cater to a wider range of skin types and tones than typical cosmetic brands. Thanks to the star's endorsement, and her 82 million Instagram followers, it was an immediate success, racking up sales of Â£78m in its first few weeks. The company is now valued at $3bn (Â£2.4bn). Rihanna also has a lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, and continues to receive royalties from hit songs like SOS, Umbrella and Only Girl In The World. Her Â£468m fortune makes her the richest female musician not just in the UK, but the world - ahead of Madonna (Â£462m), Celine Dion (Â£365m) and BeyoncÃ© (Â£325m). Watts notes that musicians' wealth ""held up better than many other ultra-high net worth individuals"" over the last 12 months, but says the impact of cancelled tours could impact next year's list. ""Their fortunes have held up a little better this year because they're coming off the back of big tours and their valuation is not affected by a plunging stock market,"" he says. ""But next year I would expect, for a lot of these musicians, their wealth to flatline - and some of them may even have to dip into their reserves.""

"People in the most-deprived areas of Scotland are 2.3 times more likely to die with Covid-19 than those in the least deprived areas, new data reveals National Records of Scotland (NRS) release weekly figures of Covid-related deaths showing that 3,213 people in Scotland lost their lives to the virus The total number will be higher as the data does not include deaths registered since 10 May Local firms in Scotland are on a ""knife-edge"" because of the coronavirus restrictions, say Federation of Small Businesses MSPs are to consider emergency legislation to allow students to end accommodation contracts amid pandemic Some lockdown restrictions have been eased in England BBC Scotland News A daily update on the number of coronavirus cases in Scotland and where the cases are. Across the world, people are being asked to wear face coverings to help stop coronavirus from spreading.

David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter BBC Scotland's The Nine has seen NHS guidance sent to care homes that
advises staff âdo not meet criteria for testingâ even if they show symptoms of
coronavirus. The document, sent to care homes in Fife, says that if the
staff member works in a team big enough to âabsorb the workloadâ they should
isolate for 14 days instead. But Scottish government guidance states âall symptomatic key
workersâ can be tested. A Scottish government spokesperson told us âall residents
and staff will be offered testing, whether they are symptomatic or not, in
homes where there has been a confirmed caseâ. For the final question, Colin asked Ms Hyslop when garden centres will open given they have now done so in England and Wales. The economy secretary said that she expected outdoor activity to be ""much easier"" given the examples set in other countries. She highlighted the R number - the virus infection rate - is different in Scotland and that the first case arrived in Scotland much later than in London. She said: ""The public health interest means that Scotland has to make its own decisions in terms of what we do. ""I do think because garden centres work outside means we can open them first, but that's in phasing discussions."" Paul's firm has a head office in Scotland but employees in England - he asked should he develop different policies for each office. Fiona Hyslop said that the UK government framework was helpful ""in principal"" for different types of workplaces but all businesses should refer to devolved administrations for issues like the timing of reopening. She said: ""I want Scotland to be known as safe. I think it's possible to do what many companies do working over the world adapting policies to different places."" David asked the economy secretary how we handle practicalities such as training new staff for when businesses reopen. Fiona Hyslop told BBC Scotland that businesses would need to adapt to training staff online and support different types of training, while work was being done to bring together colleges and workplaces. She said there is a ""need to share best practice and experience"", and that she expected ""far more collaboration between businesses than competition"" because it is in ""everyone's interest to stimulate demand"". Ms Hyslop added the furlough scheme would be useful in enabling firms to conduct training, allow part time working and carry out phased returns. She said the Scottish government was working with the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive to make sure there was ""institutional capability"" to give advice to employers and workers on the matter. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop has been taking questions from viewers around Scotland, during Coronavirus: Scotland's Response, on BBC One Scotland. The first question was from Mark who wants to know how Scotland plans to help businesses going forward. Ms Hyslop highlighted the Scottish government's four-point economic plan, as well as ""big uptake"" on grants for which letters are being issued this week. She said the country would have to ""rethink and re-emerge into a world where digital will be more prevalent"", as well as making sure jobs and training opportunities exist. Guidance on how different industries can operate a phased return in a ""planned, orderly"" fashion will be issued, she said, adding the government is attempting to understand to issues such as transport and childcare for working parents. Suzi asked what plans would be in place to prevent the tourism industry from collapsing. Ms Hyslop said the extension of the furlough scheme announced yesterday was ""welcome"" and said she had argued that the events sector would need a ""longer tail"" in terms of the support it requires.

Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter The owner of one of the oldest cinemas in Scotland says he hopes to be able to reopen its doors in mid-July. The coronavirus lockdown forced the family-run Dominion Cinema in Edinburgh to close for only the second time in its 82-year history.  Director Alastair Cameron said they had ""battened down the hatches"" to make sure the business survived. But he said everything had now been put in place to enable the cinema to open safely when the time came. ""We have thought out all the social distancing logistics and drawn up all the plans,"" he said.

The Scottish Contemporary Art Network (Scan) found that seven in 10 organisations said they are likely to cancel programmes or projects. A total of 29% of individual respondents to the survey said they had lost 100% of their income last month. Some 76% of respondents â both individuals and organisations â had lost income in April, by an average of 53%.

The Scottish government is being urged to follow England in easing lockdown for the housing and leisure sectors. Homes for Scotland (HFS) and the SGA Fishing Group have both written to Holyrood ministers asking for restrictions around their industries to be lifted, following changes south of the border. ""Our industry contributes significantly to Scotlandâs social and economic wellbeing and we are ready and willing to reopen safely with additional measures in place to help protect our employees and customers, while also supporting the struggling economy,"" said HFS chief executive Nicola Barclay. Meanwhile, the SGA Fishing Group wants Scotland's rivers to be accessible again, saying that salmon fishing brings Â£135m to the nation's economy. ""Angling is relatively solitary,"" said member Robert White. ""It has known physical and mental health benefits. It would also allow some fisheries to get at least some income in, too.""

Housing minister Robert Jenrick is asked what will happen to the government's job retention or furlough scheme for workers in Scotland if it remains in effective lockdown longer than the rest of the UK. Could the Treasury step in to pay for the scheme if the Scottish government's borrowing powers are too stretched? Jenrick says it is a UK-wide scheme and the government will have regard to how it is working in all parts of the UK, adding that it has recently been extended to October.

"Sales are at levels normally seen at Christmas Some 373,000 property sales are on hold owing to the coronavirus lockdown, analysis of the housing market in UK cities suggests. The value of held sales totals a collective Â£82bn, researchers at property portal Zoopla have estimated. Agreed sales were running at a tenth of the normal level for the time of year, and were akin to the activity seen in late December, they said. Spring is usually a busy time for the housing and mortgage markets. It is known in the trade as the ""spring bounce"". However, the stay-at-home message from the government has meant that people are only moving to new homes in rare circumstances, such as entering a vacant property. Government advice is for sellers and buyers to come toan amicable arrangementover delaying a moving date. Banks to allow customers to defer mortgage payments Demand from renters slumps amid lockdown Lenders kick-start mortgage deals Zoopla researchers said the rate of sales falling through peaked on 23 March - the day the UK lockdown began. It added that demand for housing was down 60% on levels recorded at the start of March. However, the picture varied across UK cities, with Cardiff recording an 80% drop in demand from buyers, and Newcastle a 48% fall. The housing market could take some time to recover Zoopla said people had been browsing for homes less on the internet, but this had recovered slightly in the last couple of weeks, perhaps in response to the fact people are living and working from home and yearning for more room on the domestic front. ""Some may feel the urge to move and find more space or consider the potential for remote working,"" said Richard Donnell, director of research and insight at Zoopla. ""This could boost activity in the second half of 2020, but this all depends upon how much the economy is impacted over the rest of the year and the impact on levels of unemployment."" Overall, Zoopla expects the number of completed sales across the UK this year to be around half that seen in 2019. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Some big lenders have begun reopening their doors to British borrowers, making it easier to get a home loan. At the start of the coronavirus lockdown, several scrapped deals or only offered loans to those with large deposits. But this week Nationwide, Halifax, Virgin and Santander all made it easier for people to qualify for a loan. ""Lenders are adapting and innovating,"" said broker Mark Harris of SPF Private Clients. Nationwide resumed loans at 85% loan-to-value (LTV) on Wednesday, while Halifax raised its LTV level from 80% to 85%. Meanwhile, this week Virgin Money began offering purchase mortgages again, as Santander increased its maximum loan size - from Â£300,000 to Â£500,000 - and cut fees on its residential mortgages. At the start of the lockdown, lenders were forced to reassess their deals in the light of the new restrictions. For instance, Nationwide, the UK's biggest building society, stopped offering deals above 75% loan-to-value to new customers at the end of March to ""focus on supporting existing mortgage members, while continuing to process ongoing applications"". ""Lenders had to work out how they were going to continue trading while their mortgage processing centres were being scaled back and staff were working from home,"" explained Aaron Strutt, product director at Trinity Financial. ""As the general public is getting used to life under extended lockdown, so too are lenders,"" said Chris Sykes, mortgage consultant at broker Private Finance. Lenders returning this last week ""is great news for the market and for borrowers who will have increased choice going forward,"" he added. ""It also means the post-lockdown recovery should be swifter when some semblance of normality returns."" Coronavirus: UK mortgage market goes into partial lockdown Coronavirus: One in nine homeowners takes mortgage holiday Coronavirus: Property sales down 70% since lockdown, says Zoopla According to SPF's chief executive Mark Harris, lenders have found ways to deal with some of the problems and ""there is a willingness to lend"". ""Problems have mostly centred around staff resources, handling the surge in mortgage payment holidays and those staff self-isolating who have children and no childcare,"" he said. Lenders have been changing the way they operate to cope with the lockdown and are now much more reliant on their IT systems, pointed out Mr Strutt. One of the biggest problems under lockdown has been valuations, as properties can't be visited by lenders' staff to be inspected. ""Lenders are using system-generated valuations to get property purchases and remortgages agreed,"" he said. These are known in the industry as ""drive-by valuations"". Sorting out the problems and gaining confidence in the use of these valuations has encouraged lenders to reopen temporarily-closed doors. ""As the UK's second largest mortgage lender, it is right that we still play an active role in the market, while maintaining the levels of service expected of us, during what are unprecedented and evolving times,"" said Henry Jordan, director of mortgages at Nationwide. Nationwide has raised its loan-to-value level to 85% ""We are still getting calls from people asking if it is possible to get a mortgage,"" said Mr Strutt. He said borrowers typically need a deposit of at least 10% to qualify and lenders will want to know if people's income has reduced as a result of the coronavirus. But that doesn't mean you will be turned down. ""There is a little more caution in the underwriting process, but even if a borrower is furloughed, the lender will often take their full income into account if it can be proven that the employer is topping up the salary,"" said Mr Harris. He added: ""NHS workers are being prioritised on remortgages to make sure they go through smoothly and lessen any potential stress."" Fixed rates continue to be at all-time lows, while the base rate is almost zero, so there continue to be plenty of good deals on offer, he pointed out. ""After three weeks of product availability falling, borrowers looking to purchase or remortgage will have an increased number of options open to them,"" said Mr Harris.

"Tenants are staying put amid the coronavirus lockdown, but analysis suggests they will start moving again soon after restrictions are lifted. Renting from a private landlord gives some flexibility in normal times, but restrictions have made viewings and moving family belongings impossible. Rental demand is 42% down since the start of March, according to research by property portal Zoopla. Demand from buyers fell faster and could face a longer-term slowdown. Buyersdeserted the housing marketfor obvious reasons just before and after the introduction of virus restrictions, which began on 23 March. This led to a 70% drop in buyer demand over the course of a few weeks. There was an immediate 57% drop in demand from renters too, according to Zoopla research. There has been a rebound since the start of April. However, overall, its research suggests rental demand is still 42% lower now than at the start of March. You can't just stop paying rent, tenants told Students angry at empty rooms rent charge The long-term impact of the financial crisis, coupled with the coronavirus outbreak, may see a slowdown in demand in the housing market as a whole if jobs and incomes continue to be affected. However, Zoopla suggested that ""some tenants are already mapping out their next move"". ""The flexibility of the rental market is one of the key factors which has allowed activity to bounce back more quickly than other parts of the property market,"" said âGrÃ¡inne Gilmore, head of research at Zooplaâ. The latter half of the year is generally the busier time for rental activity, which could coincide with looser virus-related restrictions. However, even after a rebound, Zoopla estimates that the number of moves among tenants would be 25% lower in 2020 than last year. Ms Gilmore added that rents were likely to continue to get more expensive, but only slightly, over the course of the year. Tenants have been urged to continue paying their rent during the current crisis, unless they have come to an agreement with their landlord to defer payment after a sudden drop or disappearance of income. Landlords themselves can request a mortgage holiday from their lender. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"The government has set out plans to restart England's housing market, which has been in deep freeze since the coronavirus lockdown. Estate agents can now open, viewings can be carried out and removal firms and conveyancers can restart operations. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the changes must be carried out under social distancing and safety rules. It is estimated there are 450,000 buyers and renters with plans on hold. ""Our clear plan will enable people to move home safely, covering each aspect of the sales and letting process, from viewings to removals,"" Mr Jenrick said. ""This critical industry can now safely move forward, and those waiting patiently to move can now do so."" Meanwhile, the property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remain shut. Home viewings are not permitted under lockdown regulations and their land registries are either running a reduced service or are not registering transactions. Coronavirus: House moves and viewings to resume in England Coronavirus: Property sales worth Â£82bn 'on hold' amid lockdown Where can I afford to live? Alistair Elliott, chairman and senior partner at estate agents Knight Frank, told the BBC's Today programme the measures were ""a major first step"". ""We believe the public will have confidence to re-engage with the housing market,"" he said. Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of real estate consultants Garrington Property Finders, said: ""Few things are more likely to make people want to move than being cooped up in the same four walls for weeks on end, and property portals have seen traffic increase by up to a fifth."" This announcement by the government,externalwill test the housing sector's hope, and belief, that a wave of pent-up demand amongst buyers and renters is ready to be released. Yet, the reality is that many people's finances are now less secure than they were just a few months ago when they were preparing to move. Expect a lot more haggling over price from both sides if they have yet to have formally agreed what they will pay or accept, especially if getting a mortgage is harder. Estate agent Savills has already suggested that people who still have money to look for somewhere new, may now be rethinking their priorities. A spare room and good Wi-Fi may suddenly have become more appealing when working from home, and a large garden may be even more of a golden ticket for anyone with children. Housing Secretary Mr Jenrick said guidance from Public Health England must continue to be followed. For example, anyone advised to self-isolate should continue to do so and not move home. The move has raised questions over how social distancing would work during the viewing process to ensure people remain safe, particularly when tenants are still at home. Miles Shipside, from property portal Rightmove, said he expected digital viewings to remain popular. Property website Zoopla previously estimated that about 373,000 property sales had been put on hold during lockdown - with a total value of Â£82bn. Agreed sales were running at a 10th of the normal level for the time of year, and were akin to the activity seen in late December, it said. Spring is usually a busy time for the housing and mortgage markets. Buyers deserted the housing marketfor obvious reasons just before and after the introduction of virus restrictions, which began on 23 March.

Meanwhile, rental demand is 42% down since the start of March, according to Zoopla. The government has also outlined other measures to get the house building sector moving, including: Allowing builders to agree more flexible working hours with their local council, such as staggering arrival times to ease pressure on public transport Enabling local councils and developers to publicise planning applications through social media, instead of having to rely on posters and leaflets Providing support for smaller developers by allowing them to defer payments to local councils to ease cash flow The new guidance includes the permission for trades people to operate in homes, providing they follow social distancing advice. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said:  ""A resumption of work will play a major part in helping the economy recover, as well as delivering the homes the country needs.

In the Amish world, young people in their teens begin to move from the domestic realm and their families to the sphere outside of the home by spending time on the weekends with people their age. They go to parties, gatherings that are part of a tradition known as ""rumspringa"", which translates roughly as ""running around"". At some point the young people decide whether to join the church in a formal manner. If so, they are baptized and become adult members of the Amish community. With the advent of social distancing, the young people have cut back on their outings, however, and slowed down the rites of rumspringa. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Public Health England (PHE) says an antibody test for coronavirus has been evaluated and is a ""very positive development"". The product made by the drug company Roche was assessed by PHE at its Porton Down laboratories last week. Sources say it is the first such test to offer serious potential. Such a test looks for antibodies in the bloodstream to see whether an individual has in the past had the virus and has gained immunity. It is understood talks are now underway between Roche and the Department of Health over possible supply to the NHS. Previous antibody tests have proved unreliable according to health officials. Some are still being assessed.

The South American nation has seen the price of food increase by 80% and a shortage of fuel since the lockdown. Teacher Sonia Pantes says sometimes she does not eat so her young daughter can. Rafael Barrios Armas, a surgeon who treats cancer patients, says he has queued overnight for fuel, sometimes for almost 13 hours, and still not been able to fill up his car. Lin-Manuel Miranda created the hit Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical Hamilton, has been recruited to join an organisation tasked with figuring out how to revive New York City's tourist trade. The Coalition for NYC Hospitality and Tourism Recovery has been established by NYC & Company, New York City's marketing organization and convention and visitors bureau, to figure out a plan to get tourists to come to the city when it eventually reopens. Miranda is known for creating hits like Hamilton and In The Heights, both set in New York, as well as writing the music for Disney's Moana. ""Together, we will create a next act for our city,"" he said. ""After this intermission, we will be ready to welcome the world back with open arms, so people can fall in love with New York over and over again."" Update 20 May: This post has been updated to clarify that the coalition was formed by NYC & Company Countries around the world are starting to ease the restrictions imposed because of the virus More now on the warnings from the World Health Organization emergencies expert Mike Ryan, who said Covid-19 ""may never go away"" - we had more on that a bit earlier. While much of the world hopes the worst of the virus has passed, Ryan said the global community needed to brace itself for a long battle. ""I think it's important we're realistic and I don't think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear,"" he said. ""I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be."" If a vaccine is found, implementing globally would require a ""massive effort"", he added. As many countries start easing lockdown measures, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""The trajectory is in our hands, and itâs everybody's business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic."" For many firms, coronavirus has been one of the toughest problems they have ever faced. But, stuck at home, thousands of young people have been encouraged to started their own businesses during lockdown. Radio 4 Money Box Live talked to the new entrepreneurs about the successes and challenges they encountered along the way. Listen back to the episode here. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington Will you tip more? When cleaner JosÃ© Zaragoza finished his job at a home, he was surprised to find he had received a $100 tip on Venmo. ""I was like 'hey you made a mistake' - you sent an extra zero,"" but the customer told him he had given him a large tip ""to help you and your family in these tough times."" There have been similar reports of generous tipping - sometimes extremely generous - across the US, as states start to reopen. In Austin, Texas, one restaurant reopened on 30 April - and founda customer left $1,300 to staff,externalas a ""welcome back"" tip. Some delivery apps have also noticed an increase in tips since the pandemic began. Is the coronavirus making us more generous?

BBC Panorama has been filming the distressing story of one funeral director in England who has taken extraordinary measures to provide storage for hundreds of bodies. Dean Floyd, of Floyd & Son in Essex, has bought refrigerated containers and converted most of his premises to take care of the dead. Andrew HardingBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa is starting to ease its lockdown South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases in Africa (11,350), and one of the world's strictest lockdowns. It is starting to ease restrictions, but some of the new rules are being queried -  particularly those around what clothes shops can and cannot sell. The new regulations are impressively detailed: shoes may now be sold - but not if they are opened toed. T-shirts are okay - but only if advertised and sold as undergarments. The same goes for sleeveless knitted topsâ¦ and so on. There is a logic to all this. Winter is coming here - hence the green light for the sale of winter clothes. But Dean MacPherson from the opposition Democratic Alliance is unimpressed. He called the regulations ""quite frankly ridiculous and mad. More likely the sort of rules found in the Soviet Union and East Germany"". The crisis has exposed deep rifts in government - between ministers more inclined to authoritarian solutions, including an ongoing ban on all alcohol and cigarette sales, and those who now believe South Africans should be trusted with more individual freedoms - including the right to buy sandals and exposed knitwear. Buzzfeed set up a London office in 2013 Online media giantBuzzfeed is to close its UK and Australian news operations. The US company, which set up its London office in 2013, said the decision had been made ""both for economic and strategic reasons"". The move comes as the media industry is facing an advertising downturn caused by the pandemic. Buzzfeed said it would be focusing on news that ""hits big in the United States during this difficult period"". In the UK, some staff will stay on to cover social news, celebrity and investigations for US readers, but it is thought about 10 jobs are affected. BBC News media editor Amol Rajan said the affected UK staff had been furloughed. Some pupils may return to school on 1 June Plans to reopen primary schools in England do not have adequate safety measures and need to be halted,warns an alliance of school teachers' unions. A joint education union statement called on the government to ""step back"" from a 1 June start date and said ""classrooms of four and five-year olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread"". In the House of Commons, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against ""scaremongering"" over safety, although his department's chief scientific adviser cast doubt on suggestions the virus spreads less among children. ""Sometimes scaremongering, making people fear, is really unfair and not a welcome pressure to be placed on families, children and teachers alike,"" Williamson told MPs. Santiago has experienced a worrying spike in new infections The Chilean government is to impose a total lockdown across the capital, Santiago, following a spike in the number of coronavirus infections. A total of 2,260 new infections and 12 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The current death toll is about 350. The new restrictions will affect eight million people and come into effect on Friday evening. Chile had limited lockdown measures to areas with higher rates of infection. The authorities were considering partially reopening the economy, but the country has now reported a 60% rise in the number of daily cases. A few minutes ago we told you about the World Health Organization's warning that Covid-19 ""may never go away"". As we know, a vaccine would provide some protection, by training people's immune systems to fight the virus. But how easy is it to create a vaccine and when could we expect one to be ready? Our health correspondent Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How close are we to getting a vaccine? London's transport network needs to reach a deal with the government this week because of financial problems, said the deputy mayor for transport. Speaking to Eddie Nestorâs Drivetime show on BBC Radio London, Heidi Alexander said City Hall was in ""very live negotiations"" with the government and hoped to have a deal soon. Alexander denied a suggestion that Transport for London (TfL) only had ""24 to 48 hours worth of money left"". But, when asked if the Tube would be operating next week, she replied: ""I'm sure TfL will be running this time next week. Let's hope by the end of this week we have a deal on the table with the government so that money is there."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At least nine women and girls have been killed in domestic homicides in Canada since the pandemic, a new report says. There is no federal database, but the Battered Womenâs Support Services, a non-profit, has been tracking them and tallied the numbers,which were confirmed by the Globe and Mail newspaper.,external It said three of the men involved also killed themselves. On average one woman is killed by a domestic partner ever six days in Canada. The government says some parts of the country have seen a 20-30% increase in rates of gender-based violence and domestic violence. The government has provided an additional $28m (Â£23.2m) to help address domestic violence during Covid-19. Alison RobertsLisbon For the first time in more than a century, the Catholic shrine at FÃ¡tima in Portugal has held a pilgrimage without pilgrims. On 12 May every year, hundreds of thousands flock to attend mass at the famed shrine to mark the anniversary of reported sightings of the Virgin Mary by three children in 1917. But due to the coronavirus, ceremonies have been livestreamed this year. The bishop of FÃ¡tima called for solidarity to combat ""the virus"" of indifference and individualism that he said could only be defeated ""with the antibodies of compassion and solidarity"". Lockdown measures have been loosened in France The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Covid-19 may be here to stay. ""This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away,"" Michael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies director, told a virtual press conference in Geneva. ""HIV has not gone away - but we have come to terms with the virus."" He said that, without a vaccine, it could take years for the population to build up sufficient levels of immunity to the virus. There are many attempts being carried out around the world to develop a vaccine but experts say there is a risk that one may never be created. Meanwhile, as countries across the globe start easing lockdown measures, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the process could trigger new waves of infections. Ryan said there was lots of ""magical thinking"" surrounding countries opening back up. He added that there was a ""long, long way to go"" on the path to returning to normal. Countries are hoping that technology will be an ally in curbing the spread of the virus Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing appwill trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19. That puts it at odds with the NHS app in the UK, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire. UK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a ""centralised"" design despite privacy campaigners' protests, although Germany ditched that model in April. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a ""much higher level of acceptance"" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity. Â© 2025 BBC.
