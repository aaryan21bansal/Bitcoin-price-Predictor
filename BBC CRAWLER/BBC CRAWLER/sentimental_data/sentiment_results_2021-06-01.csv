"This video can not be played US President Joe Biden: ""This was not a riot, this was a massacre"" Joe Biden has become the first sitting president to commemorate the 1921 Tulsa Massacre - one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history. Mr Biden flew to Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Tuesday to mark the 100th anniversary of the attack, which claimed up to 300 African-American lives. The two days of violence, sparked by a white mob, were largely erased from history for decades. It re-entered the national discourse amid racial justice protests last year. On 31 May 1921, a group of white Americans razed the affluent and predominantly black neighbourhood of Greenwood in Tulsa. The community - known by the moniker of ""Black Wall Street"" - was the country's wealthiest African-American neighbourhood until its many homes and businesses were burned down in the riot. In addition to the lives lost, many more black Americans were left injured or homeless. The hunt for victims of America's forgotten massacre Three generations on what America needs to change How far have African Americans come since 1960s? In the years following the incident, many official records were lost or destroyed, and schools did not teach about the massacre. Speaking in Tulsa on Tuesday, Mr Biden said: ""For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness."" ""My fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre, and among the worst in our history. But not the only one."" Less than two years after the Tulsa massacre, a white mob destroyed the black town of Rosewood in rural Florida. On 31 May, Mr Biden issued a proclamation for a day of remembrance. Community members gathered as Mr Biden arrived in Greenwood ""We honour the legacy of the Greenwood community and of Black Wall Street by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts,"" read a statement from the White House. Only three survivors of the massacre - currently aged between 101 and 107 - are still alive. Mr Biden is expected to meet them during his trip. The president began his visit on Tuesday with a tour of the Hall of Survivors, an exhibit about the massacre at the Greenwood Cultural Center. This video can not be played In 1921 Tulsa saw one of the biggest race massacres in American history. On Monday, Tulsa Mayor GT Bynum posted an apology on behalf of the city government for its failure to protect the community and ""to do right by the victims"". ""While no municipal elected official in Tulsa today was alive in 1921, we are the stewards of the same government and an apology for those failures is ours to deliver,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""The victims - men, women, young children - deserved better from their city, and I am sorry they didn't receive it."" Greenwood was a unique sight in pre-civil rights America: a prosperous community where predominantly black citizens thrived at a time of racial discrimination and segregation. The actions of rioters reportedly erased decades of black wealth and wealth creation. Testifying before Congress last month, one survivor - 107-year-old Viola Fletcher - said: ""We lost everything that day... Greenwood represented all the best of what was possible for black people in America."" At the start of his presidency, Mr Biden said racial justice would be one of his top causes in office. As part of his visit to Tulsa, he is expected to tout several new housing and small business programmes the White House hopes can narrow the wealth gap between black and white Americans. The Biden administration says it will address racial discrimination in the housing market by issuing new rules on fair housing practices and curbing inequities in the home appraisal process. Another programme involves increasing federal contracts with small, minority-owned, businesses by 50% over the next five years. In addition, Mr Biden's proposed infrastructure package includes new initiatives aimed at expanding economic opportunities for minority Americans. This includes a $10bn (Â£7bn) community revitalisation fund, which would send money to underserved neighbourhoods like Greenwood. The plan also proposes putting $31bn toward increasing access to capital and technical assistance for small business initiatives, with a focus on ""socially and economically disadvantaged"" firms. It also calls for a new tax credit for private investments in affordable housing. However, left-wing activists expressed disappointment over the president's reluctance to cancel student loan debt, or address financial reparations for black descendants of slavery and racial violence.

"Paramedic Gary Watson says bodycams might have helped identify a drunk patient who attacked him in 2018 Ambulance workers in England will be given body-worn cameras, after assaults against them went up by almost a third in five years. More than 3,500 attacks on emergency care staff were recorded last year. The move was welcomed by staff trialling the cameras, some of whom had experienced violence on the job. The NHS is expecting to make the equipment available to all 10 of England's ambulance trusts by the end of the month. Gary Watson, who took part in the trial in the London Ambulance Service, was assaulted by a drunk patient in 2018, along with three of his colleagues. He tore ligaments, damaged his shoulder and received serious injuries to his face and neck. 'We don't come to work to have abuse thrown at us' Ambulance staff trial body-worn cameras Mr Watson believes the cameras could act as a deterrent. And, he said, if he'd had one when he was attacked three years ago, it would have saved him the stress of testifying against his attacker in court. ""Every time a job comes on the radio you think, 'Is it going to be another one of those jobs?' You just never know. ""All four members of staff got up for work that morning to help people -  come in, do their job, care for people and then go home to their families. They didn't come in to... be hospitalised and end up with the after-effects of such violence,"" he said. ""When you see someone in uniform, you see the uniform, but obviously there's a person who is wearing it."" The bodycams can start recording at the touch of a button and then be shared with police Chief people officer for NHS England Prerana Isaar said: ""Every member of our dedicated and hardworking NHS staff has the fundamental right to be safe at work and it is our priority to eliminate violence and abuse, which we will not tolerate."" A law passed in 2018 gave judges the power to hand down more severe sentences to people who assault emergency workers on duty. NHS England said the camera would start recording at the touch of a button, if members of the public became aggressive or abusive. Recordings can then be shared with the police, and used in court as evidence. NHS England medical director Steve Powis, said: ""Initial trial findings show the cameras make staff feel safer, and can assist in de-escalating situations where staff are faced with someone being aggressive towards them."" This video can not be played Edward Elsden-Smith was caught on a bodycam attacking a policeman But in the North East Ambulance Service - one of the pilot areas along with the London Ambulance Service - assaults actually increased. The cameras were only trialled with small numbers of people, though. Health minister Nadine Dorries said the trial of the cameras helped to reduce incidents. She added: ""We have already doubled the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker and continue to take action to protect staff against violence, aggression and discrimination."" Ambulance services in Wales and Northern Ireland both said they were considering introducing body cameras for staff. The Scottish ambulance service declined to comment.

"The car crashed through the front of the house causing ""extensive damage"" A house has been partially destroyed after a car crashed though its wall, making it the third time it has been struck by a vehicle in 20 years. Aubrey and Pat Eke, 77 and 78, were asleep upstairs when the car hit their home in Holt, Norfolk, on Monday. It has left most of the house structurally unstable, Mr Eke said, with a surveyor due to assess the extent of the damage later. A man, 25, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. He was later released under investigation. The couple were unhurt, but the driver of the VW Golf was taken to hospital to be checked over. ""We heard this almighty crash and I thought, oh no,"" said Mr Eke, who was awoken by the accident on Norwich Road in the early hours of the morning. The driver was arrested and later released under investigation ""I was stumbling around in the dark as it had taken all the electricity out, but I looked through all the rubble and the window and saw the driver had just got out."" It is believed the man had driven straight across a T-junction opposite the Eke's home before coming to an abrupt halt in the living room. ""It's the third time this has happened in the 20 years we've lived here, but this is by far the worst,"" Mr Eke said. He said the couple could currently only use the conservatory and kitchen in the two-storey home and could not go upstairs to collect clean clothes. It is thought the car came straight across a junction before colliding with the house ""They [police] kept the road closed as they weren't sure whether vibrations from passing traffic might cause the house to fall down,"" said Mr Eke. ""Some of it has already moved about three inches."" Police officers who attended the crash said the house was left with ""extensive damage"", a Norfolk police spokeswoman said. Mr Eke said he was ""now on a mission"" to get better road signage and other safety measures at the junction opposite his home. A Norfolk County Council spokesperson, said: ""We will visit the site to check that all signs and road markings are clearly visible and determine whether any further works are required.""

"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is often described as America's last great wilderness US President Joe Biden's administration will suspend oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge pending an environmental review. The move reverses former President Donald Trump's decision to sell oil leases in the refuge to expand fossil fuel and mineral development. The giant Alaskan wilderness is home to many important species, including polar bears, caribou and wolves. Arctic tribal leaders have welcomed the move but Republicans are opposed. Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change The wildlife at risk from drilling plan in Arctic refuge Trump opens wilderness up for oil drilling Covering some 19 million acres (78,000 sq km), the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is often described as America's last great wilderness. The push for exploration in the park has been the subject of a decades-long dispute. The oil-rich region is a critically important location for many species and is considered sacred by the indigenous Gwich'in people. One side argues that drilling for oil could bring in significant amounts of money and provide jobs for people in Alaska, while the other has raised concerns over environmental and climate threats. Days before his presidential term ended in January, Mr Trump went ahead withthe first sale of oil leases in the region's coastal plainas part of his push to develop more domestic fossil fuel production. Butthe sale received little interest from the oil and gas industry.Companies said they were focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices. Several large US banks said they would not fund exploration in the area. In total, 11 tracts were auctioned off, covering just over 550,000 acres, according to the Washington Post newspaper. The sale raised less than $15m (Â£11m) - far less than the government had hoped. Most went to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state agency. While estimates suggest around 11 billion barrels of oil lie under the refuge, it has no roads or other infrastructure, making it a very expensive place to drill. During his campaign Mr Biden pledged to protect the habitat. Once in office, he directed the Interior Department to review the leases. In a statement on Tuesday,the department said it had ""identified defects in the underlying record,externalof decision supporting the leases, including the lack of analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives"", required under environmental law. White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said Mr Biden ""believes America's national treasures are cultural and economic cornerstones of our country"". ""He is grateful for the prompt action by the Department of the Interior to suspend all leasing pending a review of decisions made in the last administration's final days that could have changed the character of this special place forever,"" she added. Since taking office, Mr Biden has signed executive ordersaimed at freezing new oil and gas leases on public land, and has pledged todrastically cut carbon emissions. But his administration disappointed environmental groups last week when the Justice Department defended a Trump-era decision to approve a major oil project on Alaska's North Slope in the former Naval Petroleum Reserve. Arctic tribal leaders praised the decision. ""I want to thank President Biden and the Interior Department for recognising the wrongs committed against our people by the last Administration, and for putting us on the right path forward,"" Tonya Garnett, special projects coordinator for the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, said in a statement. ""This goes to show that, no matter the odds, the voices of our Tribes matter."" Kristen Miller, acting executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said suspending the leases was ""a step in the right direction"". Arctic tribal leaders and environmental groups have welcomed the move But the Biden administration's move was criticised in a joint statement by Republican senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski along with representative Don Young and Governor Mike Dunleavy. ""This action serves no purpose other than to obstruct Alaska's economy and put our energy security at risk,"" said Ms Murkowski, who has represented Alaska in the Senate since 2002. Mr Dunleavy added that the leases sold by the Trump administration ""are valid and cannot be taken away by the federal government"". Oil revenues are critical for Alaska, with every resident getting a cheque for around $1,600 every year from the state's permanent fund. Mr Dunleavy has previously said that opening the refuge for ""responsible resource development"" could ""put more oil in our pipeline, put Alaskans to work, bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities"". The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority said it was disappointed by the decision, and had no reason to believe that the environmental analysis was inadequate.

"Anthony Sootheran's death was initially not treated as suspicious A woman who starved her millionaire landlord to death in order to inherit part of his Â£3.5m estate has been jailed for a minimum of 28 years. Lynda Rickard, 62, was convicted of murdering 59-year-old Anthony Sootheran who died at his farm near South Newington, Oxfordshire, in 2014. Rickard's husband Wayne, 66, who was found guilty of allowing the death, was jailed for 10-and-a-half years. The judge, Mr Justice Wall, said she had shown ""extraordinary greed"". The ""brazen"" plot to steal millionaire's fortune The Rickards, from Banbury, were Mr Sootheran's live-in tenants at High Havens Farm. Lynda Rickard ""ruthlessly exploited"" the reclusive millionaire and his mother, Joy Sootheran, who died in 2012, Reading Crown Court previously heard. She took up to Â£300,000 from their accounts, forged both of their wills and isolated her vulnerable landlord by discouraging visitors, prosecutors said. Lynda and Wayne Rickard bought a Mitsubishi Shogun car with some of the money they obtained Mr Sootheran's ""severely emaciated"" body was found in his room in March 2014. A combination of malnutrition and a deep-seated pressure sore led to a fatal lung infection, the court heard. The death, initially treated as non-suspicious, was reinvestigated when his bank account was used after he died, the judge was told. The Rickards later went to court to try to uphold his forged will but failed to inherit any part of the Sootherans' estates, prosecutors said. Joy Sootheran's will was also forged by Mrs Rickard Mr Sootheran's daughter Hannah told the court she was ""heartbroken"" over the loss of her father. In a written victim statement, she said: ""My trust in people has deteriorated significantly. ""I cannot comprehend how someone who said she cared deeply for my dad left him to die in such horrible conditions."" Mr Sootheran lived with the Rickards at High Havens Farm Mary Loram QC, defending Lynda Rickard, said her client felt ""profound shame"" and had not spent the Sootherans' money on ""high living"". The defendant previously admitted forging their wills, four counts of fraud over their bank accounts, two counts of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, one of possessing forged documents and one of  housing benefit fraud. She and her husband were convicted by the jury of fraud over the purchase of a Mitsubishi Shogun car. (Left to right) Denise Neal, Shanda Robinson and Michael Dunkley were all found guilty of fraudulently signing forged wills Passing a life sentence, Mr Justice Wall said Mrs Rickard had ""cynically and systematically bled this family of money"". He told her: ""Your greed was such that when you thought Anthony Sootheran might act in a way which would derail your gravy train, you murdered him."" The judge said Wayne Rickard, who was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice, ""hoped to profit"" from Mr Sootheran's death. He told him: ""You were the only person who could have saved Anthony Sootheran but instead... you left him to die the most horrible of deaths."" Michael Dunkley, 49, from Banbury, and Denise Neal, 41, of Lower Tysoe, Warwickshire, were jailed for 24 months and 27 months respectively after being found guilty of fraudulently signing forged wills. Shanda Robinson, 51, from Banbury, who was convicted of the same offence and conspiring to pervert the course of justice, was jailed for two years and eight months. Another of Mrs Rickard's friends, June Alsford, 78, from Aynho, Northamptonshire, who admitted fraud before the trial, was given a two-year suspended sentence.

"While most of the UK is opening up, Glasgow is nearing nine months with some of the strictest Covid restrictions in the country. People are forbidden from mixing in each other's homes, pubs are closed for indoor drinking and no-one is allowed to visit or leave the city without good reason. Rising case rates driven by the Indian variant have seen restrictions remain in Glasgow, while rules ease across the rest of Scotland. Withsigns that new cases are stabilising, families and business owners hoped an announcement on Friday would bring an end to their 270-day confinement. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would be ""premature"" at this stage and a decision will be made next week. Glasgow to remain in level three lockdown Catrin Kemp founded a creative writing group for new mothers just before the virus arrived in Scotland When Catrin Kemp heard news that only Glasgow would remain in level three restrictions last week, she found it was ""just another disappointment"". The long-term ban on household mixing in Glasgow has meant loved ones have been unable to share important moments in her family's life. ""We had no celebrations for my daughter's first birthday,"" Catrin said. ""We'll make a fuss of her next year but those moments are lost - and lots of people would say that now, especially if their family doesn't live in Glasgow. ""People are going to break rules - they'll say 'I've done it for too long'. People are broken by Covid, they need to connect."" Families remember loved ones lost to coronavirus What rules are changing, and when? Catrin launched acreative writing group for new mothers,externalin Glasgow just before the virus arrived in Scotland, but kept meetings going online during the pandemic. With two children of her own, the 42-year-old was concerned about the ""double whammy"" of the isolation new parents face combined with lockdown rules. ""It became a weekly group because it felt like everyone was so vulnerable,"" she said. ""New motherhood is such a paradox, it's lonely and wonderful all at the same time and during Covid those mothers would have felt that even more."" In leading the group, Catrin heard about family hardships but also saw what she described as ""beautiful moments"" - mothers breastfeeding and babies falling asleep in their arms. She spoke of how people have adapted, her own family included - but worries the length of Glasgow's lockdown may have permanent effects. ""We talk far more to our neighbours, we spend more time on the street or shared back garden talking to anyone. I've made new friends from being in parks. ""But I don't know how I'll visit another house - I feel institutionalised by Covid."" 2 September:Visiting restrictions are reintroduced for Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire. People can no longer visit other households indoors unless they are in an extended household or ""bubble"" 9 October:Pubs across the central belt close at 18:00 2 November:Scotland's newlevels frameworksees Glasgow placed in level three, meaning pubs cannot serve alcohol. People are warned not to travel to areas in higher levels 17 November:11 local authorities including Glasgow told they will move to level four, meaning pubs, cafes and non-essential shops must shut 20 November:People in level three or four areas are told they will bebreaking the lawif they travel outside their own council area 11 December:Glasgow and 10 other councils move to level three - shops, pubs and cafes can reopen but alcohol cannot be served 26 December:The whole mainland of Scotland moves into level four lockdown after one day of respite on Christmas Day March:Various rules are relaxed - care home visiting resumes, schools return and small groups can meet outdoors 26 April:The country moves down from level four to level three - cafes, pubs, gyms and remaining non-essential shops reopen while travel restrictions are eased 17 May: All councils move to level two restrictions apart from Glasgow and Moray which remain in level three - people are told not to travel in and out of these areas 22 May:Glasgow is the only council area in level three, meaning people can go into pubs, restaurants and cafes - but they can only drink alcohol outside 28 May:Glasgow is told it will be at least another week before restrictions can be lifted as they need time for public health measures to work such as increased testing and vaccination. Alicia Macrae has found travel restrictions have affected family life Alicia Macrae says travel restrictions will likely prevent her from visiting her parents in New York for another year - she last saw them in August 2019. She has taken positive steps to cope with pandemic pressures, such as counselling and giving up alcohol. But local travel restrictions have presented further challenges for her family of five - who live in a tenement flat in the south side of the city. Having to remain within the council boundaries for so long has meant they have visited most green spaces in the city - and what used to be a pleasure for her children is ""almost like punishment"" now. ""When things became more restricted again it was like the kids gave up,"" she said. ""We still manage to go walks but it's no longer an adventure."" With all three children of school age, home learning has been a major challenge - particularly for 10-year-old Hector, who is on the autism spectrum. ""He really struggled with going back to school and all the new rules and regulations,"" said Alicia. ""We got into a rhythm but his anxiety sky-rocketed until about February. ""It's been a long, hard slog dealing with that - autumn and winter was a dark time for us."" The Luchador opened in the south side of the city for the first time on April 26 Nathaniel Hampton, 27, runs The Luchador - a small Latin American-themed bar and restaurant in the southside of Glasgow with a focus on high end cocktails. It was set to open in November 2020 and owners had recruited staff from all over the UK - but the venue lay empty over winter having never sold a drink as a result of restrictions on hospitality. Nathaniel said: ""There was always a concern we might not open but we kept in mind what our goal was - that kept us all going. ""I'm used to coming to work and having thousands of things to think about, so just being sat in a room with nothing happening was difficult."" After a spell operating as a takeaway, the venue welcomed its first customers indoors on 26 April - but can only serve its signature drinks to a few tables outdoors on a busy main road. Despite the challenges for the industry in Glasgow, Nathaniel remains optimistic. He said: ""The response we've had has been fantastic. For me, seeing the look on someone's face when they enjoy themselves on night out is one of reasons I'm still here. ""Glasgow has a great reputation all around the world - we'll be able to survive because of where we are."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The car crashed through the front of the house causing ""extensive damage"" A house has been partially destroyed after a car crashed though its wall, making it the third time it has been struck by a vehicle in 20 years. Aubrey and Pat Eke, 77 and 78, were asleep upstairs when the car hit their home in Holt, Norfolk, on Monday. It has left most of the house structurally unstable, Mr Eke said, with a surveyor due to assess the extent of the damage later. A man, 25, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. He was later released under investigation. The couple were unhurt, but the driver of the VW Golf was taken to hospital to be checked over. ""We heard this almighty crash and I thought, oh no,"" said Mr Eke, who was awoken by the accident on Norwich Road in the early hours of the morning. The driver was arrested and later released under investigation ""I was stumbling around in the dark as it had taken all the electricity out, but I looked through all the rubble and the window and saw the driver had just got out."" It is believed the man had driven straight across a T-junction opposite the Eke's home before coming to an abrupt halt in the living room. ""It's the third time this has happened in the 20 years we've lived here, but this is by far the worst,"" Mr Eke said. He said the couple could currently only use the conservatory and kitchen in the two-storey home and could not go upstairs to collect clean clothes. It is thought the car came straight across a junction before colliding with the house ""They [police] kept the road closed as they weren't sure whether vibrations from passing traffic might cause the house to fall down,"" said Mr Eke. ""Some of it has already moved about three inches."" Police officers who attended the crash said the house was left with ""extensive damage"", a Norfolk police spokeswoman said. Mr Eke said he was ""now on a mission"" to get better road signage and other safety measures at the junction opposite his home. A Norfolk County Council spokesperson, said: ""We will visit the site to check that all signs and road markings are clearly visible and determine whether any further works are required.""

"This video can not be played US President Joe Biden: ""This was not a riot, this was a massacre"" Joe Biden has become the first sitting president to commemorate the 1921 Tulsa Massacre - one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history. Mr Biden flew to Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Tuesday to mark the 100th anniversary of the attack, which claimed up to 300 African-American lives. The two days of violence, sparked by a white mob, were largely erased from history for decades. It re-entered the national discourse amid racial justice protests last year. On 31 May 1921, a group of white Americans razed the affluent and predominantly black neighbourhood of Greenwood in Tulsa. The community - known by the moniker of ""Black Wall Street"" - was the country's wealthiest African-American neighbourhood until its many homes and businesses were burned down in the riot. In addition to the lives lost, many more black Americans were left injured or homeless. The hunt for victims of America's forgotten massacre Three generations on what America needs to change How far have African Americans come since 1960s? In the years following the incident, many official records were lost or destroyed, and schools did not teach about the massacre. Speaking in Tulsa on Tuesday, Mr Biden said: ""For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness."" ""My fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre, and among the worst in our history. But not the only one."" Less than two years after the Tulsa massacre, a white mob destroyed the black town of Rosewood in rural Florida. On 31 May, Mr Biden issued a proclamation for a day of remembrance. Community members gathered as Mr Biden arrived in Greenwood ""We honour the legacy of the Greenwood community and of Black Wall Street by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts,"" read a statement from the White House. Only three survivors of the massacre - currently aged between 101 and 107 - are still alive. Mr Biden is expected to meet them during his trip. The president began his visit on Tuesday with a tour of the Hall of Survivors, an exhibit about the massacre at the Greenwood Cultural Center. This video can not be played In 1921 Tulsa saw one of the biggest race massacres in American history. On Monday, Tulsa Mayor GT Bynum posted an apology on behalf of the city government for its failure to protect the community and ""to do right by the victims"". ""While no municipal elected official in Tulsa today was alive in 1921, we are the stewards of the same government and an apology for those failures is ours to deliver,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""The victims - men, women, young children - deserved better from their city, and I am sorry they didn't receive it."" Greenwood was a unique sight in pre-civil rights America: a prosperous community where predominantly black citizens thrived at a time of racial discrimination and segregation. The actions of rioters reportedly erased decades of black wealth and wealth creation. Testifying before Congress last month, one survivor - 107-year-old Viola Fletcher - said: ""We lost everything that day... Greenwood represented all the best of what was possible for black people in America."" At the start of his presidency, Mr Biden said racial justice would be one of his top causes in office. As part of his visit to Tulsa, he is expected to tout several new housing and small business programmes the White House hopes can narrow the wealth gap between black and white Americans. The Biden administration says it will address racial discrimination in the housing market by issuing new rules on fair housing practices and curbing inequities in the home appraisal process. Another programme involves increasing federal contracts with small, minority-owned, businesses by 50% over the next five years. In addition, Mr Biden's proposed infrastructure package includes new initiatives aimed at expanding economic opportunities for minority Americans. This includes a $10bn (Â£7bn) community revitalisation fund, which would send money to underserved neighbourhoods like Greenwood. The plan also proposes putting $31bn toward increasing access to capital and technical assistance for small business initiatives, with a focus on ""socially and economically disadvantaged"" firms. It also calls for a new tax credit for private investments in affordable housing. However, left-wing activists expressed disappointment over the president's reluctance to cancel student loan debt, or address financial reparations for black descendants of slavery and racial violence.

"Amigo, which lends money to those with a poor credit history, has said it faces insolvency without a new plan to cap payouts for mis-sold loans. A proposal to set aside a separate pot of money for compensation was thrown out by the High Court a week ago. Now Amigo has said it will not appeal against that decision and was, instead, investigating all options - including an alternative plan, or insolvency. In the meantime, all compensation payments remain on hold. Doorstep lending move puts 2,100 jobs at risk Amigo has 150,000 current customers, and 500,000 past customers who are often cash-strapped and are required to give the name of a guarantor to step in to cover any unpaid repayments. It is the biggest operator in the market but its future has been in doubt for some time, having also been embroiled in a boardroom battle. It stopped all new lending in November. The company, as with many others in the sub-prime lending sector, has faced a blizzard of complaints from customers who believe they were approved for loans which they could never afford to repay. A host of these complaints have come via claims management companies. The regulator says that a loan is unaffordable if making the repayments means someone has to borrow more money or get behind with essential bills. Amigo said it wanted to cap any unfinished or subsequent complaints in what is known as a scheme of arrangement. This was opposed by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and a judge said he was ""not satisfied that the court should sanction the scheme"". Amigo said it would now work with the FCA in the coming weeks. Chief executive Gary Jennison said: ""Without a scheme, Amigo faces insolvency as it will be unable to satisfy its customer compensation claims as well as meeting the legally binding funding obligations owed to its secured creditors. The board is committed to finding the best solution it can for Amigo's customers."" It said that ""to ensure equal treatment of customers with redress claims"", compensation would continue to be put on hold ""until further notice"". But Sara Williams, who has been following the case on herDebt Camel blog,external, said it was unfair that halting payments only worked one way. ""Amigo won't pay refunds but it expects customers who have a complaint in to carry on paying their monthly loan repayments,"" she said. ""If Amigo wants to halt deciding complaints and paying refunds, it should allow the customers too to halt payments until their complaint is decided. I think the FCA should insist on this to protect the customers."" The company would also be delaying the publication of its results for the last financial year.

"Twickenham Stadium was turned into a vaccine walk-in centre on Monday, including for over-18s The success of the UK's vaccination programme does not mean that the battle with Covid is over, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Adam Finn said the country remained vulnerable as there were still large numbers of unvaccinated people. There have been calls to delay ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 Juneamid warnings of a third wave. Downing Street reiterated that the PM had seen nothing in the data to suggest the plan would need to be postponed. A No 10 spokesman added: ""We will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced Scotland'snext stage of lockdown easing would be paused for much of its central belt,with places including Edinburgh, Dundee and Stirling staying in level two. The UK has seen a small rise in cases recently linked to the spread of the more transmissible variant first identified in India. On Monday, the UK reported more than 3,000 new Covid infections for the sixth day in a row. Iâm under 30 - which vaccine will I get? Vaccinate the world to save lives at home - MPs Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? Prof Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the government on vaccine priority, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK needed to achieve a high coverage of immunity across the population, not just among certain groups. ""The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong - we've still got a lot of people out there who have neither had this virus infection nor yet been immunised and that's why we're in a vulnerable position right now,"" he said. More than 25 million people in the UK have had two doses of a vaccine - just under half of the adult population. He said the message needed to be broadcast that ""we're all in this together - everyone needs to do this (get vaccinated) for everyone"". Prof Finn joined other government scientific advisers in urging caution over relaxing the coronavirus restrictions too soon, saying it was ""so much better to delay slightly than to go around with another cycle"" of lockdown restrictions. He said the new variant first identified in India looked to be more infectious and it was something ""we need to take seriously"". ""It's a different virus, it could be a real problem and it's only by taking it seriously now that we can get where we want to be as soon as possible,"" he said. The Indian variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to account for up to three quarters of new cases in the UK and has beenlinked to a surge in cases in some parts of the country. The last stage of the government's roadmap in England for lifting lockdown, whichwould remove all limitson how many people you can meet, is due no earlier than 21 June. A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted will be reached on 14 June. Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the situation was ""very delicately balanced"". He told BBC Breakfast that more data was needed over the next two weeks to help the prime minister ""make the difficult decision"". He said the data on hospital admissions and case numbers would be key to determining whether to lift restrictions. Asked whether the UK was entering a third wave of the virus, he said he hoped it wasn't ""but it's not impossible"". In most of the UK, cases are rising gradually while hospital admissions are flat or falling. But Scotland and the North West of England tell a different story. Cases in both areas have been doubling roughly every fortnight across the last month. And admissions are following, doubling roughly monthly in the North West and every fortnight in Scotland. London too is seeing rising cases and admissions, albeit more slowly. And we are still seeing small numbers: in all three areas the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is less than 5% of what it was at the end of January. Vaccines reduce the number of people with coronavirus who get really ill. But as cases go up, inevitably some people end up in hospital. The key question for those analysing the data between now and 14 June is, how much of this is part of what we expected and planned for as society opens up again, and how much is the variant? Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said on Monday that there were signs theUK was already in the early stages of a third wavefuelled by the Indian variant. Another member of Nervtag, professor of sociology Robert Dingwall, told Times Radio he hadn't seen anything in the latest data to make a case for postponing relaxing restrictions. He said the younger age groups who were not vaccinated faced ""much lower risk"", adding that ""many of the scientists who've been talking over the weekend simply haven't adjusted their expectations to understand that (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community"". What restrictions could be lifted on 21 June? Red list terminal opens at Heathrow Airport Business leaders have repeatedly warned that any change to the proposed dates would have a devastating impact on those sectors not yet able to fully reopen - or open at all. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said that some businesses were ""haemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"". The timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. In Wales,there is due to be a review on 3 June.In Northern Ireland, some measures were relaxed on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June. Young people queued up outside London's Twickenham rugby stadium for a Covid vaccine Meanwhile, MPs and peers have urged Boris Johnson toshare some of the UK's vaccines with developing nationsto prevent a ""humanitarian disaster"". And on Monday, thousands of people received jabs at Twickenham Stadium as part of the NHS' drive to target areas hardest hit by the Indian variant. Hounslow's director of public health Kelly O'Neill told the BBC more than 11,000 people were vaccinated at the stadium - with organisers later opening up jabs to anyone aged over 18 as they did not want supplies to be wasted.

"Twickenham Stadium was turned into a vaccine walk-in centre on Monday, including for over-18s The success of the UK's vaccination programme does not mean that the battle with Covid is over, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Adam Finn said the country remained vulnerable as there were still large numbers of unvaccinated people. There have been calls to delay ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 Juneamid warnings of a third wave. Downing Street reiterated that the PM had seen nothing in the data to suggest the plan would need to be postponed. A No 10 spokesman added: ""We will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced Scotland'snext stage of lockdown easing would be paused for much of its central belt,with places including Edinburgh, Dundee and Stirling staying in level two. The UK has seen a small rise in cases recently linked to the spread of the more transmissible variant first identified in India. On Monday, the UK reported more than 3,000 new Covid infections for the sixth day in a row. Iâm under 30 - which vaccine will I get? Vaccinate the world to save lives at home - MPs Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? Prof Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the government on vaccine priority, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK needed to achieve a high coverage of immunity across the population, not just among certain groups. ""The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong - we've still got a lot of people out there who have neither had this virus infection nor yet been immunised and that's why we're in a vulnerable position right now,"" he said. More than 25 million people in the UK have had two doses of a vaccine - just under half of the adult population. He said the message needed to be broadcast that ""we're all in this together - everyone needs to do this (get vaccinated) for everyone"". Prof Finn joined other government scientific advisers in urging caution over relaxing the coronavirus restrictions too soon, saying it was ""so much better to delay slightly than to go around with another cycle"" of lockdown restrictions. He said the new variant first identified in India looked to be more infectious and it was something ""we need to take seriously"". ""It's a different virus, it could be a real problem and it's only by taking it seriously now that we can get where we want to be as soon as possible,"" he said. The Indian variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to account for up to three quarters of new cases in the UK and has beenlinked to a surge in cases in some parts of the country. The last stage of the government's roadmap in England for lifting lockdown, whichwould remove all limitson how many people you can meet, is due no earlier than 21 June. A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted will be reached on 14 June. Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the situation was ""very delicately balanced"". He told BBC Breakfast that more data was needed over the next two weeks to help the prime minister ""make the difficult decision"". He said the data on hospital admissions and case numbers would be key to determining whether to lift restrictions. Asked whether the UK was entering a third wave of the virus, he said he hoped it wasn't ""but it's not impossible"". In most of the UK, cases are rising gradually while hospital admissions are flat or falling. But Scotland and the North West of England tell a different story. Cases in both areas have been doubling roughly every fortnight across the last month. And admissions are following, doubling roughly monthly in the North West and every fortnight in Scotland. London too is seeing rising cases and admissions, albeit more slowly. And we are still seeing small numbers: in all three areas the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is less than 5% of what it was at the end of January. Vaccines reduce the number of people with coronavirus who get really ill. But as cases go up, inevitably some people end up in hospital. The key question for those analysing the data between now and 14 June is, how much of this is part of what we expected and planned for as society opens up again, and how much is the variant? Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said on Monday that there were signs theUK was already in the early stages of a third wavefuelled by the Indian variant. Another member of Nervtag, professor of sociology Robert Dingwall, told Times Radio he hadn't seen anything in the latest data to make a case for postponing relaxing restrictions. He said the younger age groups who were not vaccinated faced ""much lower risk"", adding that ""many of the scientists who've been talking over the weekend simply haven't adjusted their expectations to understand that (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community"".

Red list terminal opens at Heathrow Airport Business leaders have repeatedly warned that any change to the proposed dates would have a devastating impact on those sectors not yet able to fully reopen - or open at all.

"The funding will enable Transport for London to continue to support the capital until 11 December Transport for London (TfL) has secured a Â£1.08bn funding package from the government, the third bailout since the start of the pandemic.

"UK house prices soared 10.9% in the year to May, the highest level in seven years, according to the Nationwide. The average house price has risen to Â£242,832, up Â£23,930 over the past twelve months. Buyers are in a ""race for space"" as they seek larger homes and properties with gardens, Nationwide said. Bank of England deputy Sir Jon Cunliffe told the BBC it was important people did not overstretch themselves in terms of mortgage borrowing. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said the housing market has seen a complete turnaround over the past twelve months. A year ago, activity collapsed in the wake of the first lockdown with housing transactions falling to a record low of 42,000 in April 2020, he said. ""But activity surged towards the end of last year and into 2021, reaching a record high of 183,000 in March,"" Mr Gardner said. According to the building society's research, there's ""a race for space"" with people moving to access a garden or outdoor space more easily. Banks call for support for struggling homeowners 'Mad rush' to buy homes faded in April ""The majority of people are looking to move to less urban areas,"" Mr Gardner said. He added that the extension of the stamp duty holiday from its original end date of March helped to maintain momentum in the market. ""It is shifting housing preferences which is continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic,"" he said. Talking to the BBC, Sir Jon Cunliffe said the way people had learned to work differently during the pandemic may also be changing their preferences for where they want to live. He said the Bank's main concern was rising personal debt. ""We learned from experience that if households are carrying high levels of debt, and you then hit a bump, the recession is much worse. We learned that 10 years ago after the financial crisis,"" he said. Tax breaks introduced during the pandemic to boost the housing market and, in turn the UK economy, had a marked effect in the last 12 months. The property purchase tax was suspended on the first Â£500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland from July to support the market. Similar support for homebuyers was introduced in Scotland and Wales. The tax relief was due to end across the whole of the UK at the end of March, prompting a surge in sales to beat the planned cut-off date, but only Scotland stuck to the deadline. England, Northern Ireland and Wales extended relief to the end of June. After that in England and Northern Ireland, the nil rate band will be set at Â£250,000 - double its standard Â£125,000 level - until the end of September.

"Abergavenny players protest against the ""unfair"" decision The football team that finished fourth in the women's Welsh top flight has criticised the decision to relegate them as part of a league restructure. Abergavenny Women's FC is one of three Welsh Premier Women's League (WPWL) sides to be removed as the division is cut from nine to eight. Monmouth MP David Davies urged the Football Association of Wales (FAW) to reconsider the ""inexplicable"" decision. The FAW said it sympathised, but the application process had been ""robust"". Under the moveannounced on Monday, Abergavenny, Caerphilly's Cascade Ladies YC and Briton Ferry Llansawel Ladies will all drop to the second-tier competition. In contrast, Barry Town United Ladies FC will join the top flight, as will The New Saints, who are actively recruiting for players after splitting from their women's team last year. There is anger among some that well-established teams have been replaced with one that does not yet exist. Abergavenny captain Ceri Hudson has been at the club for a decade Abergavenny's manager said they had been left disheartened and disillusioned after securing fourth spot in their final game of the season. Craig Morgan-Hill said he feared some players would walk away from the game. ""They've given it their all. They beat Cardiff City 4-0, but they're not good enough. What can they do?"" said the former Manchester City academy player. The WPWL is the top flight of the domestic game and is organised by the FAW. It includes Swansea City, Cardiff City and Cardiff Met, with the winners qualifying for the prestigious Uefa Women's Champions League. The league below, Tier 2, is to be split between northern and southern leagues, supported but not run by the governing body. The changes are part of the FAW's wider women and girls football strategy to strengthen the domestic game in Wales and improve player pathways, in the hope fewer drop out. FAW receive 37 applications for new league FAW restructures women's domestic football in Wales 'A seismic, pivotal week in football - but game not yet over' However Abergavenny captain Ceri Hudson said everyone at the club felt ""deflated"". The 28-year-old, who has been at the club for 10 years, said the decision had affected the team's mental health, especially as they are ""not being judged on merit"", and was worried players would leave. That is a particular concern for the town's MP, Mr Davies, who has written to the FAW questioning the decision to have no teams from the former Gwent area in the league. He said it was ""inexplicable and completely unfair"", adding that removing a team for bureaucratic reasons instead of performance ""flies in the face of a level playing field for sport"". Those concerns were shared in a statement from Cascade YC Ladies who compared the changes to the controversial plans behind the failedmen's European Super League.

Briton Ferry Llansawel Ladies FC also described the decision as ""unjust, ethically wrong and discriminatory"". The club said it had ""serious questions about the levels of due diligence and fairness"" of the FAW's application process. ""It will have, in some cases, an irreparable impact on our community and our ability to provide opportunities to young players and coaches,"" the club said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

"Kraft Heinz says it will invest $199m (Â£140m) in a UK food manufacturing facility over the next four years. The plans for the plant in north west England would see British favourites - ketchup, mayonnaise and salad cream - made in the country once again. It would be the firm's biggest expansion of a manufacturing site outside the US in more than 20 years. The company said it is also one of the largest investments in UK manufacturing since Brexit. The plan, which is subject to approval in the US, will also fund equipment and technology and create up to 50 new full-time jobs, the company said. The Kitt Green plant on the outskirts of Wigan is Europe's largest food manufacturing site, making 1.3 billion cans of food a year. Under the plan, it will start making sauces, as well as continuing to make soups, pasta and baked beans. Heinz sauces were last made in the UK in 1999. ""The Kraft Heinz investment is a vote of confidence in the UK economy from a major US firm and a boost that will mean jobs and growth for the local economy,"" UK Minister for Investment Gerry Grimstone said in a statement. US faces ketchup packet shortage amid pandemic Kraft Heinz shares fall as appetites wane In April, the US faced shortages of tomato ketchup sachets after the coronavirus pandemic led to a surge in demand for small packets of the popular condiment. Heinz, which is the most widely sold brand of ketchup globally, said that the rise in demand had been ""driven by... accelerated delivery and take-out trends"". The packs often accompany delivery orders and have effectively replaced the bottles kept on restaurant tables. The company said it had stepped up production and added multiple new production lines in its factories.  It also says it has developed a ""no-touch dispenser"" for dine-in services.

"Twickenham Stadium was turned into a vaccine walk-in centre on Monday, including for over-18s The success of the UK's vaccination programme does not mean that the battle with Covid is over, a scientist advising the government has said. Prof Adam Finn said the country remained vulnerable as there were still large numbers of unvaccinated people. There have been calls to delay ending Covid restrictions in England on 21 Juneamid warnings of a third wave. Downing Street reiterated that the PM had seen nothing in the data to suggest the plan would need to be postponed. A No 10 spokesman added: ""We will continue to look at the data, we will continue to look at the latest scientific evidence as we move through June."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced Scotland'snext stage of lockdown easing would be paused for much of its central belt,with places including Edinburgh, Dundee and Stirling staying in level two. The UK has seen a small rise in cases recently linked to the spread of the more transmissible variant first identified in India. On Monday, the UK reported more than 3,000 new Covid infections for the sixth day in a row. Iâm under 30 - which vaccine will I get? Vaccinate the world to save lives at home - MPs Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? Prof Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the government on vaccine priority, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK needed to achieve a high coverage of immunity across the population, not just among certain groups. ""The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong - we've still got a lot of people out there who have neither had this virus infection nor yet been immunised and that's why we're in a vulnerable position right now,"" he said. More than 25 million people in the UK have had two doses of a vaccine - just under half of the adult population. He said the message needed to be broadcast that ""we're all in this together - everyone needs to do this (get vaccinated) for everyone"". Prof Finn joined other government scientific advisers in urging caution over relaxing the coronavirus restrictions too soon, saying it was ""so much better to delay slightly than to go around with another cycle"" of lockdown restrictions. He said the new variant first identified in India looked to be more infectious and it was something ""we need to take seriously"". ""It's a different virus, it could be a real problem and it's only by taking it seriously now that we can get where we want to be as soon as possible,"" he said. The Indian variant - known as B.1.617.2 - is thought to account for up to three quarters of new cases in the UK and has beenlinked to a surge in cases in some parts of the country. The last stage of the government's roadmap in England for lifting lockdown, whichwould remove all limitson how many people you can meet, is due no earlier than 21 June. A final decision on whether restrictions will be lifted will be reached on 14 June. Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the situation was ""very delicately balanced"". He told BBC Breakfast that more data was needed over the next two weeks to help the prime minister ""make the difficult decision"". He said the data on hospital admissions and case numbers would be key to determining whether to lift restrictions. Asked whether the UK was entering a third wave of the virus, he said he hoped it wasn't ""but it's not impossible"". In most of the UK, cases are rising gradually while hospital admissions are flat or falling. But Scotland and the North West of England tell a different story. Cases in both areas have been doubling roughly every fortnight across the last month. And admissions are following, doubling roughly monthly in the North West and every fortnight in Scotland. London too is seeing rising cases and admissions, albeit more slowly. And we are still seeing small numbers: in all three areas the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is less than 5% of what it was at the end of January. Vaccines reduce the number of people with coronavirus who get really ill. But as cases go up, inevitably some people end up in hospital. The key question for those analysing the data between now and 14 June is, how much of this is part of what we expected and planned for as society opens up again, and how much is the variant? Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said on Monday that there were signs theUK was already in the early stages of a third wavefuelled by the Indian variant. Another member of Nervtag, professor of sociology Robert Dingwall, told Times Radio he hadn't seen anything in the latest data to make a case for postponing relaxing restrictions. He said the younger age groups who were not vaccinated faced ""much lower risk"", adding that ""many of the scientists who've been talking over the weekend simply haven't adjusted their expectations to understand that (for these people) Covid is a mild illness in the community"". What restrictions could be lifted on 21 June? Red list terminal opens at Heathrow Airport Business leaders have repeatedly warned that any change to the proposed dates would have a devastating impact on those sectors not yet able to fully reopen - or open at all. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said that some businesses were ""haemorrhaging cash"" and a delay would ""push them closer to the cliff edge of business failure"". The timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. In Wales,there is due to be a review on 3 June.In Northern Ireland, some measures were relaxed on 24 May - the next review is due on 10 June. Young people queued up outside London's Twickenham rugby stadium for a Covid vaccine Meanwhile, MPs and peers have urged Boris Johnson toshare some of the UK's vaccines with developing nationsto prevent a ""humanitarian disaster"". And on Monday, thousands of people received jabs at Twickenham Stadium as part of the NHS' drive to target areas hardest hit by the Indian variant. Hounslow's director of public health Kelly O'Neill told the BBC more than 11,000 people were vaccinated at the stadium - with organisers later opening up jabs to anyone aged over 18 as they did not want supplies to be wasted.

"The newly-published research was a commitment in the New Decade New Approach agreement The Department of Education needs to spend more than Â£180m on widespread measures to tackle educational underachievement over the next five years. All children should also go to pre-school for at least four and a half hours a day. There needs to be significantly more investment in early years education. Those are some of the actions recommended in a wide-ranging report, calledA Fair Start,external. The report, from an expert panelset up by the Education Minister Peter Weir in 2020, looks into the links between persistent educational underachievement and socio-economic background. The research had been a commitment in the New Decade New Approach (NDNA) agreement. Mr Weir described it as ""one of the most important reports I have overseen in my time as education minister"". Spending on disadvantaged pupils is 'ineffective' NI education divided and splintered, says report The panel was expected to look particularly at the ""long-standing issues facing working class Protestant boys"" and come up with an action plan to tackle underachievement. However, the Fair Start report said underachievement affected all communities and ""the most significant differences are between the GCSE attainment of free school meal-entitled (FMSE) and non-FSME pupils, irrespective of religion, gender or ethnicity"". The report said schools in disadvantaged areas should be funded to run more extra-curricular activities But it recommended a number of actions to help boys, who it said could face alienation from school, a lack of role models and lack a sense of belonging. It called, for instance, for more investment in youth work in Protestant working class areas and said schools in disadvantaged areas should to be funded to run more extra-curricular activities. The report also said more male teachers were needed, especially in primary schools. ""For a number of years, the issue of educational underachievement has been an area that I have been personally committed to addressing so this is a very significant day for me,"" said the education minister. ""I concur with the panel that the actions set out in the Action Plan are capable of making a real and significant impact on children's learning. Education Minister Peter Weir said the panel's work provided a ""road map"" for making an impact on education ""We need to give our young people confidence, instil within them self-belief that they can succeed and provide the support they need to thrive in school."" Mr Weir added that the ""crucial work"" of the panel provides a ""road map"" for how we can achieve all these things. Setting up the panel in 2020, Mr Weir said underachievement by some pupils remained ""entrenched"" in Northern Ireland despite significant funding and policies to tackle it. The Northern Ireland Audit Office, however, previously saidthe Department of Education (DE) could not demonstrate that almost Â£1bn funding to help disadvantaged children had made a difference. A previous large-scale report for the Executive Office examining the effects of deprivation on educational achievement published in 2017 wascritical of academic selection. The expert panel said there was evidence preparation for the transfer test ""skews"" teaching in the later years of primary school. ""Transfer outcomes for free school meal-entitled (FSME) pupils are significantly lower than for non-FSME pupils, leading to significantly lower percentages of FSME pupils attending grammar schools,"" the report said. The panel said the arrangements for transfer between primary and post-primary schools should be reviewed by DE. The panel called for more investment in children's emotional and mental wellbeing They also said there needed to be much more focus on children's education from birth. ""There is a substantial body of research evidence which highlights that children's early experiences have a profound and lasting impact on their future learning and development,"" the report said, ""which confirms that investing in quality early childhood education for disadvantaged children has significant and long-term benefits for individuals and society."" One of their recommendations is that all children attend full-time pre-school for at least four and a half hours a day. They said research suggested children who attended pre-school full-time had better ""literacy, language, maths, socio-emotional development and physical health, had increased school readiness skills"". The report said, though, staff in pre-school and early years ""were struggling to cope with the number of children who had special educational needs or, more commonly, were awaiting assessment to confirm special educational needs"". The panel also called for more investment in children's emotional and mental wellbeing to reflect the level of need. They also said the Covid-19 pandemic and children being out of school for prolonged periods was likely to have ""exacerbated the existing challenges faced by many children and young people"". BBC News NI has previously reported onsignificant waiting times for Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), for example. Other areas covered by the panel's extensive report included the need for more links between schools and local communities and more professional development for school staff. The panel recommended 47 actions needed to address educational underachievement at all levels at a cumulative cost of over Â£180m over the next five years, though the report also recommends many of the actions continue beyond that. The expert panel was chaired by Dr Noel Purdy from Stranmillis University College. Other members were former principal Kathleen O'Hare, the chief executive of the Greater Shankill Partnership Jackie Redpath, the head of Belfast Boys' Model Mary Montgomery and the head of Long Tower Primary School Joyce Logue. Their final report is based on evidence from almost 350 school leaders, parents, officials from government departments, community organisations, assembly members, teaching unions and others.

"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. You must have received your final vaccine dose no earlier than 270 days (about nine months) before travelling. If it was earlier than this, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed between receiving your booster and entering Spain. Spain (like all EU countries) will accept as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021). Fully vaccinated children aged 12 to 15 can now also use the NHS app to show their Covid status, or they can request anNHS Covid Pass letter for international travel.Children under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination. If you have not been fully vaccinated, you can only enter Spain if your journey is classed as""essential""by the Spanish Ministry of Health. If your journey qualifies, you will need to present either a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours, or a negative antigen test/LFT taken within the previous 24 hours, or else a medical certificate to say that you have recovered from Covid in the previous six months. If you're travelling via Gibraltar, check the latestForeign Office travel advice. Wherever you are in Spain, you must observe social distancing of 1.5m (5ft).

"A ban on evictions introduced during lockdown comes to an end in England on 1 June. What does it mean for renters? If a landlord wants to evict tenants, there is a strict legal process to follow. There are two main types of eviction: A ""no-fault"" or Section 21 eviction is when a landlord does not need to give a reason. Landlords can do this at the end of a fixed-term tenancy agreement, or during a tenancy with no fixed end date If the tenant breaks the terms of the rental agreement - for example by not paying rent, damaging the property or causing a nuisance - the landlord can use a Section Eight order Usually, no-fault evictions require two months' notice. Evictions where tenants have broken the terms of the tenancy have a notice period of between two weeks and two months, depending on which terms were broken. Renter eviction ban to finish at end of May There are a series of steps a landlord must take to evict someone: Issue a Section 21 or Section Eight notice with the date they want a tenant to leave Get a possession order from the court if a tenant stays beyond the date Ask the court for a warrant of possession if they don't leave on time. The court sends an eviction notice to the tenants, who can be evicted by a bailiff Someone can only be evicted if correct procedure has been followed. They could challenge the order if they have been discriminated against During the pandemic, some people saw their incomes plummet. So, the government announced a ""complete ban on evictions"" to ensure no struggling renter would be ""forced out of their home"". Eviction hearings were banned in courts in England and Wales last March. They restarted in September, but bailiffs were told not to enforce eviction orders. Meanwhile minimum notice periods for renters - where eviction was not involved - were increased across the UK. In England this was to six months. In the first three months of 2020 there werejust over 12,000 warrants for possession,externalgranted to landlords in England and Wales. 'Fix the broken rental system' Shelter calls for 90,000 social homes to be built Rental market unusually uncertain, Nationwide says Landlords who want their tenants to move out can give four months' notice, down from six months. On 1 October it will return to two months. Minimum notices are shorter for evictions where renters have broken the tenancy agreement. It will drop back to two weeks - or no notice in the most serious cases. Bailiffs will be able to enforce eviction orders issued by courts with two weeks' notice. They are not allowed to evict you if you, or anyone you live with, has coronavirus symptoms, tested positive for coronavirus or has been told to self isolate by the NHS. In Wales, the ban on eviction enforcement is due to end in July. There is no ban in Northern Ireland. Evictions can be enforced in Scotland,external, apart from in Glasgow, which is in Level 3 restrictions. Landlords are not allowed to harass tenants to leave, or lock them out of the property. Only bailiffs can carry out evictions. The government has advised tenants,externalwhose ability to pay rent has been affected by the pandemic to have an ""early conversation"". Renters can apply to their local council for help if they are homeless, or set to become homeless within eight weeks. Some landlords have also experienced hardship. The government says, 45% of private landlords own just one property and are vulnerable to rent arrears Announcing the end of the ban, Housing Minister Christopher Pincher said it would ""ensure tenants continue to be supported with longer notice periods, while also balancing the need for landlords to access justice"". The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) said it was ""an important step in ensuring the sector's recovery"". But representatives of both landlords and tenants have called for more help for people in rent arrears. The NRLA said ministers should ""step in and provide affected tenants with the financial support they need to pay off rent arrears built as a result of the pandemic"". Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, called for an emergency package of financial aid and said the government should ""make renting more stable and secure by scrapping Section 21 ""no fault"" evictions altogether"".
