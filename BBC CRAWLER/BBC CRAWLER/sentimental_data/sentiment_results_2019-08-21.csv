"The High Court in London will allow a proposed strike over pay and conditions by UK-based Ryanair pilots on Thursday and Friday. Earlier, the airline won a bid to stop Ireland-based pilots from striking, but more of its pilots fly from the UK. Ryanair said it would aim to minimise disruption for passengers and would be able to run its ""full schedule of flights"". However, it said it could not rule out some delays. Ryanair's lawyers told the Irish court that the Forsa pilots' union, which represents around 180 Ryanair pilots, had not let talks reach a conclusion before announcing the strike. Dublin-based Ryanair pilots vote to strike What's going on with my holiday flights? Pilots can be drafted in from elsewhere in Europe to fill in during strike action. Ryanair said it would inform passengers of any changes to their flights by email and text message. ""If you have not received any SMS or email from us, your flight is scheduled to operate,"" it said. Customers can alsocheck its website,external, it said. In early August, Ryanair pilots in the UK joined pilots in Ireland in voting to strike over pay and conditions. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) announced two 48-hour walkouts, one from 22-23 August and another from 2-4 September. But Ryanair turned to the courts in London and Dublin in a bid to block the industrial action, prompting Balpa to accuse the airline of ""bully boy"" tactics. ""We are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring about a change in Ryanair for the better,"" said Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, welcoming the judgement. ""Pilots in Ryanair are seeking the same kind of policies and agreements that exist in other airlines - our demands are not unreasonable."" Balpa's decision to walk out came only days after the budget airline warned of job lossesfollowing a 21% fall in quarterly profits, because of higher costs for fuel and staff, and reduced ticket prices. The union said 72% of its members at the company had taken part in the ballot, with 80% of those supporting strike action. However, Ryanair said that fewer than 50% of its UK pilots were members of Balpa, and of these, just 57% voted in favour of industrial action. In a letter to Balpa, Ryanair's director of HR strategy and operations, Darrell Hughes, said senior captains were paid up to Â£180,000 per annum and, because of this, pilot turnover had fallen to zero ""in recent months"". He said: ""At this difficult time for UK pilots facing base cuts and closures, Balpa should be working with Ryanair to save UK pilot jobs, not endanger them through ill-timed and ill-judged disruption of our customers' travel plans, just 10 weeks before the threat of a no-deal Brexit. We remain available for talks at your convenience."" On 31 July, Ryanair bossMichael O'Leary warned staff in a video message to prepare for job cuts,saying the airline has 900 too many pilots and cabin crew members. He said the two weakest markets were Germany, where Ryanair faced fierce competition on price, and the UK, where there were Brexit uncertainties. ""It's been a challenging summer, we're facing into a very difficult winter,"" he said in the video, seen by the BBC. But Captain Tilmann Gabriel, a former pilot who teaches aviation management at City, University of London, told BBC Radio 5 Live that pilots were in short supply, with 800,000 more needed over the next two decades. ""That means we need to produce... 110 pilots every day [for] the next 20 years and we are producing much less,"" he said. ""So of course the price goes up."" In a tweet, Ryanair welcomed the judgement from the Irish court. It said all Ryanair flights from Irish airports would now take off as normal. The airline had previously warned that the 180 pilots who were set to strike on Thursday 22 and Friday 23 August would put holidaymakers' travel plans at risk if the action went ahead. Justice McDonald told Dublin High Court that he would restrain the pilots' union, Forsa, ""from directly or indirectly, organising, directing or endorsing"" a strike by its members on Thursday and Friday. Forsa's lawyers had told the court that Ryanair had been ""curt and dismissive"" of a 30-page proposal it submitted to the airline on pay and conditions.

"This video can not be played Denmark called Trump's bid to buy Greenland ""absurd"" - he called that ""nasty"" and offensive to the US. US President Donald Trump has called the Danish leader ""nasty"" after she rebuffed his idea of buying Greenland. He lashed out hours after Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was ""sorry"" that Mr Trump had abruptly called off a state visit to Denmark. She has dismissed the suggestion of such a land deal as ""absurd"". Queen Margrethe II invited Mr Trump to visit Denmark on 2 September, and the manner of his cancellation has stunned the Scandinavian nation. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Trump took umbrage at Ms Frederiksen's remarks. ""I thought that the prime minister's statement that it was absurd, that it was an absurd idea was nasty,"" he said. ""I thought it was an inappropriate statement. All she had to do is say no, we wouldn't be interested."" This video can not be played President Trump also said he was ""the chosen one"" He added: ""She's not talking to me. She's talking to the United States of America. You don't talk to the United States that way, at least under me."" Mr Trump pointed out that US President Harry Truman once considered making an offer for Greenland, which is an autonomous Danish territory. He continued to make digs at Denmark online.

This video can not be played Watch: Greenland wouldn't be the first time the US bought territory Earlier on Wednesday, Ms Frederiksen reiterated that Greenland could not be bought. She told reporters the idea of selling the resource-rich Arctic island had ""clearly been rejected"" by its leader, Kim Kielsen, ""a position I share of course"". Ms Frederiksen also said the American president's visit would have been an ""opportunity to celebrate Denmark's close relationship to the US"". This video can not be played The Danish prime minister underlined her hope for continued strong relations with the US ""This does not change the character of our good relations and we will continue our dialogue on how we can deal with challenges we are facing,"" she said, adding that the invitation to Mr Trump ""remains open"". She has said Mr Trump's no-show was a matter of regret because ""our preparations were well under way"". Donald Trump and Greenland: Why would he want to buy it? While praising Denmark as a ""very special country"", Mr Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday that his planned visit would no longer go ahead because Ms Frederiksen had ""no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland"". Greenland: What you need to know Mr Trump had earlier confirmed reports that he was interested in buying Greenland. When asked on Sunday if he would consider trading a US territory for the island, he replied: ""Well, a lot of things could be done."" ""Essentially it's a large real estate deal,"" he said. On Monday, the US president tweeted a jokey image showing a tall golden skyscraper among the homes of a small village on the island. Allow Twitter content?

Is the Arctic set to become a main shipping route? The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss 'Why I translate all of Trump's tweets into Chinese' Mr Trump has reportedly taken an interest in Greenland, in part, because of its resources, such as coal, zinc, copper and iron ore. But while Greenland may be rich in minerals, it relies on Denmark for two-thirds of its budget revenue. It has high rates of suicide, alcoholism and unemployment. The US has long seen the island, which sits along a direct route from Europe to North America, as being strategically important. It established the Thule air force and radar base there at the start of the Cold War, which now covers space surveillance and forms the northernmost part of the US ballistic missile early warning system. Meanwhile, new Arctic sea routes are opening up as climate change is blamed for the accelerating thaw of ice in the region. China has recently been taking an interest in the area, too.

"This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? The government is launching a review of high-speed rail link HS2 - with a ""go or no-go"" decision by the end of the year, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. It will consider whether and how the project to connect London, the Midlands and northern England should proceed. Billions have already been spent, but Mr Shapps refused to rule out scrapping it entirely. He said it was ""responsible"" to see whether the benefits really ""stack up"". Phase 1 of the development between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester scheduled for completion by 2032-33. It is designed to carry trains capable of travelling at 250mph. What is HS2? And what will it cost? Scrapping HS2 'would be a disaster' What's it like to be in the way of HS2? Have you been directly affected by the HS2 plans? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external When asked about the money already spent on the project, Mr Shapps said: ""Just because you've spent a lot of money on something does not mean you should plough more and more money into it."" He said ministers were asking the reviewers ""just give us the facts"". ""Go and find out all the information that's out thereâ¦ genuinely what it would cost to complete this project, and then we'll be in a much better position to make that decision - go or no-go by the end of the year."" The review will be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a civil engineer and former chair of HS2 Ltd.  Â£55.6bnExisting budget Â£32.7bnOriginal budget Â£7.4bnAlready spent on the project 9,000Jobs supported by the railway 345 milesNew high-speed track 50 minutesJourney time saving between London and Manchester Lord Berkeley, another civil engineer who worked on the construction of the Channel Tunnel, will act as his deputy. The Labour peer has previously been critical of the project. A final report will be sent to the government in the autumn. During the Conservative Party leadership campaign Boris Johnson said he would not scrap plans for the new rail link, but did express ""anxieties about the business case"". In July, the current chairman of the projectreportedly warnedthat the total cost could rise by another Â£30bn - up from the current budget of Â£56bn. Labour peer Lord Adonis, a former transport secretary who worked as an infrastructure adviser to Theresa May, said the review was ""as stupid as you can get"" and would ""screw Birmingham and the North"". He tweeted that it would become ""a massive bun fight, while the transport department runs for cover and HS2 Ltd is paralysed by indecision"". The review will look into: cost estimates so far opportunities for efficiency savings the environmental impact, focusing specifically on net zero carbon commitment whether the economic and business case made for HS2 is accurate the added costs of cancelling the project or changing its scope, such as combining phases 1 and 2a (Birmingham to Crewe), reducing the speed or building only phase 1 Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling argued that new rail links were needed to take pressure off a system which was ""bursting at the seams"". And in June this year, more than 20 business leadersurged the governmentto deliver HS2 in full, arguing it would ""spread the flow of investment across the Midlands, the North of England and into Scotland"". The Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who will sit on the review panel, said HS2 was ""vital"" for the West Midlands and was ""already creating jobs and building new homes"". But Conservative MP Dame Cheryl Gillan, whose constituency HS2 will run through, told BBC Radio 4's World at One its costs had risen ""astronomically"" and it was ""now completely unviable in terms of value for money for the British taxpayer"". In May, a committee of peersargued the projectrisked ""short changing"" the North of England. Their report said the scheme put too much emphasis on cutting journey times and not enough on the economic impact on regions. It also called for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme - a separate scheme connecting towns and cities in the region - to be completed alongside HS2. Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, who supports HS2, complained that the review panel included two elected representatives from the West Midlands but none from the North. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Labour supported investment in new rail capacity, adding that ""improved governance of railway expansion is needed, not least over the HS2 project."" One Conservative MP, Bob Seely suggested the ""top half"" of HS2 - the section covering the North of England - should be built, but not the Birmingham to London route, which he described as ""a monumental white elephant"". The key question is, is HS2 value for money? One former senior figure at the Treasury said to me recently that in terms of that it scores much lower than many other projects, so the government is taking quite a big risk putting so much money into it. The government could cancel it - but, of course, the main caveat to that is the amount that has already been spent and would be lost. For all the opposition to it, HS2 also has a lot of passionate supporters too and they would be unhappy. Rather than scrapping it altogether then, perhaps the more plausible option is altering the plans in some way. Trust me though, even doing will not be straightforward for financial or legal reasons. Joe Rukin, from the Stop HS2 campaign, said: ""If this is a genuine review, they must stop work now, because irreparable damage is being done right now to unique habitats, ancient woodlands."" He accused HS2 of ""sending out possession orders like there is no tomorrow"", referring tothe compulsory purchase of propertiesin the path of the line. He also raised concerns that the review chairman, Mr Oakervee, was being given a chance to ""mark his own homework"" given his previous role on the project. Allow Twitter content?

"People will have to get out of their cars if the UK is to meet its climate change targets, MPs say. The Science and Technology Select Committee says technology alone cannot solve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from transport. It says the government cannot achieve sufficient emissions cuts by swapping existing vehicles for cleaner versions. The government said it would consider the committee's findings. In its report, the committee said: âIn the long-term, widespread personal vehicle ownership does not appear to be compatible with significant decarbonisation.â It echoesa report from an Oxford-based group of academics,externalwho warned that even electric cars produce pollution through their tyres and brakes. How polluting are idling cars and buses? Madrid bans old cars to cut pollution The AA said the committee had underestimated the power of new technology to solve pollution in cars. But the MPs are demanding improvements in public transport, walking and cycling, which benefit health as well as the climate. They also criticise the governmentâs recent policies on the costs of transport. They point out that most of the increase in average new car emissions in 2017 was caused by consumers choosing more polluting models because financial incentives to buy cleaner cars are insufficient. A government strategy should aim to reduce the overall number of vehicles required, the report says. This would be achieved by: Promoting and improving public transport Reducing the cost of public transport relative to driving Encouraging vehicle usership in place of ownership (car sharing, car hire and taxis) And boosting walking and cycling. Ministers have held down fuel duty increases in recent years following lobbying from motoring groups. But the MPs say they should ensure that the annual increase in fuel duty is never lower than the average increase in rail or bus fares. The report says we should be cycling more For drivers investing in electric vehicles there should be a better network of charging points. But thereâs a warning that more research is needed on the environmental impact of the batteries of electric vehicles. The report warns: âHydrogen technology may prove to be cheaper and less environmentally damaging than battery-powered electric vehicles. The government should not rely on a single technology.â The AAâs president Edmund King told BBC News: âStating that widespread personal vehicle ownership isnât compatible with significant decarbonisation seems to be giving up on emerging science and technology. âTechnology is developing at a rapid rate with great potential from more efficient electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. ""More emphasis should be going into renewable energy and greener vehicle production rather than higher fuel duty or banning hybrids, as the report recommends. âThe fastest growth in traffic is by vans due to internet deliveries so more technological effort should be put into decarbonising that sector as a priority.â This video can not be played New backpacks monitor London's air pollution The MPsâ report stretches beyond transport to cover the whole economy. Its general message is that not enough is being done to ensure that the UK achieves its recently-adopted Net Zero Carbon target by 2050. The report says stamp duty should be increased for badly-insulated homes. Homebuyers should then be able to make improvements, and offset the cost with a stamp duty rebate. Another idea in a wide-ranging document is for the UK to set a target for reducing the emissions embedded in the manufacturing process of the goods we buy from abroad. This would prevent Britain from achieving cuts in greenhouse gases by exporting whatâs left of its own polluting industries. The MPs backed many of the recommendations of the governmentâs official advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change. But they complained that its chair, Lord Deben, should have declared the interest of his consultancy firm in Drax power station, the largest recipient of renewable energy subsidies in the country, and Johnson Matthey, which is about to make a huge investment in electric vehicles. A government spokesman said: ""From transport to heating, electricity to agriculture, we are working to put in place the right measures to help us tackle global warming. We welcome the committee's report and will consider its findings. ""We are going further and faster to tackle climate change than any other major economy having legislated for net zero emissions by 2050.""

"Health leaders have written to Boris Johnson issuing new warnings on the impact of a no-deal Brexit. In a letter to the prime minister, the heads of 17 royal colleges and health charities across the UK say clinicians are ""unable to reassure patients"" their health and care will not be affected. They go on to say they have ""significant concerns about shortages of medical supplies"". Government said it was working with the health sector on ""robust preparations"". The letter, co-ordinated by the Royal College of Physicians, is signed by the heads of organisations including the British Dental Association, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Kidney Care UK and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. It calls for the Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock to be put on the EU exit strategy committee chaired by Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal planning. The signatories argue that - given the scale of the NHS - without sufficient planning, even the smallest of problems could have ""huge consequences on the lives of millions of people"". And they say: ""The public rightly expects candour from us, and we are simply unable to reassure patients that their health and care won't be negatively impacted by the UK's exit from the EU."" Brexit: 'No guarantee' of medicines if no EU deal agreed Boris Johnson: UK 'will be ready' for no-deal Brexit School lunch standards warning under no-deal Brexit There are also, despite ongoing conversations with the Department of Health and Social Care, ""significant concerns about shortages of medical supplies"", the letter adds. ""Delays at the border could exacerbate current supply issues and create the very real possibility that life-saving medication is delayed from making it across the Channel."" There have been concerns there will be tailbacks of lorries at Dover and Calais with longer customs checks, if there is a no-deal Brexit. The government has said it is drawing up contingency plans to create more ferry capacity for medicines and other vital supplies on other routes. More than two-thirds of the UK's pharmaceutical imports come from the EU. Last week, the government announced a tender for a Â£25m contract for express freight services to deliver medicines with a short shelf life within 24 hours. Pharmaceutical companies have been told to build up stockpiles of six weeks' supply of drugs. Novo Nordisk, which manufactures insulin, told the BBC it had 18 weeks' worth of supplies in the UK and had secured ferry capacity to renew stocks. Please upgrade your browser A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was doing ""everything appropriate to prepare to leave the EU on the 31st October, whatever the circumstance"". And he said it was working closely with the health and care system and industry on ""robust preparations"". ""Patients can be reassured that our plans should ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted and they will continue to receive the excellent standard of care they currently do."" But Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other trusts in England, said: ""We are in a very challenging situation 11 weeks out, despite all sorts of planning taking place by health and social care systems. ""I think we need to look at those items which cannot be stockpiled - short shelf life items such as supplies for radiotherapy, things which need refrigeration"". Health leaders have argued elsewhere that the NHS will already be overstretched on 31 October, with winter closing in and the risk that flu cases will increase. They have noted that there is a virulent strain of flu in Australia, which has put great pressure on hospitals, and what happens there is usually a pointer to what will take place in Europe.

"Nicola Marshall said Lucas was ""my life, my soul, my everything"" A boy has died after falling from the balcony of a Spanish apartment while on a holiday with his mum and a friend. Lucas Briscoe, 12, from Lostock Gralam, Cheshire, was due to return home after a two-week break in the Costa Del Sol resort of Fuengirola when he fell on Tuesday afternoon. His death is being treated as an accident. ""I can't believe he's gone. He was my world,"" said his mum Nicola Marshall in tribute to her only son. ""Please grab your child and cuddle them today and tell them how much you love them because they're precious and you never know when tomorrow will never come,"" she added. Lucas, a talented singer and rugby player, went to St Nicholas High School in Hartford, Northwich, and had been due to audition for TV talent show The Voice this weekend. Lucas's dad Gary Briscoe said his death will ""leave a big hole in a lot of lives"" Lucas, his mum and his schoolfriend had been staying in a holiday apartment owned by Lucas's father, and Ms Marshall's ex-husband, Gary Briscoe. ""What should have been the final day of an amazing holiday ended up being the worst day of my life,"" said Ms Marshall, who was in the kitchen preparing lunch when Lucas fell at 13:30 local time. His friend witnessed him fall and has been left ""devastated"", a family spokesperson said. ""We had the usual complaints over hoovering and cleaningâ¦all the usual chaos before you go home,"" Ms Marshall said. ""I lost my world, my everything, when Lucas went over the balcony. A fall, a jump, a slip, a moment of silliness, boyish behaviour, annoyed at his mum for nagging him over hoovering. I will never know. ""What I do know one million per cent is that if Lucas had truly known the repercussions of climbing over, he wouldn't have wanted that. He wouldn't have wanted to leave this world. Not yet."" Mr Briscoe, who has flown out to Spain, said: ""I am devastated. No-one expects to say goodbye to a child and not in circumstances like this. We are devastated at losing our precious, vibrant and loving son. ""Lucas was a memorable character - funny, outgoing, sociable - he is going to leave a big hole in a lot of lives."" A Foreign Office spokesman said it was offering support to the family and is in contact with the Spanish police.

"Many of the victims were targeted on Madrid's Metro A man has been arrested in Madrid on suspicion of taking upskirt videos of more than 550 women and posting much of the content online. The 53-year-old Colombian man allegedly filmed the videos on a mobile phone hidden in a backpack. Police say he then uploaded at least 283 videos to pornographic websites, racking up millions of views. Many of the 555 victims - some of which were underage - were targeted on the capital's Metro system. I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back The man is accused of upskirting women on a daily basis since last summer when he began uploading content online. He also allegedly operated at supermarkets, sometimes even introducing himself to his targets in an effort to get clearer shots. Police started monitoring the suspect and arrested him while filming a woman on the Metro. In a video posted to Twitter, the National Police called the suspect ""one of the biggest predators of women's privacy"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Gers figures estimate the total amount of money spent on public services in Scotland Scotland's public spending deficit has fallen by a further Â£1.2bn over the past year, according toScottish government statistics,external. The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) estimated the country spent Â£12.6bn more on public services than it raised in taxes. This is lower than the Â£13.8bn deficit estimated for the previous year, and is equivalent to 7% of the country's GDP. The UK as a whole has a deficit of Â£23.5bn - or 1.1% of its GDP. The annual Gers figures, which have become a key battleground in the independence debate, are compiled by Scottish government statisticians free of political interference. Read the full Gers report,external What is Gers and how is it calculated? Transfer market: Read Douglas Fraser on the Gers debate They estimated the total amount of money spent that ""benefits the residents of Scotland"" by the Scottish government, UK government, and all other parts of the public sector in Scotland under the current constitutional arrangements, as well as the total amount of revenue raised by taxation. Revenue from the North Sea oil and gas industry was marginally higher than the previous year The report said that Scotland raised a total of Â£62.7bn for the public purse in 2018/19 - about Â£2.9bn more than the Â£59.8bn it raised the previous year. However, the amount the country spent on its public services increased by about Â£1.8bn from Â£73.5bn to Â£75.3bn. The report also estimated that Scotland raises Â£307 less per person than the UK average in taxation, while public spending was about Â£1,660 per person higher than the UK average.  Â£75bnSpending in 2018-19 Â£24bnSocial protection + state pension Â£13bnHealth Â£8.5bnEducation Â£3.8bnTransport Revenue from the North Sea oil and gas industry was similar to the previous year, increasing marginally from Â£1.42bn to Â£1.43bn. The industry raised Â£8bn in revenue in 2011/12, but hit a low of just Â£50m five years later. Last year's Gers figures originally estimated that the country had a Â£13.4bn deficit in 2017/18, but this was revised up to Â£13.8bn in the latest statistics. Scotland's deficit reached Â£15.5bn in 2015/16 - the height of the global oil price crash -  but has fallen in each of the three subsequent years. The estimated fiscal deficit for the UK as a whole in 2018/19 was Â£23.5bn - or 1.1% of its GDP. This was Â£18.3bn less than the previous year and the lowest for 17 years. Scotland's deficit as a percentage of GDP is therefore more than six times higher at 7% - and more than double the 3% target set by the EU for its members. Cyprus was the only EU state to break that threshold last year, with its fiscal deficit at 4.8% of its GDP - although it is expected to return to a surplus this year. The average deficit across all 28 EU member states was 0.6% of GDP last year. Most parts of the UK outside of London and its surrounding areas are estimated to raise less revenue than is spent on their behalf. Academics at Cardiff Universityestimated last monththat Wales has a deficit of Â£13.7bn or 19.4% of its GDP. Scotland had a relatively stronger fiscal position than the UK as a whole in 2010/11, but since then the position has been reversed largely because of the collapse in the oil price. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, pictured here with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, insisted that Scotland's economy remains strong The Scottish government's finance secretary, Derek Mackay, said the country's revenues had exceeded Â£60bn for the first time, which he said reflected the ""strength"" of Scotland's economy. Mr Mackay added: ""Our notional deficit has fallen while public spending has increased thanks to our efforts to grow the onshore economy and the strong performance of taxes in Scotland."" But he warned that a no-deal Brexit could reduce revenues in Scotland by about Â£2.5bn a year - and argued that independence would allow Scotland to ""unlock our full potential, allowing us to take the best decisions for Scotland"". However, the UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said the Gers figures showed that Scotland ""benefits from being part of a strong UK with every man, woman and child in Scotland receiving a 'Union dividend' of nearly Â£2,000 a year"". The Gers figures have been central to the arguments over independence in recent years Mr Jack said: ""These Scottish government figures also show there would be a Â£12.6bn black hole at the centre of an independent Scotland's finances. Real questions need to be asked about the first minister's stewardship of the country's economy. ""With Scotland's deficit now more than six times greater than the UK average, the Scottish government needs to take action. Scotland remains the highest taxed part of the UK. This is harming our economy and should be a huge concern to us all."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the figures showed an independent Scotland would have ""one of the biggest fiscal deficits in the developed world"", which he said would result in ""unprecedented cuts for Scotland's schools and hospitals"". And Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the figures showed the importance of ""breaking our reliance on oil revenues"" and ""the urgent need to build a post-oil economy"". Gers was described as the ""authoritative publication on Scotland's public finances"" in the Scottish government's White Paper on independence ahead of the 2014 referendum. The figures were also used as the starting point for the SNP's Growth Commission report, which examined the financial options for an independent Scotland. The commission, headed by former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, said Scotland should aim to reduce its deficit to under 3% within the first five to 10 years of independence. But pro-UK parties argue that the Gers figures show that the country would face ""unprecedented levels of austerity"" in the years after independence. The Scottish government has published a list of answers to frequently asked questions about how Gers is compiled which can bee seenhere,external, and the Fraser of Allander Institute has a guide to Gershere,external.

"Only two women make Forbes' top 10 best-paid actors list Scarlett Johansson has toppedForbes' list of best-paid actresses,externalfor a second year - but is only the eighth highest paid actor overall. The 34-year-old's income of $56m (Â£45.7m) lands her below seventh-placed male actor Adam Sandler. She earned $15.5m (Â£12.6m) more than she did in 2018, thanks largely to the success of Avengers: Endgame. Modern family actor Sofia Vergara is the only other woman to break into the overall top 10. Earlier this week, Dwayne Johnson was announced as the highest-paid actor of the last 12 months, making $89.4m (Â£73.6m) according to the latest annual rankings from the financial experts. Notably all of the top 10 actresses earned above $20m (Â£16.3) this year, compared with last year when only the top two - Johansson and Angelina Jolie made that amount. Johansson is set to reprise her title role in the Avengers spin-off Black Widow next year. (L-R) Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Aniston and Margot Robbie Meanwhile, Jolie - who earned $28m (Â£22.8) in 2018 - drops out of this year's top 10 due to increased earnings for several of the highest earners in the top 10. She is currently acting in and producing two forthcoming films - Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and The One and Only Ivan. Other names to drop out of the top 10 this year include Mila Kunis, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Melissa McCarthy and Gal Gadot. Unlike the male actors list, there's a notable lack of diversity among this year's highest earning women. Vergara is Colombian-American, but there are no black actresses in the top 10. Scarlett Johansson- $56m (Â£45.7m) Sofia Vergara- $44.1 (Â£35.9m) Reese Witherspoon- $35m (Â£28.5m) Nicole Kidman- $34m (Â£27.7m) Jennifer Aniston- $28m (22.8m) Kaley Cuoco- $25m (Â£20.4m) Elisabeth Moss- $24m (Â£19.5m) Margot Robbie- $23.5m (Â£19.1m) Charlize Theron- $23m (Â£18.7m) Ellen Pompeo- $22m (Â£17.9m) Dwayne Johnson will star in Jumanji: The Next Level later this year The list of top earning male actors was released on Wednesday. Dwayne Johnson - aka The Rock - climbed from his number two placing last year - despite his earnings actually being less than the $119m (Â£98.1m) he made in 2018. Last year's number one actor George Clooney has dropped out of the top 10. That's because his high earnings on 2018's list were down to the sale of his tequila company, in a deal worth $1bn (Â£753m). Forbes highest-paid actor of 2018 revealed The lists include celebrities' overall earnings, including brand endorsements and don't solely consist of payments for acting. Johnson's endorsements include sportswear firm Under Armour. In the last year, he has starred in the Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, Skyscraper and has produced films like Fighting with My Family and Shazam!. Later this year, he will star in Jumanji: The Next Level alongside Kevin Hart and Jack Black. L-R: Will Smith, Chris Hemsworth, Akshay Kumar and Bradley Cooper Elsewhere in this year's top 10, Chris Hemsworth has climbed to second place with earnings of $76.4m (Â£62.9m) Bradley Cooper has re-entered the top 10 for the first time since 2015 thanks in large part to directing, co-writing, co-producing and starring in the Oscar-winning A Star Is Born. He is the sixth highest earner at $57m (Â£46.9m) Having only appeared in one major film in the last year (Aladdin), Will Smith is down slightly this year, with his earnings of $35m (Â£28.8m) placing him 10th. Bollywood star Akshay Kumar is one of the most significant climbers, moving up to number four with earnings this year of $65m (Â£53.5m) Dwayne Johnson- $89.4m (Â£73.6m) Chris Hemsworth- $76.4m (Â£62.9m) Robert Downey Jr- $66m (Â£54.4m) Akshay Kumar- $65m (Â£53.5m) Jackie Chan- $58m (Â£47.8m) Bradley Cooper- $57m (Â£46.9m) Adam Sandler- $57m (Â£46.9m) Chris Evans- $43m (Â£35.4m) Paul Rudd- $41m (Â£33.8m) Will Smith- $35m (Â£28.8m) Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Family tells Victoria Derbyshire programme about life in container. More than 210,000 children are estimated to be homeless, with some being temporarily housed in converted shipping containers, a report says. The Children's Commissioner for England says that as well as the 124,000 children officially homeless, a further 90,000 are estimated to be ""sofa-surfing"". Her report,externaltells of families housed in repurposed shipping containers and office blocks, and whole families living in tiny spaces. Councils blamed a Â£159m funding gap. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said anyone who feels they have been placed in unsuitable accommodation should request a review. The report, entitled Bleak Houses, found the use of shipping containers as temporary accommodation was leading to cramped conditions and inhospitable temperatures. One mother told the report's authors she had to sleep with the front door wide open in the summer and her baby got heat rash - but in winter it was too cold. Often, the units have not been properly designed with children in mind, the report found, with ovens and other dangers too close to the ground and in reach of very young children. The Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, who visited children affected by homelessness, said it was sad and surprising to learn of the new developments councils were turning to in order to deal with the problem. ""Office block conversions, in which whole families live in single rooms barely bigger than a parking space, and shipping containers which are blisteringly hot in summer and freezing in the winter months,"" she said. The report does not contain data on how many councils are using shipping containers to house families, but it said areas where this happens include Brighton, Cardiff, Ealing, in west London, and Bristol. Bristol City Council said it did not direct families to the containers and only provided land for them, and the units were instead operated by a charity. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' Rough sleeping rises for seventh year 'Quarter of a million homeless' in England The families living in modern day slums Thousands housed in converted office blocks The Children's Commissioner also expressed concern about families living in converted offices. In Harlow, Essex, 13 office blocks have been converted into more than 1,000 individual flats. In one such building, Templefields House, some units measure 18 sq m and are being used to house whole families, with parents and children sleeping in a single room also used as the kitchen. Theaverage size of a home in England and Wales is 90 sq m,external. In the area surrounding another building,Terminus House, also in Harlow, crime rose by 20% in the first 10 months after tenants moved there in April 2018. Office block conversions are often located on or near industrial estates, presenting risks to safety, and are far away from shops and other amenities. Living in the developments can also be a ""stigmatising experience"", the report said, with children being referred to as ""office block kids"". This was ""compounding their sense of isolation and difference to their peers"". B&Bs are also being used as temporary accommodation, creating ""intimidating and potentially unsafe environments"" for children. The bathrooms in B&Bs are often shared with other residents and vulnerable adults, including those with mental health or drug abuse problems. Ealing Council, which has converted shipping containers into temporary housing, says the accommodation is much better than standard B&Bs with shared facilities. It says it has been pushed into using novel solutions because of the wider housing crisis. Of the 2,420 families known to be living in B&Bs in December 2018, a third had been there for more than six weeks - despite this being unlawful. Analysis in the report, released on Wednesday, found that in 2017, around two in five children in temporary accommodation had been there for at least six months. Around one in 20 - an estimated 6,000 children - had been there for at least a year. The figures used for the analysis of those in temporary accommodation relate to the end of 2018, while the number of those estimated to be sofa-surfing are taken from an official household survey for the year 2016-17. The report warns that a further 375,000 children in England are in households that have fallen behind on rent or mortgage payments. This means thousands more are at financial risk of becoming homeless in the future. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity, Shelter, said no child should be spending months, if not years, living in a shipping container, office block or emergency B&B. She said the charity constantly heard of struggling families being forced to accept ""downright dangerous accommodation"" because they had nowhere else to go. She said housing benefit must be increased urgently and that three million more social homes needed to be built. Local Government Association housing spokesman Martin Tett said councils desperately wanted to find every family a secure home. ""However, the severe lack of social rented homes available in which to house families means councils have no choice but to place households in temporary accommodation."" He highlighted a Â£159m funding gap in councils' homelessness services budgets, and urged the government to fund and give back councils their historic role of building homes with the right infrastructure required. The DCLG spokesman said the government had invested Â£1.2bn to tackle all types of homelessness which had helped reduce the number of families in B&B accommodation.

"Health leaders have written to Boris Johnson issuing new warnings on the impact of a no-deal Brexit. In a letter to the prime minister, the heads of 17 royal colleges and health charities across the UK say clinicians are ""unable to reassure patients"" their health and care will not be affected. They go on to say they have ""significant concerns about shortages of medical supplies"". Government said it was working with the health sector on ""robust preparations"". The letter, co-ordinated by the Royal College of Physicians, is signed by the heads of organisations including the British Dental Association, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Kidney Care UK and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. It calls for the Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock to be put on the EU exit strategy committee chaired by Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal planning. The signatories argue that - given the scale of the NHS - without sufficient planning, even the smallest of problems could have ""huge consequences on the lives of millions of people"". And they say: ""The public rightly expects candour from us, and we are simply unable to reassure patients that their health and care won't be negatively impacted by the UK's exit from the EU."" Brexit: 'No guarantee' of medicines if no EU deal agreed Boris Johnson: UK 'will be ready' for no-deal Brexit School lunch standards warning under no-deal Brexit There are also, despite ongoing conversations with the Department of Health and Social Care, ""significant concerns about shortages of medical supplies"", the letter adds. ""Delays at the border could exacerbate current supply issues and create the very real possibility that life-saving medication is delayed from making it across the Channel."" There have been concerns there will be tailbacks of lorries at Dover and Calais with longer customs checks, if there is a no-deal Brexit. The government has said it is drawing up contingency plans to create more ferry capacity for medicines and other vital supplies on other routes. More than two-thirds of the UK's pharmaceutical imports come from the EU. Last week, the government announced a tender for a Â£25m contract for express freight services to deliver medicines with a short shelf life within 24 hours. Pharmaceutical companies have been told to build up stockpiles of six weeks' supply of drugs. Novo Nordisk, which manufactures insulin, told the BBC it had 18 weeks' worth of supplies in the UK and had secured ferry capacity to renew stocks. Please upgrade your browser A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the government was doing ""everything appropriate to prepare to leave the EU on the 31st October, whatever the circumstance"". And he said it was working closely with the health and care system and industry on ""robust preparations"". ""Patients can be reassured that our plans should ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted and they will continue to receive the excellent standard of care they currently do."" But Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other trusts in England, said: ""We are in a very challenging situation 11 weeks out, despite all sorts of planning taking place by health and social care systems. ""I think we need to look at those items which cannot be stockpiled - short shelf life items such as supplies for radiotherapy, things which need refrigeration"". Health leaders have argued elsewhere that the NHS will already be overstretched on 31 October, with winter closing in and the risk that flu cases will increase. They have noted that there is a virulent strain of flu in Australia, which has put great pressure on hospitals, and what happens there is usually a pointer to what will take place in Europe.

"Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel will hold a working dinner on Wednesday evening Boris Johnson has arrived to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel, where he is expected to reiterate his call for the Irish border backstop plan to be scrapped. The pair shook hands outside the Chancellery in Berlin, as protesters nearby shouted ""stop Brexit"". The PM has said the arrangement to avoid a hard border after Brexit must be removed to secure a deal. But the EU has rejected the possibility of any changes to the backstop. Mr Johnson has said the EU's response to his demand to scrap the backstop, which he describes as ""anti-democratic"", had been ""a bit negative"". However, he said he would enter Brexit talks with ""a lot of oomph"" and there was ""a real sense that something needs to be done"" with the backstop. ""We can't get it through Parliament as it is,"" he added. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has cancelled a trip to Ghana later this week, urging opposition MPs to meet urgently to discuss ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit. It comes as an official close to French President Emmanuel Macron has confirmed that a no-deal Brexit is now his government's ""central scenario"". The official added that border controls would have to be reintroduced between the UK and the EU immediately if the UK left without an agreement. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he did not think it was true the EU would need to impose controls to protect its single market. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? What did we learn from Boris Johnson's letter to the EU? The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Brussels and former Prime Minister Theresa May, which has been rejected by Parliament three times. Mr Johnson has vowed to do all he can to renegotiate the agreement, but has insisted the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal - ""do or die,"" as he put it. Labour and other opposition parties, as well as a number of Conservative MPs, have vowed to do everything possible to prevent a no deal. They say it would severely damage the economy and lead to widespread disruption to areas like travel and food supply. Mr Corbyn has promised to bring a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson as a means to do that, and some Tories have said they would rather bring down their own government than see no deal happen. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said beyond his backstop demand, Mr Johnson would take a second key message to the German chancellor - ""renegotiate now and don't assume the anti-Brexit dissidents in the UK Parliament will find a way to block no deal."" What does no deal look like? And what preparations are being made for one? Are France and Germany ready for Brexit? Brexit ports assistance 'too little, too late' Speaking ahead of the meeting, Ms Merkel stressed that the backstop was a position of last resort and once ""a practical solution"" was found for the Irish border which allows trade and secures the Good Friday Agreement, it would not be needed. She also indicated, though, there would be no change to the withdrawal agreement. The military band at the German Chancellery is getting good at the British national anthem. It is the second time in three years they've laid on full military honours for a new British prime minister. Boris Johnson's ""do or die"" rhetoric has alarmed and bemused Berlin, but Germany's position hasn't changed since Theresa May first arrived here seeking a Brexit deal for Britain. The UK matters to Germany, but the integrity of the EU and its single market matter more. Angela Merkel will no doubt serve up her Brexit red lines over the working dinner. The Irish backstop is one of them. Prime Minister Johnson's threat of a no-deal Brexit sends a shiver down the spine of German economists and industrialists, especially at a time of global economic uncertainty. But even the business community here believe Germany and Europe must not put the unity and interests of the EU at risk simply to avoid the pain of such a scenario. Mr Johnson's meeting with the German chancellor is the first in a series of talks with EU leaders. On Thursday, he will travel to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron and on Saturday he will attend the G7 summit alongside other world leaders including US President Donald Trump. He is due to meet the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, at the summit in Biarritz on Sunday at 11:30 BST. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Conservative MP and former minister Ed Vaizey said Mr Johnson was ""hell-bent"" on a no-deal Brexit and was ""just going though the motions"" in his attempts to talk to the EU. Therefore, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the only way to avoid no deal was to find a way to persuade Parliament to back the existing deal. ""We've been looking at the wrong target. The EU has said again and again and again this is the deal. They've got 27 countries to support it; we can't even get 350 MPs to support it."" Mr Vaizey added that the onus was now on ""people like the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party"" who should support the withdrawal agreement if they genuinely want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Please upgrade your browser In a letter to Mr Tusk on Monday,external, Mr Johnson said the backstop risked undermining the Northern Irish peace process and must be scrapped. He called for ""flexible and creative solutions"" and ""alternative arrangements"" - based on technology - instead. That demand was met with a wall of rejection from the EU. Good Friday Agreement in the Brexit spotlight Mr Tusk said those opposing the backstop without ""realistic alternatives"" effectively supported re-establishing a hard border. The European Commission said Mr Johnson's letter did not contain a ""legally operational solution"" to the Irish border issue. Speaking to RTE, Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said: ""We are not going to abandon a solution that we know works for some kind of promise on the basis of trust... ""We are not in the business of being steam-rolled at the end of this because a British prime minister has rolled out new red lines."" Mr Coveney also insisted Ireland would not be entering into bilateral negotiationswith the UK regarding no-deal Brexit planning. The Irish border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity, and both the UK and EU agree that whatever happens after Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. The backstop is a position of last resort to guarantee that, but if implemented, it would see Northern Ireland stay aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. This video can not be played Johnson: EU 'a bit negative' over backstop demands On Tuesday, the government has announced that British officials would stop attending most EU meetings from 1 September, only taking part in those where the UK has a ""significant national interest"". The Department for Exiting the European Union said it would ""unshackle"" them from discussions ""about the future of the Union after the UK has left"" and allow them to focus on ""our immediate national priorities"". But the SNP's Fiona Hyslop expressed concern the move could leave Scotland and the UK unrepresented while it was still a member of the EU. The government is also ramping up its preparations for no-deal,announcing it will automatically enrol UK firms in a customs system to enable them to continue trading with the EU after Brexit. And the communities department has allocated Â£9m to councils in areas with key ports to help prepare for Brexit. But the Lib Dem leader of Portsmouth councilsaid the money was ""too little, too late"". However, Labour called for ministers to ""put businesses and the economy first, and rule out a no-deal Brexit"". Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Peter Dowd said the ""panicked announcement"" was ""late in the day"" for businesses and would ""not come close to  mitigating the disastrous effects a Tory no-deal Brexit will have on small business exporters"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We do need that backstop removed"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested an alternative to the Irish border backstop - a key Brexit sticking point - could be found within 30 days. Speaking at a news conference alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Berlin, she stressed it would be up to the UK to offer a workable plan. The PM said he was ""more than happy"" with that ""blistering timetable"". He accepted the ""onus"" was on the UK, but said he believed there was ""ample scope"" for a new deal to be reached. In his first overseas visit to a fellow leader, Mr Johnson is meeting Mrs Merkel after he told the EU the backstop - which aims to prevent a hard Irish border after Brexit - must be ditched if a no-deal exit was to be avoided. He will meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, before attending the G7 summit on Saturday alongside other leaders including US President Donald Trump. The EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. And - despite Mrs Merkel's comments - that message was echoed by Mr Macron on Wednesday evening. ""Renegotiation of the terms currently proposed by the British is not an option that exists, and that has always been made clear by [EU] President Tusk,"" he told reporters in Paris. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? What did we learn from Boris Johnson's letter to the EU? At the news conference, the German chancellor said a realistic alternative to the plan would require ""absolute clarity"" on the post-Brexit future relationship between the UK and the EU. ""The backstop has always been a fall-back option until this issue is solved,"" she said. ""It was said we will probably find a solution in two years. But we could also find one in the next 30 days, why not?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""You rightly say the onus is on us to produce those solutions, those ideas [...] and that is what we want to do. ""You have set a very blistering timetable of 30 days - if I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that,"" he added. He added that alternatives to the backstop had not been ""actively proposed"" under his predecessor Theresa May - but he was pressed by Mrs Merkel to spell out what such alternatives might look like. The prime minister has insisted he wants the UK to leave the EU with a renegotiated withdrawal deal, but the UK must leave on 31 October ""do or die"". Please upgrade your browser If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Brexit supporters fear this could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. Mr Johnson called the backstop ""anti-democratic"" and ""unviable"". Should we be optimistic about the scope for a Brexit breakthrough after Angela Merkel suggested a solution to remove the need for the backstop could be found - possibly even within just 30 days? Boris Johnson will certainly be pleased the German chancellor has left a door open. But don't get carried away. There's a reason Europe is so adamant the backstop has to stay in the Brexit deal - it just doesn't believe there is a workable alternative available right now. Boris Johnson says it's his job to find a solution and accepted a deadline of 30 days to come up with one. The pressure is firmly on the UK to find that solution - and it's going to be a huge challenge to put it mildly. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has cancelled a trip to Ghana later this week, urging opposition MPs to meet urgently to discuss ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has confirmed he would attend the meeting next Tuesday, but warned the Labour leader that ""all options must be on the table"". Mr Corbynhas proposedthat in order to prevent a no-deal exit, opposition MPs should help him defeat the government in a no-confidence motion and install him as a caretaker PM. If he wins the vote, he plans to delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. But the Liberal Democrats, and some potential Tory allies opposed to a no-deal exit, have indicated they won't back a plan that leads to Mr Corbyn in No 10.

"HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof The HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and Manchester will be scrapped, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Another part of the route, between the East Midlands and Leeds,has already been cancelled. Instead, Â£36bn funding will be put into alternative transport projects, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. That has been pared down to a high-speed link between Birmingham and London. It is aimed at cutting journey times, creating more space on the rail network and more jobs outside London. But HS2 has faced delays, spiralling costs and cuts. HS2 was meant to connectLondonwithBirmingham,ManchesterandLeeds. Lots of work has been done on the section linking London and Birmingham. Butthe government scrapped the Leeds leg in 2021,external. It decided to upgrade existing routes for HS2 trains, instead of building new ones. In June, the government said it would still build HS2 from London Euston to Manchester and the East Midlands. However,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said recently that costs were getting ""totally out of control"". Now, thealready-delayedBirmingham to Manchester leg has been cancelled. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link to connect HS2 and the West Coast Main Line in Cheshire and Greater Manchesterhad already been scrapped. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, Mr Sunak said the latest decision would save Â£36bn, which would be used instead in ""hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country"". This will include road and rail schemes. HS2 will now eventually run from London to Birmingham Interchange, with branches to central Birmingham and Handsacre, near Lichfield. HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre. The government previously said HS2 would cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, to 52 minutes. Before the link was scrapped, HS2 was projected to take an hour off Manchester to London journeys - from just over two hours to just over one hour. HS2 trains will still run to Manchester, and journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham and London by up to 30 minutes, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was originally meant to reach Euston in central London, although demolition work was paused due to rising costs. The government said it would ""get a grip"" on plans for the station's ""unaffordable designs"". It has already cut the number of planned platforms for high-speed trains from 11 to six. But if cash is not put forward by private investorsthen the high-speed line will only run from Birmingham to Old Oak Commonin London's western suburbs. It is unclear whether the same capacity across the line will be needed now the HS2 line to Manchester has been discarded. The cost of the project, the biggest of its kind in Europe, has grown. The first estimate in 2010 was for about Â£33bn. The government's most recent official estimate was about Â£71bn in 2019 prices. But this included Â£26bn for Birmingham to Manchester, which will now not be built. The government is currently updating its cost estimates. About Â£24.7bn had been spent on HS2 as of February 2023. This includes at least Â£22.5bn on Phase 1 and Â£2.3bn on Phase 2, including on the purchase of more than 400 properties between Birmingham and Manchester. HS2: Six reasons why the rail route is so expensive HS2 was due to open by 2026. Under current plans, HS2 trains would carry their first passengers between Old Oak Common and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033. Timescales for when Euston will open have yet to be announced. The government has announced the ""Network North"" scheme, with Â£36bn redirected from HS2 to road and rail projects. This will allow the objectives of the previous ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" project to be met, it said. ""Network North"" plans including upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull and Leeds. In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham recently said scrapping the Manchester link ""rips the heart"" out of Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the government said Northern Powerhouse Rail, including high speed rail links, will be delivered ""as previously planned"". Big decisions await as HS2 row simmers on What is levelling up and who is it helping? Mr Sunak diverting money from HS2 to road schemes ""shows how little he really cares about tackling air pollution, traffic and cutting carbon emissions"", Greenpeace says. Previously the HS2 project said it could provide ""zero carbon rail travel"" and create new wildlife habitats along its route. But environmental campaigners and conservation organisations had objected, saying it would destroy irreplaceable natural habitats. How much?

"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists ""there is a way"" to avoid checks along the Irish border after Brexit. But why has the Irish border remained a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations? If Brexit happens, the 310-mile Irish border will represent the only land border between the UK and the EU. As well as no longer being in the EU, Northern Ireland is likely to end up with different rules and standards to its neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. That's because the UK intends to leave the customs union and single market - arrangements designed to make trade easier between EU countries. Lorries travelling to the EU from Northern Ireland would be required to stop at the border for document checks and some product inspections. This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards. Following incidents likefoot-and-mouth disease,externaland thehorse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements. In theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called ""hard border"". Concerns have been raised that the return of a hard border couldjeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Irelandknown as ""The Troubles""to an end. Boris Johnson says there are ""abundant"" technological solutions UK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. However, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Their opposition eventually led toTheresa May's resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include ""the abolition of the backstop"". He says the current solution would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A ""wealth of solutions"" including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign. Supporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. However, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution. The problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. Single UK-Irish food zone suggested by report Border technology 'could take 10 years' Why are vets being recruited in Ireland? Alongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards. For it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. But setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling. Another solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in""mobile units away from the border"".,external However, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"",external- which would include the Irish border. The EU says ""geographic constraints"" are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases, ""a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" So getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules. DUP leader Arlene Foster also believes technology and other solutions can prevent a hard border after Brexit Mr Johnson has also suggested the idea ofan all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. But some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks. But the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border. So there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.

"This video can not be played Robert Lockhart says he had to continually chase officials over compensation and information Scrapping the high-speed rail link HS2 would be a ""disaster"" and prevent a transformation of the road and rail network, a strategy group has said. The government is to examine the costs and benefits of the project and make a decision on its future later this year. Although a review will ""rightly scrutinise"" the scheme, Midlands Connect said HS2 must not be dropped or the scope of the scheme changed. But farmer Robert Lockhart who has lost land to HS2 said it was a ""whitewash"". Phase 1 of HS2 between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with a second phase to Leeds and Manchester scheduled for completion by 2032-33. The government approved the scheme in January 2012, but last month the project chairman reportedly warned its cost could rise by Â£30bn and said it cannot be delivered within its Â£56bn budget. Lottie Jones met with her MP Boris Johnson in 2015 Midlands Connect, which works with local authorities and enterprise partnerships on the region's transport strategies, said the ""massive benefits of HS2 to the Midlands"" were already being felt. Its director Maria Machancoses said: ""We must not lose sight of the fact that HS2 will transform our transport network for the next century."" She said scrapping the project would ""be a disaster for the Midlands and the whole country"". But farmer Mr Lockhart, who has lost about 35 of his 280 acre farm on the Staffordshire/Warwickshire border to the project said he felt the scheme would not go ahead in full. ""There are so many people and companies involved that no-one knows what they're doing and they're chucking money at it and I've noticed such a waste of resources and time,"" he said. ""They've made so many promises over it and now the government is so fragile."" Curzon Street is due to open with seven high-speed platforms in 2026 Lottie Jones, a campaigner for Ruislip Against HS2, said she was glad the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is her local MP, was ""taking HS2 seriously"". But she said she doubted the independence of the ""long overdue review"". ""It is not too late to stop HS2. Even if billions have already been spent it would be better to put it out of its misery now than waste tens of billions more,"" she added. HS2 rail project to be reviewed Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? HS2 rail project cost 'could rise by Â£30bn' Ted Pawley, 69, who is a Perivale resident and campaigner against HS2, said he thought the review was ""fantastic news."" ""All these people who are for HS2 are the investors, living miles away from where all this will be happening, trying to convince us that we want this when we don't, not yet anyway. ""Let's spend that money on things we really need like improving the NHS, on schools."" Maria Machancoses said it would be a disaster if HS2 was scrapped The rail network is due to arrive in Crewe by 2027 and the station will become a hub when the line later extends to Manchester. Earlier this month, it was revealed a Â£137m extension to the West Midlands Metro passing underneath Curzon Street Station - a yet-to-be-built hub for the proposed route - had been delayed by HS2. Curzon Street is due to open with seven high-speed platforms in 2026 and the Department for Transport said work would continue at the site during the review. By Phil Mackie, BBC News Correspondent Many businesses have already relocated to Birmingham in anticipation of the project going ahead Work is already under way at Curzon Street in Birmingham to prepare the ground for where the new HS2 terminal will be built. Besides the facade of the old Victorian station and the sound of diggers there isn't much to see. However if you look back towards the city it becomes clear what HS2 means to Britain's second city. The skyline is filled with new office buildings and hotels which in turn are surrounded by more than a dozen giant cranes which are building the next developments. Many of those businesses which have already relocated to Birmingham, or are planning to do so, have made the decision based on the promise of faster connections to London and beyond. If the project were scrapped or downgraded it's feared that the city's great revival will falter or stop. However, if you live along the route and have seen little or no benefit from the new high speed rail line then today's announcement may be more welcome. The government's review will be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a civil engineer and former chair of HS2 Ltd. West Midlands Mayor Andy Street, who will be part of the panel, said he was behind the review and was confident the scheme would go ahead. He said: ""HS2 is mission critical for the West Midlands as it will free up the capacity we so desperately need on our existing railways, drive huge economic growth, and is already creating jobs and building new homes in the region."" Andy Street said he was confident the case for HS2 could be won Leader of Birmingham City Council, Ian Ward, said ""a U-turn would be disastrous"" and he would be making the case for the city when he meets Mr Oakervee. ""HS2 is about so much more than fast trains to and from London,"" he said. ""It's about jobs, homes and life chances. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to rebalance the UK economy.""

"The UK has been in a transition period with the EU since last January, during which rules and trade have stayed the same. But all of this will come to an end on 1 January 2021. With just a few weeks left for the UK and the EU to negotiate a trade agreement, both sides are now talking about the prospect of a no-deal outcome. If there's no trade agreement in place, they will have to adjust quickly to doing things very differently. So how are both sides preparing? For the first six months from 1 January, the British government will bring in only minimal checks on goods coming in to the UK, but the EU will have full border checks on goods coming into the EU from the UK straight away. The UK government haswarned thata reasonable worst-case scenario could see queues of 7,000 trucks clogging up the roads around Dover and the Channel Tunnel. The UK government has two contingency plans for this: Operation Brock and Operation Fennel. Operation Brock is a traffic management plan, which it is hoped will prevent more than 10,000 lorries a day from clogging up roads in Kent. Under the scheme, drivers of very large lorries will need to get a special permit - a Kent Access Permit - before they enter the county, and permits will only be issued if they have completed the correct paperwork for exporting goods. Other traffic will be kept flowing around them, in what is known as a contraflow system. Highways England istrialling the moveable road barrier,external, which makes the contraflow system possible, on the M20 over four nights from 11 December. If there are more than 2,000 lorries queued up, the government has made plans for several temporary lorry parks - it bought a 27-acre site in Ashford in Kent. There is also a plan called Operation Fennel in which as many as 7,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) could be diverted to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate. This is part of the government's plans for building facilities away from ports. If further capacity is needed, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. The UK government has also set up the Border Operations Centre to co-ordinate the response to any further disruption. Queuing at ports is not the only problem for lorry drivers. If no further steps are taken, UK lorry drivers would need to apply for documents called ECMT permits to be allowed to enter EU countries.The European Commission has warned that,externalthere are not enough of these permits available, which would mean not enough UK lorries being able to travel to the EU to pick up goods to bring back to the UK. The European Commission said this could result in serious disruptions, ""potentially even threatening public order"". To prevent this, it proposed allowing UK lorries and buses into the EU for six months without special permits, as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK. The proposals would also allow regular bus services that pick up and drop off passengers on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to continue to do so. The UK has not been clear yet on whether it plans to continue to allow EU operators to enter the country. A similar proposal is on the table for aviation. In the event of no deal, the UK would no longer be a member of the European Common Aviation Area, which allows British airlines to fly to destinations in the EU, and vice versa. The European Commission is proposing a six month regulation to allow flights to continue until a new agreement is in place, but it would require the UK government to offer the same to operators from EU countries. The UK has not yet responded to the proposal. The UK government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile and plan alternative supply routes in case of border problems. It has also arranged extra freight capacity for pharmaceutical companies should they need it. Ina memo, seen by the BBCin June, pharmaceutical companies warned the government that some stockpiles of medicines have been ""used up entirely"" by the coronavirus pandemic and said these could not be replenished in time for the UK's exit from the EU. The head of the Association of  the British Pharmaceutical Industrywarned,externalthat not having any sort of deal would cause ""increased complexity, duplication and cost"" in the middle of a pandemic. The government insisted, however, that ""robust contingency plans are in place"". For the coronavirus vaccine, the government says there are contingency plans for making sure the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine made in Belgium can be shipped to the UK if border problems arise. These include alternative sea routes and the use of freight oreven military aircraft. The European Commission has also proposed extending the deadline to reach an agreement on fishing until the end of December 2021. This would allow European fishing vessels to continue fishing in British waters and vice-versa for another year, or until an agreement is reached. But a Downing Street spokesman said the UK ""would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state"". The Ministry of Defence has saidit will make four patrol boats availableto monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place"". As things stand, if nothing is agreed then non-UK boats will not be allowed to fish in UK waters from January. But without a deal, the UK fishing industry would find its extensive exports to EU countries being hit by tariffs (import taxes) and regulatory hurdles. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? The French government has said it would hand out compensation to trawlers if they were not able to fish in UK waters.

"This video can not be played Family tells Victoria Derbyshire programme about life in container. More than 210,000 children are estimated to be homeless, with some being temporarily housed in converted shipping containers, a report says. The Children's Commissioner for England says that as well as the 124,000 children officially homeless, a further 90,000 are estimated to be ""sofa-surfing"". Her report,externaltells of families housed in repurposed shipping containers and office blocks, and whole families living in tiny spaces. Councils blamed a Â£159m funding gap. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said anyone who feels they have been placed in unsuitable accommodation should request a review. The report, entitled Bleak Houses, found the use of shipping containers as temporary accommodation was leading to cramped conditions and inhospitable temperatures. One mother told the report's authors she had to sleep with the front door wide open in the summer and her baby got heat rash - but in winter it was too cold. Often, the units have not been properly designed with children in mind, the report found, with ovens and other dangers too close to the ground and in reach of very young children. The Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, who visited children affected by homelessness, said it was sad and surprising to learn of the new developments councils were turning to in order to deal with the problem. ""Office block conversions, in which whole families live in single rooms barely bigger than a parking space, and shipping containers which are blisteringly hot in summer and freezing in the winter months,"" she said. The report does not contain data on how many councils are using shipping containers to house families, but it said areas where this happens include Brighton, Cardiff, Ealing, in west London, and Bristol. Bristol City Council said it did not direct families to the containers and only provided land for them, and the units were instead operated by a charity. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' Rough sleeping rises for seventh year 'Quarter of a million homeless' in England The families living in modern day slums Thousands housed in converted office blocks The Children's Commissioner also expressed concern about families living in converted offices. In Harlow, Essex, 13 office blocks have been converted into more than 1,000 individual flats. In one such building, Templefields House, some units measure 18 sq m and are being used to house whole families, with parents and children sleeping in a single room also used as the kitchen. Theaverage size of a home in England and Wales is 90 sq m,external. In the area surrounding another building,Terminus House, also in Harlow, crime rose by 20% in the first 10 months after tenants moved there in April 2018. Office block conversions are often located on or near industrial estates, presenting risks to safety, and are far away from shops and other amenities. Living in the developments can also be a ""stigmatising experience"", the report said, with children being referred to as ""office block kids"". This was ""compounding their sense of isolation and difference to their peers"". B&Bs are also being used as temporary accommodation, creating ""intimidating and potentially unsafe environments"" for children. The bathrooms in B&Bs are often shared with other residents and vulnerable adults, including those with mental health or drug abuse problems. Ealing Council, which has converted shipping containers into temporary housing, says the accommodation is much better than standard B&Bs with shared facilities. It says it has been pushed into using novel solutions because of the wider housing crisis. Of the 2,420 families known to be living in B&Bs in December 2018, a third had been there for more than six weeks - despite this being unlawful. Analysis in the report, released on Wednesday, found that in 2017, around two in five children in temporary accommodation had been there for at least six months. Around one in 20 - an estimated 6,000 children - had been there for at least a year. The figures used for the analysis of those in temporary accommodation relate to the end of 2018, while the number of those estimated to be sofa-surfing are taken from an official household survey for the year 2016-17. The report warns that a further 375,000 children in England are in households that have fallen behind on rent or mortgage payments. This means thousands more are at financial risk of becoming homeless in the future. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity, Shelter, said no child should be spending months, if not years, living in a shipping container, office block or emergency B&B. She said the charity constantly heard of struggling families being forced to accept ""downright dangerous accommodation"" because they had nowhere else to go. She said housing benefit must be increased urgently and that three million more social homes needed to be built. Local Government Association housing spokesman Martin Tett said councils desperately wanted to find every family a secure home. ""However, the severe lack of social rented homes available in which to house families means councils have no choice but to place households in temporary accommodation."" He highlighted a Â£159m funding gap in councils' homelessness services budgets, and urged the government to fund and give back councils their historic role of building homes with the right infrastructure required. The DCLG spokesman said the government had invested Â£1.2bn to tackle all types of homelessness which had helped reduce the number of families in B&B accommodation.

"The US retail giant Amazon has been criticised by customers for increasing its use of plastic packaging. While UK supermarkets and shops try to use less plastic, Amazon earlier this year introduced a new range of padded plastic envelopes for deliveries. One fed-up customer told the BBC: ""Amazon shouldn't be creating more plastic waste."" Amazon said its SmartPac envelopes are recyclable and that it is ""working to improve"" its packaging options"". ""Over the past 10 years, our sustainable packaging initiatives have eliminated more than 244,000 tons of packaging materials, avoiding 500 million shipping boxes,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. ""SmartPac mailers are kerbside recyclable in some cities, and in all store drop-off locations."" Concern is growing about the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our oceans, harming marine life. But Amazon said it urged customers to recycle its plastic envelopes, along with its Prime Now plastic bags. If your local council doesn't take them through its normal kerbside pick-ups, you can see where you can recycle plastic bags locally at theRecycle Now,externalwebsite. Alex, who works in higher education and did not want to share her surname, said Amazon ""has a duty to act and set the standard for others"". ""I haven't been buying from Amazon because of the way they treat their workers, and really this is the last straw,"" she told the BBC. ""Now that Greenpeace has found that microplastics and hazardous chemicals have reached Antarctica, this should be a stark warning to all of us that this is no time to be complacent."" A plastic bag along a coral reef off the coast of the Red Sea Andy Taylor, a retail manager from Leighton Buzzard, also said that he was upset about Amazon using more plastic packaging.

Alex wants Amazon to rethink its plans. She said: ""Even if the plastic is recyclable I am not confident that it all gets recycled, so where does it end up?

"This video can not be played Denmark called Trump's bid to buy Greenland ""absurd"" - he called that ""nasty"" and offensive to the US. US President Donald Trump has called the Danish leader ""nasty"" after she rebuffed his idea of buying Greenland. He lashed out hours after Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was ""sorry"" that Mr Trump had abruptly called off a state visit to Denmark. She has dismissed the suggestion of such a land deal as ""absurd"". Queen Margrethe II invited Mr Trump to visit Denmark on 2 September, and the manner of his cancellation has stunned the Scandinavian nation. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Trump took umbrage at Ms Frederiksen's remarks. ""I thought that the prime minister's statement that it was absurd, that it was an absurd idea was nasty,"" he said. ""I thought it was an inappropriate statement. All she had to do is say no, we wouldn't be interested."" This video can not be played President Trump also said he was ""the chosen one"" He added: ""She's not talking to me. She's talking to the United States of America. You don't talk to the United States that way, at least under me."" Mr Trump pointed out that US President Harry Truman once considered making an offer for Greenland, which is an autonomous Danish territory. He continued to make digs at Denmark online.

"This video can not be played Denmark called Trump's bid to buy Greenland ""absurd"" - he called that ""nasty"" and offensive to the US. US President Donald Trump has called the Danish leader ""nasty"" after she rebuffed his idea of buying Greenland. He lashed out hours after Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was ""sorry"" that Mr Trump had abruptly called off a state visit to Denmark. She has dismissed the suggestion of such a land deal as ""absurd"". Queen Margrethe II invited Mr Trump to visit Denmark on 2 September, and the manner of his cancellation has stunned the Scandinavian nation. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Trump took umbrage at Ms Frederiksen's remarks. ""I thought that the prime minister's statement that it was absurd, that it was an absurd idea was nasty,"" he said. ""I thought it was an inappropriate statement. All she had to do is say no, we wouldn't be interested."" This video can not be played President Trump also said he was ""the chosen one"" He added: ""She's not talking to me. She's talking to the United States of America. You don't talk to the United States that way, at least under me."" Mr Trump pointed out that US President Harry Truman once considered making an offer for Greenland, which is an autonomous Danish territory. He continued to make digs at Denmark online.

She told reporters the idea of selling the resource-rich Arctic island had ""clearly been rejected"" by its leader, Kim Kielsen, ""a position I share of course"". Ms Frederiksen also said the American president's visit would have been an ""opportunity to celebrate Denmark's close relationship to the US"".

Spider-Man is a Marvel comic book character - but in 1999 Sony bought the film rights for the superhero. Sony made five films of its own featuring the character - three with Tobey Maguire and two with Andrew Garfield. In 2015 the studio struck a deal with Disney and Marvel Studios, to bring Peter Parker and his alter-ego into the MCU. The deal meant Disney would co-produce and share profits from films featuring Spider-Man. Since then he's been in five Marvel movies: Captain America: Civil War Spider-Man: Homecoming Avengers: Infinity War Avengers: Endgame Spider-Man: Far From Home Allow YouTube content?

Radio 1 and 1Xtra's film critic Ali Plumb points out that Tom is still contracted to Sony for two more films so ""this doesn't mean we're not going to see him anymore"" but the movies might look different. ""There's more of a risk for these new, only-Sony Spider-Man movies not being as good as previous Disney-made Spider-Man films."" But it could be an opportunity for Sony to be more ""adventurous"" and ""edgy"", Ali says, even if they can't reference other MCU characters. ""They will be forbidden from doing so because they don't own the rights to any of those Disney Marvel characters."" That's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk and the rest. Tom Holland at the world premiere of Spider-Man: Far From Home in Hollywood Entertainment website Deadline has reported over the last few months that Disney and Sony were ""unable"" to reach new terms for funding of future movies. And it was noticed at Comic-Con last month Marvel's announcements for its next phase of films and showsfailed to include Spider-Man.

"A worker at the UK's Hong Kong consulate has been detained at the border for allegedly violating the law, China has confirmed. Media reports on Tuesday said Simon Cheng, who is thought to be from Hong Kong, went missing on 8 August during a business trip. China's foreign ministry said Mr Cheng was detained at Shenzhen for 15 days. The UK said it was ""extremely concerned"" and the embassy in Beijing was providing support to his family. China said Mr Cheng, 28, had been detained for violating public security laws, although the foreign ministry gave no details of the alleged offence. The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Huge crowds rally peacefully in Hong Kong Twitter and Facebook block HK misinformation Following large-scale protests in Hong Kong, travellers have reported heightened security measures on the mainland side, with people passing through being subjected to police checks of their mobile phones. The protests, now entering their third month, were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. A small group of protesters gathered outside the British consulate in support of Mr Cheng. Max Chung, a spokesman for the protesters, told Reuters the case had serious consequences for everybody in Hong Kong. Protesters held posters of Mr Cheng and signs saying ""England expects that every man will do his duty"" ""We want to urge the UK government to step up and act now. Save Simon now,"" he said, adding that Mr Cheng had not taken part in anti-government demonstrations. ""Simon is a very good guy, and he's a smart guy - he finished his Masters at LSE (London School of Economics) - so I don't think he would do anything stupid."" China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said they had made ""stern representations"" to the UK over comments made since the protests began in Hong Kong. ""We request they stop making these irresponsible statements, stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs and stop interfering in China's internal affairs,"" he said. He said Mr Cheng was a Chinese citizen and his detention was an internal affair. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows extent of Hong Kong protest BBC China correspondent Robin Brant said the detention was short compared to many sentences in China and that Mr Cheng should be due for release in the next 48 hours. He said China insisted the detention was not a diplomatic incident, but he said the Foreign Office had likely been working out of the public spotlight over the last 13 days to find out what had happened to Mr Cheng and secure his release. Earlier this month, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab raised concerns about the treatment of protesters in Hong Kong, promptingChina to accuse the UK of ""colonial"" attitudes. Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? UK 'should not interfere in Hong Kong's affairs' According to local outlet HKFP,external, Mr Cheng is a trade and investment officer at the Scottish Development International section of the consulate. It said on 8 August he travelled to a business event in Shenzhen in south-east China, which links Hong Kong to the mainland. His girlfriend told HKFP that he planned to travel home the same day, but did not return. In online messages, he wrote that he was passing through the border, adding ""pray for me"". Hong Kong police said they had inquired about Mr Cheng's whereabouts with the mainland authorities but ""results are still pending"". Earlier this year,China also arrested two Canadians, accusing them of espionage after detaining them for several months. It followed the arrest in Canada of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on behalf of the US.

"Louise and her family's hoard of old technology is typical of a UK household ""Ten phones, two laptops, digital cameras... all just sitting here. We're not dealing with it."" Louise Lewis is surveying a collection of old gadgets that have piled up in her home. Her technological stash, experts say, is typical. But it could jeopardise our ability to manufacture new devices. A study has estimated that as many as 40 million unused gadgets are languishing in UK homes. Each device contains multiple valuable and increasingly endangered elements. This video can not be played Smartphones contain around 30 different elements, some of which the Earth is running out of The growing, unseen shortage of ""rare earth elements"" was the impetus for theRoyal Society of Chemistry's,externalsurvey of just how much unused technology we are all stockpiling. The organisation carried out an online survey - completed by more than 2,000 people - which revealed that half of UK households had at least one unused electronic device and 45% of homes had between two and five. Most people admitted they had no plans to recycle their collection. ""There are about 30 different elements just in a smartphone,"" said Elisabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry, ""and many of them are very rare."" The metal indium, she explained, is used in a unique compound called indium tin oxide, which is vital for touch screens, because it conducts electricity and is transparent. ""It's also used in solar panels, so we're going to need a lot of it in the future. ""There's not a lot of it in the Earth and you need a kilo of ore to extract just a few milligrams of indium."" Most of us will not have heard of tantalum, but it's a highly corrosion-resistant metal that is ""perfect for small electronic devices like our phones"", explained Ms Ratcliffe. ""But it's also perfect for hearing aids and pace-makers,"" she told BBC News. Scientists estimate that indium and tantalum mines, among others, could run out within a century. Meanwhile, our demand for new technology continues to increase. ""Even the copper in all that wire is not endlessly abundant,"" added Ms Ratcliffe. ""On top of that, most of these devices are coated in plastic, which could be recycled."" 2019 is the international year of the periodic table Gallium: Used in medical thermometers, LEDs, solar panels, telescopes and has possible anti-cancer properties; Arsenic: Used in fireworks, as a wood preserver; Silver: Used in mirrors, reactive lenses that darken in sunlight, antibacterial clothing and gloves for use with touch-screens; Indium: Used in transistors, microchips, fire-sprinkler systems, as a coating for ball-bearings in Formula One cars and solar panels; Yttrium: Used in white LED lights, camera lenses and can be used to treat some cancers; Tantalum: Used in surgical implants, electrodes for neon lights, turbine blades, rocket nozzles and nose caps for supersonic aircraft, hearing aids and pacemakers. In short - recycle it; you cansearch for your nearest electronics recycling point online.,external ""Take it to your local tip,"" advised Stuart Price from Electrical Waste Recycling in Huddersfield. ""Or a retailer - distributors actually have an obligation to take back material when you buy a new product from them."" ""We need this material to go to reprocessing facilities, so it can be processed properly."" At electrical waste reprocessing plants, devices - even wires- can be broken down into their component parts for recycling Many people who hoard old tech are concerned about protecting their personal data, but a ""factory reset"" should protect that - and council tips and responsible retailers keep electronics secure before they are recycled. According to the Electrical Waste Recycling Group, about 500,000 tonnes of electronic waste is recycled in the UK every year. But that is only a fraction of the ""E-waste"" that is piling up in landfill and in people's homes. Much of the responsibility for that will lie with tech manufacturers, according to Prof Lenny Koh, director of the Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at the University of Sheffield. ""The current approach is not sustainable,"" she told BBC News. ""With increasing demand and reliance on smaller devices and more sophisticated technology, there'll only be more waste to be recycled. ""Manufacturers need to think about the entire life-cycle of a device at the design stage - so devices are built to be fully recyclable."" Ms Ratcliffe added that we can all help by delaying a phone upgrade for a while longer. ""This is the International Year of the Periodic Table,external,"" she said. ""So it's a great time to be thinking about all the amazing elements out there. And just by holding onto your current phone for another year, you can really make a difference in environmental terms.""

"The chairman of the High Speed 2 rail project has reportedly warned that its cost could rise by Â£30bn. HS2 chairman Allan Cook has written to the Department for Transport to say the high-speed line cannot be delivered within its Â£56bn budget,according to the Financial Times,external. The DfT said a review of HS2's costs is continuing. The line will connect London, the Midlands and northern England using trains capable of travelling at 250mph. ""The chairman of HS2 Ltd is conducting detailed work into of the costs and schedule of the project to ensure it delivers benefits to passengers, the economy and represents value for money for the taxpayer,"" the DfT said in a statement. ""This work is ongoing. We expect Allan Cook to provide his final assessment in due course."" What do we know about HS2? Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? The first segment of the project between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester expected to be completed by 2032-33. An HS2 spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on leaks or speculation. ""We have previously noted that our chair, as you would expect, continues to scrutinise the programme, and regularly reports back to the Department [for Transport]. ""We are determined to deliver a railway that rebalances the economy, creates jobs, boosts economic growth and is value for money for taxpayers."" Mr Cook was appointed to head HS2 in December 2018 after his predecessor, Sir Terry Morgan, resigned as chairman because of delays at the Crossrail project in London which he was also leading. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent There has been no denial that this letter was sent by the chairman of HS2 to the top civil servant at the Department for Transport. And none of my contacts have rubbished the ""potential Â£30bn overspend"" idea outright. Sources at HS2 and at the DfT insist Allan Cook's review is ongoing and that he has not settled on a final figure. That may be true, but there has been a subtle shift of tone in recent months from both HS2 and the government; a creeping acceptance that the project, in its current form, is increasingly unlikely to come in within its Â£56bn budget. And there has already been plenty of evidence suggesting that the project's original estimates of how much it would cost to purchase land and property along the route were significantly below the true values. This leak, which feels at the very least like a case of 'no smoke without fire', comes at a very sensitive time. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who has repeatedly insisted that the project HAS to be delivered within budget, is possibly leaving his post in a matter of days. Boris Johnson - considered the front-runner to be the UK's next prime minister - is by no means a die-hard fan of the scheme. And Mr Johnson has already nominated a former HS2 executive, Douglas Oakervee, to carry out a separate review of the project if he gets the keys to No 10 next week. Â£56bn was already a hefty sum. As a former senior official at the Treasury puts it: ""In terms of value for money it [HS2] scores lower than lots of other projects."" And the government ""is taking quite a big risk"" by putting so much money into high-speed rail, the source told me. That risk looks set to rise.

"The High Court in London will allow a proposed strike over pay and conditions by UK-based Ryanair pilots on Thursday and Friday. Earlier, the airline won a bid to stop Ireland-based pilots from striking, but more of its pilots fly from the UK. Ryanair said it would aim to minimise disruption for passengers and would be able to run its ""full schedule of flights"". However, it said it could not rule out some delays. Ryanair's lawyers told the Irish court that the Forsa pilots' union, which represents around 180 Ryanair pilots, had not let talks reach a conclusion before announcing the strike. Dublin-based Ryanair pilots vote to strike What's going on with my holiday flights? Pilots can be drafted in from elsewhere in Europe to fill in during strike action. Ryanair said it would inform passengers of any changes to their flights by email and text message. ""If you have not received any SMS or email from us, your flight is scheduled to operate,"" it said. Customers can alsocheck its website,external, it said. In early August, Ryanair pilots in the UK joined pilots in Ireland in voting to strike over pay and conditions. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) announced two 48-hour walkouts, one from 22-23 August and another from 2-4 September. But Ryanair turned to the courts in London and Dublin in a bid to block the industrial action, prompting Balpa to accuse the airline of ""bully boy"" tactics. ""We are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring about a change in Ryanair for the better,"" said Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, welcoming the judgement. ""Pilots in Ryanair are seeking the same kind of policies and agreements that exist in other airlines - our demands are not unreasonable."" Balpa's decision to walk out came only days after the budget airline warned of job lossesfollowing a 21% fall in quarterly profits, because of higher costs for fuel and staff, and reduced ticket prices. The union said 72% of its members at the company had taken part in the ballot, with 80% of those supporting strike action. However, Ryanair said that fewer than 50% of its UK pilots were members of Balpa, and of these, just 57% voted in favour of industrial action. In a letter to Balpa, Ryanair's director of HR strategy and operations, Darrell Hughes, said senior captains were paid up to Â£180,000 per annum and, because of this, pilot turnover had fallen to zero ""in recent months"". He said: ""At this difficult time for UK pilots facing base cuts and closures, Balpa should be working with Ryanair to save UK pilot jobs, not endanger them through ill-timed and ill-judged disruption of our customers' travel plans, just 10 weeks before the threat of a no-deal Brexit. We remain available for talks at your convenience."" On 31 July, Ryanair bossMichael O'Leary warned staff in a video message to prepare for job cuts,saying the airline has 900 too many pilots and cabin crew members. He said the two weakest markets were Germany, where Ryanair faced fierce competition on price, and the UK, where there were Brexit uncertainties. ""It's been a challenging summer, we're facing into a very difficult winter,"" he said in the video, seen by the BBC. But Captain Tilmann Gabriel, a former pilot who teaches aviation management at City, University of London, told BBC Radio 5 Live that pilots were in short supply, with 800,000 more needed over the next two decades. ""That means we need to produce... 110 pilots every day [for] the next 20 years and we are producing much less,"" he said. ""So of course the price goes up."" In a tweet, Ryanair welcomed the judgement from the Irish court. It said all Ryanair flights from Irish airports would now take off as normal. The airline had previously warned that the 180 pilots who were set to strike on Thursday 22 and Friday 23 August would put holidaymakers' travel plans at risk if the action went ahead. Justice McDonald told Dublin High Court that he would restrain the pilots' union, Forsa, ""from directly or indirectly, organising, directing or endorsing"" a strike by its members on Thursday and Friday. Forsa's lawyers had told the court that Ryanair had been ""curt and dismissive"" of a 30-page proposal it submitted to the airline on pay and conditions.

"The man was delivering a speech at an aquarium in Stockholm when he was bitten by the crocodile A man has been hospitalised after he was bitten by a crocodile that once belonged to Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The man, in his 70s, had been attending a crayfish party at the Skansen Aquarium in Stockholm on Tuesday. According to police, the man had his ""arm on the wrong side of the security glass"" when he was bitten. The animal is one of two Cuban crocodiles at the aquarium.

""It's been a challenging summer, we're facing into a very difficult winter,"" he said in the video, seen by the BBC. But Captain Tilmann Gabriel, a former pilot who teaches aviation management at City, University of London, told BBC Radio 5 Live that pilots were in short supply, with 800,000 more needed over the next two decades. ""That means we need to produce... 110 pilots every day [for] the next 20 years and we are producing much less,"" he said. ""So of course the price goes up."" In a tweet, Ryanair welcomed the judgement from the Irish court. It said all Ryanair flights from Irish airports would now take off as normal. The airline had previously warned that the 180 pilots who were set to strike on Thursday 22 and Friday 23 August would put holidaymakers' travel plans at risk if the action went ahead. Justice McDonald told Dublin High Court that he would restrain the pilots' union, Forsa, ""from directly or indirectly, organising, directing or endorsing"" a strike by its members on Thursday and Friday. Forsa's lawyers had told the court that Ryanair had been ""curt and dismissive"" of a 30-page proposal it submitted to the airline on pay and conditions. Earlier in August, Ryanair pilots in the UK joined pilots in Ireland in voting to strike over pay and conditions. Are you set to travel with Ryanair today or tomorrow?

"Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel will hold a working dinner on Wednesday evening Boris Johnson has arrived to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel, where he is expected to reiterate his call for the Irish border backstop plan to be scrapped. The pair shook hands outside the Chancellery in Berlin, as protesters nearby shouted ""stop Brexit"". The PM has said the arrangement to avoid a hard border after Brexit must be removed to secure a deal. But the EU has rejected the possibility of any changes to the backstop. Mr Johnson has said the EU's response to his demand to scrap the backstop, which he describes as ""anti-democratic"", had been ""a bit negative"". However, he said he would enter Brexit talks with ""a lot of oomph"" and there was ""a real sense that something needs to be done"" with the backstop. ""We can't get it through Parliament as it is,"" he added. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has cancelled a trip to Ghana later this week, urging opposition MPs to meet urgently to discuss ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit. It comes as an official close to French President Emmanuel Macron has confirmed that a no-deal Brexit is now his government's ""central scenario"". The official added that border controls would have to be reintroduced between the UK and the EU immediately if the UK left without an agreement. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he did not think it was true the EU would need to impose controls to protect its single market. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? What did we learn from Boris Johnson's letter to the EU? The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Brussels and former Prime Minister Theresa May, which has been rejected by Parliament three times. Mr Johnson has vowed to do all he can to renegotiate the agreement, but has insisted the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal - ""do or die,"" as he put it. Labour and other opposition parties, as well as a number of Conservative MPs, have vowed to do everything possible to prevent a no deal. They say it would severely damage the economy and lead to widespread disruption to areas like travel and food supply. Mr Corbyn has promised to bring a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson as a means to do that, and some Tories have said they would rather bring down their own government than see no deal happen. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said beyond his backstop demand, Mr Johnson would take a second key message to the German chancellor - ""renegotiate now and don't assume the anti-Brexit dissidents in the UK Parliament will find a way to block no deal."" What does no deal look like? And what preparations are being made for one? Are France and Germany ready for Brexit? Brexit ports assistance 'too little, too late' Speaking ahead of the meeting, Ms Merkel stressed that the backstop was a position of last resort and once ""a practical solution"" was found for the Irish border which allows trade and secures the Good Friday Agreement, it would not be needed. She also indicated, though, there would be no change to the withdrawal agreement. The military band at the German Chancellery is getting good at the British national anthem. It is the second time in three years they've laid on full military honours for a new British prime minister. Boris Johnson's ""do or die"" rhetoric has alarmed and bemused Berlin, but Germany's position hasn't changed since Theresa May first arrived here seeking a Brexit deal for Britain. The UK matters to Germany, but the integrity of the EU and its single market matter more. Angela Merkel will no doubt serve up her Brexit red lines over the working dinner. The Irish backstop is one of them. Prime Minister Johnson's threat of a no-deal Brexit sends a shiver down the spine of German economists and industrialists, especially at a time of global economic uncertainty. But even the business community here believe Germany and Europe must not put the unity and interests of the EU at risk simply to avoid the pain of such a scenario. Mr Johnson's meeting with the German chancellor is the first in a series of talks with EU leaders. On Thursday, he will travel to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron and on Saturday he will attend the G7 summit alongside other world leaders including US President Donald Trump. He is due to meet the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, at the summit in Biarritz on Sunday at 11:30 BST. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Conservative MP and former minister Ed Vaizey said Mr Johnson was ""hell-bent"" on a no-deal Brexit and was ""just going though the motions"" in his attempts to talk to the EU. Therefore, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the only way to avoid no deal was to find a way to persuade Parliament to back the existing deal. ""We've been looking at the wrong target. The EU has said again and again and again this is the deal. They've got 27 countries to support it; we can't even get 350 MPs to support it."" Mr Vaizey added that the onus was now on ""people like the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party"" who should support the withdrawal agreement if they genuinely want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Please upgrade your browser In a letter to Mr Tusk on Monday,external, Mr Johnson said the backstop risked undermining the Northern Irish peace process and must be scrapped. He called for ""flexible and creative solutions"" and ""alternative arrangements"" - based on technology - instead. That demand was met with a wall of rejection from the EU. Good Friday Agreement in the Brexit spotlight Mr Tusk said those opposing the backstop without ""realistic alternatives"" effectively supported re-establishing a hard border. The European Commission said Mr Johnson's letter did not contain a ""legally operational solution"" to the Irish border issue. Speaking to RTE, Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said: ""We are not going to abandon a solution that we know works for some kind of promise on the basis of trust... ""We are not in the business of being steam-rolled at the end of this because a British prime minister has rolled out new red lines."" Mr Coveney also insisted Ireland would not be entering into bilateral negotiationswith the UK regarding no-deal Brexit planning. The Irish border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity, and both the UK and EU agree that whatever happens after Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. The backstop is a position of last resort to guarantee that, but if implemented, it would see Northern Ireland stay aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. This video can not be played Johnson: EU 'a bit negative' over backstop demands On Tuesday, the government has announced that British officials would stop attending most EU meetings from 1 September, only taking part in those where the UK has a ""significant national interest"". The Department for Exiting the European Union said it would ""unshackle"" them from discussions ""about the future of the Union after the UK has left"" and allow them to focus on ""our immediate national priorities"". But the SNP's Fiona Hyslop expressed concern the move could leave Scotland and the UK unrepresented while it was still a member of the EU. The government is also ramping up its preparations for no-deal,announcing it will automatically enrol UK firms in a customs system to enable them to continue trading with the EU after Brexit. And the communities department has allocated Â£9m to councils in areas with key ports to help prepare for Brexit. But the Lib Dem leader of Portsmouth councilsaid the money was ""too little, too late"". However, Labour called for ministers to ""put businesses and the economy first, and rule out a no-deal Brexit"". Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Peter Dowd said the ""panicked announcement"" was ""late in the day"" for businesses and would ""not come close to  mitigating the disastrous effects a Tory no-deal Brexit will have on small business exporters"".

"Parents have been told they are responsible for getting their child to school Pupils in Moray are back at school but there is something missing from their journey to class. Moray Council has become the first of Scotland's 32 local authorities to completely scrap its school crossing patrols, as part of a programme of savings. Other measures mean grass has been left uncut, landmarks are threatened with closure and locals are having to clean public toilets. Two years ago the then leader of the council, George Alexander, claimed it could be ""bankrupt"" by September 2019if it was not given more money for services. It was in danger of using up all its ""rainy day"" reserves. Roddy Burns, the council's chief executive, toldBBC Scotland's The Ninecouncillors had to make ""tough decisions"" to balance the budget. The council has cut all school patrol officers As a result, the council is proceeding with Â£20m of savings over the next two years, having already taken out Â£40m of costs in the past decade. By cutting all 28 lollipop men and women posts at the end of last term it hopes to shave Â£120,000 off its spending. That means almost 12,000 school pupils in the area are now navigating busy roads without the help of patrol officers. The council chief executive said school crossing patrollers were ""a non-statutory service"" and in the current financial situation the council had to ""ensure adequate funding of those services we're obliged to provide"". Mr Burns added: ""Parents are reminded that they are responsible for ensuring their child's safety on their whole journey to and from school."" However, parents have criticised the move, saying it puts the safety of their children at risk. Laura Scott said cutting the school patrols was a crazy idea Laura Scott, who has a child at New Elgin Primary, said: ""It's a stupid idea. It's crazy. They should find another way that is not at the cost of our kids. Health and safety has got to be paramount."" Another parent, William Mackenzie, added: ""I don't think [crossing patrollers] should be taken away. The kids need them as this is a busy area. There are buses dropping kids off, and heaps of cars coming, so the kids definitely need them."" Locals have complained about overgrown parks The most visible savings can be seen in the council's lands and parks budget. The authority has stopped cutting grass in many communal areas. Locals have complained about the impact of overgrown parks on local tourism. The cuts have saved Â£45,000. It has also closed 12 public toilets across the area, including facilities at Lossiemouth marina. This video can not be played Volunteers in Lossiemouth have taken on responsibility for their public toilets following cuts by Moray Council Carolle Ralph is a member of Lossiemouth Community Council, which has taken over the running of the marina toilets. She raises money for maintenance and helps clean the facility. Carolle said: ""It is really important. And it is free and it's a basic need. It is a very important part of our community. ""We fully expect that, with the council cuts next year, it will be worse. We will have to take on the other toilets at the other side of the esplanade but we are prepared to do that."" Moray has also ceased maintaining some local landmarks, including Forres Town Hall, with local groups taking over their operation. Bob Kenny, a volunteer at Forres Area Community Trust, said such changes could actually give local communities ""real opportunity for people power again"". Other council changes include restructuring senior management at the council, increasing burial fees and reducing bin collections. Future measures will include increasing the capacity of some primary school classes and commercialising leisure services. A plan to close Keith Swimming Pool sparked a local campaign that resulted in increased usage and the pool being saved from closure. Moray is mainly rural and coastal, which can affect service delivery Changing demographics are a big part of the problem, according to council. Successive administrations have claimed that a rising elderly population is putting strain on its finances, while its predominantly rural location also causes difficulties with service delivery. Some councillors also believe the formula used by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) to distribute funds from the Scottish government gives Moray Council a ""raw deal"". Cosla insisted funds are distributed ""largely based on the principle of using needs-based indicators"" and it was committed to a ""fair settlement"" for all local authorities. Moray Council leader Graham Leadbitter also believes the council tax system is not favourable for the area, calling for a local income tax. In the short term, no. Council leaders believe that the current programme of savings should be enough to avoid bankruptcy. However, the council faces a spending deficit of Â£12m this year, as well as Â£9m next year. Its reserves could reach as low as Â£5m by March 2020. A Scottish government spokeswoman said it had increased Moray Council's budget this year by Â£8.8m to Â£180.2m. The council decision to increase council tax by 4.79% meant it would have an additional Â£10.8m compared to 2018-19, the government said. It added that it was in talks with Cosla to ""identify options for the replacement of council tax"".

"The man was delivering a speech at an aquarium in Stockholm when he was bitten by the crocodile A man has been hospitalised after he was bitten by a crocodile that once belonged to Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The man, in his 70s, had been attending a crayfish party at the Skansen Aquarium in Stockholm on Tuesday. According to police, the man had his ""arm on the wrong side of the security glass"" when he was bitten. The animal is one of two Cuban crocodiles at the aquarium. Both were gifted to Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Shatalov by Fidel Castro in the 1970s. Head of the aquarium Jonas Wahlstrom told Aftonbladet thatthe man was giving a speech at the time of the incident,external. Attendees used napkins to stop the bleeding as they waited for an ambulance to arrive. One plausible theory for Nessie, say scientists Kangaroos enjoy rare snow in Australia Badger rescued from pit on military firing range Mr Wahlstrom said that the aquarium would be assessing the animal's enclosure to ensure it doesn't happen again. ""Nothing like this has ever happened with these crocodiles before, we've had them for more than 40 years."" Mikael Petterson, police control room officer, told local media that the man was ""heavily bandaged""when officers arrived at the scene,external. The two crocodiles, Castro and Hillary, were given by Fidel Castro to Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Shatalov in 1978.

"Christy and her son Christopher Christopher Holmes has haemophilia A - his body lacks a protein that makes blood clot. A simple graze can mean the two-year-old bleeds uncontrollably. To avoid this he needs treatment every few days with a drug put into his bloodstream via a tube in his chest. But now, NHS England has agreed to fund a new therapy for patients like him. It's a medication that can be given weekly or fortnightly as an injection just under the skin rather than into a vein. Emicizumab, marketed as Hemlibra, mimics the action of the missing protein, factor VIII. Christopher's doctors are recommending he stay on his current factor-VIII treatment but consider switching to the new one when he is a bit older. Like other people with haemophilia A, he will need life-long treatment. His mother, Christy, 22, of Surrey, says: ""Without treatment, there's the possibility that he could have multiple bleeds every week, every day. ""He is quite an active boy, so he bumps his head quite often and obviously there's always the chance of brain bleeds, and bleeds anywhere really, without that factor VIII. ""Christopher has severe haemophilia A. He has literally got no factor VIII in his body until we provide it to him."" Christopher copes really well with having his treatment - but it can be difficult. ""He's really good with it,"" Christy says. ""He's not scared of things or worried. To him, he's a normal child. We try as much as possible to treat him like a normal child. But a couple of weeks ago, he was in hospital because he had a port infection[, where the tube enters his chest]. ""And sometimes he'll say to me, 'Mummy, don't hurt me,' when I'm doing his injection and that just kills you as a parent."" Haemophilia A is a genetic condition most often inherited but can occur spontaneously and usually affects boys and men. Now, about 1,800 patients in England living with severe haemophilia A will potentially be able to have emicizumab. People with less severe forms of the condition (but who have stopped responding to conventional factor-VIII treatment) have been able to get Hemlibra on the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales since 2018. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""Giving patients access to world-class, trailblazing drugs and therapies is a key part of the NHS Long Term Plan, which aims to save thousands more lives. ""As a parent, I know that cuts and scrapes happen to kids all the time but for many families these routine accidents can be distressing and life-threatening, so this new treatment will change lives and lift a weight from thousands of parents."" The Haemophilia Society chief executive Liz Carroll said: ""This decision is fantastic news for our community. ""Current treatments can require intravenous infusions multiple times a week which can place a significant burden on people with haemophilia and their carers. ""This decision will mean that people will have the opportunity to have treatment less frequently without intravenous access, which will enable many to live their lives more freely.''

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""come what may"" The Welsh Government would campaign for Remain in any future EU referendum, even under a Labour-led UK government, the first minister has said. It comes after Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn refused to say if he would support Remainin a second Brexit vote. Mr Corbyn's plan to stop no-deal Brexit involves defeating Boris Johnson's government in a no-confidence vote and becoming prime minister himself. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 31 October. Following the Leave vote in the 2016 referendum, the Welsh Government initially supported leaving the EU, while retaining close economic ties to the continent. Mr Drakeford said a future Labour government would ""seek to have a different conversation with the European Union, but that in any referendum that then followed, remain would be on the ballot paper. ""The conclusion of Welsh Labour and the Welsh Labour government is clear - Labour will put remain on the ballot paper and this government will campaign in Wales for a remain outcome."" The first minister also called on Mr Johnson to confirm beyond any doubt that he would not take steps to suspend Parliament in the run-up to 31 October to prevent MPs from stopping a no-deal Brexit. A UK government spokesperson said the prime minister ""has been clear that he is not attracted to archaic devices like prorogation"".

Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal planning for the UK government, said the document was old and Brexit planning had accelerated since Mr Johnson became prime minister. The leaked documents also suggested a no-deal Brexit could lead to the closure of two of the UK's six major oil refineries. Valero employs more than 500 people at its Pembroke refinery. The Milford Haven waterway in Pembrokeshire is home to petro-chemical firms, including Valero Stephen Crabb, Tory MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, warned a no-deal Brexitwould make it harder for Valero to increase investmentin its Pembrokeshire plant, but said the company is ""not suggesting in any way"" that a no-deal Brexit would mean the end of the site. The Welsh and Scottish governments haveboth expressed concernover the UK government's decision not to apply tariffs - taxes on trade - to imports of petrol in the event of no deal. A letter, seen by BBC Wales, said: ""We are alarmed by the UK government's apparent absence of industry consultation in preparing these tariffs, as well as their harmful impact upon a strategically important sector, crucial to our economies. ""Losing access to necessary free trade arrangements, in a no-deal outcome, alongside the imposition of the temporary import tariffs regime risks placing the sector at a competitive disadvantage."" The UK government said it was working with the industry to prepare for Brexit. ""We will continue to work flat out to prepare for the potential impact on UK refineries in the event of Brexit without a deal, and to be responsive to the needs of all UK businesses and consumers both as we prepare to leave the EU and afterwards,"" it added.

"The UK posted a smaller-than-expected budget surplus in July as government spending increased. The lower July surplus leaves the government finances in a weaker position overall for the first four months of this financial year. That raises questions over prime minister Boris Johnson's room for fulfilling promises over tax cuts and more spending. Borrowing so far this year has grown to Â£16bn, an increase of 60% on last year. A growing wage bill and higher spending on goods and services was behind the lower July surplus, which fell to Â£1.3bn. Analysts had been expecting a Â£2.7bn surplus, which would have been less than the Â£3.6bn booked last year. The government typically posts surpluses in January and July because taxpayers submit their self-assessment returns in those months. Those tax payments reached Â£9.4bn in July, Â£300m more than the same time last year, helping to balance increased government spending for that month. However, overall the government's borrowing position has worsened, said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club. ""Central government revenues were down 0.5% on a year earlier, reflecting a combination of weak activity and the generous increases in income tax allowances which came into force in April. ""At the same time, current expenditure has continued to run at a pace well ahead of that implied by the full-year plans,"" he said. Since the beginning of the financial year in April, the government has borrowed Â£16bn - Â£6bn more than it had by this time last year. The Office for National Statistics' forecast for the whole year was Â£29bn - so we are more than half way after just 4 months. So at this early juncture, the public finances are looking weaker than expected. Given some big spending promises on police, schools prisons, digital infrastructure, extra no-deal preparation PLUS the promise of a tax cut for those who earn between 50 and 80K PLUS a potential ""stimulus package"" to support the economy in a no-deal Brexit scenario, then it seems clear the government will have to raise taxes sharply elsewhere or abandon the last chancellor's target of balancing the books by the mid-2020s. Successive Conservative-led governments have been driven by an imperative to reduce, then eliminate the deficit. It's a target has been kicked into the future many times but not abandoned. The outlook now suggests a trajectory of rising government borrowing rather than falling and a new, uncharacteristic tolerance of it from a Conservative government. The lower July surplus followsa steep climb in borrowing in June. That month's Â£7.2bn deficit was driven by higher debt interest payments and rising spending on services. It was the highest June borrowing figure since 2015. The lower-than-expected surplus underlines the budget constraints facing Boris Johnson, who has promised to increase spending ahead of Brexit. The prime minister has made billions of pounds of spending commitments in his first few weeks in office and the government is also facing a hefty bill for no-deal preparations. July's surplus figure, released on Wednesday, forms part of a complicated picture for the UK economy, whichshrank by 0.2%between April and June, the first economic contraction since 2012. UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012 UK wage growth picks up to 11-year high The unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.9% in the three months to the end of June, but this remained close to a 44-year low. Nevertheless, median disposable household income was forecast to grow by 1.4% to Â£29,400 over the course of the year. And people are feeling the effects of that extra money in their pockets. Household spending grew by 0.5% between April and June as wage growth hit an 11-year high. It has never been cheaper for the government to borrow, which it does by issuing bonds. The interest paid on 10-year UK Treasury bills has fallen to historic lows. They now return just 0.5%.

"Louise and her family's hoard of old technology is typical of a UK household ""Ten phones, two laptops, digital cameras... all just sitting here. We're not dealing with it."" Louise Lewis is surveying a collection of old gadgets that have piled up in her home. Her technological stash, experts say, is typical. But it could jeopardise our ability to manufacture new devices. A study has estimated that as many as 40 million unused gadgets are languishing in UK homes. Each device contains multiple valuable and increasingly endangered elements. This video can not be played Smartphones contain around 30 different elements, some of which the Earth is running out of The growing, unseen shortage of ""rare earth elements"" was the impetus for theRoyal Society of Chemistry's,externalsurvey of just how much unused technology we are all stockpiling. The organisation carried out an online survey - completed by more than 2,000 people - which revealed that half of UK households had at least one unused electronic device and 45% of homes had between two and five. Most people admitted they had no plans to recycle their collection. ""There are about 30 different elements just in a smartphone,"" said Elisabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry, ""and many of them are very rare."" The metal indium, she explained, is used in a unique compound called indium tin oxide, which is vital for touch screens, because it conducts electricity and is transparent. ""It's also used in solar panels, so we're going to need a lot of it in the future. ""There's not a lot of it in the Earth and you need a kilo of ore to extract just a few milligrams of indium."" Most of us will not have heard of tantalum, but it's a highly corrosion-resistant metal that is ""perfect for small electronic devices like our phones"", explained Ms Ratcliffe. ""But it's also perfect for hearing aids and pace-makers,"" she told BBC News. Scientists estimate that indium and tantalum mines, among others, could run out within a century. Meanwhile, our demand for new technology continues to increase. ""Even the copper in all that wire is not endlessly abundant,"" added Ms Ratcliffe. ""On top of that, most of these devices are coated in plastic, which could be recycled."" 2019 is the international year of the periodic table Gallium: Used in medical thermometers, LEDs, solar panels, telescopes and has possible anti-cancer properties; Arsenic: Used in fireworks, as a wood preserver; Silver: Used in mirrors, reactive lenses that darken in sunlight, antibacterial clothing and gloves for use with touch-screens; Indium: Used in transistors, microchips, fire-sprinkler systems, as a coating for ball-bearings in Formula One cars and solar panels; Yttrium: Used in white LED lights, camera lenses and can be used to treat some cancers; Tantalum: Used in surgical implants, electrodes for neon lights, turbine blades, rocket nozzles and nose caps for supersonic aircraft, hearing aids and pacemakers. In short - recycle it; you cansearch for your nearest electronics recycling point online.,external ""Take it to your local tip,"" advised Stuart Price from Electrical Waste Recycling in Huddersfield. ""Or a retailer - distributors actually have an obligation to take back material when you buy a new product from them."" ""We need this material to go to reprocessing facilities, so it can be processed properly."" At electrical waste reprocessing plants, devices - even wires- can be broken down into their component parts for recycling Many people who hoard old tech are concerned about protecting their personal data, but a ""factory reset"" should protect that - and council tips and responsible retailers keep electronics secure before they are recycled. According to the Electrical Waste Recycling Group, about 500,000 tonnes of electronic waste is recycled in the UK every year. But that is only a fraction of the ""E-waste"" that is piling up in landfill and in people's homes. Much of the responsibility for that will lie with tech manufacturers, according to Prof Lenny Koh, director of the Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at the University of Sheffield. ""The current approach is not sustainable,"" she told BBC News. ""With increasing demand and reliance on smaller devices and more sophisticated technology, there'll only be more waste to be recycled. ""Manufacturers need to think about the entire life-cycle of a device at the design stage - so devices are built to be fully recyclable."" Ms Ratcliffe added that we can all help by delaying a phone upgrade for a while longer. ""This is the International Year of the Periodic Table,external,"" she said. ""So it's a great time to be thinking about all the amazing elements out there. And just by holding onto your current phone for another year, you can really make a difference in environmental terms.""

"Sony says it's ""disappointed"" not to be working with Disney on future Spider-Man films. We might not see actor Tom Holland in new Marvel movies because a fresh deal can't be reached over the character. The film rights to the superhero are owned by Sony - but he could appear in movies like Avengers: Endgame due to a deal between Sony and Marvel Studios - owned by Disney. Sony says it hopes things ""might change in future"". In a series of tweets, Sony thanked Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige for his ""help and guidance"" with the franchise. Allow Twitter content?

Spider-Man is a Marvel comic book character - but in 1999 Sony bought the film rights for the superhero. Sony made five films of its own featuring the character - three with Tobey Maguire and two with Andrew Garfield. In 2015 the studio struck a deal with Disney and Marvel Studios, to bring Peter Parker and his alter-ego into the MCU.

"This video can not be played Family tells Victoria Derbyshire programme about life in container. More than 210,000 children are estimated to be homeless, with some being temporarily housed in converted shipping containers, a report says. The Children's Commissioner for England says that as well as the 124,000 children officially homeless, a further 90,000 are estimated to be ""sofa-surfing"". Her report,externaltells of families housed in repurposed shipping containers and office blocks, and whole families living in tiny spaces. Councils blamed a Â£159m funding gap. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said anyone who feels they have been placed in unsuitable accommodation should request a review. The report, entitled Bleak Houses, found the use of shipping containers as temporary accommodation was leading to cramped conditions and inhospitable temperatures. One mother told the report's authors she had to sleep with the front door wide open in the summer and her baby got heat rash - but in winter it was too cold. Often, the units have not been properly designed with children in mind, the report found, with ovens and other dangers too close to the ground and in reach of very young children. The Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, who visited children affected by homelessness, said it was sad and surprising to learn of the new developments councils were turning to in order to deal with the problem. ""Office block conversions, in which whole families live in single rooms barely bigger than a parking space, and shipping containers which are blisteringly hot in summer and freezing in the winter months,"" she said. The report does not contain data on how many councils are using shipping containers to house families, but it said areas where this happens include Brighton, Cardiff, Ealing, in west London, and Bristol. Bristol City Council said it did not direct families to the containers and only provided land for them, and the units were instead operated by a charity. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' Rough sleeping rises for seventh year 'Quarter of a million homeless' in England The families living in modern day slums Thousands housed in converted office blocks The Children's Commissioner also expressed concern about families living in converted offices. In Harlow, Essex, 13 office blocks have been converted into more than 1,000 individual flats. In one such building, Templefields House, some units measure 18 sq m and are being used to house whole families, with parents and children sleeping in a single room also used as the kitchen. Theaverage size of a home in England and Wales is 90 sq m,external. In the area surrounding another building,Terminus House, also in Harlow, crime rose by 20% in the first 10 months after tenants moved there in April 2018. Office block conversions are often located on or near industrial estates, presenting risks to safety, and are far away from shops and other amenities. Living in the developments can also be a ""stigmatising experience"", the report said, with children being referred to as ""office block kids"". This was ""compounding their sense of isolation and difference to their peers"". B&Bs are also being used as temporary accommodation, creating ""intimidating and potentially unsafe environments"" for children. The bathrooms in B&Bs are often shared with other residents and vulnerable adults, including those with mental health or drug abuse problems. Ealing Council, which has converted shipping containers into temporary housing, says the accommodation is much better than standard B&Bs with shared facilities. It says it has been pushed into using novel solutions because of the wider housing crisis. Of the 2,420 families known to be living in B&Bs in December 2018, a third had been there for more than six weeks - despite this being unlawful. Analysis in the report, released on Wednesday, found that in 2017, around two in five children in temporary accommodation had been there for at least six months. Around one in 20 - an estimated 6,000 children - had been there for at least a year. The figures used for the analysis of those in temporary accommodation relate to the end of 2018, while the number of those estimated to be sofa-surfing are taken from an official household survey for the year 2016-17. The report warns that a further 375,000 children in England are in households that have fallen behind on rent or mortgage payments. This means thousands more are at financial risk of becoming homeless in the future. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity, Shelter, said no child should be spending months, if not years, living in a shipping container, office block or emergency B&B. She said the charity constantly heard of struggling families being forced to accept ""downright dangerous accommodation"" because they had nowhere else to go. She said housing benefit must be increased urgently and that three million more social homes needed to be built. Local Government Association housing spokesman Martin Tett said councils desperately wanted to find every family a secure home. ""However, the severe lack of social rented homes available in which to house families means councils have no choice but to place households in temporary accommodation."" He highlighted a Â£159m funding gap in councils' homelessness services budgets, and urged the government to fund and give back councils their historic role of building homes with the right infrastructure required. The DCLG spokesman said the government had invested Â£1.2bn to tackle all types of homelessness which had helped reduce the number of families in B&B accommodation.

"A worker at the UK's Hong Kong consulate has been detained at the border for allegedly violating the law, China has confirmed. Media reports on Tuesday said Simon Cheng, who is thought to be from Hong Kong, went missing on 8 August during a business trip. China's foreign ministry said Mr Cheng was detained at Shenzhen for 15 days. The UK said it was ""extremely concerned"" and the embassy in Beijing was providing support to his family. China said Mr Cheng, 28, had been detained for violating public security laws, although the foreign ministry gave no details of the alleged offence. The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far Huge crowds rally peacefully in Hong Kong Twitter and Facebook block HK misinformation Following large-scale protests in Hong Kong, travellers have reported heightened security measures on the mainland side, with people passing through being subjected to police checks of their mobile phones. The protests, now entering their third month, were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. A small group of protesters gathered outside the British consulate in support of Mr Cheng. Max Chung, a spokesman for the protesters, told Reuters the case had serious consequences for everybody in Hong Kong. Protesters held posters of Mr Cheng and signs saying ""England expects that every man will do his duty"" ""We want to urge the UK government to step up and act now. Save Simon now,"" he said, adding that Mr Cheng had not taken part in anti-government demonstrations. ""Simon is a very good guy, and he's a smart guy - he finished his Masters at LSE (London School of Economics) - so I don't think he would do anything stupid."" China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said they had made ""stern representations"" to the UK over comments made since the protests began in Hong Kong. ""We request they stop making these irresponsible statements, stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs and stop interfering in China's internal affairs,"" he said. He said Mr Cheng was a Chinese citizen and his detention was an internal affair. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows extent of Hong Kong protest BBC China correspondent Robin Brant said the detention was short compared to many sentences in China and that Mr Cheng should be due for release in the next 48 hours. He said China insisted the detention was not a diplomatic incident, but he said the Foreign Office had likely been working out of the public spotlight over the last 13 days to find out what had happened to Mr Cheng and secure his release. Earlier this month, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab raised concerns about the treatment of protesters in Hong Kong, promptingChina to accuse the UK of ""colonial"" attitudes. Why are the UK and China arguing about Hong Kong? UK 'should not interfere in Hong Kong's affairs' According to local outlet HKFP,external, Mr Cheng is a trade and investment officer at the Scottish Development International section of the consulate. It said on 8 August he travelled to a business event in Shenzhen in south-east China, which links Hong Kong to the mainland. His girlfriend told HKFP that he planned to travel home the same day, but did not return. In online messages, he wrote that he was passing through the border, adding ""pray for me"". Hong Kong police said they had inquired about Mr Cheng's whereabouts with the mainland authorities but ""results are still pending"".

"The UK posted a smaller-than-expected budget surplus in July as government spending increased. The lower July surplus leaves the government finances in a weaker position overall for the first four months of this financial year. That raises questions over prime minister Boris Johnson's room for fulfilling promises over tax cuts and more spending. Borrowing so far this year has grown to Â£16bn, an increase of 60% on last year. A growing wage bill and higher spending on goods and services was behind the lower July surplus, which fell to Â£1.3bn. Analysts had been expecting a Â£2.7bn surplus, which would have been less than the Â£3.6bn booked last year. The government typically posts surpluses in January and July because taxpayers submit their self-assessment returns in those months. Those tax payments reached Â£9.4bn in July, Â£300m more than the same time last year, helping to balance increased government spending for that month. However, overall the government's borrowing position has worsened, said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club. ""Central government revenues were down 0.5% on a year earlier, reflecting a combination of weak activity and the generous increases in income tax allowances which came into force in April. ""At the same time, current expenditure has continued to run at a pace well ahead of that implied by the full-year plans,"" he said. Since the beginning of the financial year in April, the government has borrowed Â£16bn - Â£6bn more than it had by this time last year. The Office for National Statistics' forecast for the whole year was Â£29bn - so we are more than half way after just 4 months. So at this early juncture, the public finances are looking weaker than expected. Given some big spending promises on police, schools prisons, digital infrastructure, extra no-deal preparation PLUS the promise of a tax cut for those who earn between 50 and 80K PLUS a potential ""stimulus package"" to support the economy in a no-deal Brexit scenario, then it seems clear the government will have to raise taxes sharply elsewhere or abandon the last chancellor's target of balancing the books by the mid-2020s. Successive Conservative-led governments have been driven by an imperative to reduce, then eliminate the deficit. It's a target has been kicked into the future many times but not abandoned. The outlook now suggests a trajectory of rising government borrowing rather than falling and a new, uncharacteristic tolerance of it from a Conservative government. The lower July surplus followsa steep climb in borrowing in June. That month's Â£7.2bn deficit was driven by higher debt interest payments and rising spending on services. It was the highest June borrowing figure since 2015. The lower-than-expected surplus underlines the budget constraints facing Boris Johnson, who has promised to increase spending ahead of Brexit. The prime minister has made billions of pounds of spending commitments in his first few weeks in office and the government is also facing a hefty bill for no-deal preparations. July's surplus figure, released on Wednesday, forms part of a complicated picture for the UK economy, whichshrank by 0.2%between April and June, the first economic contraction since 2012. UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012 UK wage growth picks up to 11-year high The unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.9% in the three months to the end of June, but this remained close to a 44-year low. Nevertheless, median disposable household income was forecast to grow by 1.4% to Â£29,400 over the course of the year. And people are feeling the effects of that extra money in their pockets. Household spending grew by 0.5% between April and June as wage growth hit an 11-year high. It has never been cheaper for the government to borrow, which it does by issuing bonds.

"An estimated 240,000 UK businesses trade with the EU The government has said it will start automatically enrolling UK firms in a customs system as it speeds up its preparations for a no-deal Brexit. The move will enable UK firms to continue to trade with EU member states after the UK leaves the EU. Business trade groups had urged the government to act after many firms failed to register for the system. The CBI said it was ""a sensible move"" but ""one of hundreds of things that needed to be done"" in a no-deal event. The plan to force companies to be no-deal ready No-deal Brexit plan threatens UK fuel plants 'No prospect of deal' unless backstop scrapped HMRC said all VAT-registered firms in the UK - which had not already signed up to the customs system - would receive an ID number within the next two weeks. The so called Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number will allow firms to continue to trade with customers and suppliers in the EU once the UK has left the EU on 31 October. Firms without an EORI number will not be allowed to trade with EU member states after Brexit. So far, 72,000 companies had registered for an EORI number. The government said its auto-enrolment scheme would mean 88,000 more firms would be registered. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the move would help ""ease the flow of goods at border points and support businesses to trade and grow"". But business lobby groups urged the government to do more to avoid a no-deal. Nicole Sykes, CBI head of EU negotiations, said auto-enrolment would reduce the risk of lorries turning up at ports without one of the necessary pieces of paperwork. ""But the web of short and long-term consequences of no deal go well beyond this, which are both complex and damaging,"" she added. ""That's why the government must put just as much time and effort into securing a deal."" Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said auto-enrolment was ""long overdue"" but still only ""a first step"". ""For many firms, it will trigger more questions. Businesses still need clarity on many other cross-border trade issues, such as customs procedures at borders following a no-deal exit and when the government will launch an official database to provide ease of access to information on tariffs and quotas."" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it will allocate Â£9m to councils to help make sure they are staffed to deal with any issues at ports. Kent Council will get over Â£2.6m due to the pressures it faces around the Port of Dover.

"This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? The government is launching a review of high-speed rail link HS2 - with a ""go or no-go"" decision by the end of the year, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. It will consider whether and how the project to connect London, the Midlands and northern England should proceed. Billions have already been spent, but Mr Shapps refused to rule out scrapping it entirely. He said it was ""responsible"" to see whether the benefits really ""stack up"". Phase 1 of the development between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester scheduled for completion by 2032-33. It is designed to carry trains capable of travelling at 250mph. What is HS2? And what will it cost? Scrapping HS2 'would be a disaster' What's it like to be in the way of HS2? Have you been directly affected by the HS2 plans? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external When asked about the money already spent on the project, Mr Shapps said: ""Just because you've spent a lot of money on something does not mean you should plough more and more money into it."" He said ministers were asking the reviewers ""just give us the facts"". ""Go and find out all the information that's out thereâ¦ genuinely what it would cost to complete this project, and then we'll be in a much better position to make that decision - go or no-go by the end of the year."" The review will be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a civil engineer and former chair of HS2 Ltd.  Â£55.6bnExisting budget Â£32.7bnOriginal budget Â£7.4bnAlready spent on the project 9,000Jobs supported by the railway 345 milesNew high-speed track 50 minutesJourney time saving between London and Manchester Lord Berkeley, another civil engineer who worked on the construction of the Channel Tunnel, will act as his deputy. The Labour peer has previously been critical of the project. A final report will be sent to the government in the autumn. During the Conservative Party leadership campaign Boris Johnson said he would not scrap plans for the new rail link, but did express ""anxieties about the business case"". In July, the current chairman of the projectreportedly warnedthat the total cost could rise by another Â£30bn - up from the current budget of Â£56bn. Labour peer Lord Adonis, a former transport secretary who worked as an infrastructure adviser to Theresa May, said the review was ""as stupid as you can get"" and would ""screw Birmingham and the North"". He tweeted that it would become ""a massive bun fight, while the transport department runs for cover and HS2 Ltd is paralysed by indecision"". The review will look into: cost estimates so far opportunities for efficiency savings the environmental impact, focusing specifically on net zero carbon commitment whether the economic and business case made for HS2 is accurate the added costs of cancelling the project or changing its scope, such as combining phases 1 and 2a (Birmingham to Crewe), reducing the speed or building only phase 1 Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling argued that new rail links were needed to take pressure off a system which was ""bursting at the seams"". And in June this year, more than 20 business leadersurged the governmentto deliver HS2 in full, arguing it would ""spread the flow of investment across the Midlands, the North of England and into Scotland"". The Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who will sit on the review panel, said HS2 was ""vital"" for the West Midlands and was ""already creating jobs and building new homes"". But Conservative MP Dame Cheryl Gillan, whose constituency HS2 will run through, told BBC Radio 4's World at One its costs had risen ""astronomically"" and it was ""now completely unviable in terms of value for money for the British taxpayer"". In May, a committee of peersargued the projectrisked ""short changing"" the North of England. Their report said the scheme put too much emphasis on cutting journey times and not enough on the economic impact on regions. It also called for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme - a separate scheme connecting towns and cities in the region - to be completed alongside HS2. Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, who supports HS2, complained that the review panel included two elected representatives from the West Midlands but none from the North. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Labour supported investment in new rail capacity, adding that ""improved governance of railway expansion is needed, not least over the HS2 project."" One Conservative MP, Bob Seely suggested the ""top half"" of HS2 - the section covering the North of England - should be built, but not the Birmingham to London route, which he described as ""a monumental white elephant"". The key question is, is HS2 value for money? One former senior figure at the Treasury said to me recently that in terms of that it scores much lower than many other projects, so the government is taking quite a big risk putting so much money into it. The government could cancel it - but, of course, the main caveat to that is the amount that has already been spent and would be lost. For all the opposition to it, HS2 also has a lot of passionate supporters too and they would be unhappy. Rather than scrapping it altogether then, perhaps the more plausible option is altering the plans in some way. Trust me though, even doing will not be straightforward for financial or legal reasons. Joe Rukin, from the Stop HS2 campaign, said: ""If this is a genuine review, they must stop work now, because irreparable damage is being done right now to unique habitats, ancient woodlands."" He accused HS2 of ""sending out possession orders like there is no tomorrow"", referring tothe compulsory purchase of propertiesin the path of the line. He also raised concerns that the review chairman, Mr Oakervee, was being given a chance to ""mark his own homework"" given his previous role on the project. Allow Twitter content?

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK will leave the EU on 31 October ""come what may"" The Welsh Government would campaign for Remain in any future EU referendum, even under a Labour-led UK government, the first minister has said. It comes after Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn refused to say if he would support Remainin a second Brexit vote. Mr Corbyn's plan to stop no-deal Brexit involves defeating Boris Johnson's government in a no-confidence vote and becoming prime minister himself. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 31 October. Following the Leave vote in the 2016 referendum, the Welsh Government initially supported leaving the EU, while retaining close economic ties to the continent. Mr Drakeford said a future Labour government would ""seek to have a different conversation with the European Union, but that in any referendum that then followed, remain would be on the ballot paper. ""The conclusion of Welsh Labour and the Welsh Labour government is clear - Labour will put remain on the ballot paper and this government will campaign in Wales for a remain outcome."" The first minister also called on Mr Johnson to confirm beyond any doubt that he would not take steps to suspend Parliament in the run-up to 31 October to prevent MPs from stopping a no-deal Brexit. A UK government spokesperson said the prime minister ""has been clear that he is not attracted to archaic devices like prorogation"".

Mr Drakeford pointed to aleaked cross-government study,external, which warned of food and medicine shortages, months of disruption at UK ports and a rise in public disorder in the event of no deal, ""reflects"" the concerns of the Welsh Government. Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal planning for the UK government, said the document was old and Brexit planning had accelerated since Mr Johnson became prime minister. The leaked documents also suggested a no-deal Brexit could lead to the closure of two of the UK's six major oil refineries. Valero employs more than 500 people at its Pembroke refinery. The Milford Haven waterway in Pembrokeshire is home to petro-chemical firms, including Valero Stephen Crabb, Tory MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, warned a no-deal Brexitwould make it harder for Valero to increase investmentin its Pembrokeshire plant, but said the company is ""not suggesting in any way"" that a no-deal Brexit would mean the end of the site. The Welsh and Scottish governments haveboth expressed concernover the UK government's decision not to apply tariffs - taxes on trade - to imports of petrol in the event of no deal. A letter, seen by BBC Wales, said: ""We are alarmed by the UK government's apparent absence of industry consultation in preparing these tariffs, as well as their harmful impact upon a strategically important sector, crucial to our economies. ""Losing access to necessary free trade arrangements, in a no-deal outcome, alongside the imposition of the temporary import tariffs regime risks placing the sector at a competitive disadvantage."" The UK government said it was working with the industry to prepare for Brexit. ""We will continue to work flat out to prepare for the potential impact on UK refineries in the event of Brexit without a deal, and to be responsive to the needs of all UK businesses and consumers both as we prepare to leave the EU and afterwards,"" it added.

"This video can not be played Watch: Greenland wouldn't be the first time the US bought territory US President Donald Trump has cancelled a state visit to Denmark after the nation's prime minister said Greenland was not for sale to the US. The president was scheduled to visit on 2 September, at the invitation of Denmark's Queen Margrethe II. Then last week Mr Trump suggested the US was interested in buying Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen described the suggestion as ""absurd"" and said she hoped Mr Trump was not being serious. Donald Trump and Greenland: Why would he want to buy it? Ms Frederiksen is due to give a statement later on Wednesday. While praising Denmark as a ""very special country"", Mr Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday that his planned visit would no longer go ahead because Ms Frederiksen had ""no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland"". The cancellation was confirmed by a White House spokesman. The Danish royal house also confirmed it had been informed of the cancellation. The house's head of communications, Lene Balleby, told the BBC ""it was definitely a surprise"". Just hours before Mr Trump announced the cancellation, the US ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, tweeted: ""Denmark is ready for the POTUS @realDonaldTrump visit! Partner, ally, friend."" Greenland: What you need to know Mr Trump had earlier confirmed reports that he was interested in buying Greenland. When asked on Sunday if he would consider trading a US territory for the island, he replied: ""Well, a lot of things could be done."" ""Essentially it's a large real estate deal,"" he said. Then, on Monday, the US president posted an image on social media showing a tall golden skyscraper among the homes of a small village on the island. Allow Twitter content?

The cancellation of what was considered an important state visit in Denmark was described as a ""farce"" by the leader of the populist Danish People's Party, Kristian Thulesen Dahl. ""What is this man thinking of though? And with grounds that are worthy of an April Fools' joke,"" he wrote in a tweet. Danish Conservative MP Rasmus Jarlov, who earlier said that ""of all things that are not going to happen, this is the most unlikely"", accused Mr Trump of lacking respect for his country in a tweet on Wednesday.

Former foreign minister Kristian Jensen said Mr Trump's move had resulted in ""total chaos"". ""It has gone from a great opportunity for enhanced dialogue between allies to a diplomatic crisis,"" he said, adding: ""Need to get the co-operation back on track."" A spokeswoman for the leftist Red-Green Alliance, Pernille Skipper, said: ""Trump lives on another planet. Self-sufficient and disrespectful."" Pia Kjaersgaard, the populist former speaker of the Danish parliament, said it showed a ""complete lack of respect"", adding: ""Rude behaviour to the Danish people and the Queen, who invited him."" Danish royal expert and historian Lars Hovbakke Sorensen said the whole episode was ""very strange"". ""This is a violation of all traditions and etiquettes and makes it seem like the Trump administration views state visits in a completely different way,"" he told Danish broadcaster TV2. Mr Trump has reportedly taken an interest in Greenland, in part, because of its natural resources, such as coal, zinc, copper and iron ore. But while Greenland might be rich in minerals, it currently relies on Denmark for two thirds of its budget revenue. It has high rates of suicide, alcoholism and unemployment. President Trump confirmed reports he was interested in buying Greenland Two people briefed on the discussions told the New York Timesthe president was also interested in Greenland's ""national security value"",externalbecause of its location. The US has long seen the island, which sits along a direct route from Europe to North America, as being strategically important. It established the Thule air force and radar base there at the start of the Cold War, which now covers space surveillance and forms the northernmost part of the US ballistic missile early warning system. Meanwhile, new Arctic sea routes are opening up as climate change continues to accelerate the melting of ice in the region. Is the Arctic set to become a main shipping route? Mr Trump's latest bid also comes at a time that China is taking a big interest in the area. Last year, a Chinese state-owned construction company announced plans to build new airports in Greenland - but withdrew them in June this year. Republican Representative Mike Gallagherdescribed Mr Trump's idea as a ""smart geopolitical move"".,external ""The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table,"" he tweeted. Greenland is the largest island in the world (after Australia, which is defined as a continent in its own right). It is an autonomous Danish territory, located between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. It has a population of about 56,000 people concentrated around the coastline. Almost 90% are indigenous Greenlandic Inuit people. It has a limited self-government and its own parliament. The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss 'Why I translate all of Trump's tweets into Chinese' More than 80% of the island is covered by an ice cap which is feared to be melting due to global warming. The ice melt has increased access to the island's mineral resources. But it is also believed that the receding ice may expose toxic nuclear waste that was left at several US military sites during the Cold War. The idea of purchasing Greenland was first mooted during the 1860s under the presidency of Andrew Johnson. In 1867,a report by the US State Department,externalsuggested that Greenland's strategic location, along with its abundance of resources, made it an ideal acquisition. But no official move was made until 1946, when Harry Truman offered Denmark $100m for the territory. He had earlier toyed with the idea of swapping land in Alaska for strategic parts of Greenland, AP reported.

"The UK has been in a transition period with the EU since last January, during which rules and trade have stayed the same. But all of this will come to an end on 1 January 2021. With just a few weeks left for the UK and the EU to negotiate a trade agreement, both sides are now talking about the prospect of a no-deal outcome. If there's no trade agreement in place, they will have to adjust quickly to doing things very differently. So how are both sides preparing? For the first six months from 1 January, the British government will bring in only minimal checks on goods coming in to the UK, but the EU will have full border checks on goods coming into the EU from the UK straight away. The UK government haswarned thata reasonable worst-case scenario could see queues of 7,000 trucks clogging up the roads around Dover and the Channel Tunnel. The UK government has two contingency plans for this: Operation Brock and Operation Fennel. Operation Brock is a traffic management plan, which it is hoped will prevent more than 10,000 lorries a day from clogging up roads in Kent. Under the scheme, drivers of very large lorries will need to get a special permit - a Kent Access Permit - before they enter the county, and permits will only be issued if they have completed the correct paperwork for exporting goods. Other traffic will be kept flowing around them, in what is known as a contraflow system. Highways England istrialling the moveable road barrier,external, which makes the contraflow system possible, on the M20 over four nights from 11 December. If there are more than 2,000 lorries queued up, the government has made plans for several temporary lorry parks - it bought a 27-acre site in Ashford in Kent. There is also a plan called Operation Fennel in which as many as 7,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) could be diverted to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate. This is part of the government's plans for building facilities away from ports. If further capacity is needed, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. The UK government has also set up the Border Operations Centre to co-ordinate the response to any further disruption. Queuing at ports is not the only problem for lorry drivers. If no further steps are taken, UK lorry drivers would need to apply for documents called ECMT permits to be allowed to enter EU countries.The European Commission has warned that,externalthere are not enough of these permits available, which would mean not enough UK lorries being able to travel to the EU to pick up goods to bring back to the UK. The European Commission said this could result in serious disruptions, ""potentially even threatening public order"". To prevent this, it proposed allowing UK lorries and buses into the EU for six months without special permits, as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK. The proposals would also allow regular bus services that pick up and drop off passengers on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to continue to do so. The UK has not been clear yet on whether it plans to continue to allow EU operators to enter the country. A similar proposal is on the table for aviation. In the event of no deal, the UK would no longer be a member of the European Common Aviation Area, which allows British airlines to fly to destinations in the EU, and vice versa. The European Commission is proposing a six month regulation to allow flights to continue until a new agreement is in place, but it would require the UK government to offer the same to operators from EU countries. The UK has not yet responded to the proposal. The UK government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile and plan alternative supply routes in case of border problems. It has also arranged extra freight capacity for pharmaceutical companies should they need it. Ina memo, seen by the BBCin June, pharmaceutical companies warned the government that some stockpiles of medicines have been ""used up entirely"" by the coronavirus pandemic and said these could not be replenished in time for the UK's exit from the EU. The head of the Association of  the British Pharmaceutical Industrywarned,externalthat not having any sort of deal would cause ""increased complexity, duplication and cost"" in the middle of a pandemic. The government insisted, however, that ""robust contingency plans are in place"". For the coronavirus vaccine, the government says there are contingency plans for making sure the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine made in Belgium can be shipped to the UK if border problems arise. These include alternative sea routes and the use of freight oreven military aircraft. The European Commission has also proposed extending the deadline to reach an agreement on fishing until the end of December 2021. This would allow European fishing vessels to continue fishing in British waters and vice-versa for another year, or until an agreement is reached. But a Downing Street spokesman said the UK ""would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state"". The Ministry of Defence has saidit will make four patrol boats availableto monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place"". As things stand, if nothing is agreed then non-UK boats will not be allowed to fish in UK waters from January. But without a deal, the UK fishing industry would find its extensive exports to EU countries being hit by tariffs (import taxes) and regulatory hurdles. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? The French government has said it would hand out compensation to trawlers if they were not able to fish in UK waters.

"George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes Reporting on a secret trial can be confronting and confusing. For several months, journalists like me have been going back and forth to Melbourne's County Court, unable to broadcast what we'd learnt about George Pell's crimes. Now the suppression order on the case has been lifted, those details can finally be made public. Outside court, there was at times high drama - all the sound and fury of cameramen jostling and campaigners brandishing placards at the cardinal as he arrived. But after the initial hearings, the crowds and the cameras petered out, and the cardinal no longer needed a police escort to sweep him into the building. Cardinal Pell: Poisoned power at the top Why Pell's conviction was kept a secret How will the Pope tackle abuse in the Catholic Church? Sex abuse and the Catholic Church Inside court, things also settled into a predictable routine. George Pell would sit in the dock with his notebook, listening, writing, but never really betraying any emotion. He was excused from standing due to a knee injury, and often sat with his legs stretched out. He wasn't called to give evidence, and so we didn't hear a word from him for the majority of the trial. As the court heard vivid descriptions of how in 1996 he had forced himself upon two victims, pushing his archbishop's robes to one side in order to expose himself, he didn't flinch Pell's case has drawn huge attention around the world The jury was told how one young boy had pleaded for Pell to let him go - only to be shocked into a silence that would last for decades. Pell's defence barrister is one of Australia's most experienced and expensive lawyers - his speeches focused on areas of doubt. Robert Richter QC repeated over and over how highly improbable - if not impossible - it would have been for any of the abuse to have occurred. Instead, he insisted that his client had become a scapegoat for the crimes of other Catholic clerics. At one stage, Mr Richter even referred to Pell as ""the Darth Vader of the Catholic Church"", painting him as a bold leader vilified by the media. Profile: Who is George Pell? Pell certainly has his critics - some came to the court to watch and see him in the dock. Although the proceedings couldn't be reported, there was nothing to stop members of the public coming in to listen. Campaigners and abuse survivors sat mixed in with the media, some sighing as they heard accounts of the abuse. Some of Pell's supporters attended too, sending sympathetic smiles in his direction, and exchanging small talk as he went in and out of the court. After two trials, one hung jury and many months of waiting - the results of this long process are now public. The pace of justice has felt slow at times, but it has resulted in one of the Catholic Church's most prominent and powerful figures being held to account.

"An estimated 240,000 UK businesses trade with the EU The government has said it will start automatically enrolling UK firms in a customs system as it speeds up its preparations for a no-deal Brexit. The move will enable UK firms to continue to trade with EU member states after the UK leaves the EU. Business trade groups had urged the government to act after many firms failed to register for the system. The CBI said it was ""a sensible move"" but ""one of hundreds of things that needed to be done"" in a no-deal event. The plan to force companies to be no-deal ready No-deal Brexit plan threatens UK fuel plants 'No prospect of deal' unless backstop scrapped HMRC said all VAT-registered firms in the UK - which had not already signed up to the customs system - would receive an ID number within the next two weeks. The so called Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number will allow firms to continue to trade with customers and suppliers in the EU once the UK has left the EU on 31 October. Firms without an EORI number will not be allowed to trade with EU member states after Brexit. So far, 72,000 companies had registered for an EORI number. The government said its auto-enrolment scheme would mean 88,000 more firms would be registered. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the move would help ""ease the flow of goods at border points and support businesses to trade and grow"". But business lobby groups urged the government to do more to avoid a no-deal. Nicole Sykes, CBI head of EU negotiations, said auto-enrolment would reduce the risk of lorries turning up at ports without one of the necessary pieces of paperwork. ""But the web of short and long-term consequences of no deal go well beyond this, which are both complex and damaging,"" she added. ""That's why the government must put just as much time and effort into securing a deal."" Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said auto-enrolment was ""long overdue"" but still only ""a first step"". ""For many firms, it will trigger more questions. Businesses still need clarity on many other cross-border trade issues, such as customs procedures at borders following a no-deal exit and when the government will launch an official database to provide ease of access to information on tariffs and quotas."" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it will allocate Â£9m to councils to help make sure they are staffed to deal with any issues at ports. Kent Council will get over Â£2.6m due to the pressures it faces around the Port of Dover.

"The average salary for chief executives fell by 13% between 2017 and 2018, but they still earned 117 times more than the average UK full-time worker, a report has found. A boss of one of the UK's largest listed 100 companies earns Â£3.5m a year on average, the CIPD, the professional body for HR found. The average full-time worker in the UK earns Â£29,574. The report also showed a continued big gender gap at the top of big firms. In 2018, only six of the FTSE 100 companies had a female boss, down from seven in 2017. Shareholders 'not stopping excessive executive pay' Hundreds of firms rush to meet gender pay deadline Top bosses' Â£4m pay packet 'damaging' to UK reputation The CIPD analyses executive pay, together with the High Pay Centre think tank every year. CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese said: the gap between pay at the top and bottom of firms remained ""unacceptably wide"". ""We must question if CEOs are overly focused on financial measures and are being incentivised to keep share prices high rather than focusing on the long-term health of their business,"" he said. High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said: ""There is still more to be done to align pay practices with the interests of wider society."" He added it was important to ""give the public confidence that our biggest businesses are working for the good of the economy as a whole, rather than the enrichment of a few people at the top"". The CIPD and High Pay Centre made a number of recommendations: Pay for the top 1% of earners should be disclosed Consider wider workforce reward practices, and understanding of organisational culture, fairness and investment in people Link chief executive pay to both financial and non-financial measures of performance Simplify chief executive reward packages and ensure they are linked to fewer and more meaningful measures of performance For the first time, the study also looked at pay in the FTSE 250 companies, the 250 largest firms listed on the stock exchange after the FTSE 100 firms. If found that, in contract to FTSE 100 pay, the salaries of chief executives in this group had stayed relatively steady. Pay averaged Â£1.58m in 2016 and 2018 with a 2% rise to Â£1.61m in 2017. The drop in chief executive pay was welcomed by trade body The Investment Association. Its director of stewardship and corporate governance, Andrew Ninian, said that this year, more than 50 companies had promised to cut their executive pensions because of a campaign by shareholders. He added: ""Investors have repeatedly highlighted their concerns with excessive CEO pay, so the fall in pay is a welcome sign that companies are beginning to listen."" However, unions were angered by the total pay still being earned by chief executives every year. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said: ""It would take most workers two lifetimes to earn what top execs get in a single year. That's not right. ""This shocking pay gap won't change without major reform. We need new rules to give workers seats on executive pay committees. This would help bring some much-needed common sense and fairness to boardroom pay."" And GMB union general secretary Tim Roache said: ""It's an absolute scandal the average worker will have to graft for more than a century to earn the same pay a CEO gets in just a year. ""GMB has never been against people getting well paid for doing a good job - but we need a maximum pay ratio enshrined in law to keep our society fair and healthy.""

"Long-suffering bank customers are facing an average of 10 digital banking shutdowns a month, according to new figures. UK banks began publishing details of the number of operational and security incidents that occur last year. The latest data analysed by the BBC reveals that the major banks typically suffer more than 10 outages a month. Barclays reported the most problems in the past year but RBS/NatWest had the most in the past three months. Barclays reported 33 incidents in the 12 months to the end of June this year, higher than NatWest which had 25 and Lloyds Bank, which had 23. A Barclays spokesperson told the BBC: ""Our systems are designed to ensure continuity of service for customers in the event of an incident, with a range of channels available to customers. ""We have seen a consistent reduction in our operational and security incidents throughout the course of the last year."" In the three months to the end of June RBS and NatWest topped the table with seven incidents reported, followed by HSBC with five. An RBS spokesperson said: ""Our incident volumes continue to decrease year on year. We have invested significantly in our systems to help keep our customers safe and secure. ""However, we are not complacent and we will continue working to improve our service to minimise any incidents of disruption for customers."" Banks hit by dozens of IT shutdowns Which banks do customers love or hate? On Tuesday credit card customers of RBS became the latest victims of an IT meltdown which it blamed on ""a third party service provider"". They were unable to see their information online or on their phones and contacting the bank's call centre didn't help as workers there had no access to information and so couldn't help worried customers. The bank said in a statement: ""We apologise to any customers impacted and are working with the third party provider to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. Customers can continue to use their credit cards as usual and no customer will be left out of pocket."" Meanwhile Barclaycard has warned customers won't be able to use their app, online or telephone services overnight from 11.30pm on Thursday 22 August until 6am on Friday 23 August while the bank updates its system.

""It is now a year since we required firms to start publishing this data, providing people with the tools to work out how easily they can carry out day to day banking activities, as well as the reliability of the service they receive,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. ""The information published should increase the incentive for firms to offer better service, helping consumers to get the most out of their banking experience."" UK Finance, the organisation that represents the banking industry, said its members ""invest billions to ensure systems, human and digital, are robust and secure"". ""Operational resilience is crucial in a modern financial system and is a key priority for the industry.

"Christy and her son Christopher Christopher Holmes has haemophilia A - his body lacks a protein that makes blood clot. A simple graze can mean the two-year-old bleeds uncontrollably. To avoid this he needs treatment every few days with a drug put into his bloodstream via a tube in his chest. But now, NHS England has agreed to fund a new therapy for patients like him. It's a medication that can be given weekly or fortnightly as an injection just under the skin rather than into a vein. Emicizumab, marketed as Hemlibra, mimics the action of the missing protein, factor VIII. Christopher's doctors are recommending he stay on his current factor-VIII treatment but consider switching to the new one when he is a bit older. Like other people with haemophilia A, he will need life-long treatment. His mother, Christy, 22, of Surrey, says: ""Without treatment, there's the possibility that he could have multiple bleeds every week, every day. ""He is quite an active boy, so he bumps his head quite often and obviously there's always the chance of brain bleeds, and bleeds anywhere really, without that factor VIII. ""Christopher has severe haemophilia A. He has literally got no factor VIII in his body until we provide it to him.""

"Christy and her son Christopher Christopher Holmes has haemophilia A - his body lacks a protein that makes blood clot. A simple graze can mean the two-year-old bleeds uncontrollably. To avoid this he needs treatment every few days with a drug put into his bloodstream via a tube in his chest. But now, NHS England has agreed to fund a new therapy for patients like him. It's a medication that can be given weekly or fortnightly as an injection just under the skin rather than into a vein. Emicizumab, marketed as Hemlibra, mimics the action of the missing protein, factor VIII. Christopher's doctors are recommending he stay on his current factor-VIII treatment but consider switching to the new one when he is a bit older. Like other people with haemophilia A, he will need life-long treatment. His mother, Christy, 22, of Surrey, says: ""Without treatment, there's the possibility that he could have multiple bleeds every week, every day. ""He is quite an active boy, so he bumps his head quite often and obviously there's always the chance of brain bleeds, and bleeds anywhere really, without that factor VIII. ""Christopher has severe haemophilia A. He has literally got no factor VIII in his body until we provide it to him."" Christopher copes really well with having his treatment - but it can be difficult. ""He's really good with it,"" Christy says. ""He's not scared of things or worried. To him, he's a normal child. We try as much as possible to treat him like a normal child. But a couple of weeks ago, he was in hospital because he had a port infection[, where the tube enters his chest].

"Louise and her family's hoard of old technology is typical of a UK household ""Ten phones, two laptops, digital cameras... all just sitting here. We're not dealing with it."" Louise Lewis is surveying a collection of old gadgets that have piled up in her home. Her technological stash, experts say, is typical. But it could jeopardise our ability to manufacture new devices. A study has estimated that as many as 40 million unused gadgets are languishing in UK homes. Each device contains multiple valuable and increasingly endangered elements. This video can not be played Smartphones contain around 30 different elements, some of which the Earth is running out of The growing, unseen shortage of ""rare earth elements"" was the impetus for theRoyal Society of Chemistry's,externalsurvey of just how much unused technology we are all stockpiling. The organisation carried out an online survey - completed by more than 2,000 people - which revealed that half of UK households had at least one unused electronic device and 45% of homes had between two and five. Most people admitted they had no plans to recycle their collection. ""There are about 30 different elements just in a smartphone,"" said Elisabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry, ""and many of them are very rare."" The metal indium, she explained, is used in a unique compound called indium tin oxide, which is vital for touch screens, because it conducts electricity and is transparent. ""It's also used in solar panels, so we're going to need a lot of it in the future. ""There's not a lot of it in the Earth and you need a kilo of ore to extract just a few milligrams of indium."" Most of us will not have heard of tantalum, but it's a highly corrosion-resistant metal that is ""perfect for small electronic devices like our phones"", explained Ms Ratcliffe. ""But it's also perfect for hearing aids and pace-makers,"" she told BBC News. Scientists estimate that indium and tantalum mines, among others, could run out within a century. Meanwhile, our demand for new technology continues to increase. ""Even the copper in all that wire is not endlessly abundant,"" added Ms Ratcliffe. ""On top of that, most of these devices are coated in plastic, which could be recycled."" 2019 is the international year of the periodic table Gallium: Used in medical thermometers, LEDs, solar panels, telescopes and has possible anti-cancer properties; Arsenic: Used in fireworks, as a wood preserver; Silver: Used in mirrors, reactive lenses that darken in sunlight, antibacterial clothing and gloves for use with touch-screens; Indium: Used in transistors, microchips, fire-sprinkler systems, as a coating for ball-bearings in Formula One cars and solar panels; Yttrium: Used in white LED lights, camera lenses and can be used to treat some cancers; Tantalum: Used in surgical implants, electrodes for neon lights, turbine blades, rocket nozzles and nose caps for supersonic aircraft, hearing aids and pacemakers. In short - recycle it; you cansearch for your nearest electronics recycling point online.,external ""Take it to your local tip,"" advised Stuart Price from Electrical Waste Recycling in Huddersfield. ""Or a retailer - distributors actually have an obligation to take back material when you buy a new product from them."" ""We need this material to go to reprocessing facilities, so it can be processed properly."" At electrical waste reprocessing plants, devices - even wires- can be broken down into their component parts for recycling Many people who hoard old tech are concerned about protecting their personal data, but a ""factory reset"" should protect that - and council tips and responsible retailers keep electronics secure before they are recycled. According to the Electrical Waste Recycling Group, about 500,000 tonnes of electronic waste is recycled in the UK every year. But that is only a fraction of the ""E-waste"" that is piling up in landfill and in people's homes. Much of the responsibility for that will lie with tech manufacturers, according to Prof Lenny Koh, director of the Centre for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at the University of Sheffield. ""The current approach is not sustainable,"" she told BBC News. ""With increasing demand and reliance on smaller devices and more sophisticated technology, there'll only be more waste to be recycled. ""Manufacturers need to think about the entire life-cycle of a device at the design stage - so devices are built to be fully recyclable."" Ms Ratcliffe added that we can all help by delaying a phone upgrade for a while longer. ""This is the International Year of the Periodic Table,external,"" she said. ""So it's a great time to be thinking about all the amazing elements out there. And just by holding onto your current phone for another year, you can really make a difference in environmental terms.""
