"Early signs suggest a year of high A-level grades, says a university's head of admissions A-level results next week in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could see high levels of top grades, according to an annual analysis of exam trends. Prof Alan Smithers, at the University of Buckingham, is predicting a ""bumper crop"" of A* and A grades, in results for exams cancelled by the pandemic. But he warns against allowing ""grade inflation"" to become the norm. The University of East Anglia (UEA) is also reporting early signs that it could be a ""record year for grades"". There have been suggestions that if more pupils receive high grades - which are being submitted by teachers for a second year in a row - there will be a crush for places at the most sought-after universities and courses. There is also pressure from record numbers applying, with more than 680,000 seeking university places. Prof Smithers said some universities could consider introducing their own exams to help them choose between students. There have already been reports of oversubscribed medicine courses trying to get applicants to defer for a year -such as at the University of Exeter,where students were offered Â£10,000 to delay. But Richard Harvey, director of admissions at UEA, reassured students that even if grades are higher than last year's record high levels, there is capacity in the university system. What's different with this year's A-levels? Students offered cash to defer medical degree Parents pressure teachers over exam grades Last summer's big exam grades U-turn ""Of course that will cause pressure in certain subjects, mostly medical ones, and in certain universities. At UEA, medicine and related subjects look a bit pressured, but in other subjects I do hope we can continue to welcome people, so I'd encourage people to get in touch,"" he said. Universities get an advance sight of whether applicants have achieved their required grades, and will be going through their admission decisions ahead of the official release of results next week. There is expected to be particular pressure on places for medical and dentistry courses - with a 20% increase in applications and more students expected to get the required grades this year. The Department for Education says it will create more places and flexibility - allowing ""over 9,000 places"" - but with no fixed numbers for an increase. Last year, there was an intake of almost 9,300 for these medicine and dentistry courses. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was much harder to create more places for medicine because of the high cost of training doctors, the length of the course and the need for hospital placements. Mr Hillman said he was ""a little bit uncomfortable"" with the suggestion that students could be asked if they wanted to shift to other medical schools with more capacity. ""If you've had your sights set on one particular medical school from the moment you applied or even the moment you started your A-levels, it's quite a big mental jump to decide you're going to go somewhere else,"" he said. This will be the second year in which results will be decided without pupils taking the usual set of exam papers. Schools submitted grades for pupils, based on a range of evidence, including mini-exams, mock exams and coursework, and next week will see the final results issued by exam boards. Last year saw huge controversy after an initial downgrading of many pupils' grades - which was then reversed in a U-turn which saw the highest-ever proportion of A* and A grades. Almost two in five A-levels, 38.5%, were awarded an A* or A last year after the U-turn, up from 25.5% for pupils in 2019. Prof Smithers,in his annual pre-results report,,externalsuggests results are once again going to be very high, or even higher, to compensate for the disruption facing pupils. ""While logically there is no reason why A-level standards should not be restored to what they were in 2019, my fear is that the various pressures will cause the government to allow what they became in 2020 to stand,"" he said. He warned that issuing so many top grades makes it hard for universities to distinguish between students. ""Leading universities could be forced to set their own tests to help them distinguish between the many prospective students awarded straight As,"" said Prof Smithers. But Prof Graham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, rejected the focus on grade inflation. ""These young people have had a very difficult time since March 2020. How their grades compare with other years is of secondary importance. We should prioritise this year's students and treat this year as the extreme exception it obviously is,"" he said. Tom Middlehurst, of the ASCL head teachers' union, said speculation about grades was ""unhelpful"" and said that if grades were higher this year ""it would be a reflection of the system devised by the government and [regulator] Ofqual"" rather than a decision by teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, promising extra places for medical courses, said: ""Students have worked incredibly hard over the past 18 months and we have continued to put their best interests first to ensure they can progress on to the next stage of their education training or career.""

"This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Barcelona say Lionel Messi will not be staying at the club ""because of financial and structural obstacles"". Messi, 34, has been a free agent since 1 July when his contract expired. He agreed a new deal on reduced wages with the club two weeks later, but it was dependent on Barca selling players to afford his salary. ""Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of the player and the club will ultimately not be fulfilled,"" the club said. Is this really the end for Messi at Barcelona? Listen: The Football Daily Podcast breaks down Messi's bombshell announcement Barcelona had said Messi was poised to extend his 21-year association with the club by signing the new deal on Thursday, and blame La Liga for the failure to do so. He had reached an agreement to stay with the Catalan side until 2026 - but La Liga said the club must reduce wages before he and any new players can be registered. ""Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles [Spanish La Liga regulations],"" the club said. ""FC Barcelona wholeheartedly expresses its gratitude to the player for his contribution to the aggrandisement of the club and wishes him all the very best for the future in his personal and professional life."" This video can not be played Copa America: 'That's what you expect of him' - Messi scores free-kick for Argentina Messi is Barcelona's record scorer with 672 goals and has won 10 La Liga titles, four Champions Leagues and seven Copa del Reys, as well as claiming the Ballon d'Or on a record six occasions. Keeping Messi at the Nou Camp had been president Joan Laporta's top priority this summer. The Barca future of a player who is widely regarded as being one of the world's greatest of all time, however, has been severely complicated by the club's financial problems. The presidential election earlier this year was held against the backdrop ofBarca being on the verge of bankruptcy. The Argentine arguably now becomes the most in-demand player in world football. Messi has long been linked with a move to either Paris St-Germain or Manchester City, where he would be reunited with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola. America's Major League Soccer, which Messi has previously considered experiencing, is another option. The announcement that Messi is to move on comes a year after he sent a fax to Barcelona bosses saying he wished to exercise a clause in his contract that would have allowed him to leave for free last summer. Days laterhe said he would stay,admitting it was ""impossible"" for any team to pay his 700m euro (Â£624m) release clause, which Barca insisted needed to be met. Aged 13 Messi joined Barca's famed La Masia academy in 2000 from Argentine side Newell's Old Boys and made his senior debut aged 16 in 2004. He has gone on to make 778 appearances for the club, scoring 672 goals, including 120 Champions League goals (second behind Cristiano Ronaldo), and a record 474 La Liga goals. He has collected the European Golden Shoe award for the continent's top scorer on six occasions. 25 August 2020- Messi sends a fax to the club saying he wishes toexercise a clause in his contract, allowing him to leave for free with immediate effect. 4 September 2020-Messi says he is staying at Barcelonabecause it is ""impossible"" for any team to pay his 700m euro (Â£624m) release clause, which the club insist would have to be met. 27 October 2020- Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who had fallen out with Messi over his failed transfer request,resigns. 28 December 2020- Messi says he hopesto one day play in the United States, but is unsure of his future when his contract runs out. 31 January 2021- Barcelona say they will take ""appropriate legal action"" against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after itpublished details of Messi's contract, worth Â£492m over four years. 16 May 2021- Manager Ronald Koeman says he hopes Messi has not played his final home game for the club after a2-1 defeat by Celta Vigoended their title hopes and meant they finished outside the top two for the first time since 2007-08. 22 May 2021- Paris St-Germain are believed to be""looking closely"" at Messi's contractsituation. 28 May 2021- Barcelona president Joan Laporta says a new contract for Lionel Messi is""not done yet""but that ""things are going well"". 1 July 2021- Messi's Barcelona contract expires and hebecomes a free agent. 15 July 2021-Messi agrees to stay with Barcaon a deal until 2026 that includes reducing his wages. 5 August 2021- Barcelona announce Lionel Messi will leave the club ""because of financial and structural obstacles"".

"The global giant which produces the Oatly oat milk drink accused a rival of copyright breaches A family-run farm has won a legal battle against the multimillion-pound makers of plant milk, Oatly, which accused it of trademark infringement. Oatly brought legal action against Glebe Farm Foods, in Cambridgeshire, saying their product PureOaty took ""unfair advantage"" of their own drink. A High Court judge ruled in favour of the farm saying he did not see ""any risk of injury to the distinctive character"" of the Oatly brand. The farm said it was ""gratifying"". Oatly was founded in the 1990s and produces a milk substitute made from oats. The brand is endorsed by a number of celebrities including Oprah Winfrey. During the two-day hearing in June, the court heard Oatly had sold more than Â£38m worth of its ""barista edition"" oat milk, and more than Â£13m of other varieties. Glebe Farm Foods, based near Huntingdon, launched an oat milk in 2019 called ""Oat Drink"", before rebranding it ""PureOaty"" in 2020. Oatly's lawyers said the farm hadinfringed five of their firm's trademarkswith the ""PureOaty"" name and the drink's packaging, as well as ""passing off"" their product as Oatly's. Oatly sought a High Court injunction earlier this year to stop Glebe Farm Foods selling its PureOaty brand Glebe Farm Foods, run by brother and sister Philip and Rebecca Rayner, denied the claims. Ruling in favour of the farm, Judge Nicholas Caddick QC, said while there were similarities between the initial PureOaty packaging and the Oatly packaging, including the use of the colour blue and the use of an irregular font for the product name, these were ""at a very general level"". ""It is hard to see how any relevant confusion would arise from the defendant's use of the sign 'PureOaty',"" he said. He concluded: ""On the facts of this case, I do not see that there is any risk of injury to the distinctive character of Oatly's marks."" Philip and Rebecca Rayner said the outcome was ""enormously gratifying"" Mr Rayner said his farm had ""always felt certain that we have done nothing wrong"". ""You only need to look at the two products and packaging side by side to appreciate how different these brands are, and how unnecessary this legal action was,"" he said. ""It is enormously gratifying... to see that smaller independent companies can fight back and win."" A spokeswoman for Oatly said the company would not be appealing the decision. ""For us, this case has always been about protecting our trademark and how the single letter Y creates too much of a similarity between Oaty and Oatly."" She said Oatly wished Glebe Farm Foods ""total success... moving forward"", but added: ""We just think they should do so in their own unique voice, just like we do.""

"UK music festivals and other live events are to be protected by a government-backed insurance scheme if they have to cancel because of Covid. It will begin next month with a Â£750m budget to cover cancellation costs if events are legally unable to happen due to government Covid restrictions. The live events industry, which has repeatedly called for such a plan, broadly welcomed the announcement. More than half of all music festivals have been cancelled this summer. And several events, including the Boomtown and Womad festivals,have cited an inability to obtain cancellation insuranceas a factor in their decision. The new scheme will see insurance companies provide cover for live events, with the government agreeing to act as a reinsurer - guaranteeing that any pay-outs will be funded. Festivals are facing devastation, MPs warn Festivals face 'lost summer' without safety net Festivals 2021: Which ones are still going ahead? Julian Knight MP, who chairs the House of Commons culture select committee, said: ""Though it is a shame that it has come too late for some this summer, this scheme will provide the confidence the sector needs to plan and invest in future events."" Promoter Live Nation UK called it a ""vital intervention"" that would give the sector ""certainty"". However, there are concerns that it will just pay out if events are banned by another lockdown. The Musicians' Union said ""the major problem"" with the scheme is that it does not cover events that would become uneconomical if social distancing came back into force. The Association of Independent Festivals welcomed the scheme, but said it doesn't ""cover a festival needing to reduce capacity or cancel due to social distancing restrictions being reintroduced"". Greg Parmley, chief executive of industry association Live, said the scheme was ""good news"" but ""the devil is very much in the detail"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the association wanted to work with government to ensure it covered cancellations due to the reintroduction of social distancing making an event financially unviable and artists being forced to self-isolate after catching the virus. He added that these situations were ""far more likely"" to cause events to be cancelled in the coming months than another lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the lack of ""the right kind"" of insurance had proved ""a problem"" for the UK's live events industry. ""As the economy reopens I want to do everything I can to help events providers and small businesses plan with confidence right through to next year,"" he said. Rishi Sunak said ""the right kind of insurance"" was needed Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden called it ""an important next step"" for the live events sector, and said it would give organisers ""the confidence they need to plan for a brighter future"". The development comes after the government's Â£1.8bnCulture Recovery Fundwas set up to provide grants for arts organisations and heritage sites affected by the pandemic. Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, head of trade body UK Music, said: ""We are extremely grateful to government for listening to the calls of the sector and delivering a solution to the market failure in the insurance industry."" Michael Kill, the CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, said:  ""I am extremely pleased the government has decided to introduce an insurance scheme for the events and festival sector, it stands testament to a government that is starting to acknowledge the varying issues within the sector and through engagement, take the appropriate action to protect businesses and jobs."" But, he added: ""It is devastating that the timings of this scheme could not have been earlier, as we have already lost many amazing festivals and events to the uncertainty that this pandemic represents. Labour said the funding was a ""bare minimum"" and promoters would still be taking risks by staging events. Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens described the scheme as ""a solution that doesn't address the problem"". The government also published endorsements from the Events Industry Alliance, the Meetings Industry Association and the organisers of Southampton International Boat Show. Events companies will be able to purchase the cover from next month, with the scheme set to run until September 2022. But the events industry is not the only sector currently calling for more government support. The travel industry has urged the Treasury to extend the furlough support scheme to protect jobs. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said despite thelatest changes to the UK's traffic light systemit was one of the ""few sectors that cannot reopen properly"". ""We've now had two summers of precious little revenue and we're at the limit of what we can borrow,"" he said. ""Tens of thousands of jobs are at stake and without furlough it will be very tough."" The government said it was providing an ""unprecedented package"" of support to protect jobs and businesses, and the airlines sector would have received about Â£7bn by the end of September. On Thursday 30,215 new Covid cases were reported across the UK, along with a further 86 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

The Musicians' Union said ""the major problem"" with the scheme is that it does not cover events that would become uneconomical if social distancing came back into force. The Association of Independent Festivals welcomed the scheme, but said it doesn't ""cover a festival needing to reduce capacity or cancel due to social distancing restrictions being reintroduced"". Greg Parmley, chief executive of industry association Live, said the scheme was ""good news"" but ""the devil is very much in the detail"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the association wanted to work with government to ensure it covered cancellations due to the reintroduction of social distancing making an event financially unviable and artists being forced to self-isolate after catching the virus. He added that these situations were ""far more likely"" to cause events to be cancelled in the coming months than another lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the lack of ""the right kind"" of insurance had proved ""a problem"" for the UK's live events industry. ""As the economy reopens I want to do everything I can to help events providers and small businesses plan with confidence right through to next year,"" he said. Rishi Sunak said ""the right kind of insurance"" was needed Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden called it ""an important next step"" for the live events sector, and said it would give organisers ""the confidence they need to plan for a brighter future"". The development comes after the government's Â£1.8bnCulture Recovery Fundwas set up to provide grants for arts organisations and heritage sites affected by the pandemic. Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, head of trade body UK Music, said: ""We are extremely grateful to government for listening to the calls of the sector and delivering a solution to the market failure in the insurance industry."" Michael Kill, the CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, said:  ""I am extremely pleased the government has decided to introduce an insurance scheme for the events and festival sector, it stands testament to a government that is starting to acknowledge the varying issues within the sector and through engagement, take the appropriate action to protect businesses and jobs."" But, he added: ""It is devastating that the timings of this scheme could not have been earlier, as we have already lost many amazing festivals and events to the uncertainty that this pandemic represents. Labour said the funding was a ""bare minimum"" and promoters would still be taking risks by staging events. Shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens described the scheme as ""a solution that doesn't address the problem"". The government also published endorsements from the Events Industry Alliance, the Meetings Industry Association and the organisers of Southampton International Boat Show. Events companies will be able to purchase the cover from next month, with the scheme set to run until September 2022. But the events industry is not the only sector currently calling for more government support. The travel industry has urged the Treasury to extend the furlough support scheme to protect jobs. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, said despite thelatest changes to the UK's traffic light systemit was one of the ""few sectors that cannot reopen properly"". ""We've now had two summers of precious little revenue and we're at the limit of what we can borrow,"" he said. ""Tens of thousands of jobs are at stake and without furlough it will be very tough."" The government said it was providing an ""unprecedented package"" of support to protect jobs and businesses, and the airlines sector would have received about Â£7bn by the end of September. On Thursday 30,215 new Covid cases were reported across the UK, along with a further 86 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

"This video can not be played Jordan and Emily Burns can now have their wedding celebration with friends and family Most of Wales' remaining Covid rules will be lifted as the nation enters the ""final lap"" of the pandemic, the first minister has said. Social distancing laws and rules on who can meet indoors will end on Saturday, almost 17 months after the first lockdown. However, rules will remain tighter than in England, with face masks still required by law in many public places. Mark Drakeford said they will likely be needed for the rest of the year. He warned the changes did not mean a ""free-for-all"". Wales will move to alert level zero - the lowest level of restrictions seen so far - from 06:00 BST on Saturday. What are the new Covid rules in Wales? Teens aged 16-17 to be offered jabs in Wales What are the latest changes to the Covid rules across the UK? This video can not be played Two-metre distancing and masks will not be legally required in pubs and restaurant from 7 August Mr Drakeford said as the case rate had steadily declined for the past three weeks and vaccinations had increased, most rules could now be scrapped. He told a press briefing that the easing of restrictions was a ""significant moment for all of us"" and a ""big step closer to life before the pandemic started"". In response to the news, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives said it was time for a Wales-specific inquiry into the way the pandemic had been handled in Wales. The first minister urged people to be sensible, to continue to practise social distancing, think about who they meet and where, and not behave as if the ""virus has disappeared"". ""Most people in Wales want to go on acting carefully to protect their health and the health of others,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said with such major changes to rules, the impact on case rates needed to be seen and so no further relaxation was expected to be made for ""at least six weeks"". This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said the easing of restrictions was a ""significant moment for all of us"" Mr Drakeford said while he did not expect Wales to have to return to tight restrictions such as lockdown measures, he could not rule anything out if there was a ""sudden change for the worse"". However, he said: ""Provided we do not see further unexpected turns in the course of the virus, then I think we can have confidence that we are on the final lap of emerging from the pandemic."" Under the changes from Saturday: There will be no limit on the numbers that can meet indoors, including in homes, public places and at events Any businesses still closed, such as nightclubs, can reopen Laws requiring companies and organisations to socially distance indoors will end Pubs will no longer have to provide table service However companies will still be expected to take measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted on their premises. It will be the law to wear face masks in indoor public places including shops, buses and trains, and in health and social care settings, but not in venues where food and drink is served, such as pubs. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales face coverings were ""likely"" to play a part in helping tackle coronavirus ""for the rest of this year"". While the changes will see most of Wales' rules lifted, more restrictions remain in place than across the border in England,where they were scrapped on so-called ""freedom day"" on 18 July. Most restrictions in Scotland will come to anend on Monday- and with face masks still required in shops, the rules will be similar to here in Wales. Meanwhile, inNorthern Ireland ruleson who you can meet and where remain in place. Laws on who you can meet indoors have existed since the start of the lockdown in March 2020. Current restrictions  - to be scrapped on Saturday - say only six people are able to meet in private homes. People will continue to have to self-isolate by law for 10 days if they get Covid, while the Welsh government advice will be to continue to work from home where possible. However, those who are fully vaccinated and are found to be a close contact of a positive Covid casewill not need to self-isolate from Saturday. The decision to lift the social distancing duty on businesses means firms will instead be expected to put in place measures to keep people safe and draw up risk assessments. That could see them continuing to require social distancing, face masks, or use other measures such as ventilation or a combination of these, with the first minister saying he did not expect ""large crowds of people"" would be seen at bars as businesses tried to keep punters safe. You can go ""out out"" in Wales from Saturday with nightclubs able to open Some pub and bar owners have said while they were pleased to be able to ""throw away the measuring tape"", the onus on businesses to set their own rules was unfair. Joanne Cooney, owner of Cooney's Bar in Llandudno, said with rules being different in England, some places had reported issues with tourists refusing to wear masks and stay apart, and having different rules in different businesses could make it worse. ""We are having to try and figure out very confusing guidance... people think everything's gone back to normal, but it's not, they've just said 'it's all on you now'"", shetold BBC Radio Wales. Ms Cooney said the guidance setting out what businesses should do from Saturday was ""unclear"", and called for clarity from the Welsh government. Responding to the concerns, Mr Drakeford said the guidance was clear, and the measures were to make sure staff and customers were ""properly protected"" and give people confidence they could go out. Jordan and Emily Burns are having their wedding on the day restrictions ease Wedding receptions have been subject to restrictions since March 2020 - but from Saturday those will be lifted. Jordan and Emily Burns, from Buckley in Flintshire, should have been married in April 2020 - two weeks after lockdown began. They have rearranged their ceremony four times since and had a small, legal marriage ceremony four months ago. On Saturday, however, they will have the big wedding they always wanted at Ty'n Dwr Hall in Llangollen. Mrs Burns said: ""It's been only six to a table in weddings - our tables will have 24 people, which just seems crazy doesn't it? ""We're able to have the ceremony indoors so we're not worried with the weather. It just takes so much pressure off us as well and we can just look forward to it, be excited and just enjoy the day."" DJ Stacey Alford said the pandemic ""pulled the plug"" on her career Stacey Alford, a DJ from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said the pandemic ""pulled the plug"" on her career. She said the music community was excited to see Wales moving to alert level zero, but was aware of the need for caution. ""The general consensus is 'get us in there, we can't wait' - but obviously we want everyone to just take it slowly, enjoy themselves but not be silly."" The changes mean there will be fewer Covid rules to police. But Mark Jones, general secretary of the North Wales Police Federation, fears a return to normality for the public will put pressure on officers. ""We're seeing the first time in near enough two summers where freedom is there, so a lot of people will be coming to visit north Wales and we're anticipating demands on policing, which means that the thin blue line is going to be stretched even further and further,"" he said. Exactly 500 days after telling us to stay home, Mark Drakeford has confirmed an end to the rules on who and where we meet. He has deliberately avoided repeating Boris Johnson's assurance that we are on an ""irreversible"" path out. But the success of the vaccination programme means the bar for ""re-imposing severe restrictions will be higher"", the Welsh government says. The next step is to provide booster jabs. Some people will get one with their annual flu jab in the autumn. In a clear signal about the ongoing threat of the pandemic, ministers say they are worried about a ""perfect storm"" of Covid and flu this winter. Following the announcement, opposition parties called for people to act responsibly, and pressed again for a Wales-only inquiry into the handling of Covid by the Welsh government. More than 7,900 have died since the pandemic began. Plaid Cymru said it wanted ""reassurance from government that lessons have been learnt"", and the Tories said those who have suffered should be given justice. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said that as Wales moved forward people had to ""take responsibility"" to stop cases rising. ""We are going to have to learn to live with Covid, because we can't afford to go back into the lockdowns that have blighted our lives in the past 15, 16 months,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, welcomed the move forward, but said the ministers must be ready to take a step back if necessary. ""Now what we want as these freedoms come back is to see in clear evidence terms that government is honing its early-warning systems even more, is even more vigilant about any curveballs sent in our direction,"" he said. However, Mr Drakeford, who has already agreed to a UK-wide inquiry, said a Wales specific inquiry would not give a ""proper understanding"" of how the pandemic was handled. Wales has seen a third wave of coronavirus cases in recent months - but it peaked on 16 July and has been decreasing ever since. Latest figures published on Friday showed Wales' case rate had fallen slightly, to 132.4 per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. They also showed 66% of Wales' total population was fully vaccinated,with health boards now inviting 16 and 17-year-olds for their jabs. Mr Drakeford said health boards were ready to start offering booster jabs from September, but the government were waiting for advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

"Amazon's headquarters in Seattle, Washington Amazon has told its US corporate staff not to return to the office until next year as Covid continues to spread. The online shopping giant previously asked staff to work from home until 7 September, but will now extend this until 3 January 2022. It comes as new Covid infections surge across America, with with daily cases at an average not seen in months. Two US financial institutions, Wells Fargo and Blackrock, also said they would push back their office returns. ""As we continue to closely watch local conditions related to Covid-19, we are adjusting our guidance for corporate employees,"" said Amazon. Investment giant to pay vaccinated workers $1,000 Goldman Sachs delays return to office for workers The online shopping giant's policy will apply to corporate and tech employees, but not the warehouse and delivery workers who make up the bulk of its workforce. Staff in the US will be affected but also some based abroad, although Amazon did not specify where. Wells Fargo has almost 260,000 staff Separately, Wells Fargo - the biggest US bank in terms of headcount - said it was delaying its return to the office from 7 September, to 4 October. The lender, which has almost 260,000 employees, said it would also give staff eight hours of paid time off to enable them to get vaccinated. Investment giant Blackrock is postponing the date it expects all staff to be back in the office by a month to 1 October. ""We are following the Delta variant in different parts of the country and closely monitoring the latest guidance from public health officials and local government authorities that encourages people to wear masks in indoor public spaces in areas of substantial or high transmission,"" said BlackRock's chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, in a memo to staff. ""We know this raises concerns about returning to the office."" The contagious Delta variant of coronavirus is spreading rapidly across the US, with states such as Florida and Texas seeing high levels of new infections. A slowing vaccination rate is only adding to the problem, and companies are under pressure to act. Google, Facebook and Twitter have all said they will delay their returns to the office, with the former two also requiring employees to be vaccinated. Walmart and Uber, meanwhile, have asked their management, not frontline staff, to get the vaccine, while investment giant Vanguard on Wednesday said it would pay staff who got vaccinated $1,000 (Â£792). Amazon, which is not mandating vaccines, said it would continue to follow local government guidance to ensure a safe office return, including asking all unvaccinated staff to wear masks in the workplace. As previously announced, its corporate employees will also be allowed to work from home two days a week, under a new hybrid model.

"Jack Grealish's move to Manchester City makes him the ninth-most expensive player in history Manchester City have signed England midfielder Jack Grealish from Aston Villa for a British record Â£100m. The 25-year-old joins the Premier League champions on a six-year contract and will wear the number 10 shirt recently vacated by Sergio Aguero. The fee surpasses the Â£89m Manchester United paid to re-sign midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus in 2016. ""City are the best team in the country with a manager considered to be the best in the world,"" said Grealish. ""It's a dream come true to be part of this club."" The move makes Grealish the ninth most expensive footballer in history. He could make his debut for Pep Guardiola's side in Saturday's Community Shield against Leicester City at Wembley. Villa 'hoped' Grealish Â£100m release clause would never be met Where does Grealish fit in at Man City? Quiz: Name the past 13 players to go for a British transfer record A boyhood Villa fan, Grealish joined the club aged six and made 213 appearances in all competitions, scoring 32 goals. He said: ""It was obviously a difficult few months because I have been an Aston Villa fan for my whole life, but when I spoke to the manager here and you see what type of players they have got here, in the end it was something I couldn't say no to. ""Competing for major trophies is something that I wanted to do. It was something I couldn't turn down. ""Playing in the Champions League was a massive thing for me, I haven't done that yet. When I was sitting there on a Tuesday or Wednesday night last year it was just what I wanted to do. To be able to do it with this club is going to be a dream. ""I had a long chat with [Pep Guardiola] about positions and stuff like that, all football. It was such a positive chat and shows why I want to play under him.

He made his Villa debut in a 4-0 defeat by City in May 2014 and made 17 Premier League appearances during the 2014-15 season as Villa finished one place above the relegation zone. During the following season, he scored his first top-flight goal against Leicester City in September 2015 and made 16 league appearances as Villa finished bottom and were relegated to the Championship. Villa spent three seasons in the Championship before Grealish helped them regain their Premier League status with a play-off final win against Derby County. He made 36 Premier League appearances during 2019-20 and scored eight goals, including one in the1-1 draw against West Ham Unitedwhich secured Villa's top-flight survival on the final day of a season interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. A Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, Grealish announced in 2015 that he wanted to represent England. Having switched to their Under-21 side, he made his senior England debut in a goalless draw against Denmark in September 2020. Jack Grealish's stats for Aston Villa during the 2020-21 Premier League season Last season, Grealish scored six goals in 26 Premier League appearances, including two in a 7-2 win over Liverpool, as Villa finished 11th. He spent three months out injured from mid-February to mid-May but his return just before the end of the campaign saw him selected in England manager Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2020. Grealish impressed in warm-up wins against Austria and Romania and made one start and four substitute appearances, registering two assists, for England during the tournament. (Premier League 2020-21 season) Aston Villa with Grealish Aston Villa without Grealish Games 26 12 Win % 50% 25% Goals for 42 13 Goals against 29 17 Points per game 1.7 1.0 Analysis by BBC Sport's Simon Stone For all the nudges about Manchester City's spending and the questions about how the club manages to do deals like this one without falling foul of profit and sustainability rules, it is worth noting they are now responsible for the biggest single purchase by an English club during their Abu Dhabi ownership for only the second time. The first occasion was that never-to-be-forgotten night in 2008 when Sheikh Mansour went on an elaborate sweep of available players to prove he was a man to be taken seriously and spent Â£50m on Brazil striker Robinho. In the same period, Manchester United have held the record seven times. It is United's Â£89m purchase of Paul Pogba in 2016 that the Grealish deal has overtaken. Of City's 'big six' rivals, only Tottenham have not invested a significant sum in an individual player during the pandemic - although United and Chelsea are the only clubs that can truly be argued to have spent such high sums so consistently over so many seasons. There is a book-balancing exercise going on as well. Including Leroy Sane's exit for Bayern Munich last summer and the Â£11m they received as a sell-on payment from Borussia Dortmund's sale of Jadon Sancho to Manchester United, City sources argue the club has already raised Â£109.5m over the past 12 months - with - potentially - another Â£55m to come through sales of younger players. This does not include the exit of high-earning Sergio Aguero to Barcelona, nor the potential sales of bigger names before the transfer window closes, the most likely of which is Bernardo Silva, who wants to move to Spain. On the basis that some clubs will always have more money than others, some may wonder why this is important anyway. However, given their recent skirmish with Uefa over Financial Fair Play, it is understandable why City are sensitive when it comes to their finances. Evidently though, the club is in a different place to 20 years ago, when they were trying to re-invent themselves under Kevin Keegan. Back then their idea of a big name was Eyal Berkovic, who joined them from Celtic for Â£1.5m. Find all the latest football transferson our dedicated page.

"The prime minister and transport secretary have defended changes to the UK's traffic light travel system, as an airline has scheduled extra flights to return Britons from red-listed Mexico. Up to 6,000 British tourists are currently in the country, and those who want to avoid quarantine will need to return before 04:00 BST on Sunday. The changewas announced on Wednesday. Grant Shapps said a new plan to review restrictions every three weeks will make for a ""simplified system"". Boris Johnson said that the government wanted people to be able to travel but had to balance that desire with the ""need to protect us against new variants"". Asked whether he would book a holiday to Spain, the prime minister said the government was trying to make travel as simple as possible by lengthening the gap between changes to guidance. Transport secretary Mr Shapps said this meant people would be able to travel ""without looking over their shoulders"". The travel list changes apply for passengers returning to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. TheWelsh government said on Thursday evening that it would follow the changes, due to sharing an open border with England, but said it was ""extremely disappointed"" and would continue to advise against non-essential international travel. Countries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit.

Moving from amber to green:Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway Moving from red to amber:India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE Moving from amber to red:Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte Moving from amber-plus to amber:France Read more on what the colours mean for testing and quarantine,here. On Thursday, Mr Shapps sought to reassure British holidaymakers that the traffic light system would now be reviewed every three weeks - compared with once a week last summer and more recent ad-hoc changes - because of the number of people in the UK and abroad who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I hope people will be able to go away under this simplified system, enjoy their breaks and not be looking over their shoulders the whole time."" Mr Shapps said that between 5,000 and 6,000 British holidaymakers are in Mexico currently and would be ""making arrangements to come home"". From 12 August, the cost of hotel quarantine will increase, with the price for single adult travellers rising from Â£1,750 to Â£2,285 and a second adult paying Â£1,430. The government has said this better reflects the costs involved, including transport, security and PCR tests. Children aged 5-12 will still cost Â£325; it is free for children aged under five. British Airways said its teams had been ""working through the night"" to arrange additional seats out of Mexico and had added four additional flights to London over the next three days, as well as rearranging another flight to land ahead of the deadline. It said customers could re-book their flights from Mexico ""at no additional cost"" ahead of the deadline. Robin and Viv Silverthorne, from Worthing in Sussex, were flying to Cancun, Mexico, yesterday when they found out mid-air that the country was being placed on the red list. Robin says the couple spent hours on the phone trying to speak to their airline ""without success"" before making the decision to come home after just a day to avoid paying for a quarantine hotel. He told the BBC: ""It's not just us, there was a plane full of holidaymakers in the same boat, some with children who will now have to pay thousands to quarantine on return. ""We have only just secured a return flight via Miami tomorrow. We have essentially paid a total of Â£8,000 for a day trip to Mexico."" He says the couple had done their research and just wanted a ""nice holiday"" - but that the latest changes to the rules had left Viv in tears. Also in Mexico are Claudia Rattray and her daughters Ivana and Summer who travelled to Mexico City to visit her family only to find out that the country had been added to the red list when they arrived. ""I decided to enjoy the time here with my family and I am going to see if in three weeks the government reviews this list,"" she said. ""But I think if not I am going to stay here in Mexico because I can't afford to pay for a quarantine hotel."" She added that they were lucky that they were staying with family and so had the option of staying for longer. Asked about the advice on PCR tests for arrivals from Spain, Mr Shapps insisted the government was ""not changing the rules"", as in Spain's case, ""virtually everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test. But in aseries of tweets,externalConservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee, said PCR tests for travel were an ""unnecessary rip-off"" and a ""barrier to affordable travel"". Mr Shapps also said he believes full vaccination will be increasingly important for future travel. ""Most countries, probably all countries, will require full vaccination in order for you to enter"", he said. Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon criticised the government for ""flip-flopping over France"" and reiterated calls for data upon which travel list decisions are made to be published. Grant Shapps told the Today Programme that the government's advice to those returning to the UK from Spain to use a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever possible, was ""not actually a change"". This does not appear to be the case. The existing guidance applying to Spain tells people returning to the UK that they need to take a private test in the three days before travelling. The guidance says that could be a PCR test or a (cheaper) lateral flow test as long as it meets UK requirements. Many travellers order a lateral flow test in the UK and take it with them to use in Spain. The travel operator Tui told Reality Check that more than 90% of its customers buy a package with their holiday that includes that sort of test. Mr Shapps also said that ""virtually everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test. But we've spoken to several people who have used lateral flow tests in Spain in recent weeks and had no trouble using them to return to the UK. If you have been in a red list country in the last 10 days, you can only enter the UK ifyou are a UK or Irish national or UK resident, and you must stay at a quarantine hotel on your return. The total number of countries or territorieson the green list,external- from which all travellers can return without having to quarantine - rises from 29 to 36 when the changes come into effect. The UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. The travel industry has welcomed France's addition to the amber list but trade association Abta said the speed at which countries were being added to the green list was at a ""snail's pace"", with the seven added not being traditional holiday destinations. BA boss Sean Doyle said that the UK's travel sector was ""lagging behind Europe"" due to ""more stringent testing requirements"" and a red list ""significantly broader than our European peers"". Industry body Airlines UK has warned ""tens of thousands of jobs are at stake"" as it called for the furlough scheme to be extended. The government acknowledged it was a difficult time for the sector but said it was providing ""an unprecedented package of support"".

"The global giant which produces the Oatly oat milk drink accused a rival of copyright breaches A family-run farm has won a legal battle against the multimillion-pound makers of plant milk, Oatly, which accused it of trademark infringement. Oatly brought legal action against Glebe Farm Foods, in Cambridgeshire, saying their product PureOaty took ""unfair advantage"" of their own drink. A High Court judge ruled in favour of the farm saying he did not see ""any risk of injury to the distinctive character"" of the Oatly brand. The farm said it was ""gratifying"". Oatly was founded in the 1990s and produces a milk substitute made from oats. The brand is endorsed by a number of celebrities including Oprah Winfrey. During the two-day hearing in June, the court heard Oatly had sold more than Â£38m worth of its ""barista edition"" oat milk, and more than Â£13m of other varieties. Glebe Farm Foods, based near Huntingdon, launched an oat milk in 2019 called ""Oat Drink"", before rebranding it ""PureOaty"" in 2020. Oatly's lawyers said the farm hadinfringed five of their firm's trademarkswith the ""PureOaty"" name and the drink's packaging, as well as ""passing off"" their product as Oatly's. Oatly sought a High Court injunction earlier this year to stop Glebe Farm Foods selling its PureOaty brand Glebe Farm Foods, run by brother and sister Philip and Rebecca Rayner, denied the claims. Ruling in favour of the farm, Judge Nicholas Caddick QC, said while there were similarities between the initial PureOaty packaging and the Oatly packaging, including the use of the colour blue and the use of an irregular font for the product name, these were ""at a very general level"". ""It is hard to see how any relevant confusion would arise from the defendant's use of the sign 'PureOaty',"" he said. He concluded: ""On the facts of this case, I do not see that there is any risk of injury to the distinctive character of Oatly's marks."" Philip and Rebecca Rayner said the outcome was ""enormously gratifying"" Mr Rayner said his farm had ""always felt certain that we have done nothing wrong"". ""You only need to look at the two products and packaging side by side to appreciate how different these brands are, and how unnecessary this legal action was,"" he said. ""It is enormously gratifying... to see that smaller independent companies can fight back and win."" A spokeswoman for Oatly said the company would not be appealing the decision. ""For us, this case has always been about protecting our trademark and how the single letter Y creates too much of a similarity between Oaty and Oatly."" She said Oatly wished Glebe Farm Foods ""total success... moving forward"", but added: ""We just think they should do so in their own unique voice, just like we do.""

"This video can not be played Jordan and Emily Burns can now have their wedding celebration with friends and family Most of Wales' remaining Covid rules will be lifted as the nation enters the ""final lap"" of the pandemic, the first minister has said. Social distancing laws and rules on who can meet indoors will end on Saturday, almost 17 months after the first lockdown. However, rules will remain tighter than in England, with face masks still required by law in many public places. Mark Drakeford said they will likely be needed for the rest of the year. He warned the changes did not mean a ""free-for-all"". Wales will move to alert level zero - the lowest level of restrictions seen so far - from 06:00 BST on Saturday. What are the new Covid rules in Wales? Teens aged 16-17 to be offered jabs in Wales What are the latest changes to the Covid rules across the UK? This video can not be played Two-metre distancing and masks will not be legally required in pubs and restaurant from 7 August Mr Drakeford said as the case rate had steadily declined for the past three weeks and vaccinations had increased, most rules could now be scrapped. He told a press briefing that the easing of restrictions was a ""significant moment for all of us"" and a ""big step closer to life before the pandemic started"". In response to the news, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives said it was time for a Wales-specific inquiry into the way the pandemic had been handled in Wales. The first minister urged people to be sensible, to continue to practise social distancing, think about who they meet and where, and not behave as if the ""virus has disappeared"". ""Most people in Wales want to go on acting carefully to protect their health and the health of others,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said with such major changes to rules, the impact on case rates needed to be seen and so no further relaxation was expected to be made for ""at least six weeks"". This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said the easing of restrictions was a ""significant moment for all of us"" Mr Drakeford said while he did not expect Wales to have to return to tight restrictions such as lockdown measures, he could not rule anything out if there was a ""sudden change for the worse"". However, he said: ""Provided we do not see further unexpected turns in the course of the virus, then I think we can have confidence that we are on the final lap of emerging from the pandemic."" Under the changes from Saturday: There will be no limit on the numbers that can meet indoors, including in homes, public places and at events Any businesses still closed, such as nightclubs, can reopen Laws requiring companies and organisations to socially distance indoors will end Pubs will no longer have to provide table service However companies will still be expected to take measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted on their premises. It will be the law to wear face masks in indoor public places including shops, buses and trains, and in health and social care settings, but not in venues where food and drink is served, such as pubs. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales face coverings were ""likely"" to play a part in helping tackle coronavirus ""for the rest of this year"". While the changes will see most of Wales' rules lifted, more restrictions remain in place than across the border in England,where they were scrapped on so-called ""freedom day"" on 18 July. Most restrictions in Scotland will come to anend on Monday- and with face masks still required in shops, the rules will be similar to here in Wales. Meanwhile, inNorthern Ireland ruleson who you can meet and where remain in place. Laws on who you can meet indoors have existed since the start of the lockdown in March 2020. Current restrictions  - to be scrapped on Saturday - say only six people are able to meet in private homes. People will continue to have to self-isolate by law for 10 days if they get Covid, while the Welsh government advice will be to continue to work from home where possible. However, those who are fully vaccinated and are found to be a close contact of a positive Covid casewill not need to self-isolate from Saturday. The decision to lift the social distancing duty on businesses means firms will instead be expected to put in place measures to keep people safe and draw up risk assessments. That could see them continuing to require social distancing, face masks, or use other measures such as ventilation or a combination of these, with the first minister saying he did not expect ""large crowds of people"" would be seen at bars as businesses tried to keep punters safe. You can go ""out out"" in Wales from Saturday with nightclubs able to open Some pub and bar owners have said while they were pleased to be able to ""throw away the measuring tape"", the onus on businesses to set their own rules was unfair. Joanne Cooney, owner of Cooney's Bar in Llandudno, said with rules being different in England, some places had reported issues with tourists refusing to wear masks and stay apart, and having different rules in different businesses could make it worse. ""We are having to try and figure out very confusing guidance... people think everything's gone back to normal, but it's not, they've just said 'it's all on you now'"", shetold BBC Radio Wales. Ms Cooney said the guidance setting out what businesses should do from Saturday was ""unclear"", and called for clarity from the Welsh government. Responding to the concerns, Mr Drakeford said the guidance was clear, and the measures were to make sure staff and customers were ""properly protected"" and give people confidence they could go out. Jordan and Emily Burns are having their wedding on the day restrictions ease Wedding receptions have been subject to restrictions since March 2020 - but from Saturday those will be lifted. Jordan and Emily Burns, from Buckley in Flintshire, should have been married in April 2020 - two weeks after lockdown began. They have rearranged their ceremony four times since and had a small, legal marriage ceremony four months ago. On Saturday, however, they will have the big wedding they always wanted at Ty'n Dwr Hall in Llangollen. Mrs Burns said: ""It's been only six to a table in weddings - our tables will have 24 people, which just seems crazy doesn't it? ""We're able to have the ceremony indoors so we're not worried with the weather. It just takes so much pressure off us as well and we can just look forward to it, be excited and just enjoy the day."" DJ Stacey Alford said the pandemic ""pulled the plug"" on her career Stacey Alford, a DJ from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said the pandemic ""pulled the plug"" on her career. She said the music community was excited to see Wales moving to alert level zero, but was aware of the need for caution. ""The general consensus is 'get us in there, we can't wait' - but obviously we want everyone to just take it slowly, enjoy themselves but not be silly."" The changes mean there will be fewer Covid rules to police. But Mark Jones, general secretary of the North Wales Police Federation, fears a return to normality for the public will put pressure on officers. ""We're seeing the first time in near enough two summers where freedom is there, so a lot of people will be coming to visit north Wales and we're anticipating demands on policing, which means that the thin blue line is going to be stretched even further and further,"" he said. Exactly 500 days after telling us to stay home, Mark Drakeford has confirmed an end to the rules on who and where we meet. He has deliberately avoided repeating Boris Johnson's assurance that we are on an ""irreversible"" path out. But the success of the vaccination programme means the bar for ""re-imposing severe restrictions will be higher"", the Welsh government says. The next step is to provide booster jabs. Some people will get one with their annual flu jab in the autumn. In a clear signal about the ongoing threat of the pandemic, ministers say they are worried about a ""perfect storm"" of Covid and flu this winter. Following the announcement, opposition parties called for people to act responsibly, and pressed again for a Wales-only inquiry into the handling of Covid by the Welsh government. More than 7,900 have died since the pandemic began. Plaid Cymru said it wanted ""reassurance from government that lessons have been learnt"", and the Tories said those who have suffered should be given justice. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said that as Wales moved forward people had to ""take responsibility"" to stop cases rising. ""We are going to have to learn to live with Covid, because we can't afford to go back into the lockdowns that have blighted our lives in the past 15, 16 months,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, welcomed the move forward, but said the ministers must be ready to take a step back if necessary. ""Now what we want as these freedoms come back is to see in clear evidence terms that government is honing its early-warning systems even more, is even more vigilant about any curveballs sent in our direction,"" he said. However, Mr Drakeford, who has already agreed to a UK-wide inquiry, said a Wales specific inquiry would not give a ""proper understanding"" of how the pandemic was handled. Wales has seen a third wave of coronavirus cases in recent months - but it peaked on 16 July and has been decreasing ever since. Latest figures published on Friday showed Wales' case rate had fallen slightly, to 132.4 per 100,000 people over a seven-day period. They also showed 66% of Wales' total population was fully vaccinated,with health boards now inviting 16 and 17-year-olds for their jabs. Mr Drakeford said health boards were ready to start offering booster jabs from September, but the government were waiting for advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

"This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Barcelona say Lionel Messi will not be staying at the club ""because of financial and structural obstacles"". Messi, 34, has been a free agent since 1 July when his contract expired. He agreed a new deal on reduced wages with the club two weeks later, but it was dependent on Barca selling players to afford his salary. ""Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of the player and the club will ultimately not be fulfilled,"" the club said. Is this really the end for Messi at Barcelona? Listen: The Football Daily Podcast breaks down Messi's bombshell announcement Barcelona had said Messi was poised to extend his 21-year association with the club by signing the new deal on Thursday, and blame La Liga for the failure to do so. He had reached an agreement to stay with the Catalan side until 2026 - but La Liga said the club must reduce wages before he and any new players can be registered. ""Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles [Spanish La Liga regulations],"" the club said. ""FC Barcelona wholeheartedly expresses its gratitude to the player for his contribution to the aggrandisement of the club and wishes him all the very best for the future in his personal and professional life."" This video can not be played Copa America: 'That's what you expect of him' - Messi scores free-kick for Argentina Messi is Barcelona's record scorer with 672 goals and has won 10 La Liga titles, four Champions Leagues and seven Copa del Reys, as well as claiming the Ballon d'Or on a record six occasions. Keeping Messi at the Nou Camp had been president Joan Laporta's top priority this summer. The Barca future of a player who is widely regarded as being one of the world's greatest of all time, however, has been severely complicated by the club's financial problems. The presidential election earlier this year was held against the backdrop ofBarca being on the verge of bankruptcy. The Argentine arguably now becomes the most in-demand player in world football. Messi has long been linked with a move to either Paris St-Germain or Manchester City, where he would be reunited with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola. America's Major League Soccer, which Messi has previously considered experiencing, is another option. The announcement that Messi is to move on comes a year after he sent a fax to Barcelona bosses saying he wished to exercise a clause in his contract that would have allowed him to leave for free last summer. Days laterhe said he would stay,admitting it was ""impossible"" for any team to pay his 700m euro (Â£624m) release clause, which Barca insisted needed to be met. Aged 13 Messi joined Barca's famed La Masia academy in 2000 from Argentine side Newell's Old Boys and made his senior debut aged 16 in 2004. He has gone on to make 778 appearances for the club, scoring 672 goals, including 120 Champions League goals (second behind Cristiano Ronaldo), and a record 474 La Liga goals. He has collected the European Golden Shoe award for the continent's top scorer on six occasions. 25 August 2020- Messi sends a fax to the club saying he wishes toexercise a clause in his contract, allowing him to leave for free with immediate effect. 4 September 2020-Messi says he is staying at Barcelonabecause it is ""impossible"" for any team to pay his 700m euro (Â£624m) release clause, which the club insist would have to be met. 27 October 2020- Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who had fallen out with Messi over his failed transfer request,resigns. 28 December 2020- Messi says he hopesto one day play in the United States, but is unsure of his future when his contract runs out. 31 January 2021- Barcelona say they will take ""appropriate legal action"" against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after itpublished details of Messi's contract, worth Â£492m over four years. 16 May 2021- Manager Ronald Koeman says he hopes Messi has not played his final home game for the club after a2-1 defeat by Celta Vigoended their title hopes and meant they finished outside the top two for the first time since 2007-08. 22 May 2021- Paris St-Germain are believed to be""looking closely"" at Messi's contractsituation. 28 May 2021- Barcelona president Joan Laporta says a new contract for Lionel Messi is""not done yet""but that ""things are going well"". 1 July 2021- Messi's Barcelona contract expires and hebecomes a free agent. 15 July 2021-Messi agrees to stay with Barcaon a deal until 2026 that includes reducing his wages. 5 August 2021- Barcelona announce Lionel Messi will leave the club ""because of financial and structural obstacles"".

"This video can not be played CCTV captures the final moments of a 19-year-old student murdered in a drive-by shooting. Seven men have been jailed for murdering a student who was shot dead in a feud between two rival tyre firms. Aya Hachem, 19, was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" when she was killed in the botched drive-by shooting in Blackburn on 17 May last year. Tyre firm boss Feroz Suleman, 40, had arranged the execution of a rival businessman but the gunman he hired shot dead Ms Hachem instead. He was jailed at Preston Crown Court for life with a minimum of 34 years. The judge, Mr Justice Turner, told Suleman he was ""the driving force behind the whole deadly enterprise from beginning to end and followed through this plan with obsessive determination"". ""When you were in prison you commented you were the captain of the ship and if you were to go down then everyone would go down with you. How right you were,"" he said. The student passer-by caught up in a fatal feud Ms Hachem was shot as she was walking to the supermarket to buy food for her family to eat when they broke their Ramadan fast. The Salford University law student, who dreamed of becoming a solicitor, was fatally struck by the second of two bullets fired at 15:00 BST. Gunman Zamir Raja, 33, who agreed to carrying out the shooting for Â£1,500, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years.Â Accomplices Kashif Manzoor, 26, Ayaz Hussain, 36, Abubakr Satia, 32, Anthony Ennis, 31, and Uthman Satia, 29, were also jailed for life. Aya Hachem was on her way to the shops to buy food for her family when she was shot dead In a moving victim impact statement, Ms Hachem's father Ismail said he had brought his family to the UK to ""seek a better life"" in 2011 after fleeing from violence in Lebanon. He told the court his daughter was a ""shining star in our lives and would always make us smile and happy even when times were bad"". ""Aya was determined to do well in life. I once told her she would be the prime minister,"" he said. ""They didn't just kill Aya they killed our whole family. The light in our lives has gone out, all of our hopes and dreams have gone."" Seven guilty of student's drive-by shooting murder Tyre firm boss 'had ringside seat' as student shot Businessman 'was target' of shot that killed woman The feud between the two businesses started in early 2019 when Quickshine Tyres, which previously only washed cars, began selling tyres next door to RI Tyres. The bitter dispute escalated and Suleman hatched a murderous plot to kill Pachah Khan, the proprietor of Quickshine, with the help of his accomplices. The court heard how a Toyota Avensis driven by Ennis with hitman Raja on board drove past Quickshine on three occasions shortly before the fatal fourth journey. Footage from CCTV cameras captured Suleman standing outside his premises with a ""ringside seat"" to the shooting. Top row L-R: Abubakr Satia, Anthony Ennis, Ayaz Hussain, Feroz Suleman. Bottom row L-R: Kashif Manzoor, Uthman Satia, Zamir Raja and Judy Chapman Giving evidence at the 12-week trial, father-of-two Suleman, who was previously jailed in 2001 for causing the death of a 67-year-old man by dangerous driving, denied any knowledge of a plot to kill Mr Khan. However, Hussain told jurors that Suleman wanted Mr Khan ""roughed up"" and introduced him to Raja who suggested a drive-by with shots fired in the air to scare him. Suleman was quoted a price of Â£1,500 and excitedly agreed straightaway, said Hussain, who also claimed there was no plan to kill Mr Khan. On Tuesday, jurors took less than four hours to find the seven men guilty of murdering Ms Hachem and the attempted murder of Mr Khan. Sentencing them, Mr Justice Turner said: ""None of you seven showed any remorse in the aftermath of the shooting. Together you tried to lie, scheme and plot your way out of trouble. ""It was not long before you all started to sacrifice your co-defendants in an attempt to save your own skins."" Judy Chapman, 26, of Great Harwood, who drove the gunman and driver from Bolton with her boyfriend Uthman Satia, was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter and will be sentenced on 1 October. Suleman, of Blackburn, who instigated and organised the hit, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 34 years Raja, of Stretford, who was the gunman, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 34 years Ennis, of Partington, who drove the car carrying the gunman during the shooting, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 33 years Hussain, of Blackburn, who played a key role in organising and orchestrating the shooting, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years Abubakr Satia, of Blackburn, who sourced the car used in the shooting, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years Uthman Satia, of Great Harwood, who was responsible for transporting the gunman and driver, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years Manzoor, of Blackburn, who was responsible for ensuring the car was running on the day, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 27 years Correction: This story was published on 5 August but republished in error on 29 November The student passer-by caught up in a fatal feud Seven guilty of student's drive-by shooting murder Businessman denies plotting drive-by shooting Businessman 'was target' of shot that killed woman Tyre firm boss 'had ringside seat' as student shot Student shot dead 'amid feud between tyre firms' HM Courts & Tribunals Service A whole estate of road closures & other major roadworks starting in Preston & South Ribble Investigation launched after reported raped on Meadow Street just after midnight M6 and M55 three months of overnight closures at Preston confirmed Public urged not to approach man wanted in connection with rape Future secure for cancer charityâs support sessions for radiotherapy patientsÂ across Lancaster and Morecambe Lancaster City Council to host careers fair Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Domenico Paviglianiti was arrested on the streets of Madrid carrying six mobile phones A suspected boss of Italy's powerful 'Ndrangheta mafia clan, which controls much of Europe's cocaine trade, has been arrested in Spain. Domenico Paviglianiti, one of Italy's most wanted fugitives, was detained on the streets of Madrid, officials say. Dubbed the ""boss of the bosses"", Paviglianiti, 60, had been on the run for two years. The 'Ndrangheta is one of the world's richest criminal groups, operating from Calabria in southern Italy. Officers hunted the fugitive down following a joint operation carried out by Italian and Spanish authorities. Paviglianiti had six mobile phones, nearly â¬6,000 (Â£5,000) in cash and fake Portuguese documentation on him when he was arrested on Tuesday while leaving his house. Wanted for his role in crimes committed in the 1980s and 1990s, including murder and drug trafficking, Paviglianiti was first arrested in Spain in 1996. He was extradited three years later to Italy, where he was convicted and began serving a life sentence. But in 2019 he was released early due to an error in his sentencing. He fled to Spain, where he was allegedly helped by family members who live there. An Italian court handed Paviglianiti a fresh 11-year jail sentence in absentia in January for a series of crimes, including murder and criminal association with the aim of drug trafficking. Police believe Paviglianiti is the head of a 'Ndrangheta clan, overseeing shipments of cocaine from South America. The 'Ndrangheta has amassed huge wealth importing cocaine from Latin America and hashish from North Africa into Europe.

"France is moving to the amber list under widespread changes to travel rules in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland It means that from 04:00 BST on Sunday, fully vaccinated passengers coming back from the country will no longer need to quarantine Germany, Austria and Norway are among seven nations added to the green list Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates move to the amber list - and Spain is staying there Up to 6,000 British holidaymakers are trying to get home from Mexico, which is among four countries to move to red British Airways boss Sean Doyle says the UK is ""lagging behind Europe"" with stricter testing requirements and a bigger red list Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, says he is disappointed but the news provides ""some reassurance"" to customers 189,232 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to 28 July - down 39% on the previous week One in five people in hospital in England with Covid is aged between 18 and 34, the new NHS England boss has said Edited by Hazel Shearing and James Clarke That's all for today. We'll be back again in the morning with more Covid updates from the UK and around the world. Your writers today were Joshua Cheetham, Jo Couzens and Victoria Lindrea. The editors were Hazel Shearing and James Clarke. See you tomorrow. Thanks for joining us today - here is a summary of the main headlines at the close of the day. Reality Check Grant
Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the governmentâs advice to those returning
to the UK from Spain to âuse a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever
possibleâ was ânot actually a changeâ. This
does not appear to be the case. The
existing guidance applying to Spain tells people returning to the UK they
need to take a private test in the three days before travelling. The
guidance says that could be a PCR test or a (cheaper) lateral flow test as long
as it meets UK requirements. Many
travellers order a lateral flow test in the UK and take it with them to use in
Spain. The travel operator Tui has told Reality Check more than 90% of its
customers buy a package with their holiday that includes that sort of test. Shapps also said ""virtually
everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards
for the pre-departure test. But
weâve spoken to several people who have used lateral flow tests in Spain in
recent weeks and had no trouble using them to return to the UK.  The Welsh government has criticised the ""ad-hoc nature"" of the UK government's travel decisions following the latest changes that will see more destinations added to the green and amber lists. It says it will consider whether to follow the latest changes, adding: ""We continue to advise against all but essential travel abroad because of the continuing risk of infection."" The UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. Scotland and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will be adopting the same changes as England. Transport secretary Grant Shapps earlierdefended changes to England's traffic light travel system, after it was announced Mexico would move to the red list. Mexico, Georgia, La Reunion and Mayotte are now considered high-risk destinations and will move to the red list from Sunday, following the most recent shake-up of travel rules by the UK government. Holidaymakers need to return from these countries by the Sunday deadline  or face paying to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Simultaneously the government has announced the cost of hotel quarantine will increase from 12 August, with the price for single adult travellers rising from Â£1,750 to Â£2,285 and a second adult paying Â£1,430. The government has said this better reflects the costs involved, including transport, security and PCR tests. For children aged 5-12 it will still cost Â£325; it is free for children aged under five. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the hotel quarantine system has been designed to ""pay for itself"" and should not be at the cost of taxpayers, who, he says, have paid about Â£75m towards the programme. He stresses people should not be travelling to red list countries and they are ""off the reservation as far as travel is concerned"". But between 5,000 and 6,000 British holidaymakers are in Mexico currently. British Airways says its teams have been ""working through the night to arrange as many additional seats out of Mexico as possible to help get Britons home"" before the destination joins the red list. It adds customers can re-book their flights from Mexico ""at no additional cost"" ahead of the deadline. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What tests are required before travelling to Mallorca and on return for fully vaccinated people in the UK? If you're fully vaccinated heading out, you wonât need any
tests. You will need to fill in a health declaration form, which you
can find on theBalearic islands tourist authority website,external. If you were not vaccinated, you would have to take a PCR test
â one of the laboratory tests â before leaving the UK. On return from a country on the amber list, which the
Balearic islands are, if youâre fully vaccinated you can come into the UK
without having to quarantine. If you are not fully vaccinated, you will need to isolate for
10 days. Fully vaccinated passengers will have to undergo a PCR test
within two days of arriving. Why a PCR test and not the cheaper lateral flow? Itâs
so that if the government does detect cases coming into the UK, it can analyse
the genome of the Covid variant and therefore know which variants are being
brought into the country. Youâll also have to fill out a passenger locator form on
your return. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Large-scale events and exhibitions are being cancelled or
postponed in Chinaâs capital, Beijing, as cases of the coronavirus continue to
grow in the country. The Beijing government has today stressed events taking place
in Augustshould be cancelled,external, and public places such as parks, cinemas and
libraries should now start limiting the number of visitors they have. The Beijing International Film Festival was set to go ahead on 14
August, but has now confirmed the event has been postponed. A new date
has not yet been set. A number of universities in the capital, including the prestigious
Tsinghua University, have also announced they are delaying the start of their
new terms. Part of the city is in lockdown,external, and many inbound transport links
have been suspended Two weeks ago, cases of Covid-19 were detected at an international
airport in the eastern city of Nanjing. Cases of the virus have now been detected in 17 of Chinaâs
provincial-level regions. Many cases are the Delta variant, and so earlier this
week, the central government urged against non-essential travel. Asked about current travel rules, Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has said his big concern is ""the sheer cost of testing - and the very fact that the reason for the testing, being sequencing, is not actually being carried out in full"". Merriman suggests just 5% of tests are being used for sequencing - blaming the spike in domestic cases. He says the cost of PCR tests - which is often two or three times the cost of a lateral flow test - is ""pricing out holidays for those that don't have the means to pay for those tests"". ""If only 5% of PCR tests are being sequenced, then surely it's a complete waste of money."" He says he supports the traffic light system, providing it remains straightforward: ""I think we just need to keep it to red, amber, green and nothing else in between.""   Thelatest
figures,externalshow deaths have increased by 14.4% per 100,000 people from the previous week (23
to 29 July), with 571 recorded in the past seven days, a rise of 72. Cases have fallen 10.4%
per 100,000 people from the previous week, with 183,406 recorded between 30 July
and 5 August, a fall of 21,263. Another 33,334 people in the UK have had a first dose of a coronavirus
vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 88.7% of the adult population
has now had at least one jab. And a further 165,669 have had a second vaccine dose now. As of today, 73.5% of the adult population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 30,215 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 86 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Reality Check India
has been taken off the UKâs travel âred listâ and some people are asking why
Pakistan hasnât. The
UKâscriteria,externalfor putting countries on the list includes: In
the past month, Pakistanâs positivity rate has been rising and currently stands
at about 9%  - attributed to the Delta variant. But
Indiaâs positivity rate has remained below the World Health Organizationâs
(WHO) recommended 5% since June. However, it should be noted that comparing countries does depend on
the quality of testing. Pakistan
has increased daily testing capacity since July but it hasnât reached the
levels seen in April during the third wave. Although
it does have genome sequencing capabilities, sequencing rates are low. Pakistan
has sequenced just 0.044% of total reported cases and India 0.126%, according
toa monitoring
database,external. The UK has sequenced 10.7%. Of
the thousands of travellers from India and Pakistan who weretested
by the NHS in July,external, less than 1% were positive from both countries. The
numbers of samples collected and tests sequenced have recently decreased. Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. Here's a look at therules around isolating- for the fully vaccinated and those who have not received a jab - and what to do if alerted by the NHS Covid app. Ofcom sayslockdowns were the key drivers behind an increase in screen timein 2020. UK adults spent nearly a third of their waking hours watching TV and online video content over the year. Daily screen time averaged five hours and 40 minutes - up 47 minutes on the previous year. And, for the first time, more households had a Netflix subscription than a paid TV account such as cable or satellite. By the third quarter of 2020, 60% of all UK households were spending time on services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video - up from 49% a year earlier. ""The pandemic undoubtedly turbo-charged viewing to streaming services, with three in five UK homes now signed up,"" said Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom's group director of research. YouTube remained the most popular user-generated online video service, but Chinese-owned video app TikTok was gaining in popularity - and used by 31% of adult internet users by March 2021.

Eurostar, which runs the high-speed rail service between the UK and France, has welcomed the removal of quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers returning from France to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland from Sunday. ""Overnight we have seen a strong increase in bookings on our London-Paris route and traffic to our website has more than doubled,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are looking forward to welcoming more passengers on board as early as this weekend, and we are ready to further increase capacity over the coming weeks to carry many more passengers between the UK and the continent during the August holiday season.â The number of procedures being carried out in Northern Ireland's hospital theatres has fallen by 46%, according to the latest official figures. There were 59,762 procedures across all of the health trusts in 2020/21 compared with 110,605 the previous year. The decrease highlights the massive reduction in work being carried out across the system during the pandemic. Find out morehere. Covid-19 case rates in all regions of England are continuing to fall, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England (PHE). Yorkshire and the Humber has the highest rate, with 354.7 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 1 August - down from 422.5 week-on-week. South-east England has the lowest rate of 229.5, down from 289.6. In terms of age, the highest rate was among those aged between 20 and 29, followed by those aged between 10 and 19. And PHE says England's Covid-19 vaccine rollout is estimated to have directly averted more than 66,900 hospital admissions. Previous estimates put the number of admissions at more than 52,600. Turnaround times for coronavirus swab tests have improved, the latest figures for England from NHS Test and Trace show. In the week up to 28 July, 89% of tests taken in person - for example, at mobile testing units, drive-throughs and walk-in centres - reported back within 24 hours, compared to around 64% the week before. For home tests during this period, the wait decreased from 46 hours to 33 hours. The turnaround for tests in care homes and at NHS trusts decreased from 52 hours to 35 hours. Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Travel Association, says ""a simpler [international travel] system is definitely what is required to avoid confusion in the case of consumers"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, he said it would also provide some form of certainty for people who are wanting to travel - and in some cases ""absolutely need to travel"". Walsh also said the market for PCR tests was ""in many cases unregulated"", with tests being advertised online for Â£20 but actually costing Â£150. A Covid test is needed three days before returning from an amber country, anda PCR test two days after arriving.Those arriving from Spain are being asked to use a PCR test for the first of those two tests. ""This expensive and unnecessary testing I think needs to be challenged and I think the government should demonstrate why they require it,"" Walsh said. ""I think there is a valid reason and a concern, and I would accept that maybe for some of these high-risk countries that have been identified you can make the argument that some form of testing should be done."" But, referring to the number of PCR tests he said had been taken by travellers since 25 February, he added: ""I don't think you can justify requiring 2.2 million people to undertake PCR tests when only 8,000 of those are subsequently sequenced."" A resident in Karachi, Pakistan, receives a dose of coronavirus vaccine Two Labour MPs are demanding an explanation from the UK transport secretary as to why Pakistan
has been ""punished"" and kept on the red list. Yasmin Qureshi and Naz Shahhave bothwritten to Grant Shapps,externalasking why the country,externalis still on the red list, when neighbouring India - which has higher
Covid rates - has been moved to the amber list. The pair said the government was ""playing politics"" with the travel alert system, claiming it was only
opening up the UK to nations ""it stands to benefit from
economically"". Figures cited by both MPs suggest the seven-day Covid rate
in India is 20 per 100,000 people, compared with 14 per 100,000 people in
Pakistan. Qureshi, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Pakistan, added the ""raw amount of cases"" in Pakistan is
""five times lower"" than the UK. Shapps said factors for moving countries from the
red list include the number of people there who had received a vaccine, the reliability of
local Covid data, and the level of prevalence of the virus. A coronavirus pandemicmemorial featuring a carpet of 5,000 steel leaveshas been laid out on the floor of Worcester Cathedral. The Leaves of the Trees, by artist Peter Walker, are on display until the end of August. ""Appearing as though naturally scattered by the wind, the leaves symbolise the past and what has transpired.  However, the leaf is also emblematic of the future,"" a spokesperson for the site explained. Walker said he chose a sycamore maple leaf as it symbolised strength, protection, eternity and clarity. ""It looks beautiful in the east end of the cathedral where the light comes pouring in,"" he said. The leaves have been laid out in the Cathedral's Lady Chapel. Individual leaves from the installation will be available to buy, with a proportion of profits going to the cathedral. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mike Ashley's Frasers Group owns Sports Direct, House of Fraser, and several other retail brands Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley is to step down from leading his retail empire and hand the reins to his future son-in-law. The board of Frasers Group, which also owns House of Fraser, said talks were under way for Michael Murray, 31, to succeed the billionaire on 1 May 2022. The move would see Mr Ashley step down as chief executive but remain on the board as an executive director. Mr Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982 and retains 64% of the group. Mr Murray, engaged to be married to Mr Ashley's daughter Anna, is currently ""head of elevation"" at Frasers and is in charge of modernising stores and transforming the business. Chris Wootton, Frasers Group's finance chief said the direction of travel to hand over more power to Mr Murray had been in place for a while. ""Without insulting him, by Mike's own admission he is a bit of a dinosaur. Michael is young, fresh and youthful and knows what the customer wants. Mike is very good at selling socks,""Mr Wootton told The Times.,external Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct? In stock market statement,external, Frasers Group said it was ""currently proposed"" that Mr Murray would assume the role of chief executive, with a ""reward and remuneration package"" now being considered. ""The board consider it appropriate that Michael leads us forward on this increasingly successful elevation journey,"" Fraser's Group said. Michael Murray and Mike Ashley Mr Murray has been working for the group for several years, but his role at the company raised eyebrows after reports about him being paid millions of pounds in consultancy fees. Mr Ashley was previously executive deputy chairman of the retail group - which changed its name from Sports Direct International to Frasers Group two years ago - until 2016, when long-serving chief executive Dave Forsey resigned. Mr Ashley, 56, has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business. He first entered the fitness industry as a squash coach before opening his first high street sports shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in 1982. Through the early 1990s, he expanded to a chain of stores rebranded as Sports Soccer, and had a portfolio of about 100 shops by the turn of the millennium. The noughties saw more rebrands before the business found its current guise of Sports Direct and in 2007, Mr Ashley floated the business as a public company in a move which valued it at Â£2.5bn. Later that year, Mr Ashley became a significantly more recognisable figure when he bought majority control of Newcastle United. However, his tenure has come under criticism from fans over his ownership style and perceived lack of investment. He is currently seeking a sale after the collapse of a Â£300m deal with the Saudi Public Investment Fund. Away from football, he has rapidly grown his retail operation in recent years, snapping up a number of distressed British brands including House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Jack Wills and Game. The group is now worth around Â£3bn and operates almost 1,000 shops. However, there has been controversial moments. In 2016, a parliamentary inquiry accused Mr Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse after a report by the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Select Committee said the company had used ""appalling working practices"" and treated""workers as commodities rather than as human beings"". The group has also come under heavy criticism over its use of zero-hours contracts for workers. London's High Court heard that the businessman once hosted a management meeting in a pubwhere he drank 12 pints and vomited into a fireplace. Mr Ashley apologised in March 2020 after a series of blunders in the way his chain has reacted to the first coronavirus lockdown. The retailer lobbied the government to keep his shops open, arguing they were an ""essential service"", but backed down after a backlash from staff and media. This video can not be played Mike Ashley: 'I fly to work by helicopter' The retail veteran's decision to back away from the chief executive position appeared surprising but retail analysts have said they think it could still be ""business as usual"". Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: ""Perhaps there is a move here to give Michael Murray more limelight and draw more focus to this elevation strategy he has been leading. ""I really think we need to be careful not to look too much at this company through a corporate lens, because it doesn't matter what titles they have, this is Mike Ashley's business and he will have final say."" A graduate from the University of Reading, Mr Murray set up his own property consultancy in 2015. One of his clients was Mike Ashley's Frasers Group. His consultancy firm is tasked with finding and negotiating deals for new Sports Direct and other retail shops across globe, as well as providing advice on the company's existing sites. He was appointed ""head of elevation"" for Frasers Group in January 2019, with his job to modernise the business. One of his main projects was the development of Flannels, which is among Mr Ashley's retail empire. ""I looked at Flannels and thought it could be so much bigger than it was,""Mr Murray said in an interview.,external""Five years ago, it was a sleepy business, so I developed a strategy, Mike signed it off and we started rolling it out. Three years later, we're opening in Oxford Street."" In an interview with the Guardian following the opening of a Flannels flagship store in Leicester, Mr Murray said him and Mr Ashley were ""working like a partnership"". ""I'm thinking about the next 10 to 20 years. He looks after the back end - systems, logistics - I look after customer-facing side and the image of the business,"" he said He is now Ashley's righthand man, and soon to be one of the family, after becoming engaged to Mr Ashley's daughter. Frasers Group revealed the leadership change in its latest full-year trading figures on Thursday, in which it said its revenue fell 8.4% to Â£3.6bn from Â£3.9bn in 2020. Its sports retail revenue also decreased by 10.7% from Â£2.2bn to Â£1.9bn due store closures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said. Pre-tax profits also dived by 94.1% to Â£8.5m for the year to 25 April, compared with Â£143.5m in the previous year. In a statement Mr Ashley said: ""Our stores in the UK have reopened above expectations and our online channel continues to significantly outperform pre-Covid-19 periods. ""None the less, management remains of the view that there is a high risk of future Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, likely to be over this winter and maybe beyond."" This is a real changing of the guard. Mike Ashley is one of the most colourful figures in British retail who started out with a single store in Maidenhead and turned it into a Â£3bn business. Unconventional and brash, he's ruffled plenty of feathers along the way and liked to cock a snook at the City. But he's also a shrewd and canny businessman and in recent years has snapped up a host of big names out of administration. He took on the role of chief executive in 2016, promising to ""fix"" the business after it came under fire for poor working practices at its main distribution centre. Now he clearly feels it's time to hand over the reins to his daughter's fiancÃ©. Mr Murray has won plaudits for how he's transformed a number of stores, including the new flagship Sports Direct store in London's Oxford Street. At the age of 31, Mr Murray is now set to be catapulted into the top job in charge of some 1,000 shops and more than 20,000 employees. He'll certainly bring a younger, more modern, face to this sprawling retail empire but he has some huge trainers to fill as Mike Ashley prepares to step back.

"A firefighter was unfairly dismissed from his union job after speaking at a pro-Brexit rally in Westminster, an employment tribunal has found. Paul Embery was also barred from being a Fire Brigades Union (FBU) official for two years after appearing at the Leave Means Leave rally in March 2019. Norwich Employment Tribunal ruled he was unfairly dismissed after a ""witch hunt"" with a pre-determined outcome. But it found Mr Embery was not dismissed for supporting Brexit itself. The FBU said it was disappointed with the findings and that it was assessing its options. Mr Embery, a prominent left-leaning political activist and writer, was employed by the London Fire Brigade but released to conduct union duties as a full-time regional official in the capital between 2008 and 2019. Over a three-day hearing in February the union argued Mr Embery displayed gross misconduct in his role. This was because, it claimed, he did not exempt FBU officials from criticism during his speech at the rally and went against the union's anti-Brexit policy. Mr Embery called for Brexit to go ahead, without a deal if necessary, during the 29 March event, which was held on the day the UK was due to leave the European Union. The tribunal heard there had been regular disagreements between Mr Embery and FBU General Secretary Matt Wrack over the issue of Brexit. Mr Embery was warned of reprisals and at one point accused of siding with the far right. The conflict appeared to come to a head as Mr Embery planned to attend the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square. Before the rally, the tribunal heard Mr Embery was told by FBU President Ian Murray that he should not attend as a speaker and that to do so could breach the union's policy against Brexit, which passed in 2016. Mr Murray was also said to have suggested it could contravene a statement prohibiting FBU officials from campaigning with political opponents during the referendum campaign. Mr Embery believed Mr Murray was wrong, and that the policy had lapsed once the referendum was held, the tribunal was told. The activist was introduced at the rally as an organiser of Trade Unions Against the European Union and used a speechto describe,externala battle to defend the principle of democracy, after a majority voted to leave the EU in June 2016. Mr Embery said in the speech that the ""message to the leaders of my movement is, if you want to stay relevant, then it's about time you put yourself on the side of the people over the establishment and big business, and you better do that damn quickly"". Other speakers at the rally included Nigel Farage, Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice and then Labour MP Kate Hoey. Nigel Farage and then Labour MP Kate Hoey also appeared at the Leave Means Leave rally Two weeks later, the FBU launched an internal investigation which found Mr Embery had gone against the union's anti-Brexit policy and appeared alongside individuals ""with whom there should be no shared platform"". The investigation found Mr Embery had acted in a way that was ""prejudicial to the interests of the union"" and had failed to make a specific exception for the FBU when, it said, he criticised those in the movement who continued to oppose Brexit. The tribunal heard that, as a result, Mr Embery was removed from office for gross misconduct and was subsequently barred from standing as a union official for two years. In a written judgement, Employment Judge Robin Postle said Mr Embery's removal from office amounted to unfair dismissal under the Employment Rights Act 1996. He said the finding of gross misconduct ""was not a reasonable response that a reasonable employer would or should make on the history of the claimant's campaigning with the open knowledge of the union"". The tribunal agreed with Mr Embery that the 2016 anti-Brexit policy did not apply at the time of the rally in 2019 because the referendum effectively made it irrelevant. It also said that the transcript of Mr Embery's speech showed there was no mention of his role within the FBU. The judgement added: ""Where is the gross misconduct? How could any fair minded member come to a reasonable belief on the facts that the claimant had committed any form of misconduct?"" The judge said it appeared ""right from the start... there was an agenda"" to remove Mr Embery from his FBU role. Part of the union's investigation looked like a ""witch hunt, a fishing exercise"" with its outcome ""pre-determined"", he added. The FBU, which was represented at the tribunal by Oliver Segal QC, had also argued Mr Embery was not an employee of the FBU but was on full-time release from his job as a firefighter to the union as an elected representative. Mr Embery, who represented himself, said that for 11 years between 2008 and 2019, being a full-time union official, working at least 42 hours a week, was the only job he had known. He began his career as a firefighter in London in 1997. The tribunal found Mr Embery ""worked full time for the union in return for substantial remuneration"" of around Â£7,000 on top of his normal firefighter's salary, which the union reimbursed. While the tribunal agreed Mr Embery's pro-Brexit stance was ""well advanced, argued and long held"" and a protected philosophical belief in national independence under the Equality Act 2010, it found it was not the reason for his dismissal. In a statement, Mr Embery described the judgement as ""emphatic"". He said: ""While I am glad that, after two years, justice has finally been served, I take no pleasure in the outcome. It was an honour to serve as an FBU official for 20 years, and I remain to this day a proud member of the union."" An FBU spokesperson said: ""We are disappointed with the findings and we do not agree with the decision. However, we have only recently received it and are still considering the matter.

"Fifteen small boats were intercepted by British vessels on Thursday A further 475 migrants crossed the English Channel in 15 small boats on Thursday, following a record 482 arrivals on Wednesday. The Ministry of Defence earlier said an exercise on its firing range at Hythe had to be stopped on Wednesday when people landed on the beach there. According to Home Office figures, there have now been 10,711 arrivals in more than 440 boats so far in 2021. The Home Office said French authorities stopped 138 people on Thursday. Dan O'Mahoney, clandestine Channel threat commander, said:â¯â¯ ""These dangerous small boat crossings, facilitated by criminal gangs, are putting lives at risk. ""These numbers are unacceptable, that's why we are taking action on all fronts. ""Law enforcement agencies are dismantling the people smuggling gangs. Joint work with the French has seen a doubling of police officers on French beaches."" On Wednesday, 482 people reached the UK in 21 vessels. The previous highest totals of daily arrivals on small boats in recent years were 416 people on 2 September 2020, and430 migrants on 19 July. A group of migrants are brought into Dungeness on Wednesday Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, said: ""Overall asylum applications are dropping and much lower than they were in the 2000s, but the number of high Channel crossings shows that desperate people trying to save their lives will risk everything to reach safety. ""MPs need to act swiftly and should pass legislation to allow those with strong prospects of receiving protection here safe passage to the UK from northern France to seek asylum here."" Despite repeated promises from Home Secretary Priti Patel and her department to make the route across the Channel ""unviable"", crossings have continued to rise. Last month she announced an agreement to more than double the number of police patrolling French beaches, with the government to give France Â£54m. Earlier this week, Ms Patel met with members of the Greek government to discuss ""shared challenges"", during the visit she went on patrol with the Hellenic coastguard to learn about their methods for preventing small boat crossings. A Border Force vessel picked up migrants from one of the boats which crossed on Wednesday Steve Valdez-Symonds, Refugee and Migrant Rights Director at Amnesty International UK, said: ""The reason people are putting themselves in serious danger with these Channel crossings is that there are simply no safe alternatives open to them. ""On a global scale, very few people seek asylum in the UK and politicians need to stop peddling myths and stoking hostility toward often vulnerable people who've experienced persecution and trauma."" Migrants wait at Dungeness In June, Kent County Council said it would not be taking on any moreunaccompanied asylum-seeking childrenwho arrived in small boats as it has reached ""the limit of safe capacity"". Last week, members of the home affairs committee said women with babies and very young children were among 56 migrantsbeing held in a cramped room covered with thin mattressesat a unit in Dover. They said it was ""wholly inappropriate"" and a clear Covid risk, with some migrants held beyond legal limits. The Home Office said it takes the welfare of migrants seriously.

"The prime minister and transport secretary have defended changes to the UK's traffic light travel system, as an airline has scheduled extra flights to return Britons from red-listed Mexico. Up to 6,000 British tourists are currently in the country, and those who want to avoid quarantine will need to return before 04:00 BST on Sunday. The changewas announced on Wednesday. Grant Shapps said a new plan to review restrictions every three weeks will make for a ""simplified system"". Boris Johnson said that the government wanted people to be able to travel but had to balance that desire with the ""need to protect us against new variants"". Asked whether he would book a holiday to Spain, the prime minister said the government was trying to make travel as simple as possible by lengthening the gap between changes to guidance. Transport secretary Mr Shapps said this meant people would be able to travel ""without looking over their shoulders"". The travel list changes apply for passengers returning to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. TheWelsh government said on Thursday evening that it would follow the changes, due to sharing an open border with England, but said it was ""extremely disappointed"" and would continue to advise against non-essential international travel. Countries have their own rules about allowing visitors - so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit. On Thursday 30,215new Covid cases were reported across the UK,external, along with a further 86 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Which countries are now on the green list? Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean Why was France put on the amber-plus list? US plans to require Covid vaccine for foreign travellers The latest widespread changes to Covid travel rules also see fully vaccinated passengers arriving from France no longer needing to quarantine and Spain remaining on the amber list. But theDepartment for Transport has now said,externalthat ""arrivals from Spain and all its islands are advised to use a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever possible"" instead of the cheaper lateral flow tests. Travel agents and operators said they had seen a ""surge"" in bookings - Brittany Ferries and Eurostar having a strong increase for France and other countries reporting increased demand for holidays to Spain, the Greek Islands, and the Canaries. Moving from amber to green:Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway Moving from red to amber:India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE Moving from amber to red:Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte Moving from amber-plus to amber:France Read more on what the colours mean for testing and quarantine,here. On Thursday, Mr Shapps sought to reassure British holidaymakers that the traffic light system would now be reviewed every three weeks - compared with once a week last summer and more recent ad-hoc changes - because of the number of people in the UK and abroad who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I hope people will be able to go away under this simplified system, enjoy their breaks and not be looking over their shoulders the whole time."" Mr Shapps said that between 5,000 and 6,000 British holidaymakers are in Mexico currently and would be ""making arrangements to come home"". From 12 August, the cost of hotel quarantine will increase, with the price for single adult travellers rising from Â£1,750 to Â£2,285 and a second adult paying Â£1,430. The government has said this better reflects the costs involved, including transport, security and PCR tests. Children aged 5-12 will still cost Â£325; it is free for children aged under five. British Airways said its teams had been ""working through the night"" to arrange additional seats out of Mexico and had added four additional flights to London over the next three days, as well as rearranging another flight to land ahead of the deadline. It said customers could re-book their flights from Mexico ""at no additional cost"" ahead of the deadline. Robin and Viv Silverthorne, from Worthing in Sussex, were flying to Cancun, Mexico, yesterday when they found out mid-air that the country was being placed on the red list. Robin says the couple spent hours on the phone trying to speak to their airline ""without success"" before making the decision to come home after just a day to avoid paying for a quarantine hotel. He told the BBC: ""It's not just us, there was a plane full of holidaymakers in the same boat, some with children who will now have to pay thousands to quarantine on return. ""We have only just secured a return flight via Miami tomorrow. We have essentially paid a total of Â£8,000 for a day trip to Mexico."" He says the couple had done their research and just wanted a ""nice holiday"" - but that the latest changes to the rules had left Viv in tears. Also in Mexico are Claudia Rattray and her daughters Ivana and Summer who travelled to Mexico City to visit her family only to find out that the country had been added to the red list when they arrived. ""I decided to enjoy the time here with my family and I am going to see if in three weeks the government reviews this list,"" she said. ""But I think if not I am going to stay here in Mexico because I can't afford to pay for a quarantine hotel."" She added that they were lucky that they were staying with family and so had the option of staying for longer. Asked about the advice on PCR tests for arrivals from Spain, Mr Shapps insisted the government was ""not changing the rules"", as in Spain's case, ""virtually everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test. But in aseries of tweets,externalConservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee, said PCR tests for travel were an ""unnecessary rip-off"" and a ""barrier to affordable travel"". Mr Shapps also said he believes full vaccination will be increasingly important for future travel. ""Most countries, probably all countries, will require full vaccination in order for you to enter"", he said. Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon criticised the government for ""flip-flopping over France"" and reiterated calls for data upon which travel list decisions are made to be published. Grant Shapps told the Today Programme that the government's advice to those returning to the UK from Spain to use a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever possible, was ""not actually a change"". This does not appear to be the case. The existing guidance applying to Spain tells people returning to the UK that they need to take a private test in the three days before travelling. The guidance says that could be a PCR test or a (cheaper) lateral flow test as long as it meets UK requirements. Many travellers order a lateral flow test in the UK and take it with them to use in Spain. The travel operator Tui told Reality Check that more than 90% of its customers buy a package with their holiday that includes that sort of test. Mr Shapps also said that ""virtually everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards for the pre-departure test. But we've spoken to several people who have used lateral flow tests in Spain in recent weeks and had no trouble using them to return to the UK. If you have been in a red list country in the last 10 days, you can only enter the UK ifyou are a UK or Irish national or UK resident, and you must stay at a quarantine hotel on your return. The total number of countries or territorieson the green list,external- from which all travellers can return without having to quarantine - rises from 29 to 36 when the changes come into effect. The UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. The travel industry has welcomed France's addition to the amber list but trade association Abta said the speed at which countries were being added to the green list was at a ""snail's pace"", with the seven added not being traditional holiday destinations. BA boss Sean Doyle said that the UK's travel sector was ""lagging behind Europe"" due to ""more stringent testing requirements"" and a red list ""significantly broader than our European peers"". Industry body Airlines UK has warned ""tens of thousands of jobs are at stake"" as it called for the furlough scheme to be extended. The government acknowledged it was a difficult time for the sector but said it was providing ""an unprecedented package of support"".

"Tory donors are not ""immoral"" and have no influence on government policy, minister Grant Shapps has insisted, amid cash-for-access questions. Last week,the Financial Times reported,externalthose who donated Â£250,000 could get access to the PM and chancellor. Mr Shapps - a former Tory chairman - said the party adhered ""very carefully"" to the rules on donations. Labour are urging the Tories to name the donors and ministers involved in an elite club set up by the party. Profile: Tory money man with A-list connections Top Tory marketing Covid tests prompts questions Labour: Tories must come clean over elite donors What are the rules governing political donations? The ""advisory board"" was developed by Conservative Party co-chair Ben Elliot, who connected major Conservative supporters with ministers - including Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. Conservative donor and businessman Mohamed Amersi told the newspaper it was a ""very elite"" club with people required to ""cough up Â£250,000 per annum or be a friend of Ben"" in order to join. The advisory board gets together occasionally to receive political updates, Tory sources say, and has occasionally met the prime minister and chancellor. It was created under Theresa May's leadership. If you want to join one of the Tory Party's elite donor clubs don't bother checking their website. There's no mention of the advisory board - its existence was recently revealed by the FT. There's no mention of the leader's group either, which previously required a minimum donation of Â£50,000 a year to join. Under David Cameron the Conservatives published some details about which donors attended private dinners with the leader but that practice seems to have stopped. Questions to Conservative Party HQ about how much donors have to pay to join the advisory board, who's on it and when it meets remain unanswered. Raising money to fund political parties is entirely legitimate and necessary - the names of donors and the sums given are published by the Electoral Commission. But this is an issue of transparency and access - and the Conservative Party is proving very reluctant to pull back the curtain. Asked about the group on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Shapps, now the transport secretary, said there were ""a lot of people in this country who believe in this country"" and that there was ""nothing inherently bad or wrong"" about joining a political party. ""It doesn't change any policies but you're certainly welcome to hear about the policies,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the existence of the club was ""the latest example of one rule for them and one rule for everybody else"". The exclusive club was developed by Conservative co-chair Ben Elliot (right) seen here with his aunt the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Charles He urged the Conservatives to ""tell us who has been involved with this, who has been meeting who and how much money has exchanged hands"". ""We can't have this sleaze, this murky cash-for-access,"" he added. Asked if he would scrap Labour's ownRose Network Chair Circle,external, Sir Keir said there was nothing ""wrong"" with party donations but that ""the issue is cash for access"" and ""concerning levels of influence"". Members of the Â£5,000-per-year network get access to invite-only events, including a reception with the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner. Responding to Labour criticism, earlier in the week, Conservative co-chair Amanda Milling said all parties had to raise money in order to pay their staff and campaign in elections and that Labour also sought contributions from wealthy donors. ""If political parties didn't have a fundraising system in place they would be forced to use taxpayers money - this would mean less money for frontline services like schools, police and hospitals,"" she said. Between 2010 and 2020, Labour raised Â£152m in donations - the majority of which came from trade unions - compared with the Â£267m collected by the Conservatives. The Conservatives received a sizeable chunk from companies, whose gifts made up 29% of their donations. In the final three months of 2019 - when the last general election was held - the Conservatives raised more than Â£37.6m, while the Liberal Democrats collected Â£13.3m. During the same period, Labour raised Â£9.8m and the Brexit Party came fourth with Â£7.1m. Labour said two thirds of the donations it received during the 2019 election were under Â£20.

"Mike Ashley's Frasers Group owns Sports Direct, House of Fraser, and several other retail brands Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley is to step down from leading his retail empire and hand the reins to his future son-in-law. The board of Frasers Group, which also owns House of Fraser, said talks were under way for Michael Murray, 31, to succeed the billionaire on 1 May 2022. The move would see Mr Ashley step down as chief executive but remain on the board as an executive director. Mr Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982 and retains 64% of the group. Mr Murray, engaged to be married to Mr Ashley's daughter Anna, is currently ""head of elevation"" at Frasers and is in charge of modernising stores and transforming the business. Chris Wootton, Frasers Group's finance chief said the direction of travel to hand over more power to Mr Murray had been in place for a while. ""Without insulting him, by Mike's own admission he is a bit of a dinosaur. Michael is young, fresh and youthful and knows what the customer wants. Mike is very good at selling socks,""Mr Wootton told The Times.,external Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct? In stock market statement,external, Frasers Group said it was ""currently proposed"" that Mr Murray would assume the role of chief executive, with a ""reward and remuneration package"" now being considered. ""The board consider it appropriate that Michael leads us forward on this increasingly successful elevation journey,"" Fraser's Group said. Michael Murray and Mike Ashley Mr Murray has been working for the group for several years, but his role at the company raised eyebrows after reports about him being paid millions of pounds in consultancy fees. Mr Ashley was previously executive deputy chairman of the retail group - which changed its name from Sports Direct International to Frasers Group two years ago - until 2016, when long-serving chief executive Dave Forsey resigned. Mr Ashley, 56, has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business. He first entered the fitness industry as a squash coach before opening his first high street sports shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in 1982. Through the early 1990s, he expanded to a chain of stores rebranded as Sports Soccer, and had a portfolio of about 100 shops by the turn of the millennium. The noughties saw more rebrands before the business found its current guise of Sports Direct and in 2007, Mr Ashley floated the business as a public company in a move which valued it at Â£2.5bn. Later that year, Mr Ashley became a significantly more recognisable figure when he bought majority control of Newcastle United. However, his tenure has come under criticism from fans over his ownership style and perceived lack of investment. He is currently seeking a sale after the collapse of a Â£300m deal with the Saudi Public Investment Fund. Away from football, he has rapidly grown his retail operation in recent years, snapping up a number of distressed British brands including House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Jack Wills and Game. The group is now worth around Â£3bn and operates almost 1,000 shops. However, there has been controversial moments. In 2016, a parliamentary inquiry accused Mr Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse after a report by the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Select Committee said the company had used ""appalling working practices"" and treated""workers as commodities rather than as human beings"". The group has also come under heavy criticism over its use of zero-hours contracts for workers. London's High Court heard that the businessman once hosted a management meeting in a pubwhere he drank 12 pints and vomited into a fireplace. Mr Ashley apologised in March 2020 after a series of blunders in the way his chain has reacted to the first coronavirus lockdown. The retailer lobbied the government to keep his shops open, arguing they were an ""essential service"", but backed down after a backlash from staff and media. This video can not be played Mike Ashley: 'I fly to work by helicopter' The retail veteran's decision to back away from the chief executive position appeared surprising but retail analysts have said they think it could still be ""business as usual"". Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: ""Perhaps there is a move here to give Michael Murray more limelight and draw more focus to this elevation strategy he has been leading. ""I really think we need to be careful not to look too much at this company through a corporate lens, because it doesn't matter what titles they have, this is Mike Ashley's business and he will have final say."" A graduate from the University of Reading, Mr Murray set up his own property consultancy in 2015. One of his clients was Mike Ashley's Frasers Group. His consultancy firm is tasked with finding and negotiating deals for new Sports Direct and other retail shops across globe, as well as providing advice on the company's existing sites. He was appointed ""head of elevation"" for Frasers Group in January 2019, with his job to modernise the business. One of his main projects was the development of Flannels, which is among Mr Ashley's retail empire. ""I looked at Flannels and thought it could be so much bigger than it was,""Mr Murray said in an interview.,external""Five years ago, it was a sleepy business, so I developed a strategy, Mike signed it off and we started rolling it out. Three years later, we're opening in Oxford Street."" In an interview with the Guardian following the opening of a Flannels flagship store in Leicester, Mr Murray said him and Mr Ashley were ""working like a partnership"". ""I'm thinking about the next 10 to 20 years. He looks after the back end - systems, logistics - I look after customer-facing side and the image of the business,"" he said He is now Ashley's righthand man, and soon to be one of the family, after becoming engaged to Mr Ashley's daughter. Frasers Group revealed the leadership change in its latest full-year trading figures on Thursday, in which it said its revenue fell 8.4% to Â£3.6bn from Â£3.9bn in 2020. Its sports retail revenue also decreased by 10.7% from Â£2.2bn to Â£1.9bn due store closures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said. Pre-tax profits also dived by 94.1% to Â£8.5m for the year to 25 April, compared with Â£143.5m in the previous year. In a statement Mr Ashley said: ""Our stores in the UK have reopened above expectations and our online channel continues to significantly outperform pre-Covid-19 periods. ""None the less, management remains of the view that there is a high risk of future Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, likely to be over this winter and maybe beyond."" This is a real changing of the guard. Mike Ashley is one of the most colourful figures in British retail who started out with a single store in Maidenhead and turned it into a Â£3bn business. Unconventional and brash, he's ruffled plenty of feathers along the way and liked to cock a snook at the City. But he's also a shrewd and canny businessman and in recent years has snapped up a host of big names out of administration. He took on the role of chief executive in 2016, promising to ""fix"" the business after it came under fire for poor working practices at its main distribution centre. Now he clearly feels it's time to hand over the reins to his daughter's fiancÃ©. Mr Murray has won plaudits for how he's transformed a number of stores, including the new flagship Sports Direct store in London's Oxford Street. At the age of 31, Mr Murray is now set to be catapulted into the top job in charge of some 1,000 shops and more than 20,000 employees. He'll certainly bring a younger, more modern, face to this sprawling retail empire but he has some huge trainers to fill as Mike Ashley prepares to step back.

"Australia beat England in Brisbane to win the 2017 men's Rugby League World Cup This year's Rugby League World Cup in England has been postponed until 2022 after the withdrawal of champions Australia, and New Zealand. The two countries pulled out of the tournamentciting ""player welfare and safety concerns"" related to Covid-19. The World Cup, featuring men's, women's and wheelchair events, was set to start in Newcastle on 23 October. ""It became unfeasible and irresponsible for us to carry on,"" said Jon Dutton, chief executive of the tournament. ""I think it will take some time for international rugby league to recover from this. I hope we can be a beacon of light. ""Certainly we've prioritised player voice and player choice, we know the players want to play, we took our responsibilities very seriously, and we are determined to stage the biggest and best ever rugby league World Cup. ""It's a real shame that it cannot be this year but leadership is about making tough decisions, it's about being responsible, and we've done this in the best interests of not just the tournament but of the sport of rugby league."" Listen: BBC Radio 5 Live Rugby League Podcast Australia and NZ World Cup withdrawal 'premature' Super League Show - watch and catch-up here Organisers were given only four minutes' notice that the antipodean neighbours intended to pull out on 22 July, with Rugby Football League (RFL) chairman Simon Johnson calling it a ""selfish, parochial and cowardly decision"". Dutton last week gave ita ""50-50"" chance of going ahead as scheduled this yearafter discussions with the board and numerous stakeholders, including players. ""There's been some really disappointing behaviour,"" added Dutton when asked about whether Australia, New Zealand and the NRL had called the shots. ""We can't end up in this position again and we'll make sure we don't."" Delaying the World Cup by a year could mean it clashes with the football equivalent in 2022, but Dutton said a window will be found to avoid such a scenario. ""I am disappointed that we've needed to take the decision to delay the Rugby League World Cup,"" said Sport Minister Nigel Huddleston. ""Despite working tirelessly to explore solutions that would allow us to go ahead as planned, circumstances beyond our control have meant that postponing the Rugby League World Cup until next year is the strongest option for staging a successful tournament."" The Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) said it acknowledged ""the extremely difficult decision"" to delay the World Cup and the ""tremendous effort of the RLWC board, Jon Dutton, and the entire team to maintain the tournament's viability up to this point"". ""We have worked exceptionally close with the RLWC team to date and want to thank them for engaging in such a collaborative process which has allowed the players to feel respected and valued throughout the RLWC planning,"" said RLPA chief executive officer Clint Newton. Fresh Covid outbreaks in Australia have forced most states to reimpose restrictions, while the majority of coronavirus restrictions in England have been lifted despite a rise in cases -although those numbers appear to be falling. There were concerns about players and staff having to quarantine for 14 days on their return to Australia, with the country's borders currently closed because of the pandemic. Rugby league officials estimate about 400-500 players, staff and team officials from Australia's National Rugby League - representing several different countries - would be impacted by any quarantine measures on their return to the country after the tournament. Those measures would mean players would only return to their NRL clubs two weeks before trial games for the 2022 season begin. The number of those who would be affected is significantly higher when the women's and wheelchair events are taken into consideration. Outbreaks emerge across Australia in 'new phase' of pandemic The postponement will be a major blow to English rugby league, a sport that has been hit hard by the financial fallout of the pandemic. The UK government has provided rugby league with more than Â£32m in loan support in the past year. Australia, as 11-time and defending men's champions, were favourites to win the tournament in England, while 2008 winners New Zealand were again poised to be contenders. The event,regarded as one of the most inclusive sports events ever hosted in Britain,was to be staged across 16 towns and cities across England. St James' Park, home of Premier League football side Newcastle United, was scheduled to host the opening game between England and Samoa. Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium was to host the men's and women's finals in a back-to-back spectacle on 27 November. BBC rugby league correspondent Dave Woods Australia's NRL clubs have got their way. The postponement seemed inevitable once they decided, through the voice piece of the Australian Rugby League Commission, that they didn't want to allow their players to compete in a World Cup in England this year. Covid is only the broad issue. The risk of players being exposed to the virus in this country is a valid concern, despite the RLWC2021 organisers bending over backwards to ensure that protocols would have been in place to keep the tournament as safe as possible. But at the heart of this is that those NRL clubs have only self-interest. They want to protect their own domestic competition going into the 2022 season, rather than seeing the bigger picture of what a World Cup could do for the international profile of the game. It's to be hoped they will prove honourable when they say they will support a rearranged Rugby League World Cup. With the number of Covid cases in Australia not yet reaching the numbers seen in other countries, and with their vaccine roll out programme a long way behind schedule, it's hard to gauge how badly the pandemic will hit that country in 2022. And indeed, whether a dramatic spike in cases over the next few months will again lessen their appetite to send players abroad. In the meantime, some more incredibly hard work begins for the Rugby League World Cup organisers. Stadiums will have to be rebooked. Cities and towns where the Men's, Women's and Wheelchair teams were going to be based will have to be re-primed in readiness for the delayed event. Broadcasters will have to reschedule. This year's tournament had been over four years in the planning up to this point. Now they have to do a lot of the work again, but this time with less than 14 months to go. Finances will be stretched because budgets were only due to run up to the end of November of this year and the government will be called upon to add to the Â£25m that it's already invested into the tournament. But in the circumstances of the last few weeks, and the stance of the NRL clubs, Jon Dutton, the RLWC2021 chief executive and his board of directors, had little option but to call a halt to their desperate hard work to get the tournament on as planned.

"France is moving to the amber list under widespread changes to travel rules in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland It means that from 04:00 BST on Sunday, fully vaccinated passengers coming back from the country will no longer need to quarantine Germany, Austria and Norway are among seven nations added to the green list Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates move to the amber list - and Spain is staying there Up to 6,000 British holidaymakers are trying to get home from Mexico, which is among four countries to move to red British Airways boss Sean Doyle says the UK is ""lagging behind Europe"" with stricter testing requirements and a bigger red list Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, says he is disappointed but the news provides ""some reassurance"" to customers 189,232 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to 28 July - down 39% on the previous week One in five people in hospital in England with Covid is aged between 18 and 34, the new NHS England boss has said Edited by Hazel Shearing and James Clarke That's all for today. We'll be back again in the morning with more Covid updates from the UK and around the world. Your writers today were Joshua Cheetham, Jo Couzens and Victoria Lindrea. The editors were Hazel Shearing and James Clarke. See you tomorrow. Thanks for joining us today - here is a summary of the main headlines at the close of the day. Reality Check Grant
Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the governmentâs advice to those returning
to the UK from Spain to âuse a PCR test as their pre-departure test wherever
possibleâ was ânot actually a changeâ. This
does not appear to be the case. The
existing guidance applying to Spain tells people returning to the UK they
need to take a private test in the three days before travelling. The
guidance says that could be a PCR test or a (cheaper) lateral flow test as long
as it meets UK requirements. Many
travellers order a lateral flow test in the UK and take it with them to use in
Spain. The travel operator Tui has told Reality Check more than 90% of its
customers buy a package with their holiday that includes that sort of test. Shapps also said ""virtually
everyone is taking a PCR"" to meet the government's performance standards
for the pre-departure test. But
weâve spoken to several people who have used lateral flow tests in Spain in
recent weeks and had no trouble using them to return to the UK.  The Welsh government has criticised the ""ad-hoc nature"" of the UK government's travel decisions following the latest changes that will see more destinations added to the green and amber lists. It says it will consider whether to follow the latest changes, adding: ""We continue to advise against all but essential travel abroad because of the continuing risk of infection."" The UK government sets the red, amber and green lists for England, while the other nations are in charge of their own lists. Scotland and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will be adopting the same changes as England. Transport secretary Grant Shapps earlierdefended changes to England's traffic light travel system, after it was announced Mexico would move to the red list. Mexico, Georgia, La Reunion and Mayotte are now considered high-risk destinations and will move to the red list from Sunday, following the most recent shake-up of travel rules by the UK government. Holidaymakers need to return from these countries by the Sunday deadline  or face paying to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. Simultaneously the government has announced the cost of hotel quarantine will increase from 12 August, with the price for single adult travellers rising from Â£1,750 to Â£2,285 and a second adult paying Â£1,430. The government has said this better reflects the costs involved, including transport, security and PCR tests. For children aged 5-12 it will still cost Â£325; it is free for children aged under five. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the hotel quarantine system has been designed to ""pay for itself"" and should not be at the cost of taxpayers, who, he says, have paid about Â£75m towards the programme. He stresses people should not be travelling to red list countries and they are ""off the reservation as far as travel is concerned"". But between 5,000 and 6,000 British holidaymakers are in Mexico currently. British Airways says its teams have been ""working through the night to arrange as many additional seats out of Mexico as possible to help get Britons home"" before the destination joins the red list. It adds customers can re-book their flights from Mexico ""at no additional cost"" ahead of the deadline. Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent What tests are required before travelling to Mallorca and on return for fully vaccinated people in the UK? If you're fully vaccinated heading out, you wonât need any
tests. You will need to fill in a health declaration form, which you
can find on theBalearic islands tourist authority website,external. If you were not vaccinated, you would have to take a PCR test
â one of the laboratory tests â before leaving the UK. On return from a country on the amber list, which the
Balearic islands are, if youâre fully vaccinated you can come into the UK
without having to quarantine. If you are not fully vaccinated, you will need to isolate for
10 days. Fully vaccinated passengers will have to undergo a PCR test
within two days of arriving. Why a PCR test and not the cheaper lateral flow? Itâs
so that if the government does detect cases coming into the UK, it can analyse
the genome of the Covid variant and therefore know which variants are being
brought into the country. Youâll also have to fill out a passenger locator form on
your return. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Large-scale events and exhibitions are being cancelled or
postponed in Chinaâs capital, Beijing, as cases of the coronavirus continue to
grow in the country. The Beijing government has today stressed events taking place
in Augustshould be cancelled,external, and public places such as parks, cinemas and
libraries should now start limiting the number of visitors they have. The Beijing International Film Festival was set to go ahead on 14
August, but has now confirmed the event has been postponed. A new date
has not yet been set. A number of universities in the capital, including the prestigious
Tsinghua University, have also announced they are delaying the start of their
new terms. Part of the city is in lockdown,external, and many inbound transport links
have been suspended Two weeks ago, cases of Covid-19 were detected at an international
airport in the eastern city of Nanjing. Cases of the virus have now been detected in 17 of Chinaâs
provincial-level regions. Many cases are the Delta variant, and so earlier this
week, the central government urged against non-essential travel. Asked about current travel rules, Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, has said his big concern is ""the sheer cost of testing - and the very fact that the reason for the testing, being sequencing, is not actually being carried out in full"". Merriman suggests just 5% of tests are being used for sequencing - blaming the spike in domestic cases. He says the cost of PCR tests - which is often two or three times the cost of a lateral flow test - is ""pricing out holidays for those that don't have the means to pay for those tests"". ""If only 5% of PCR tests are being sequenced, then surely it's a complete waste of money."" He says he supports the traffic light system, providing it remains straightforward: ""I think we just need to keep it to red, amber, green and nothing else in between.""   Thelatest
figures,externalshow deaths have increased by 14.4% per 100,000 people from the previous week (23
to 29 July), with 571 recorded in the past seven days, a rise of 72. Cases have fallen 10.4%
per 100,000 people from the previous week, with 183,406 recorded between 30 July
and 5 August, a fall of 21,263. Another 33,334 people in the UK have had a first dose of a coronavirus
vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 88.7% of the adult population
has now had at least one jab. And a further 165,669 have had a second vaccine dose now. As of today, 73.5% of the adult population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 30,215 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 86 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Reality Check India
has been taken off the UKâs travel âred listâ and some people are asking why
Pakistan hasnât. The
UKâscriteria,externalfor putting countries on the list includes: In
the past month, Pakistanâs positivity rate has been rising and currently stands
at about 9%  - attributed to the Delta variant. But
Indiaâs positivity rate has remained below the World Health Organizationâs
(WHO) recommended 5% since June. However, it should be noted that comparing countries does depend on
the quality of testing. Pakistan
has increased daily testing capacity since July but it hasnât reached the
levels seen in April during the third wave. Although
it does have genome sequencing capabilities, sequencing rates are low. Pakistan
has sequenced just 0.044% of total reported cases and India 0.126%, according
toa monitoring
database,external. The UK has sequenced 10.7%. Of
the thousands of travellers from India and Pakistan who weretested
by the NHS in July,external, less than 1% were positive from both countries. The
numbers of samples collected and tests sequenced have recently decreased. Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. Here's a look at therules around isolating- for the fully vaccinated and those who have not received a jab - and what to do if alerted by the NHS Covid app. Ofcom sayslockdowns were the key drivers behind an increase in screen timein 2020. UK adults spent nearly a third of their waking hours watching TV and online video content over the year. Daily screen time averaged five hours and 40 minutes - up 47 minutes on the previous year. And, for the first time, more households had a Netflix subscription than a paid TV account such as cable or satellite. By the third quarter of 2020, 60% of all UK households were spending time on services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video - up from 49% a year earlier. ""The pandemic undoubtedly turbo-charged viewing to streaming services, with three in five UK homes now signed up,"" said Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom's group director of research. YouTube remained the most popular user-generated online video service, but Chinese-owned video app TikTok was gaining in popularity - and used by 31% of adult internet users by March 2021.

Eurostar, which runs the high-speed rail service between the UK and France, has welcomed the removal of quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers returning from France to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland from Sunday. ""Overnight we have seen a strong increase in bookings on our London-Paris route and traffic to our website has more than doubled,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are looking forward to welcoming more passengers on board as early as this weekend, and we are ready to further increase capacity over the coming weeks to carry many more passengers between the UK and the continent during the August holiday season.â The number of procedures being carried out in Northern Ireland's hospital theatres has fallen by 46%, according to the latest official figures. There were 59,762 procedures across all of the health trusts in 2020/21 compared with 110,605 the previous year. The decrease highlights the massive reduction in work being carried out across the system during the pandemic. Find out morehere. Covid-19 case rates in all regions of England are continuing to fall, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England (PHE). Yorkshire and the Humber has the highest rate, with 354.7 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 1 August - down from 422.5 week-on-week. South-east England has the lowest rate of 229.5, down from 289.6. In terms of age, the highest rate was among those aged between 20 and 29, followed by those aged between 10 and 19. And PHE says England's Covid-19 vaccine rollout is estimated to have directly averted more than 66,900 hospital admissions. Previous estimates put the number of admissions at more than 52,600. Turnaround times for coronavirus swab tests have improved, the latest figures for England from NHS Test and Trace show. In the week up to 28 July, 89% of tests taken in person - for example, at mobile testing units, drive-throughs and walk-in centres - reported back within 24 hours, compared to around 64% the week before. For home tests during this period, the wait decreased from 46 hours to 33 hours. The turnaround for tests in care homes and at NHS trusts decreased from 52 hours to 35 hours. Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Travel Association, says ""a simpler [international travel] system is definitely what is required to avoid confusion in the case of consumers"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, he said it would also provide some form of certainty for people who are wanting to travel - and in some cases ""absolutely need to travel"". Walsh also said the market for PCR tests was ""in many cases unregulated"", with tests being advertised online for Â£20 but actually costing Â£150. A Covid test is needed three days before returning from an amber country, anda PCR test two days after arriving.Those arriving from Spain are being asked to use a PCR test for the first of those two tests. ""This expensive and unnecessary testing I think needs to be challenged and I think the government should demonstrate why they require it,"" Walsh said. ""I think there is a valid reason and a concern, and I would accept that maybe for some of these high-risk countries that have been identified you can make the argument that some form of testing should be done."" But, referring to the number of PCR tests he said had been taken by travellers since 25 February, he added: ""I don't think you can justify requiring 2.2 million people to undertake PCR tests when only 8,000 of those are subsequently sequenced."" A resident in Karachi, Pakistan, receives a dose of coronavirus vaccine Two Labour MPs are demanding an explanation from the UK transport secretary as to why Pakistan
has been ""punished"" and kept on the red list. Yasmin Qureshi and Naz Shahhave bothwritten to Grant Shapps,externalasking why the country,externalis still on the red list, when neighbouring India - which has higher
Covid rates - has been moved to the amber list. The pair said the government was ""playing politics"" with the travel alert system, claiming it was only
opening up the UK to nations ""it stands to benefit from
economically"". Figures cited by both MPs suggest the seven-day Covid rate
in India is 20 per 100,000 people, compared with 14 per 100,000 people in
Pakistan. Qureshi, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Pakistan, added the ""raw amount of cases"" in Pakistan is
""five times lower"" than the UK. Shapps said factors for moving countries from the
red list include the number of people there who had received a vaccine, the reliability of
local Covid data, and the level of prevalence of the virus. A coronavirus pandemicmemorial featuring a carpet of 5,000 steel leaveshas been laid out on the floor of Worcester Cathedral. The Leaves of the Trees, by artist Peter Walker, are on display until the end of August. ""Appearing as though naturally scattered by the wind, the leaves symbolise the past and what has transpired.  However, the leaf is also emblematic of the future,"" a spokesperson for the site explained. Walker said he chose a sycamore maple leaf as it symbolised strength, protection, eternity and clarity. ""It looks beautiful in the east end of the cathedral where the light comes pouring in,"" he said. The leaves have been laid out in the Cathedral's Lady Chapel. Individual leaves from the installation will be available to buy, with a proportion of profits going to the cathedral. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A sprawling network of more than 350 fake social media profiles is pushing pro-China narratives and attempting to discredit those seen as opponents of China's government, according to a new study. The aim is to delegitimise the West and boost China's influence and image overseas, the report by the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) suggests. The study,external, shared with the BBC, found that the network of fake profiles circulated garish cartoons depicting, among others, exiled Chinese tycoon Guo Wengui, an outspoken critic of China. Other controversial figures featured in the cartoons included ""whistleblower"" scientist Li-Meng Yan, and Steve Bannon, former political strategist for Donald Trump. Each of these individuals has themselves been accused of spreading disinformation, including false information about Covid-19. The cartoons shared seek to ridicule (left-right) Bannon, Li-Meng Yan and Guo Wengui Some of the accounts - spread across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube - use fake AI-generated profile pictures, while others appear to have been hijacked after previously posting in other languages. There is no concrete evidence that the network is linked to the Chinese government, but according to the CIR, a non-profit group which works to counter disinformation, it resembles pro-China networks previously taken down by Twitter and Facebook. These networks amplified pro-China narratives similar to those promoted by Chinese state representatives and state media. Much of the content shared by the network focuses on the US, and in particular on divisive issues like gun laws and race politics. One of the narratives pushed by the network paints the US as having a poor human rights record. Posts from the fake accounts cite the murder of George Floyd among examples, as well as discrimination against Asians. This account has since been suspended by Twitter for violating its rules Some accounts repeatedly deny human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, where experts say China has detained at least a million Muslims against their will, calling the allegations ""lies fabricated by the United States and the West"". ""The aim of the network appears to be to delegitimise the West by amplifying pro-Chinese narratives,"" said Benjamin Strick, the author of the CIR report. There are strong similarities between this network and the so-called ""Spamouflage Dragon,external"" propaganda network identified by social analytics firm Graphika. Commenting on the new study Ira Hubert, a senior investigative analyst at Graphika, said: ""The report shows that on US platforms, there was no 'honeymoon' in the first months of the Biden administration. ""The network put out a steady mix of anti-US content, for example cheering US 'defeat' ahead of its withdrawal from Afghanistan and painting the US as a poor ally whose aid to India was inadequate during some of its worst months battling Covid."" The CIR mapped hashtags favoured by previously identified networks, unearthing more accounts that showed signs of being part of an influence operation. Tell-tale signs included high levels of activity pushing propaganda narratives and repeated use of the same hashtags. Newly created accounts, accounts with usernames that appeared to be randomly generated, and accounts with very few followers also raised red flags. The foreigners in China's disinformation drive Inside the pro-China network targeting the US, Hong Kong and an exiled tycoon Going undercover to infiltrate Chinese-American far-right networks Some profiles were created to post original content, while others only shared, liked and commented on those original posts, to help them reach a wider audience. This kind of activity is often referred to as ""astroturfing"" because it is designed to create the appearance of a grass-roots campaign. The study visualises how different accounts amplify each other - each small node represents a Twitter account Many of the fake profiles used AI generated photos - a relatively new phenomenon that allows computers to create realistic looking images of people who don't exist. Unlike stolen profile images of real people, the AI generated images, which are created by a type of machine learning framework called StyleGAN, cannot be traced using a reverse image search. The use of fake profile pictures in disinformation campaigns is becoming more common as users and platforms become more wary of suspicious accounts. The CIR used various techniques to identify fake profile pictures in the network. The synthetic images always put the eyes in the same location, so lining them all up can help identify a collection of fake profile pictures. Normally, a random collection of profile pictures would display much more variety in the cropping and the alignment of the eyes. The network uses images of people who do not exist Other signs include blurred edges around the hair, teeth at strange angles, and blurred objects around the face. Many of the Facebook accounts believed to be part of the network appeared to have Turkish names. These accounts may once have belonged to real people but were later hijacked or sold and given new profile pictures. Hijacked accounts also spread the network's pro-China narratives on YouTube. Accounts that had previously posted in English or German and then lain dormant for years suddenly started posting Chinese language content from official Chinese state broadcasters. The report found spam Tweets using the same text, tags and images all uploaded on the same day The CIR shared its research with the social media platforms involved. Facebook has removed the accounts on its platform highlighted in the study. A Facebook spokesman said: ""In September 2019, we removed a network of spam activity that posted lifestyle and political clickbait, primarily in Chinese. This network had almost no engagement on our platform, and we continue to work with researchers and our industry peers to detect and block their attempts to come back, like those accounts mentioned in this report."" YouTube also terminated accounts in the network for violating YouTube's community guidelines. Twitter said it had also now removed almost all of the accounts identified by CIR, as well as a number of others engaged in similar behaviour. It said its investigations are still ongoing. ""When we identify information operation campaigns that we can reliably attribute to state-linked activity - either domestic or foreign-led - we disclose them to ourpublic archive,external."" Over the past decade, billions of dollars have gone into funding the growth of China's presence on international platforms. But with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube blocked in the mainland, and only accessible via a VPN, the country has struggled to get such platforms recognised as viable competitors to Western juggernauts. It has needed not only Chinese voices, but foreign voices, to show that the country has ""arrived"". ""Wolf warrior diplomacy"" has emerged, with officials using Twitter accounts to fly the flag for Communist Party rhetoric. China wants to portray itself as a friend to the world - and not a repressive, authoritarian state, as it perceives Western nations make it out to be. With more than one billion internet users, China certainly has the capability to orchestrate large-scale social media campaigns, and target what it sees as anti-China voices with a wealth of opposing opinions. But with English-language skills limited in China, there are often clumsy tell-tale signs that a Chinese troll is behind such accounts. Many rely on automatic translation software to turn Chinese messages into English, meaning such messages are riddled with typos, or contain clumsy grammatical structures. And with many Western outlets inaccessible to them within China, users generally have very little knowledge of who they are meant to be targeting, so they simply piggyback off the replies of others from within the same network.

"Pret, McColls and Welcome Break are among almost 200 firms ""named and shamed"" by the government for not paying workers the minimum wage. In total, 191 companies investigated between 2011 and 2018 failed to pay Â£2.1m,externalto more than 34,000 workers. The businesses were made to pay back the money as well as being fined Â£3.2m. Pret, McColls and Welcome Break said the underpayments were historic errors and staff had been swiftly reimbursed. Nearly half of the breaches involved firms deducting pay from wages, for things like uniforms and expenses. Others failed to pay for all the time staff worked or paid the incorrect apprenticeship rate. Other organisations named by the government included Sheffield United and four other football clubs, as well as the Body Shop chain, Worcestershire Cricket Club and Enterprise Rent A Car. Retail giant John Lewis was also named over an underpayment reported four years ago. The National Living Wage, as it is now known, is currently Â£8.91 an hour for workers over the age of 23. What is the minimum wage? The government acknowledged that many of the breaches were not intentional, but said the minimum wage laws were meant to ensure that a fair day's work received a fair day's pay. ""It is unacceptable for any company to come up short. All employers, including those on this list, need to pay workers properly,"" said business minister Paul Scully. ""This government will continue to protect workers' rights vigilantly, and employers that short-change workers won't get off lightly,"" he added. Low Pay Commission chairman Bryan Sanderson said: ""These are very difficult times for all workers, particularly those on low pay who are often undertaking critical tasks in a variety of key sectors including care. ""The minimum wage provides a crucial level of support and compliance is essential for the benefit of both the recipients and our society as a whole."" Pret a Manger said the underpayment refers to a 2019 case that affected 33 employees, and that it had since made the required payments to staff and HMRC. The team members had opted to use some of their salary in exchange for childcare vouchers. Those deductions reduced the National Minimum Wage eligible pay, a spokesperson said, adding that the government has since changed those rules. A Welcome Break spokesperson said: ""In 2018, HRMC informed us, along with many other businesses, that our policy on team member uniforms inadvertently led to a breach of the National Minimum Wage. ""As soon as we were made aware of this oversight, we fully reimbursed and apologised to all affected team members. ""We never intended to underpay our employees and have strengthened our policies and training to prevent this from happening again."" A spokesperson for Enterprise Holdings said during an audit in 2017 HMRC noticed that we had mistakenly underpaid two apprentices over a two-year period. Further investigation by the firm showed that 62 employees had also fallen below the minimum wage between 2012 and 2018, and they were reimbursed. ""Although these historic underpayments represent less than 1% of Enterprise's employees during the period, it is something that we take very seriously,"" a spokesperson said. McColl's said the problem related to staff attendance recording processes and it had reimbursed those affected. Minimum wage rises for two million workers In all, 2,300 employers have been named since the current scheme was introduced in 2014. Trades Union Congress head of economics Kate Bell said these cases ""are likely to be just the tip of an underpayment iceberg"". ""Minimum wage workers have been at the heart of the pandemic, and deserve a decent wage of at least Â£10 an hour. ""But these figures show many workers aren't even being paid the legal minimum, with household name employers flouting their responsibility to properly pay staff. ""Government should step up inspections to catch every employer that underpays staff."" She added that workers who suspected they were being underpaid should discuss that with their union rep.
