"This video can not be played PM speaks out against anti-vax ""mumbo jumbo"" Boris Johnson has accused anti-vaccine campaigners of speaking ""mumbo jumbo"" when it comes to coronavirus jabs. The prime minister said those spreading false information on social media were ""totally wrong"" and it was time for him ""to call them out"". Some European countries are making vaccination mandatory, but Mr Johnson stressed it was important for the UK to maintain its voluntary approach. In the UK, 90% of over-12s have now had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. And nearly 83% have had a second dose, while 60% have had their booster or third primary dose. Thursday'scoronavirus figures,externalshowed 179,756 new cases had been reported in the UK and 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Who is targeting teens with false claims? How Covid misinformation spreads The fertility myths that won't go away Mr Johnson, who was speaking while on a visit to a vaccination centre in Northampton, said: ""I want to say to the anti-vax campaigners, the people who are putting this mumbo jumbo on social media: they are completely wrong. ""You haven't heard me say that before, because I think it's important we have a voluntary approach in this country and we're going to keep a voluntary approach."" Mr Johnson said some other European nations were going for ""coercion"". Italy is the latest country to make vaccination compulsory for some, with all over-50s now being told to have a jab. Austria wasthe first to make it a legal requirement. The prime minister said: ""What a tragedy that we've got all this pressure on the NHS, all the difficulties that our doctors and nurses are experiencing, and we've got people out there spouting complete nonsense about vaccination. ""They are totally wrong, and I think it's time that I, the government, call them out on what they're doing. It's absolutely wrong, it's totally counterproductive, and the stuff they're putting out on social media is complete mumbo jumbo."" He said some 30-40% of the 17,000 patients in hospital with Covid ""haven't actually been vaccinated at all"". This is ""increasingly true"" of those in intensive care, added Mr Johnson, as the ""overwhelming majority of them have not been boosted"". People should ""behave sensibly"" as well as recognising ""the vital importance of vaccination"", he added. The vast majority of adults in the UK have had Covid-19 vaccines - but that hasn't stopped anti-vaccine activists from continuing their crusade against jabs. Their tactics change and evolve according to social media policies and what's in the news. They generally promote unfounded claims about the jabs relating to emotive topics. Some brandish scientific titles in a bid to play on trust in experts. The reasons behind vaccine hesitancy vary. Some can't get a jab because of medical reasons. Others are on the fence, or don't see the personal benefit. It's only a tiny minority of the unjabbed who are ardent anti-vaxxers. But that group is extremely active on social media, sharing posts and videos thatexploit doubt and fearin order to advance their agenda. A select few do it for money or clicks, but others are simplytrue believers being pulled deeper into an online movement. In recent months, it's become clear that anti-vax activists are losing their battle. Some aretrying to create their own small communities. But a few are turning to increasingly aggressive tactics - threatening doctors, journalists and politicians online and even turning up to their houses. Mr Johnson said while Omicron is milder than previous variants, ""the pressures on hospitals are clear"". The number of hospital trusts in England tobe in critical incident statusamid staffing shortages and rising numbers of coronavirus cases is currently thought to be 17. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services like emergency care. But the prime minister said it was not true that the NHS does not have enough staff to cope with the increasing pressure - with staff numbers increasing, retired staff being called back and volunteers being used. Mr Johnson said the UK vaccination programme would continue to be voluntary ""What we've got to do is give the NHS all the help we can through the next period, with all the simplifications of systems, moving staff from one hospital to another, all the ways we can back staff up, but also make sure that the people who are likely to get ill get vaccinated first,"" he said. ""The saddest words in the English language are 'too late'. When you're in ICU and you haven't been vaccinated, sadly it's too late to get vaccinated, so get boosted now."" How can I get my booster jab? What are the self-isolation rules now? What tests do I need to go on holiday? Asked about Australia's detention of men's tennis world number one Novak Djokovic, amid a row over his vaccination status, Mr Johnson said he shares the view that it is a ""very good idea to get vaccinated"". But he said the decision to detain the tennis player was a ""matter for Australia"". Figures released by NHS England on Thursday suggest fewer than half of all adults in some of England's biggest cities have had a booster or third dose of a Covid vaccine. In Nottingham, the take-up of the extra jab among over-18s is estimated to be 42.8%, while it is 45.7% in Manchester, 49.9% in Birmingham and 49.1% in Liverpool. The figures, for vaccinations given up to 2 January, suggest Newham in London has the lowest rate of take-up for boosters and third doses out of all English local authorities, with 38.5% of all adults having had the extra jab. The Gloucestershire Cotswolds area is estimated to have the highest rate, at 83%.

"Investors want four of the biggest coronavirus vaccine manufacturers to make access fairer A large coalition of investment firms want the bosses of coronavirus vaccine makers to have their bonuses withheld if they fail to improve product distribution. This could guarantee a ""more equitable"" global circulation of the vaccine, said Rogier Krens chief investment officer of Achmea Investment Management. Drug makers said they are making sure lower income countries have access. Over nine billion doses have been administered worldwide. Why most of Africa has missed global vaccine target WHO: New Covid-19 variants will emerge unless more are vaccinated Hundreds of unions issue vaccine supply chain plea Mr Krens said that the group of 65 companies, which collectively control almost $3.5tn (Â£2.59tn) in assets, believes that vaccines are ""not distributed fairly at the moment"". Overall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with nearly three billion and 1.5 billion respectively. The US is third, with more than 500 million. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine. So far the scheme has distributed more than 900 million vaccines. ""What we're asking the companies to do is to tie their remuneration policy and strategy to a more equitable distribution of the vaccine,"" Mr Krens explained. If they don't commit to a fairer distribution, he said the groups first step will be to vote against any remuneration proposals that don't take this into consideration. Asked if that means trying to withhold bonuses if the concerns aren't addressed, Mr Krens, replied ""effectively yes"". Executive pay at vaccine makers should be linked to distribution, says Rogier Krens of Achmea Investment Management Figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, show that many of the countries with the lowest vaccination rates are lower income African nations such as Burundi, DR Congo and Chad. Meanwhile, those at the top of the list are wealthier countries such as the UAE, Portugal and Brunei. Last weekthe head of the World Health Organisation reiterated the importance of vaccines in ending the pandemic. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu warned against ""narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding"", and added that if ""we end inequity, we end the pandemic"". Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. Source: Our World in Data Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST A fairer distribution of vaccines makes sense from both a humanitarian and financial perspective, according to Mr Krens. ""We definitely feel it's our responsibility to invest in companies that act in a socially responsible way,"" he said. When it comes to the money that the group manages for pension funds and other clients Mr Krens explained that a continuation of the pandemic as it's going now, would be a ""threat"" to the economy and eventually, a threat to their investment returns. The massive gap in vaccination rates between advanced economies and poorer nations could cost the global economy $5.3tn over five yearsaccording to the International Monetary Fund,external. Many people are keen to get coronavirus vaccines, such as these who are queuing up in Malta The group of investors have voiced their concerns in a letter to the boards of Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. In their statement, they highlight theWorld Health Organisation's roadmap,externalwhich calls for 70% of the population of every country to be vaccinated by the middle of this year. This video can not be played What went wrong with vaccinating the world? Three experts explain The roadmap calls on vaccine manufacturers to be more transparent about production schedules and to prioritise contracts with Covax and Avat which aim to improve the distribution of vaccines in poorer countries. Vaccines makers said they are doing what they can to ensure that doses are spread out fairly. WHO chief optimistic about beating Covid in 2022 Omicron and Delta driving case tsunami - WHO World's top Covid vaccine maker halves production AstraZeneca, which has worked with Oxford University on its vaccine, said it is ""producing its COVID-19 vaccine for no profit to low income countries and has distributed most of its supply to low and middle income countries."" Johnson & Johnson said that approximately 60% its COVID-19 vaccines have been shipped to low and middle income countries and that fair access to them has been ""at the forefront"" of its response to the pandemic. It added that its executive pay strategy ""is designed to promote long-term, sustainable value creation"". Moderna and Pfizer haven't responded to requests for comment. However last year, in anopen letter,externalPfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla wrote that the biggest restriction on expanding manufacturing was ""scarcity of highly specialised raw materials"". Companies including Pfizer have spent billions developing coronavirus vaccines International political efforts to improve vaccine production and distribution through a wavier of intellectual property rights have stalled. Hopes for an agreement at the World Trade Organisation were dented when it's in person Ministerial Conference was abruptly cancelled in late November. Achmea's Rogier Krens believes that such a sharing of the vaccine manufacturing know-how has an important role to play in improving vaccine distribution. Although they have largely resisted so far he said: ""We're actually calling actively for the pharmaceutical companies to contribute in that area"". He argued that increasing vaccine supply is crucial to getting more people protected from coronavirus. Mr Krens said that the coalition of investors can bring about change from the drug makers, even if it doesn't happen overnight, because it's size equates to ""quite a strong voice"".

"Security forces on the streets of Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city Fresh gunshots have been heard in Kazakhstan's largest city, as the president claims order has been largely restored after a violent crackdown to days of anti-government demonstrations. Reports said gunfire was heard near the main square of Almaty, the epicentre of protests sparked by a fuel price hike. The interior ministry said 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers had been killed so far in the unrest. Russian-led forces have arrived in the country at the president's request. Internet access in the country is down and little independent information is coming out. Armoured personal carriers and troops were seen in the main square of Almaty on Friday, the Reuters news agency said. More than 3,000 people have been arrested, according to the interior ministry, and local media said 70 checkpoints had been set up across the country. In a statement on Friday, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said ""constitutional order [had] largely been restored in all regions of the country"" and that ""local authorities [were] in control of the situation"". The president. who has blamed foreign-trained ""terrorists"" for the unrest without giving evidence, said the operations would continue until ""the militants are completely eliminated"". BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Why is there unrest in Kazakhstan? As the protests escalated, President Tokayev appealed to the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) for support. The bloc includes Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Tajikistan and Armenia. The overseas force reportedly sent about 2,500 soldiers to Kazakhstan. The CSTO says the troops are a peacekeeping force and will protect state and military installations. They will stay in the country for several days or weeks, the Russian RIA news agency reports. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim republic with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. The US state department said it was closely monitoring the deployment of Russian troops. ""The United States and, frankly, the world will be watching for any violation of human rights,"" a spokesman said. ""We will also be watching for any actions that may lay the predicate for the seizure of Kazakh institutions."" This video can not be played Watch: President's residence gutted as Kazakhstan clashes continue The unrest began on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled, drawing protesters onto the streets. The government has said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances. Kazakhstan is often described as authoritarian, and most elections are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote. There is no effective political opposition. The bloodshed comes after President Tokayev sacked his cabinet on Wednesday in a bid to head off the demonstrations. He also fired his powerful predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had held a national security role since stepping down as president. By Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News, Almaty The bustling square of Almaty has turned into a conflict zone, complete with burnt down buildings and vehicles. Many people are scared to go outside, especially at night because clashes are continuing. The sounds of shooting and explosions remind people how dangerous it can be to leave their homes. Local vigilante groups block the entrances to their villages near Almaty to prevent looting. Checkpoints and makeshift barriers block the entrance to the city, so people use narrow streets to get in and out of Almaty. There are big queues at petrol stations. Residents struggle to buy food because shopping malls, supermarkets, cafes and restaurants are all closed, only small shops are still open. The internet blockade continues, so people cannot withdraw money, or top up their phones.

"The scheme is expected to benefit 20,000 families A new emergency winter fuel payment scheme has opened for applications. In December, the Department for Communities announced that Â£2m would be available for extra emergency payments to help those most affected byrising fuel costs. About 20,000 households are expected to benefit from the scheme. Pat Austin, from the Fuel Poverty Coalition, welcomed the move but says Â£2m ""in the face of this crisis is really nothing"". She called it a ""disappointing"" amount of money and called for it to be at least doubled and for a taskforce to be set up. Successful applicants to the scheme will receive a one-off payment of Â£100 worth of gas, oil or electricity. Full eligibility criteria, along with the application process,has been published by the Bryson Charitable Group,external, which is helping oversee the operation of the scheme. Eleven companies from across the energy sector have pledged more than Â£250,000 in donations to the scheme Households have seen energy bills increase due to supply and demand on the global wholesale market. This has driven up the amount providers pay for gas and electricity - and that cost is now being passed on to the consumer. The Consumer Council welcomed the scheme and its chief executive Noyona Chundur said: ""We are delighted to have facilitated the establishment of a scheme that will help ease the heavy burden of energy price rises for 20,000 households this winter."" Why are energy bills going up? Gas prices rising by 35% in parts of NI Eleven companies from across the energy sector have pledged more than Â£250,000 in donations to the scheme. The scheme will close for applications on 31 March 2022. A Department for Communities spokesperson said it was a global fuel crisis and support was provided through the affordable warmth Scheme, cold weather payments, discretionary support and the winter fuel payment. ""The vast majority of this year's winter fuel payments have been issued and to date 290,632 people have received their payment, with a total value of Â£51.7m.

"The Extern NI investigation relates to ""serious irregularities"" in financial and performance data in relation to a particular project Government payments to a charity have been suspended over financial ""irregularities"", according to a letter sent by the Department of Health. The Nolan Show can reveal the Department for the Economy is said to be investigating Extern NI. The investigation reportedly relates to ""serious irregularities"" in financial and performance data provided by Extern NI in relation to a particular project. Extern said it cannot comment on investigations. The charity also said its services were continuing as normal. Extern is an all-Ireland organisation that provides services in relation to employment, alcohol and drugs, disability services, homelessness, minority communities. and mental health and suicide. The investigation relates to Extern NI. The Nolan Show has obtained a leaked letter from the Department of Health's director of finance to health trust finance directors in Northern Ireland. It said that Stormont's Department for the Economy has suspended all payments to Extern NI pending the outcome of the investigation. The Department of Health letter advises officials to seriously consider suspending payments to Extern NI until an investigation has been completed. Extern helps people in crisis and describes itself as the leading social justice charity across Ireland The letter states Extern NI is being investigated by the Department for the Economy ""in conjunction with the PSNI"". However, the PSNI say ""at this time, the Police Service of Northern Ireland are not conducting an investigation into this matter"". The Nolan Show asked the Department of Health how this can be considered fair on Extern NI, given it was included in a letter asking health trusts to consider stopping payments to the charity. The Department of Health said it does not comment on investigations. Extern NI provide a range of services, some on behalf of the government in Northern Ireland. The Nolan Show understands that Extern's staff have not been told about the investigation or the possible suspension of payments. Alliance Party assembly member Kellie Armstrong said: ""It will come as a shock to staff and service users to hear of this investigation. ""Indeed the first I learned there were issues was from the Nolan Show. ""Any investigation process must be allowed to complete. Until the investigation outcomes are known, it is not appropriate for me to comment further."" In the Department of Health letter, it is acknowledged that officials will need to consider the impact that the stopping of payments could have on the delivery of services delivered in conjunction with Extern NI. Some payments have been allowed to continue to protect these schemes. Both the Department for Communities and the Department for the Economy said they were currently not in a position to comment on this matter.

"Gareth Lee sued Christian-run Ashers bakery for refusing to make a cake decorated with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"" A gay rights activist has lost a seven-year discrimination dispute over a cake order as the European Court of Human Rights ruled his case inadmissible. Gareth Lee started legal action back in 2014 after a Christian-run Belfast bakery refused to make him a cake with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"". The family firm Ashers said the slogan contravened their Christian beliefs. The European court ruled Mr Lee's case inadmissible, saying he had failed to exhaust all options in the UK courts. The Belfast man has long argued that by refusing to fulfil his order, the bakery had discriminated against him on grounds of his sexual orientation and political beliefs. He won his original case and a subsequent appeal in the UK courts, butin 2018 the UK Supreme Court disagreed with the lower courts and found in favour of the bakery. Mr Lee then took his case to the European Court of Human Rights, where it was examined by seven judges who decided, by majority, that it should be dismissed. The long-running dispute has raised questions about religious freedom and discrimination law. 'Gay cake' row: Q&A Cake row referred to European Court In their ruling on Thursday, the judges said the case was inadmissible because Mr Lee had not invoked his rights under the European Convention of Human Rights ""at any point in the domestic proceedings"" in the UK courts. The judges decided that in order for a complaint to be admissible, ""the Convention arguments must be raised explicitly or in substance before the domestic authorities"". This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the key dates in the ""gay cake"" case ""By relying solely on domestic law, the applicant had deprived the domestic courts of the opportunity to address any Convention issues raised, instead asking the court to usurp the role of the domestic courts. ""Because he had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, the application was inadmissible,"" said the ruling. Mr Lee expressed disappointment that his case had been dismissed on a ""technicality"". ""None of us should be expected to have to figure out the beliefs of a company's owners before going into their shop or paying for their services,"" he said. ""Everyone has freedom of expression and it must equally apply to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people,"" he added. ""I am most frustrated that the core issues did not get fairly analysed and adjudicated upon because of a technicality."" The baking firm has so far declined to comment on the latest ruling. The case began in 2014, when Mr Lee visited a Belfast branch of Ashers Bakery, and asked them to bake a cake decorated with the gay marriage slogan. Gareth Lee said he was frustrated that the case had been dismissed on a ""technicality"" At the time, same-sex marriage was still illegal in Northern Ireland, but the law has since changed andsame-sex weddings have been taking place since February 2020. The cake Mr Lee requested was to feature an image of Bert and Ernie, two characters from the children's TV programme Sesame Street, and the logo of the campaign group, QueerSpace. Mr Lee paid Â£36.50 for a cake and left the shop, but a few days later, bakery staff called him to say they could not complete the order because of the slogan and would refund his money. Ashers Baking Company is run by the McArthurs, a Christian family from County Antrim. Mr Lee said the decision to refuse his order had made him feel ""unworthy"" and a ""lesser person"". He complained to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, who supported him in taking a discrimination case against the bakery. Ashers fought the case, arguing they had not turned Mr Lee's custom away because he was gay, but because he had asked them to produce something that was contrary to their religious beliefs. The European Court of Human Rights is the court of law of the Council of Europe, an organisation founded in the aftermath of World War Two to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The Council of Europe has 47 member states including the UK and is separate from the 27-state European Union. The court, which sits in Strasbourg in France, was set up in 1959 and ensures that member states of the Council of Europe respect the rights and guarantees set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. It has 47 judges - one from each country - but only a small number rule on each case. Individuals can take cases against states, alleging that the state violated their rights under the convention. States can also sue other states, although this is very rare. There has been a mixed reaction to the ECHR ruling from Christian organisations and LGTB rights groups who had campaigned on opposite sides of the debate. Simon Calvert from the Christian Institute said it was the right result and ""good news for free speech, good news for Christians, and good news for the McArthurs"". The Christian Institute has supported the family in defending their baking company against Mr Lee's legal action since 2014. ""The UK Supreme Court engaged at length with the human rights arguments in this case and upheld the McArthurs' rights to freedom of expression and religion. It was disappointing to see another attempt to undermine those rights, so it is a relief that the attempt has failed,"" Mr Calvert said. Amy and Daniel McArthur photographed after their UK Supreme Court victory in 2018 However, the Rainbow Project, a Belfast-based gay rights campaign group, said the UK Supreme court decision had created legal uncertainty for LGBT people when accessing goods and services and Thursday's ECHR ruling had not resolved that uncertainty. ""The Rainbow Project affirms our fundamental belief in freedom of religion for all people, however this freedom cannot be extrapolated into privately-owned business and used as a justification for discrimination,"" said its director John O'Doherty. Fellow LGBT campaign group Stonewall also said Thursday's ECHR decision ""leaves the door open for legal uncertainty across the UK and causes continued unease for our communities"". ""Our thoughts are with Gareth Lee, who deserved more support from the European courts after seven years of working towards equality,"" said Stonewall's chief executive Nancy Kelley. Mr Lee's lawyer, Ciaran Moynagh, said the ruling was a missed opportunity, and that Mr Lee was considering whether a fresh case could be pursued in the UK. ""Today's decision means that the law here in Northern Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty as to how persons' rights can be protected,"" said Mr Moynagh, of Phoenix Law. ""Owners of limited companies have long taken advantage of being able to separate themselves financially from their business."" ""We continue to believe they should also keep their political and religious views separate. When a general service is offered, it must be offered without favour or prejudice,"" the lawyer added. However, Peter Tatchell, a prominent LGBT rights campaigner, said he strongly disagreed with Ashers opposition to same-sex marriage and had ""great sympathy for Mr Lee but that he did not believe Ashers had discriminated against him. ""If the judgement had gone the other way, a gay baker could have been forced by law to accede to requests to decorate cakes with messages opposing LGBT+ equality,"" he said. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said he had great sympathy for Gareth Lee but that he did not believe Ashers had discriminated against him ""I support protests against Ashers over their hostility to LGBT+ equality but I cannot endorse legal compulsion to require them to promote a message with which they profoundly disagree."" The Evangelical Alliance argued that ""human rights have been affirmed and everyone is better off"" after the ECHR ruling. ""This case was about freedom of conscience, speech and belief, and whether someone could be forced to create a message they profoundly disagreed with,"" said its director Peter Lynas. ""Today's ruling protects everyone from compelled speech."" Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan also welcomed the European Court ruling. ""This is a case that never should have went to Europe, it never should have been brought to the courts in the first place,"" he said. He added ""I think the Equality Commission has very serious questions that they need to answer."" The NI Equality Commission said it did not support Mr Lee in his application to the European Court of Human Rights ""as his application to this court engaged mainly the human rights aspects of his case"". ""In support of Mr Lee's discrimination case against Ashers Baking Company Ltd, the commission's legal expenditure in the domestic courts amounted to Â£250,603.86, over four financial years,"" it added.

"This video can not be played PM speaks out against anti-vax ""mumbo jumbo"" Boris Johnson has accused anti-vaccine campaigners of speaking ""mumbo jumbo"" when it comes to coronavirus jabs. The prime minister said those spreading false information on social media were ""totally wrong"" and it was time for him ""to call them out"". Some European countries are making vaccination mandatory, but Mr Johnson stressed it was important for the UK to maintain its voluntary approach. In the UK, 90% of over-12s have now had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. And nearly 83% have had a second dose, while 60% have had their booster or third primary dose. Thursday'scoronavirus figures,externalshowed 179,756 new cases had been reported in the UK and 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Who is targeting teens with false claims? How Covid misinformation spreads The fertility myths that won't go away Mr Johnson, who was speaking while on a visit to a vaccination centre in Northampton, said: ""I want to say to the anti-vax campaigners, the people who are putting this mumbo jumbo on social media: they are completely wrong. ""You haven't heard me say that before, because I think it's important we have a voluntary approach in this country and we're going to keep a voluntary approach."" Mr Johnson said some other European nations were going for ""coercion"". Italy is the latest country to make vaccination compulsory for some, with all over-50s now being told to have a jab. Austria wasthe first to make it a legal requirement. The prime minister said: ""What a tragedy that we've got all this pressure on the NHS, all the difficulties that our doctors and nurses are experiencing, and we've got people out there spouting complete nonsense about vaccination. ""They are totally wrong, and I think it's time that I, the government, call them out on what they're doing. It's absolutely wrong, it's totally counterproductive, and the stuff they're putting out on social media is complete mumbo jumbo."" He said some 30-40% of the 17,000 patients in hospital with Covid ""haven't actually been vaccinated at all"". This is ""increasingly true"" of those in intensive care, added Mr Johnson, as the ""overwhelming majority of them have not been boosted"". People should ""behave sensibly"" as well as recognising ""the vital importance of vaccination"", he added. The vast majority of adults in the UK have had Covid-19 vaccines - but that hasn't stopped anti-vaccine activists from continuing their crusade against jabs. Their tactics change and evolve according to social media policies and what's in the news. They generally promote unfounded claims about the jabs relating to emotive topics. Some brandish scientific titles in a bid to play on trust in experts. The reasons behind vaccine hesitancy vary. Some can't get a jab because of medical reasons. Others are on the fence, or don't see the personal benefit. It's only a tiny minority of the unjabbed who are ardent anti-vaxxers. But that group is extremely active on social media, sharing posts and videos thatexploit doubt and fearin order to advance their agenda. A select few do it for money or clicks, but others are simplytrue believers being pulled deeper into an online movement. In recent months, it's become clear that anti-vax activists are losing their battle. Some aretrying to create their own small communities. But a few are turning to increasingly aggressive tactics - threatening doctors, journalists and politicians online and even turning up to their houses. Mr Johnson said while Omicron is milder than previous variants, ""the pressures on hospitals are clear"". The number of hospital trusts in England tobe in critical incident statusamid staffing shortages and rising numbers of coronavirus cases is currently thought to be 17. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services like emergency care. But the prime minister said it was not true that the NHS does not have enough staff to cope with the increasing pressure - with staff numbers increasing, retired staff being called back and volunteers being used. Mr Johnson said the UK vaccination programme would continue to be voluntary ""What we've got to do is give the NHS all the help we can through the next period, with all the simplifications of systems, moving staff from one hospital to another, all the ways we can back staff up, but also make sure that the people who are likely to get ill get vaccinated first,"" he said. ""The saddest words in the English language are 'too late'. When you're in ICU and you haven't been vaccinated, sadly it's too late to get vaccinated, so get boosted now."" How can I get my booster jab? What are the self-isolation rules now? What tests do I need to go on holiday? Asked about Australia's detention of men's tennis world number one Novak Djokovic, amid a row over his vaccination status, Mr Johnson said he shares the view that it is a ""very good idea to get vaccinated"". But he said the decision to detain the tennis player was a ""matter for Australia"". Figures released by NHS England on Thursday suggest fewer than half of all adults in some of England's biggest cities have had a booster or third dose of a Covid vaccine. In Nottingham, the take-up of the extra jab among over-18s is estimated to be 42.8%, while it is 45.7% in Manchester, 49.9% in Birmingham and 49.1% in Liverpool. The figures, for vaccinations given up to 2 January, suggest Newham in London has the lowest rate of take-up for boosters and third doses out of all English local authorities, with 38.5% of all adults having had the extra jab. The Gloucestershire Cotswolds area is estimated to have the highest rate, at 83%.

"Security forces on the streets of Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city Fresh gunshots have been heard in Kazakhstan's largest city, as the president claims order has been largely restored after a violent crackdown to days of anti-government demonstrations. Reports said gunfire was heard near the main square of Almaty, the epicentre of protests sparked by a fuel price hike. The interior ministry said 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers had been killed so far in the unrest. Russian-led forces have arrived in the country at the president's request. Internet access in the country is down and little independent information is coming out. Armoured personal carriers and troops were seen in the main square of Almaty on Friday, the Reuters news agency said. More than 3,000 people have been arrested, according to the interior ministry, and local media said 70 checkpoints had been set up across the country. In a statement on Friday, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said ""constitutional order [had] largely been restored in all regions of the country"" and that ""local authorities [were] in control of the situation"". The president. who has blamed foreign-trained ""terrorists"" for the unrest without giving evidence, said the operations would continue until ""the militants are completely eliminated"". BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Why is there unrest in Kazakhstan? As the protests escalated, President Tokayev appealed to the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) for support. The bloc includes Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Tajikistan and Armenia. The overseas force reportedly sent about 2,500 soldiers to Kazakhstan. The CSTO says the troops are a peacekeeping force and will protect state and military installations. They will stay in the country for several days or weeks, the Russian RIA news agency reports. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim republic with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. The US state department said it was closely monitoring the deployment of Russian troops. ""The United States and, frankly, the world will be watching for any violation of human rights,"" a spokesman said. ""We will also be watching for any actions that may lay the predicate for the seizure of Kazakh institutions."" This video can not be played Watch: President's residence gutted as Kazakhstan clashes continue The unrest began on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled, drawing protesters onto the streets. The government has said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances. Kazakhstan is often described as authoritarian, and most elections are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote. There is no effective political opposition. The bloodshed comes after President Tokayev sacked his cabinet on Wednesday in a bid to head off the demonstrations. He also fired his powerful predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had held a national security role since stepping down as president. By Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News, Almaty The bustling square of Almaty has turned into a conflict zone, complete with burnt down buildings and vehicles. Many people are scared to go outside, especially at night because clashes are continuing. The sounds of shooting and explosions remind people how dangerous it can be to leave their homes. Local vigilante groups block the entrances to their villages near Almaty to prevent looting. Checkpoints and makeshift barriers block the entrance to the city, so people use narrow streets to get in and out of Almaty. There are big queues at petrol stations. Residents struggle to buy food because shopping malls, supermarkets, cafes and restaurants are all closed, only small shops are still open.

"Sage Willoughby, Jake Skuse, Milo Ponsford and Rhian Graham were cleared of criminal damage after a monument to the 17th Century slave trader was pulled down and thrown into Bristol's harbourside last June. Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended juries amid criticism from some Conservative MPs after four people who removed a statue of slave trader Edward Colston were cleared of criminal damage. The statue was thrown into Bristol harbour during a protest in 2020. Responding to the verdict, one MP suggested the jury system ""should be addressed"" if it was a ""barrier"" to doling out punishments. But Mr Rees-Mogg said juries are the ""great sublime protector of liberties"". A lawyer for the defence Blinne Ni Ghralaigh welcomed the not guilty verdict saying: ""In this case, they determined that a conviction for the removal of this statue - that glorified a slave trader involved in the enslavement of over 84,000 black men, women and children as a 'most virtuous and wise' man - would not be proportionate."" The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Colston verdict 'landmark' in Britain's slave consciousness However the decision has angered a number of Conservative MPs. MP for Ipswich Tom Hunttold the Telegraph:,external""If you've broken the law and committed criminal damage you should be punished. If the jury is a barrier to ensuring they are punished then that needs to be addressed."" Former communities secretary Robert Jenrick tweeted: ""We undermine the rule of law, which underpins our democracy, if we accept vandalism and criminal damage are acceptable forms of political protest. They aren't. Regardless of the intentions."" And another Conservative, Michael Fabricant, said the verdict could ""give rise to other statues being damaged"". ""The Cenotaph and the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square have been vandalised in the past by anti-racism protesters, and there are now fears that extremists will be 'emboldened',"" he added. However, Leader of the House of Commons Mr Rees-Mogg said he did not think the Bristol verdict put other monuments at risk. Speaking in Parliament, the senior minister said: ""I shall not be going out of here immediately afterwards and drawing a moustache on the statue on Oliver Cromwell much though I am opposed to regicides in principle and think they deserve to be removed from pedestals broadly speaking."" He told MPs that monuments should be protected and only removed through ""due process"", but added that ""one of our greatest monuments is the jury system which is the great sublime protector of our liberties"". ""Juries must be free to come to decisions that they choose to come to on the facts that are in front of them in relation to a specific case and what they hear from the prosecuting counsel, from the defence counsel and from the judge,"" he said. Asked about the jury's decision, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wouldn't comment on the case itself, but argued that it was ""wrong"" for people to ""go round seeking retrospectively to change our history"". Colston's statue was thrown in Bristol's harbourside during a Black Lives Matter protest And speaking earlier in the day, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said new powers in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would close a ""potential loophole"" limiting the prosecution of people who damage memorials. The bill - currently going through Parliament - would allow courts to consider the ""emotional or wider distress"" caused by damage to public property and raise the maximum sentence to 10 years - regardless of the cost of damage. It will also formalise the process of applying for the removal of statues, with ministers being given a final veto. The House of Lords will continue its scrutiny of the bill on Monday 10 January.

"Troops could be seen in Almaty on Thursday morning Security forces in the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan say they have killed dozens of anti-government rioters in the main city, Almaty. They moved in after protesters tried to take control of police stations in the city, a police spokeswoman said. Twelve members of the security forces have been killed and 353 injured in the unrest, sparked by a doubling in the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Russia is sending in troops at the request of the Kazakh president. They will be deployed to help ""stabilise"" the country, which is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) along with Russia, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. The CSTO confirmed Russian paratroopers were being dispatched as peacekeepers, with advance units already deployed. Protests began on Sunday when the government lifted its price cap on LPG, which many people use to fuel their cars, but the unrest has since spread to include political grievances. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe, dwarfing in land mass the other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Why does it matter?It has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. A mainly Muslim republic with a large Russian minority, it has largely escaped the civil strife seen in other parts of Central Asia. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots have rocked the government, resulting in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. Why have there been riots and deaths in Kazakhstan? BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Rare protests in a country that bans dissent Getting a clear picture of what is happening is proving difficult amid what monitoring groups describe as a ""nation-scale internet blackout"", and there are reports that security forces sided with protesters in some places. Almaty police spokeswoman Saltanat Azirbek called on people in the city to stay at home temporarily as a ""counter-terrorist"" operation continued in three administrative buildings on Thursday. Dozens of attackers were ""eliminated"" after they tried to storm police buildings in the city, she said, adding that weapons had been stolen by rioters. About 1,000 people have reportedly been injured in the unrest, with 400 being treated in hospital and 62 in intensive care. Protesters also targeted the mayor's office in Almaty and Kazakhstan's main airport, while water cannon were used against protesters in the western city of Aktobe. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has imposed a nationwide state of emergency that includes a curfew and a ban on mass gatherings. He also fired his powerful predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who held a national security role since stepping down as president, and the entire government also resigned. President Tokayev accused foreign-trained ""terrorist gangs"" of being behind the trouble and announced he had sought help from the CSTO, an alliance of former Soviet states dominated by Russia. The CSTO's current chairman, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, said the alliance would send peacekeeping forces ""for a limited period of time"". Video released by Russian media showed a small number of Russian soldiers boarding a military transport plane. According to the alliance, the peacekeeping force will be deployed to help protect state and military installations in Kazakhstan. The CSTO was set up nearly 30 years ago, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, as an alliance to counter external military threats. In 2010, Russia rejected a request from Kyrgyzstan for the CSTO to send in peacekeepers when ethnic violence erupted there, saying it was an internal matter. Some parts of Kazakhstan like the Mangistau region, where the protests started, rely on LPG (butane and propane) for refuelling as many as 90% of vehicles, Reuters news agency reports. Despite being a major oil nation, Kazakhstan had regularly faced LPG shortages because producers got a better price exporting. When the government removed its price cap on 1 January, prices reportedly rose from 50 ($0.11; Â£0.08) to 120 tenge per litre. The government has since announced it is restoring the 50-tenge cap in Mangistau. byAbdujalil Abdurasulov,BBC News, Almaty The bustling square of Almaty has turned into a conflict zone, complete with burned down buildings and vehicles. Many people are scared to go outside, especially at night because clashes are continuing. The sounds of shooting and explosions remind people how dangerous it can be to leave their homes. Local vigilante groups block the entrances to their villages near Almaty to prevent looting. Checkpoints and makeshift barriers block the entrance to the city, so people are using narrow streets to get in and out of Almaty. There are big queues at petrol stations. Residents are struggling to buy food because shopping malls, supermarkets, cafes and restaurants are all closed, only small shops are still open. And the internet shutdown continues, so people cannot withdraw money or top up their phones. This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in Almaty, the country's biggest city.

"World No 1 tennis star Novak Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated, has been denied entry to Australia His parents have held a press conference in which they said he was being held as a prisoner by the authorities A court hearing on deporting the Serb star has been adjourned and he remains in a Melbourne detention hotel Speaking about his rival's predicament, Rafael Nadal says the vaccine ""is the only way to stop this pandemic"" ""Everybody is free to take their own decisions, but then there are some consequences,"" he adds The WHO says the world is seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases that are overwhelming health systems around the world The UK reported 179,756 new cases on Thursday, plus 231 deaths Covid testing for people travelling to England has ""outlived its usefulness"", Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says Edited by Paul Gribben A court will decide on Monday whether Novak Djokovic will be deported from Australia We'll soon be bringing our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories. Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben and written by Alex Kleiderman, Alex Therrien, Nathan Williams, Jack Hunter, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. Italy has recorded 219,440 new Covid cases - its highest-ever daily number since the start of the pandemic. That's up on 189,109 infections recorded on Wednesday. And 177 more people have been admitted to intensive care units, up from 132 on Wednesday. As it tries to battle the surge, Italy's government has made it compulsory for over-50s to be vaccinated against Covid. Novak Djokovic's family cried foul at his treatment by Australia at a rally outside Serbia's parliament What has the reaction been in Serbia to Novak Djokovic and his attempted participation in the Australian Open tennis championships? The country's president, Aleksandar Vucic, has led a chorus of outrage in Belgrade, the scene of a rally by supporters outside the Serbian parliament. Djokovic's parents say the tennis star is being treated like a criminal as he awaits a ruling on whether he is to be deported from Australia. Read more herefrom BBC Balkans correspondent Guy Delauney. As we've been reporting, Novak Djokovic has had his visa for Australia revoked, after he was granted an exemption from Covid vaccination rules. We've taken a look at what he has actually said about vaccines: Read the full piece here. Portugal is relaxing restrictions, with children going back
to school from next week and night clubs reopening from 14 January â despite
a record Covid surge. PM Antonio Costa says it's ""evident"" Omicron is
less severe and vaccination has been ""effective"". That's why the
country has seen a ""lower number of hospitalisations, fewer people in ICU
and deaths"", he says. The country hit a daily record of nearly 40,000 infections
on Wednesday. It registered 25 deaths on Thursday, but that's far fewer
than the 300 daily deaths during the previous peak in January. A work from home order is also
being ditched from 14 January. However, people flying into Portugal will still need
to provide a negative Covid test.  Matt PreceyBBC Look East A picture obtained by the Eastern Daily Press showed how closely beds have been placed next to each other An NHS hospital has taken ""extreme measures"" to pack more beds into rooms and require patients to wear masks. An email seen by the BBC from the chief nurse at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) NHS Trust says it is a ""battle situation"". Chief nurse Prof Nancy Fontaine asked staff to fit seven beds in bays meant for six, with less space between them. She said the ""extreme measures"" had been taken as a short-term response to an ""unprecedented emergency"". Read more here. A fresh raft of Covid restrictions will be introduced in Austria from Saturday, including new rules on wearing masks in crowds outdoors. But it is also cutting the isolation time for those infected with Covid to five days if they test negative. Under the new restrictions, people will have to wear masks outside when they can't keep at least 2m (6.5ft) away from others. Chancellor Karl Nehammer says Austrians need to do everything they ""can possibly do together to
prevent another lockdown"". He says existing rules banning the unvaccinated from many public places would be more strictly enforced. Austria went into a lockdown for several weeksat the end of last year to fight a surge in cases. Infections then went down, but have been rising again recently. Newham in east London has the lowest take-up of Covid boosters or third jabs, while Cotswold in Gloucestershire has the highest, new figures suggest. The data from NHS England cover adult vaccinations delivered up to 2 January, and show just38.5%of adults got their third dose or boosted inNewham, while83%took up the offer inCotswold. The figures also estimate take-up of the extra dose was: The daily figures also show that 2,078 people were admitted into hospital across the UK. Looking at the seven-day averages behind the figures, cases are up 29.3%, deaths up 56.1% and hospital admissions up 64.7%. Elsewhere in the data, 247,478 booster vaccines were administered, along with 29,030 first jabs and 41,664 second jabs. A further 179,756 cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There were 231 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. On Wednesday 194,747 cases and 334 deaths were reported.  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned the world was facing a ""tsunami"" of cases The Omicron coronavirus variant appears to be less severe than the previously-dominant strain, Delta, but should not be categorised as ""mild"", the head of the World Health Organization has said. Speaking at a WHO briefing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that as with previous variants Omicron was hospitalising and killing people. He said the world was seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases ""so huge and quick that it is overwhelming health systems around the world"", with hospitals becoming overcrowded and understaffed. His colleague Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at the WHO, said the number of global cases has increased by 71% in the last week and by 100% in the Americas. Dr Tedros renewed the WHO's call for richer nations to share vaccines with the developing world. ""I hope global leaders who have shown such resolve in protecting their own populations will extend that resolve to make sure that the whole world is safe and protected,"" he said. Where are cases the highest around the world? Find outhere. Should
Covid restrictions return to what they were before Omicron struck? That's whata senior epidemiologist in Wales has been saying. Cardiff
University's Prof John Watkins says thanks to booster protection and evidence Omicron
is milder, the threat is no worse than that posed by Delta. Age
is the ""major risk factor for poor outcomes"", Prof Watkins says â and
that factor is being mitigated by high numbers of over-70s taking up the
booster. He
also says the Welsh government should perhaps ""realign"" with England
in terms of restrictions. Waleshas tougher rules, with restrictions on hospitality and nightclubs closed. Wales
has been seeing record Covid cases recently. But, as in the rest of the UK,numbers in hospital are nothing like as badas the previous year. The
daily number in hospital on 31 December was 544 â there were nearly four times
this number with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2020. The
Welsh government has said its current measures and guidance are proportionate. Dozens of people have gathered in front of the
Serbian parliament in central Belgrade to
show their support for Novak Djokovic. It came after the tennis star's father urged his fans to respond to Australia's decision to refuse the world number one entry to the country. Border officials said he had failed to provide adequate proof that he was medically exempt from coronavirus vaccination rules. The player, who arrived in Melbourne for the Australian Open after being granted an exemption by local officials, is being held in a government detention hotel in the city pending a court appeal. His father, Srdjan told a press conference the hotel conditions were ""terrible"", adding: ""Shame on you to do this to Novak, the best tennis player and
athlete and the best man in the world. You will not bring him to his knees, he
will fight against it. ""They could have told him not to come, and all
would be fine. No, they wanted to humiliate him."" The sign carried by this supporter of Novak Djokovic in Belgrade reads: ""They are afraid of the best one. Stop Corona fascism"" This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson calls out anti-vaccine social media posts Earlier, we heard UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticise anti-vaxxers for ""putting mumbo jumbo"" on social media. He told broadcasters this was the first time he was speaking out against anti-vax campaigners who were ""spouting complete nonsense"" about Covid vaccines. He estimated about 30% to 40% of people being treated for Covid in hospital have not been vaccinated at all, as he called on them to get jabbed. But he said he wanted to keep a âvoluntary approachâ to vaccinations in the UK, rather than âcoercionâ seen in other countries. Watch the video above for more. A bit more detail now on thatOffice for National Statistics,externalsurvey wementioned earlier. As a reminder, the survey suggests that about 1.3 million people in the UK have 'long Covid' - or symptoms lasting more than four weeks after an initial infection. Of those, 892,000 (70%) first caught the virus at least 12 weeks ago and 506,000 (40%) at least a year ago. Conducted over four weeks in November and December 2021, the study suggests, of those with long Covid:  University of Exeter senior clinical lecturer Dr David Strain says: ""The stark warning here is that, based on this, in the previous waves, over 800,000 people have their day-to-day activities significantly affected over three months after catching Covid and nearly a quarter of a million report this has a dramatic impact on their quality of life. ""As we continue to see case numbers of Omicron rise, we must be wary that our reliance purely on hospitalisations and death as a measure of the risk from Covid could grossly underestimate the public-health impact of our current Covid strategy.""

Dijana Djokovic and Srdjan Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2016 The parents of Novak Djokovic say the tennis star is being treated like a criminal as he awaits a ruling on whether he is to be deported from Australia, amid a public backlash over a vaccine exemption. Speaking to reporters from the player's restaurant in Belgrade, Djokovic's father Srdjan said the row ""has nothing to do with sport"" and was ""political"". The world number one is being held in a government detention hotel in Melbourne pending a court appeal. His mother, Dijana, said: ""They are keeping him as a prisoner, that's not human and it's not fair."" Australian Open organisers said the Serbian player, who has said he is opposed to vaccination, had been granted medical exemption by two independent medical panels organised by Tennis Australia, the body that runs the event, and Victoria state. A total of 125 passengers who arrived in the northern Indian city of Amritsar on a chartered flight from Italyhave tested positive for Covid. They will be placed in isolation, health officials said. They were among 179 passengers on the flight from Milan which landed in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon. TV pictures showed ambulances lined up outside the airport to take away the infected passengers and crowds outside the entrance gates. The news comes as Italy has announced mandatory Covid vaccination for people aged over 50 in a move to curb record high infections and ease pressure on hospitals there. Meanwhile, India reported more than 90,000 cases on Thursday - a nearly six-fold rise over the past week that experts say is fuelled by the Omicron variant. The country recorded 325 deaths in the 24 hours but only one has been linked to Omicron, officials said. Stephen McDonellChina correspondent, Beijing Xi'an's 13 million residents have been under a strict lockdown for two weeks Health officials in the locked-down city of Xi'an have been sacked following public outrage that a woman suffered a miscarriage after being denied access to a hospital due to Covid rules. Photos and video of the woman outside a hospital in Xi'an have received hundreds of millions of views on social media. She was sitting on a plastic stool, surrounded by a pool of blood. Her niece, who posted the images, said her aunt, who was eight months pregnant, had been denied entry to the hospital after her most recent Covid health test had expired just hours earlier. Strict virus measures have required Covid tests to enter buildings. Now the general manager of the Gaoxin Hospital has been suspended and those directly responsible for not letting her in have been removed from their positions. The director of Xian's health department appeared on television today to apologise. Read more about the lockdown in Xi'an here. The government has admitted the evidence for using masks in schools to reduce the spread of Covid is ""not conclusive"", following a review into the evidence for their use. This uncertainty is acknowledged in a newly published review used by ministers in England to make their decision to expand the use of face coverings for secondary school children to classrooms. The government's own study of 123 schools in England which used masks last autumn did not provide proof of a statistically significant impact, the review says. It also lays out that other studies have provided mixed results, but when taken together the evidence suggests they may help. You can read morehere. The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled early from its Christmas break amid concerns about safety in schools following a rise in Omicron cases. Members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) will meet on Monday after Sinn Fein issued the recall notice and 30 signatures were received. MLAs will debate a motion expressing support for keeping schools open, but that raises ""serious concern at the lack of planning by the Minister of Education (Michelle McIlveen) to ensure the safe reopening of schools"" amid the growth of Omicron. The motion calls on the minister to ""urgently develop a plan that puts the safety of pupils and staff first, through the installation of air monitoring and air filtration devices in all classrooms"". It also calls for McIlveen to address the staffing pressures facing the education system by ""utilising and deploying additional teaching capacity to keep schools open and safe"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"US politicians remembered the Capitol riot one year on, with President Joe Biden blaming Donald Trump Trump ""created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election"" in the lead-up to the attack, Biden said Trump responded with unsubstantiated claims about the election and saying Biden is destroying the nation Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, paid tribute to police officers who confronted the mob The mother of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was killed that day, said her daughter was ""publicly executed"" Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021 in a bid to halt certification of Biden's election win Edited by Jessica Murphy A candlelit vigil was held on the steps of Capitol Hill to cap off the day Night has fallen in Washington, and speeches marking the anniversary of the attack on Congress are wrapping up. The day began with Biden condemning Trump for his ""web of lies"" about the 2020 vote that led to the violence at the Capitol. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi led lawmakers on Capitol Hill in a moment of silence, and expressed hope that Americans would turn to their âbetter angelsâ. Most Republicans left Washington, and accused Democrats of politicising the attack. The day ended with a prayer and candlelit vigil. Today's reporting was by Sam Cabral, Bernd Debusmann, Robin Levinson-King, Sophie Williams and Max Matza. Lewis was a civil rights leader before becoming a congressman We've heard a lot today about the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a law that Democrats are proposing to require states with a history of discriminatory voting laws to obtain federal approval before enacting changes to election laws or practices. Last November, the law failed to pass the Senate for a fourth time that year amid overwhelming opposition from Republicans. Earlier today Vice-President Kamala Harris, who broke barriers last year as the first black woman to hold that office, tweeted her support for the bill. ""We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defence of our democracy,"" she wrote. Next week Biden will travel to Atlanta - where Lewis was from - to give a speech calling for the act to be passed. He has hinted that he may opt for the radical step of ending the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for legislation to pass the Senate. Republicans have warned of a âscorched-earthâ response should Democrats go there. Democrats are also hoping to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which would establish national standards for postal and early voting. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. ""When you think things can't get any worse, this happened? What a way to start the new year!"" That's what Rom thought as he watched the chaos unfold one year ago. A former US Marine who twice voted for Donald Trump, Rom is among a minority of Republican voters who accept the 2020 election results and view Joe Biden as the legitimate president. He strongly disapproved of the riot at the US Capitol and says political violence is unacceptable in a representative democracy like the US, but he does not assign any blame to Trump for what happened, instead calling it the work of ""a few bad apples"". Rom is also disappointed that the incident has been ""politicised by one side for their own benefit, far more than it needed to be"". ""I absolutely was stunned by what happened on January 6, but I was just as stunned throughout 2020 when riots were happening on a nightly basis across the country and nobody was doing anything to stop them,"" he says. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley recalled the ""quintessential heartfelt moment that I was involved with personally"" on the day of the riot. While fleeing the approaching mob, he said he heard congresswoman Pramila Jayapal express concern she was walking too slowly because of the cane she was using that day. Quigley recalls that another Illinois lawmaker, Brad Schneider, overheard her remark and came back to accompany her, saying: ""Then let's all just walk together."" ""I was never more proud at that moment to walk alongside any of you. It reminds me that we have to walk alongside and help guide our country away from darkness."" At a vigil outside the Capitol, members of Congress and citizens alike said a silent prayer, while the Baltimore Urban Inspiration Choir sang Amazing Grace. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry of the Episcopal Church said a prayer for the nation as a whole to heal. ""We come before you because we need your help. We need your help in these troubled times. We need your help for this beloved nation,"" he said. ""We need your help for those who have been traumatised and troubled by the painful events of one year ago and all that has continued since."" Ohio Congresswoman Joyce Beatty recalled that 6 January was her first day as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She said: ""I listened as my young staffers called their parents in a state of terror. Asking me, 'Are we going to die? Will we make it out of this alive?'"" She went on to remember the ""banging"" of a lawmaker on her office door. He was desperately searching for ""a place of refuge"", she said. ""For hours we waited, we prayed for safety,"" said Beatty. She added that she was comforted by the presence of congresswoman Val Demings, a police veteran. Democrats are now holding an outdoor candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building. The speeches are continuing on a less sombre note than earlier, with Democrats coming to the stage to cheers from the audience. They are calling for Democratic priorities to be enacted, including a change to voting rules that they argue are urgently needed in light of Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 vote. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent The Capitol is largely a Republican-free zone today, but two of the most vociferous outriders for former President Trump were here. In a small room on the fifth floor of the Cannon Building, 40 of us crammed in with camera crews and photographers to await House members Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz. They arrived: he in a dark suit, she in a sleeveless dress. What happened on 6 January last year was something orchestrated by the FBI and the CIA, they claimed. All was couched in fairly reasonable tones; they didnât raise their voices, there was no finger wagging. I raise the case of Robert Scott Palmer. He has the honour of receiving the longest jail term so far from the FBI inquiry (63 months for hurling a fire extinguisher at a police officer). Was he an undercover federal agent, I ask? ""Weâre not interested in the facts of individual cases,"" Gaetz tells me. ""I donât know about that,"" says Taylor Greene. I try a couple more times, but despite spending most of their press conference talking about getting to the facts, these are facts they are not interested in discussing. Such are the parallel universes that Americans inhabit today - it is difficult to see right now what exactly is holding the nation together. California congressman Adam Schiff said he was not focused on the ""growing mass of rioters"" outside the building last year, because his attention was absorbed by a speech he was preparing to give on the House floor. ""It was not until our leadership was swiftly removed from the chamber and police announced that we needed to take out our gas masks that I understood the full extent of the danger,"" he said at an event for lawmakers to share their memories of that day. ""When the order came to evacuate, I stayed behind for a while until two Republicans came up to me. ""One of them said: 'You can't let them see you. I know these people. I can talk to these people. I can talk my way through these people. You're in a whole different category.'"" Schiff thanked the police officers who kept lawmakers safe during the riot. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. Simon became a US citizen in 2020 and cast his first vote - reluctantly - for Joe Biden. He felt fear and dread during the Trump years, almost as if he was back in war-torn northern Uganda, where he grew up. He says the the scale of the Capitol riots should be ""shocking for anyone who cares about democracy"". ""If people in America do not believe an election is free and fair, what other nations can believe in democracy again?"" he asks. A small-business owner and father of two children, Simon is gravely concerned that what happened a year ago is far from an isolated incident. ""Between social media disinformation and the dissatisfaction among voters, we have folks who live on a different planet right now,"" he says. ""You cannot govern people who do not believe you are legitimate, and a big faction of Americans do not believe they can be governed by this administration."" US Democrats have been sharing their recollections of the 6 January riot as they mark its anniversary. Among those who spoke was Washington state Democrat Pramila Jayapal, who recalled preparing to
use a cane to âfight backâ if she was attacked by the mob. Jayapal warned that she
believes the âdanger is still clear and it is still presentâ. âOur Democracy is very fragile,
and the cult of the âbig lieâ is still very in action,â she said, referring to unsubstantiated
claims from former President Trump that mass voter fraud swayed the 2020 election. Jayapal added that she believes
it is âcritically importantâ those responsible for the riot â including Trump, she said â be held accountable. Another congresswoman, New
Jersey Democrat and long-time Navy veteran Mikie Sherrill, said she witnessed âso
many acts of courageâ during the riot, including hearing fellow representatives calling their family and behaving with ""calm and dignity"" as the crowd entered the Capitol. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio
Democrat, remembered moments of chaos as she sheltered with her young aides. âReflecting on the moments
of terror and tragedy, and a Confederate flag being flown in the United States
Capitol, and Capitol Police officers putting their lives at risk for us, I am
reminded on the advancements that weâve made as a nation. Today we stand
strong,â she said. Republican lawmakers were conspicuous by their absence, and none of the party's leaders participated in today's events. Representative Pramila Jayapal taking cover during the 6 January riot. A number of US lawmakers
have named Capitol Police officer Billy Evans as a victim of the 6 January riot
â despite the fact he was killed in an unrelated incident in April 2020. US President Joe Biden, for
example, invoked Evansâ name in his speech marking the 6 January anniversary, saying ""he lost his life defending the Capitol"". Similarly, Ohio congressman
Tim Ryan included Evans on a list of officers who died âin the weeks and monthsâ
after 6 January, while Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a statement
that Evans and his colleagues' actions on that day âwill stand as a shining
example of heroism and braveryâ. Evans, however, was killed
three months after the 6 January riot when a car crashed into a security
barrier and the driver lunged at the officer with a knife. Here is the BBC's storyabout the 2 April 2021 attack. The suspect, a 25-year-old Indiana man, was shot dead. No police officer was killed on the day of the Capitol riot. Officer Brian
Sicknick died of natural causes a day later after suffering two strokes. Capitol Police officer Billy Evans was killed in an April attack. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. As a proud 'Latino for Trump', Gabriel attended the 6 January rally near the US Capitol in ""a genuine show of support"" for the outgoing president. He says he went back to his hotel, never saw the riot itself and avoided the area thereafter. ""What I saw were people who were extremely disappointed that Republicans failed them. That's why a lot of people had showed up,"" he tells the BBC. ""We pride ourselves on being the party of critical thinking, common sense and responsibility. There was a select minority that had no regard for that and expressed some sort of horrible herd mentality,"" he continues. Gabriel - a founding member of the New York Young Republicans' Hispanic Caucus - feels that the focus of the past year has been less on justice and more about persecuting Trump supporters. ""People need to stop saying that this is our generationâs 9/11,"" he stresses. ""The comparison is extremely disingenuous and egregious. Close to 3,000 Americans died on 9/11 and it sparked a 20-year war on terror."" We've heard a lot of praise today from lawmakers for Capitol Police officers, but one congressman is putting his money where his mouth is. Minnesota representative Dean Phillips has been giving out free lunches to police officers and other Capitol Hill staff members who protected lawmakers during the riot. Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington Erin Little and Trevor Valenti Erin Little and Trevor Valenti from Rhode Island were working at the same restaurant when rioters seized the Capitol last year. They remember watching the events unfold alongside their patrons in disbelief. âIt made everyone around the world think that America is lost,â Valenti said. âI think the world still considers us a laughing stock,â Little added.  Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky Those from further afield spoke to the BBC about Americaâs place on 
the international stage as they watched the Capitol riot unfold from 
their home countries. Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky, visiting Washington from Sao Paulo, Brazil, called the riot âan abuse of 
democracyâ that has emboldened more conspiratorial attacks globally.  Nicolas Posada And
 for Nicolas Posada, from Bogota, Colombia, the siege on the Capitol resembled infamous coups that have been seen in Latin America. âThe
 US has always been the country everyone is looking up to,â he said. 
âBut it stopped being that on that day.â US representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, both vocal Trump supporters, just spoke at an event billed as a ""Republican response"" to the main events marking today's anniversary. Gaetz, a Florida congressman, said the riot may have been a âFedsurrectionâ incited by federal
agents and informants. They played videos of individuals encouraging the crowd of rioters, questioning why they had not been arrested, and calling for a counter-investigation into federal informants. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the Capitol riot, has not so far acknowledged that any of its agents or informants incited or took part in the attack on Congress. Gaetz and Greene, a Georgia congresswoman, have described the dozens of inmates being held in Washington DCâs
jail in connection with the riot as âpolitical prisonersâ. Speaking on a podcast hosted
by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon earlier in the day, Gaetz said the ex-president's supporters
âare ashamed of nothingâ and âproud of the workâ on 6 January 2021. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. James is a lifelong Republican who refused to vote for Donald Trump. His vote for Joe Biden in 2020 was the first time he ever cast his presidential ballot for a Democrat. After watching the siege at the Capitol unfold on national television, he wrote to his local Republican Party, begging them to condemn what had happened. ""Your committee is in part responsible for the violence,"" his letter said. ""If you still believe the Trump disinformation, then you should go join a proper cult instead of continuing to destroy the Republican Party from within."" For James, the shock from a year ago has not dissipated and he fears that more violence may come. ""There's a shift in the country with all the misinformation that is promulgated on the internet,"" he tells the BBC. He hopes his party will stop listening to Trump and ""the madness will end at some point"". ""These things go in cycles. The current situation is just so crazy it can't maintain itself."" One of those who died in the riot was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed woman who was shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives. Her mother has been seen speaking to conservative media outlets outside of Congress. ""She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life,"" Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network. Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran, ""came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election"", Witthoeft said. ""She felt like that was her last time to hear him speak. Little did we know that'd be her last time to hear anybody speak after she was murdered by a careless, reckless Capitol Police officer."" ""My daughter was publicly executed,"" she added, with Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene by her side. Babbitt, who operated a pool cleaning business in California, was not the only person to die that day. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Keith Scott attended the pro-Trump protest outside Congress last year and has returned again today Former President Donald Trump has released a second statement to follow up on one he made shortly after President Biden's morning speech. This latest continues to focus on unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people,"" the statement begins. ""They're [the Democrats] the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election."" Using Biden's words from this morning, Trump accuses Democrats of spreading a ""web of lies"" about suspected Russian meddling in 2016, the election he won against Hillary Clinton. He says Americans are ""aggrieved"" because of inflation, the Afghan pull-out, and rising crime. ""America is a laughingstock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection,"" Trump says, calling for voters to ""work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played Then and now: Kevin McCarthy on Trump and Capitol riot Few better exemplify the shifting attitudes of Republican politicians toward Donald Trump since 6 January, from criticism to renewed embrace, than House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The man who hopes to become House Speaker if Republicans take control of the chamber next January condemned the then-president in the days after the 6 January attacks.Now he claims Trump as a close allyâ one whose support probably will be essential if McCarthy wants to realise his political ambitions. It took some time for most Republicans to come to the realisation that if they wanted to stay in the good graces of the rank-and-file of their party - and advance their political careers - they would have to continue to stand by the former president. A year after the Capitol attack, however, that understanding appears to have fully set in, as one by one Trump's critics have changed their tune or been ushered out of power. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Trump told his supporters to march on the Capitol at a 'Stop the Steal' rally on 6 January It has been exactly a year since a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory. The most comprehensive account of the events leading up to and during that day is still ongoing, the focus of a special House of Representatives committee set up for that purpose. Established in a contentious 1 July House vote after attempts to create an independent inquiry failed, the committee - made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - has conducted more than 250 interviews and issued at least 45 subpoenas over the course of its investigation. According to committee members, most of those contacted have agreed to co-operate. A handful of those closest to Donald Trump, however, have resisted. They've cited executive privilege, a legal principle that protects candid communications between presidents and their advisers. Two so far, Trump confidante Steve Bannon and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, have been cited for contempt of Congress by the House. Bannon is facing a criminal trial next year. As its investigatory work - and legal battles - continue, there are a number of gaps and key questions that the committee is seeking to address. Here are a few of the most pressing ones. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the congressional investigation, recently set out some of what his committee is trying to learn about the Washington DC rallies that served as a precursor to the attack on the Capitol. ""We need to know who organised, planned, paid for and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organisers had with officials in the White House and Congress,"" he said. One of those organisers, far-right conservative activist Ali Alexander, has already testified to the committee â and said he was in touch with the White House and Republican members of Congress ahead of time. The exact nature of these contacts have yet to be publicly revealed. Alexander's public opening statement during his committee deposition laid some of the blame for the day on the leaders of Women for America First, which organised the event near the White House at which Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol. He said they did little to tamp down the violence and may have been at a hotel a block from the White House, ""drinking champagne"" when the Capitol was attacked. The activities at that hotel, the Willard Intercontinental, have been of particular interest to the congressional committee. Steve Bannon, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump confidant Roger Stone were a few of the prominent names linked to hotel gatherings. The committee indicated in its contempt of Congress resolution that it believes Bannon had direct contact with Trump about the 6 January rally on at least one occasion. And Jones said that the White House asked him to lead the march to the Capitol. Right-wing radio host Alex Jones addressed the crowd ahead of the riot After weeks of calls, tweets and unsuccessful legal battles, Trump set his sights on 6 January as the pivotal day that would determine whether he could successfully overturn the results of the election. ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,"" he tweeted on 19 December. ""Be there, will be wild!"" He followed that up 11 days later with another tweet: ""JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!"" According to a report by the Washington Post, there was ample evidence that right-wing militant groups were preparing to travel to the Capitol on 6 January and that they were taking their guidance from the president's public statements. Federal law enforcement and the US military, however, were reluctant to make extensive moves to prepare, for fear of drawing the president's attention â and ire. A suggestion by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley to lock down the capital city was dismissed as being too provocative. Milley, according to the Post, was also concerned military forces dispatched to Washington could receive countermanding orders from the president. On 5 January, Bannon said on his podcast, recorded at the Willard Hotel, that a ""revolution"" was coming and ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow"". That same evening, Trump â after reportedly hearing the growing crowds of supporters gathered outside the White House â tweeted: ""Washington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore!"" Several of the rally organisers, according to a report by the investigative journalism website ProPublica, were concerned that 6 January might turn violent â and the march from the White House to the Capitol was of particular concern. Trump supporters march from the White House to the Capitol ""A last-minute march, without a permit, without all the metro police that'd usually be there to fortify the perimeter, felt unsafe,"" Dustin Stockton, one of the White House rally organisers who has been subpoenaed by the committee, told ProPublica. Stockton wanted these concerns passed along to the White House, something he says he was assured took place. During his White House speech, however, Trump specifically encouraged rally attendees to head to the Capitol. He said they should do so ""peacefully and patriotically,"" but at other points told them to ""fight like hell"". One protester was shot by police while trying to enter the floor of the House of Represenatitves Ever since the days of Richard Nixon, presidential scandals have been defined by two questions. What did the president know, and when did he know it? Those are still relevant in the Capitol attack investigation, but there's also a third: What did the president do once he knew? A big chunk of the committee's investigation has been trying to piece together the president's activities on 6 January â before, during and after the attack. It's why the committee has engaged in a protracted legal battle to obtain documents â call and meeting logs, notes and speech drafts â from the National Archives related to that day. Already there are some details about the pressure the president was under to respond more forcefully when the Capitol came under attack. Republican Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler has recounted how Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy phoned the president and urged him to call off the attackers. When the president demurred, the conversation devolved into an obscenity-laden shouting match. Republican Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville also spoke with the president and told him things were not going ""very good"", adding that he and Vice-President Mike Pence were being evacuated from the Capitol. ""I know we've got problems,"" Trump replied. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows provided the investigating committee with text messages and emails he received from conservative television personalities and members of the president's own family, urging him to get the president to make a public address and take more action to stop the violence. ""He has to lead now,"" Donald Trump Jr wrote. ""It has gone too far and gotten out of hand."" ""I'm pushing it hard,"" Meadows replied. The battle at the Capitol went on for hours The president's actions, however, are the big black hole in the middle of the investigation. If Meadows pushed, how did the president respond? There are reports that the president spent most of the afternoon watching television in his private White House dining room. The committee has subpoenaed White House officials who may have been around the president that day and is currently in a legal fight over government records that may help to fill in some of that black hole. On the morning of 6 January, US Park Police were already clashing with pro-Trump protestors at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Officers were directed to stand back and ""monitor only"". After the Stop the Steal rally and Trump's speech urging the crowd to march to the Capitol, the violence escalated. Pro-Trump rioters attacked police around the Capitol and forced their way into the building, eventually occupying the Senate chamber and ransacking the offices of congressional leaders. Shortly before the rioters entered the Capitol itself, Major General William Walker, commander of the DC National Guard, made a request to acting Secretary of Defence Christopher Miller for permission to deploy his forces to handle the crisis. That authorisation wouldn't reach Walker for more than two hours, and National Guard soldiers would not arrive in numbers at the Capitol until an hour after that. A US Marine guards the White House West Wing on 6 January The committee is looking for further evidence of communication between the Capitol and the Pentagon and contact, if any, between the Pentagon and top White House officials, including the president. The Capitol attack represented a stunning lapse of security in a seat of US governmental power, and there's still no clear idea who bears the most responsibility. One of the more remarkable revelations in the approximately 9,000 documents former Trump Chief-of-Staff Meadows turned over to the congressional committee before he stopped co-operating were emails about a 36-page PowerPoint presentation that circulated in the White House and among congressional Republicans. The exact author of the document has yet to be determined, but it contains many familiar and long-since invalidated claims of election fraud. What is extraordinary about it, however, is the scope of its recommendations. It suggested the president declare a national state of emergency, discard all electronically tabulated ballots and put a federalised National Guard in charge of overseeing a hand recount of paper ballots in key states. Such steps would have no precedent in US history. The committee is also looking into reports that the president was pressuring his own Justice Department to declare the election corrupt, telling senior officials, according to notes taken by one of the participants, that they should ""just say the election was corrupt (and) leave the rest to me and the (Republican) congressman"". On 3 January, the president reportedly contemplated forcing the resignation of acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general who had already drafted a letter to election officials Georgia suggesting that Biden's win was fraudulent and calling on them to declare Trump the rightful winner. The president backed down after Rosen and other Justice Department officials threatened to resign en masse. Clark has so far refused to co-operate with the 6 January inquiry and could be the next individual cited for contempt of Congress. Vice-President Mike Pence was the final target of Trump's pressure â and key members of his staff are currently co-operating with the congressional investigation. The committee is seeking to learn more about a White House meeting the two had on 4 January with John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor who believed Pence could throw out state results and declare Trump the president or, at the very least, delay certification of the results until Republican-controlled legislatures could move to support Trump. According to news reports, the pressure to discard the election results continued into the evening of 6 January, with Eastman informing Pence's legal counsel that there was still time for him to refuse to certify Biden's victory, even with the Capitol still full of lingering teargas fumes and broken glass from the day's violence.

"Gareth Lee sued Christian-run Ashers bakery for refusing to make a cake decorated with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"" A gay rights activist has lost a seven-year discrimination dispute over a cake order as the European Court of Human Rights ruled his case inadmissible. Gareth Lee started legal action back in 2014 after a Christian-run Belfast bakery refused to make him a cake with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"". The family firm Ashers said the slogan contravened their Christian beliefs. The European court ruled Mr Lee's case inadmissible, saying he had failed to exhaust all options in the UK courts. The Belfast man has long argued that by refusing to fulfil his order, the bakery had discriminated against him on grounds of his sexual orientation and political beliefs. He won his original case and a subsequent appeal in the UK courts, butin 2018 the UK Supreme Court disagreed with the lower courts and found in favour of the bakery. Mr Lee then took his case to the European Court of Human Rights, where it was examined by seven judges who decided, by majority, that it should be dismissed. The long-running dispute has raised questions about religious freedom and discrimination law. 'Gay cake' row: Q&A Cake row referred to European Court In their ruling on Thursday, the judges said the case was inadmissible because Mr Lee had not invoked his rights under the European Convention of Human Rights ""at any point in the domestic proceedings"" in the UK courts. The judges decided that in order for a complaint to be admissible, ""the Convention arguments must be raised explicitly or in substance before the domestic authorities"". This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the key dates in the ""gay cake"" case ""By relying solely on domestic law, the applicant had deprived the domestic courts of the opportunity to address any Convention issues raised, instead asking the court to usurp the role of the domestic courts. ""Because he had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, the application was inadmissible,"" said the ruling. Mr Lee expressed disappointment that his case had been dismissed on a ""technicality"". ""None of us should be expected to have to figure out the beliefs of a company's owners before going into their shop or paying for their services,"" he said. ""Everyone has freedom of expression and it must equally apply to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people,"" he added. ""I am most frustrated that the core issues did not get fairly analysed and adjudicated upon because of a technicality."" The baking firm has so far declined to comment on the latest ruling. The case began in 2014, when Mr Lee visited a Belfast branch of Ashers Bakery, and asked them to bake a cake decorated with the gay marriage slogan. Gareth Lee said he was frustrated that the case had been dismissed on a ""technicality"" At the time, same-sex marriage was still illegal in Northern Ireland, but the law has since changed andsame-sex weddings have been taking place since February 2020. The cake Mr Lee requested was to feature an image of Bert and Ernie, two characters from the children's TV programme Sesame Street, and the logo of the campaign group, QueerSpace. Mr Lee paid Â£36.50 for a cake and left the shop, but a few days later, bakery staff called him to say they could not complete the order because of the slogan and would refund his money. Ashers Baking Company is run by the McArthurs, a Christian family from County Antrim. Mr Lee said the decision to refuse his order had made him feel ""unworthy"" and a ""lesser person"". He complained to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, who supported him in taking a discrimination case against the bakery. Ashers fought the case, arguing they had not turned Mr Lee's custom away because he was gay, but because he had asked them to produce something that was contrary to their religious beliefs. The European Court of Human Rights is the court of law of the Council of Europe, an organisation founded in the aftermath of World War Two to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The Council of Europe has 47 member states including the UK and is separate from the 27-state European Union. The court, which sits in Strasbourg in France, was set up in 1959 and ensures that member states of the Council of Europe respect the rights and guarantees set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. It has 47 judges - one from each country - but only a small number rule on each case. Individuals can take cases against states, alleging that the state violated their rights under the convention. States can also sue other states, although this is very rare. There has been a mixed reaction to the ECHR ruling from Christian organisations and LGTB rights groups who had campaigned on opposite sides of the debate. Simon Calvert from the Christian Institute said it was the right result and ""good news for free speech, good news for Christians, and good news for the McArthurs"". The Christian Institute has supported the family in defending their baking company against Mr Lee's legal action since 2014. ""The UK Supreme Court engaged at length with the human rights arguments in this case and upheld the McArthurs' rights to freedom of expression and religion. It was disappointing to see another attempt to undermine those rights, so it is a relief that the attempt has failed,"" Mr Calvert said. Amy and Daniel McArthur photographed after their UK Supreme Court victory in 2018 However, the Rainbow Project, a Belfast-based gay rights campaign group, said the UK Supreme court decision had created legal uncertainty for LGBT people when accessing goods and services and Thursday's ECHR ruling had not resolved that uncertainty. ""The Rainbow Project affirms our fundamental belief in freedom of religion for all people, however this freedom cannot be extrapolated into privately-owned business and used as a justification for discrimination,"" said its director John O'Doherty. Fellow LGBT campaign group Stonewall also said Thursday's ECHR decision ""leaves the door open for legal uncertainty across the UK and causes continued unease for our communities"". ""Our thoughts are with Gareth Lee, who deserved more support from the European courts after seven years of working towards equality,"" said Stonewall's chief executive Nancy Kelley. Mr Lee's lawyer, Ciaran Moynagh, said the ruling was a missed opportunity, and that Mr Lee was considering whether a fresh case could be pursued in the UK. ""Today's decision means that the law here in Northern Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty as to how persons' rights can be protected,"" said Mr Moynagh, of Phoenix Law. ""Owners of limited companies have long taken advantage of being able to separate themselves financially from their business."" ""We continue to believe they should also keep their political and religious views separate. When a general service is offered, it must be offered without favour or prejudice,"" the lawyer added. However, Peter Tatchell, a prominent LGBT rights campaigner, said he strongly disagreed with Ashers opposition to same-sex marriage and had ""great sympathy for Mr Lee but that he did not believe Ashers had discriminated against him. ""If the judgement had gone the other way, a gay baker could have been forced by law to accede to requests to decorate cakes with messages opposing LGBT+ equality,"" he said. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said he had great sympathy for Gareth Lee but that he did not believe Ashers had discriminated against him ""I support protests against Ashers over their hostility to LGBT+ equality but I cannot endorse legal compulsion to require them to promote a message with which they profoundly disagree."" The Evangelical Alliance argued that ""human rights have been affirmed and everyone is better off"" after the ECHR ruling. ""This case was about freedom of conscience, speech and belief, and whether someone could be forced to create a message they profoundly disagreed with,"" said its director Peter Lynas. ""Today's ruling protects everyone from compelled speech."" Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan also welcomed the European Court ruling. ""This is a case that never should have went to Europe, it never should have been brought to the courts in the first place,"" he said. He added ""I think the Equality Commission has very serious questions that they need to answer."" The NI Equality Commission said it did not support Mr Lee in his application to the European Court of Human Rights ""as his application to this court engaged mainly the human rights aspects of his case"". ""In support of Mr Lee's discrimination case against Ashers Baking Company Ltd, the commission's legal expenditure in the domestic courts amounted to Â£250,603.86, over four financial years,"" it added.

"This video can not be played Transport secretary says day two PCRs will be replaced by lateral flow tests The current Covid testing system for people travelling to England has ""outlived its usefulness"", Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says, as Omicron is now ""widespread and worldwide"". Ahead of a rule change later this week, he said the system - introduced to slow Omicron's spread - had ""done its part"". Pre-departure tests will end for fully vaccinated travellers and day two PCRs will be replaced by lateral flow tests. Mr Shapps said ministers would ""ensure a stable system is in place for 2022"". The shake-up, announced on Wednesday, came after travel firms said the measures were not effective now Omicron was spreading widely. What tests do I need to go on holiday? Where do I need to use a Covid passport? Pre-departure Covid travel tests to be scrapped Under the current rules in force until Friday, all fully vaccinated travellers over the age of 12 must show proof of a negative lateral flow or PCR test taken in the two days before coming to the UK. Fully vaccinated people must also pay for a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate while waiting for the result. People who aren't fully vaccinated must currently take PCR tests on both day two and day eight after arriving, and self-isolate for 10 days. But under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday:fully vaccinated travellers and under-18s will no longer need to take a pre-departure test two days before travelling to England. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but won't have to self-isolate while awaiting the result From 04:00 GMT on Sunday:they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. This test must be bought from a private provider - free NHS tests are not allowed Unvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and to self-isolate for 10 days People going abroad should continue to check the travel rules for their destination country. Scotland's health minister Humza Yousaf spoke of his ""frustration"" that the changes were announced for England only, despite UK-wide talks on what the rules should be. He said he would give an update on Thursday afternoon, while Welsh health minister Eluned Morgan said Wales would ""reluctantly"" align with England. Northern Irelandhas confirmed it will also follow suit. Meanwhile, Downing Street said it would continue to look at what it means to be ""fully vaccinated"" given what is known about waning immunity. At the moment, ""fully vaccinated"" refers to people who have had two jabs, but in Scotlandthe term is now being used,externalto mean those who have had their booster. Two doses of some vaccinesoffer almost no protection from an Omicron infection, although they should still greatly reduce the risk of needing hospital care. But a third booster prevents around 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms. Dr Sarah Pitt, virologist at the University of Brighton, said it was ""sensible"" to test people before they got on a plane, as about one in three people who have Covid do not have symptoms but can be infectious to others. ""It's not that you're a special risk from having been travelling, but people should be testing themselves regularly anyway,"" she said. Swabs from PCR tests, which are sent to labs for analysis, can show if the variant causing the infection looks like Omicron, Delta or something else. Asked whether the rule change could mean new variants are missed among people arriving from abroad, he said anyone who had a positive lateral flow test must get a PCR test via the NHS so it can be checked for new variants using sequencing techniques. Mr Shapps said the UK had a much higher level of sequencing than any other country in the world, so it was tracking new variants very carefully ""regardless of whether it starts here or somewhere else"". He warned that stricter travel measures could be reintroduced if another variant of concern emerged, andearlier tweeted,externalthat the rules would be reviewed by the end of the month. The travel industry welcomed the relaxation of the rules. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the changes would make travel ""much simpler and easier"", as customers could now book and travel with ""confidence"". Chief executive of travel association Abta, Mark Tanzer, said it was ""potentially very positive"", but that damage had ""already been done"". ""We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,"" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2, also said the timing of the announcement would make a ""huge difference"". Will the changes affect your travel plans?

"This video can not be played Australians give their views on Novak Djokovic's exemption Australians have reacted angrily to news that tennis player Novak Djokovic will play in the Australian Open, after being exempted from vaccination rules. All players and staff at the tournament must be vaccinated or have an exemption granted by an expert independent panel. Djokovic has not spoken about his vaccination status, but last year said he was ""opposed to vaccination"". Prime Minister Scott Morrison said if the player's evidence was insufficient he would be on the ""next plane home"". Organisers say the defending champion has not been given special treatment, but the decision has infuriated many Australians. The country is seeing tens of thousands of Covid-19 cases for the first time after enduring some of the world's strictest restrictions. Over 90% of Australia's over-16 population is fully vaccinated, but some people still cannot travel interstate or globally because of current measures. Amid the controversy, Mr Morrison said the Serbian player would be required to present evidence upon arrival that he has a genuine medical exemption from vaccination. The Australian Open begins on 17 January in Melbourne. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else,"" the prime minister told reporters. ""There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever."" The comments seemed to represent a change in his position, after he said on Tuesday that the Victoria state government had provided the player with an exemption to enter the country and that officials would act ""in accordance with that decision"". Many Australians had previously accused the government ofallowing the rich and famous to do as they pleasewhile ordinary people remained separated from sick and dying loved ones. ""I think it's a disgrace,"" Melbourne resident Christine Wharton told ABC. ""We've all done the right thing, we've all gone out and got our jabs and our boosters and we have someone that has come from overseas and all of a sudden he's been exempt and can play."" A&E doctor Stephen Parnis tweeted: ""I don't care how good a tennis player he is. If he's refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn't be allowed in."" Novak Djokovic has been granted permission to defend his Australian Open title The decision raised eyebrows with some other tennis players too. ""I just think it's very interesting. That's all I'm going to say,"" Australian Alex de Minaur said. Britain's Jamie Murray added: ""I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated I wouldn't be getting an exemption. You know, but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete."" Australian former player Rod Laver said the reason for the exemption should be made public, saying the situation ""might get ugly"". ""Yes, you're a great player and you've performed and won so many tournaments, so it can't be physical,"" he said. ""So what is the problem?"" The tournament's chief executive, Craig Tiley, said 26 athletes had applied for medical exemptions. ""A handful"" had been granted, he said, under guidelines set by federal regulators. ""We made it extra difficult for anyone applying for an application to ensure it was the right process and to make sure the medical experts deal with it independently,"" he told Channel 9. Novak Djokovic's announcement has made him an enemy to some and a hero to others. Whilst the tennis champion has never openly confirmed whether he has been vaccinated, what we do know is that he has previously tested positive for the virus and discussed his opposition to vaccines. During a Facebook live in April 2020 he explained how he ""wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine"" should that be necessary to travel or compete in tournaments. These comments were widely shared and praised in Facebook groups and Telegram channels promoting outlandish conspiracies that the vaccines are part of a sinister plot to control and harm the world's population. And previous comments like this have added fuel to the fire when it comes to the latest row over why he has been granted an exemption to travel. In Telegram channels promoting Covid-19 conspiracies, the exemption has given rise to incorrect theories that the vaccine is experimental. It has also led to outspoken vaccine sceptics, such as US tennis player Tennys Sandgren, to come out in support of Djokovic. And it is not just Djokovic who has been accused of fuelling disinformation on social media. His wife has promoted false claims that 5G technology is somehow linked to Covid-19 on her own Instagram feed - posts labelled as false by the social media site. Applications for medical exemptions are being assessed anonymously by two separate panels, with inflammatory cardiac illness or another acute condition listed as valid reasons. But it is also possible Djokovic has recently tested positive for the virus, which would allow him to defer taking the vaccine. A spokeswoman for the event told the BBC they could not comment on the reasons behind the player's exemption. On Tuesday Djokovic said on Instagram: ""I've spent fantastic quality time with my loved ones over the break and today I'm heading down under with an exemption permission. Let's go 2022. I am ready to live and breathe tennis in the next few weeks of competition."" CONTEXT:The lives upended by Australia's sealed border FEATURE:Crisis causes fury in Aboriginal communities Victoria state government minister Jaala Pulford acknowledged the decision was ""frustrating and upsetting"", but also denied that Djokovic had received special treatment. Both she and Mr Tiley urged Djokovic to give more information to the public. ""It'll certainly be helpful if Novak was to explain the conditions in which he's sought an exemption and granted an exemption but ultimately it's up to him,"" Mr Tiley said.

"World No 1 tennis star Novak Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated, has been denied entry to Australia His parents have held a press conference in which they said he was being held as a prisoner by the authorities A court hearing on deporting the Serb star has been adjourned and he remains in a Melbourne detention hotel Speaking about his rival's predicament, Rafael Nadal says the vaccine ""is the only way to stop this pandemic"" ""Everybody is free to take their own decisions, but then there are some consequences,"" he adds The WHO says the world is seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases that are overwhelming health systems around the world The UK reported 179,756 new cases on Thursday, plus 231 deaths Covid testing for people travelling to England has ""outlived its usefulness"", Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says Edited by Paul Gribben A court will decide on Monday whether Novak Djokovic will be deported from Australia We'll soon be bringing our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories. Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben and written by Alex Kleiderman, Alex Therrien, Nathan Williams, Jack Hunter, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. Italy has recorded 219,440 new Covid cases - its highest-ever daily number since the start of the pandemic. That's up on 189,109 infections recorded on Wednesday. And 177 more people have been admitted to intensive care units, up from 132 on Wednesday. As it tries to battle the surge, Italy's government has made it compulsory for over-50s to be vaccinated against Covid. Novak Djokovic's family cried foul at his treatment by Australia at a rally outside Serbia's parliament What has the reaction been in Serbia to Novak Djokovic and his attempted participation in the Australian Open tennis championships? The country's president, Aleksandar Vucic, has led a chorus of outrage in Belgrade, the scene of a rally by supporters outside the Serbian parliament. Djokovic's parents say the tennis star is being treated like a criminal as he awaits a ruling on whether he is to be deported from Australia. Read more herefrom BBC Balkans correspondent Guy Delauney. As we've been reporting, Novak Djokovic has had his visa for Australia revoked, after he was granted an exemption from Covid vaccination rules. We've taken a look at what he has actually said about vaccines: Read the full piece here. Portugal is relaxing restrictions, with children going back
to school from next week and night clubs reopening from 14 January â despite
a record Covid surge. PM Antonio Costa says it's ""evident"" Omicron is
less severe and vaccination has been ""effective"". That's why the
country has seen a ""lower number of hospitalisations, fewer people in ICU
and deaths"", he says. The country hit a daily record of nearly 40,000 infections
on Wednesday. It registered 25 deaths on Thursday, but that's far fewer
than the 300 daily deaths during the previous peak in January. A work from home order is also
being ditched from 14 January. However, people flying into Portugal will still need
to provide a negative Covid test.  Matt PreceyBBC Look East A picture obtained by the Eastern Daily Press showed how closely beds have been placed next to each other An NHS hospital has taken ""extreme measures"" to pack more beds into rooms and require patients to wear masks. An email seen by the BBC from the chief nurse at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) NHS Trust says it is a ""battle situation"". Chief nurse Prof Nancy Fontaine asked staff to fit seven beds in bays meant for six, with less space between them. She said the ""extreme measures"" had been taken as a short-term response to an ""unprecedented emergency"". Read more here. A fresh raft of Covid restrictions will be introduced in Austria from Saturday, including new rules on wearing masks in crowds outdoors. But it is also cutting the isolation time for those infected with Covid to five days if they test negative. Under the new restrictions, people will have to wear masks outside when they can't keep at least 2m (6.5ft) away from others. Chancellor Karl Nehammer says Austrians need to do everything they ""can possibly do together to
prevent another lockdown"". He says existing rules banning the unvaccinated from many public places would be more strictly enforced. Austria went into a lockdown for several weeksat the end of last year to fight a surge in cases. Infections then went down, but have been rising again recently. Newham in east London has the lowest take-up of Covid boosters or third jabs, while Cotswold in Gloucestershire has the highest, new figures suggest. The data from NHS England cover adult vaccinations delivered up to 2 January, and show just38.5%of adults got their third dose or boosted inNewham, while83%took up the offer inCotswold. The figures also estimate take-up of the extra dose was: The daily figures also show that 2,078 people were admitted into hospital across the UK. Looking at the seven-day averages behind the figures, cases are up 29.3%, deaths up 56.1% and hospital admissions up 64.7%. Elsewhere in the data, 247,478 booster vaccines were administered, along with 29,030 first jabs and 41,664 second jabs. A further 179,756 cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There were 231 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. On Wednesday 194,747 cases and 334 deaths were reported.  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned the world was facing a ""tsunami"" of cases The Omicron coronavirus variant appears to be less severe than the previously-dominant strain, Delta, but should not be categorised as ""mild"", the head of the World Health Organization has said. Speaking at a WHO briefing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that as with previous variants Omicron was hospitalising and killing people. He said the world was seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases ""so huge and quick that it is overwhelming health systems around the world"", with hospitals becoming overcrowded and understaffed. His colleague Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at the WHO, said the number of global cases has increased by 71% in the last week and by 100% in the Americas. Dr Tedros renewed the WHO's call for richer nations to share vaccines with the developing world. ""I hope global leaders who have shown such resolve in protecting their own populations will extend that resolve to make sure that the whole world is safe and protected,"" he said. Where are cases the highest around the world? Find outhere. Should
Covid restrictions return to what they were before Omicron struck? That's whata senior epidemiologist in Wales has been saying. Cardiff
University's Prof John Watkins says thanks to booster protection and evidence Omicron
is milder, the threat is no worse than that posed by Delta. Age
is the ""major risk factor for poor outcomes"", Prof Watkins says â and
that factor is being mitigated by high numbers of over-70s taking up the
booster. He
also says the Welsh government should perhaps ""realign"" with England
in terms of restrictions. Waleshas tougher rules, with restrictions on hospitality and nightclubs closed. Wales
has been seeing record Covid cases recently. But, as in the rest of the UK,numbers in hospital are nothing like as badas the previous year. The
daily number in hospital on 31 December was 544 â there were nearly four times
this number with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2020. The
Welsh government has said its current measures and guidance are proportionate. Dozens of people have gathered in front of the
Serbian parliament in central Belgrade to
show their support for Novak Djokovic. It came after the tennis star's father urged his fans to respond to Australia's decision to refuse the world number one entry to the country. Border officials said he had failed to provide adequate proof that he was medically exempt from coronavirus vaccination rules. The player, who arrived in Melbourne for the Australian Open after being granted an exemption by local officials, is being held in a government detention hotel in the city pending a court appeal. His father, Srdjan told a press conference the hotel conditions were ""terrible"", adding: ""Shame on you to do this to Novak, the best tennis player and
athlete and the best man in the world. You will not bring him to his knees, he
will fight against it. ""They could have told him not to come, and all
would be fine. No, they wanted to humiliate him."" The sign carried by this supporter of Novak Djokovic in Belgrade reads: ""They are afraid of the best one. Stop Corona fascism"" This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson calls out anti-vaccine social media posts Earlier, we heard UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticise anti-vaxxers for ""putting mumbo jumbo"" on social media. He told broadcasters this was the first time he was speaking out against anti-vax campaigners who were ""spouting complete nonsense"" about Covid vaccines. He estimated about 30% to 40% of people being treated for Covid in hospital have not been vaccinated at all, as he called on them to get jabbed. But he said he wanted to keep a âvoluntary approachâ to vaccinations in the UK, rather than âcoercionâ seen in other countries. Watch the video above for more. A bit more detail now on thatOffice for National Statistics,externalsurvey wementioned earlier. As a reminder, the survey suggests that about 1.3 million people in the UK have 'long Covid' - or symptoms lasting more than four weeks after an initial infection. Of those, 892,000 (70%) first caught the virus at least 12 weeks ago and 506,000 (40%) at least a year ago. Conducted over four weeks in November and December 2021, the study suggests, of those with long Covid:  University of Exeter senior clinical lecturer Dr David Strain says: ""The stark warning here is that, based on this, in the previous waves, over 800,000 people have their day-to-day activities significantly affected over three months after catching Covid and nearly a quarter of a million report this has a dramatic impact on their quality of life. ""As we continue to see case numbers of Omicron rise, we must be wary that our reliance purely on hospitalisations and death as a measure of the risk from Covid could grossly underestimate the public-health impact of our current Covid strategy.""

Dijana Djokovic and Srdjan Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2016 The parents of Novak Djokovic say the tennis star is being treated like a criminal as he awaits a ruling on whether he is to be deported from Australia, amid a public backlash over a vaccine exemption. Speaking to reporters from the player's restaurant in Belgrade, Djokovic's father Srdjan said the row ""has nothing to do with sport"" and was ""political"". The world number one is being held in a government detention hotel in Melbourne pending a court appeal. His mother, Dijana, said: ""They are keeping him as a prisoner, that's not human and it's not fair."" Australian Open organisers said the Serbian player, who has said he is opposed to vaccination, had been granted medical exemption by two independent medical panels organised by Tennis Australia, the body that runs the event, and Victoria state. A total of 125 passengers who arrived in the northern Indian city of Amritsar on a chartered flight from Italyhave tested positive for Covid. They will be placed in isolation, health officials said. They were among 179 passengers on the flight from Milan which landed in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon. TV pictures showed ambulances lined up outside the airport to take away the infected passengers and crowds outside the entrance gates. The news comes as Italy has announced mandatory Covid vaccination for people aged over 50 in a move to curb record high infections and ease pressure on hospitals there. Meanwhile, India reported more than 90,000 cases on Thursday - a nearly six-fold rise over the past week that experts say is fuelled by the Omicron variant. The country recorded 325 deaths in the 24 hours but only one has been linked to Omicron, officials said. Stephen McDonellChina correspondent, Beijing Xi'an's 13 million residents have been under a strict lockdown for two weeks Health officials in the locked-down city of Xi'an have been sacked following public outrage that a woman suffered a miscarriage after being denied access to a hospital due to Covid rules. Photos and video of the woman outside a hospital in Xi'an have received hundreds of millions of views on social media. She was sitting on a plastic stool, surrounded by a pool of blood. Her niece, who posted the images, said her aunt, who was eight months pregnant, had been denied entry to the hospital after her most recent Covid health test had expired just hours earlier. Strict virus measures have required Covid tests to enter buildings. Now the general manager of the Gaoxin Hospital has been suspended and those directly responsible for not letting her in have been removed from their positions. The director of Xian's health department appeared on television today to apologise. Read more about the lockdown in Xi'an here. The government has admitted the evidence for using masks in schools to reduce the spread of Covid is ""not conclusive"", following a review into the evidence for their use. This uncertainty is acknowledged in a newly published review used by ministers in England to make their decision to expand the use of face coverings for secondary school children to classrooms. The government's own study of 123 schools in England which used masks last autumn did not provide proof of a statistically significant impact, the review says. It also lays out that other studies have provided mixed results, but when taken together the evidence suggests they may help. You can read morehere. The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled early from its Christmas break amid concerns about safety in schools following a rise in Omicron cases. Members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) will meet on Monday after Sinn Fein issued the recall notice and 30 signatures were received. MLAs will debate a motion expressing support for keeping schools open, but that raises ""serious concern at the lack of planning by the Minister of Education (Michelle McIlveen) to ensure the safe reopening of schools"" amid the growth of Omicron. The motion calls on the minister to ""urgently develop a plan that puts the safety of pupils and staff first, through the installation of air monitoring and air filtration devices in all classrooms"". It also calls for McIlveen to address the staffing pressures facing the education system by ""utilising and deploying additional teaching capacity to keep schools open and safe"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"US politicians remembered the Capitol riot one year on, with President Joe Biden blaming Donald Trump Trump ""created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election"" in the lead-up to the attack, Biden said Trump responded with unsubstantiated claims about the election and saying Biden is destroying the nation Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, paid tribute to police officers who confronted the mob The mother of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was killed that day, said her daughter was ""publicly executed"" Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021 in a bid to halt certification of Biden's election win Edited by Jessica Murphy A candlelit vigil was held on the steps of Capitol Hill to cap off the day Night has fallen in Washington, and speeches marking the anniversary of the attack on Congress are wrapping up. The day began with Biden condemning Trump for his ""web of lies"" about the 2020 vote that led to the violence at the Capitol. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi led lawmakers on Capitol Hill in a moment of silence, and expressed hope that Americans would turn to their âbetter angelsâ. Most Republicans left Washington, and accused Democrats of politicising the attack. The day ended with a prayer and candlelit vigil. Today's reporting was by Sam Cabral, Bernd Debusmann, Robin Levinson-King, Sophie Williams and Max Matza. Lewis was a civil rights leader before becoming a congressman We've heard a lot today about the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a law that Democrats are proposing to require states with a history of discriminatory voting laws to obtain federal approval before enacting changes to election laws or practices. Last November, the law failed to pass the Senate for a fourth time that year amid overwhelming opposition from Republicans. Earlier today Vice-President Kamala Harris, who broke barriers last year as the first black woman to hold that office, tweeted her support for the bill. ""We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defence of our democracy,"" she wrote. Next week Biden will travel to Atlanta - where Lewis was from - to give a speech calling for the act to be passed. He has hinted that he may opt for the radical step of ending the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for legislation to pass the Senate. Republicans have warned of a âscorched-earthâ response should Democrats go there. Democrats are also hoping to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which would establish national standards for postal and early voting. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. ""When you think things can't get any worse, this happened? What a way to start the new year!"" That's what Rom thought as he watched the chaos unfold one year ago. A former US Marine who twice voted for Donald Trump, Rom is among a minority of Republican voters who accept the 2020 election results and view Joe Biden as the legitimate president. He strongly disapproved of the riot at the US Capitol and says political violence is unacceptable in a representative democracy like the US, but he does not assign any blame to Trump for what happened, instead calling it the work of ""a few bad apples"". Rom is also disappointed that the incident has been ""politicised by one side for their own benefit, far more than it needed to be"". ""I absolutely was stunned by what happened on January 6, but I was just as stunned throughout 2020 when riots were happening on a nightly basis across the country and nobody was doing anything to stop them,"" he says. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley recalled the ""quintessential heartfelt moment that I was involved with personally"" on the day of the riot. While fleeing the approaching mob, he said he heard congresswoman Pramila Jayapal express concern she was walking too slowly because of the cane she was using that day. Quigley recalls that another Illinois lawmaker, Brad Schneider, overheard her remark and came back to accompany her, saying: ""Then let's all just walk together."" ""I was never more proud at that moment to walk alongside any of you. It reminds me that we have to walk alongside and help guide our country away from darkness."" At a vigil outside the Capitol, members of Congress and citizens alike said a silent prayer, while the Baltimore Urban Inspiration Choir sang Amazing Grace. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry of the Episcopal Church said a prayer for the nation as a whole to heal. ""We come before you because we need your help. We need your help in these troubled times. We need your help for this beloved nation,"" he said. ""We need your help for those who have been traumatised and troubled by the painful events of one year ago and all that has continued since."" Ohio Congresswoman Joyce Beatty recalled that 6 January was her first day as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She said: ""I listened as my young staffers called their parents in a state of terror. Asking me, 'Are we going to die? Will we make it out of this alive?'"" She went on to remember the ""banging"" of a lawmaker on her office door. He was desperately searching for ""a place of refuge"", she said. ""For hours we waited, we prayed for safety,"" said Beatty. She added that she was comforted by the presence of congresswoman Val Demings, a police veteran. Democrats are now holding an outdoor candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building. The speeches are continuing on a less sombre note than earlier, with Democrats coming to the stage to cheers from the audience. They are calling for Democratic priorities to be enacted, including a change to voting rules that they argue are urgently needed in light of Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 vote. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent The Capitol is largely a Republican-free zone today, but two of the most vociferous outriders for former President Trump were here. In a small room on the fifth floor of the Cannon Building, 40 of us crammed in with camera crews and photographers to await House members Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz. They arrived: he in a dark suit, she in a sleeveless dress. What happened on 6 January last year was something orchestrated by the FBI and the CIA, they claimed. All was couched in fairly reasonable tones; they didnât raise their voices, there was no finger wagging. I raise the case of Robert Scott Palmer. He has the honour of receiving the longest jail term so far from the FBI inquiry (63 months for hurling a fire extinguisher at a police officer). Was he an undercover federal agent, I ask? ""Weâre not interested in the facts of individual cases,"" Gaetz tells me. ""I donât know about that,"" says Taylor Greene. I try a couple more times, but despite spending most of their press conference talking about getting to the facts, these are facts they are not interested in discussing. Such are the parallel universes that Americans inhabit today - it is difficult to see right now what exactly is holding the nation together. California congressman Adam Schiff said he was not focused on the ""growing mass of rioters"" outside the building last year, because his attention was absorbed by a speech he was preparing to give on the House floor. ""It was not until our leadership was swiftly removed from the chamber and police announced that we needed to take out our gas masks that I understood the full extent of the danger,"" he said at an event for lawmakers to share their memories of that day. ""When the order came to evacuate, I stayed behind for a while until two Republicans came up to me. ""One of them said: 'You can't let them see you. I know these people. I can talk to these people. I can talk my way through these people. You're in a whole different category.'"" Schiff thanked the police officers who kept lawmakers safe during the riot. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. Simon became a US citizen in 2020 and cast his first vote - reluctantly - for Joe Biden. He felt fear and dread during the Trump years, almost as if he was back in war-torn northern Uganda, where he grew up. He says the the scale of the Capitol riots should be ""shocking for anyone who cares about democracy"". ""If people in America do not believe an election is free and fair, what other nations can believe in democracy again?"" he asks. A small-business owner and father of two children, Simon is gravely concerned that what happened a year ago is far from an isolated incident. ""Between social media disinformation and the dissatisfaction among voters, we have folks who live on a different planet right now,"" he says. ""You cannot govern people who do not believe you are legitimate, and a big faction of Americans do not believe they can be governed by this administration."" US Democrats have been sharing their recollections of the 6 January riot as they mark its anniversary. Among those who spoke was Washington state Democrat Pramila Jayapal, who recalled preparing to
use a cane to âfight backâ if she was attacked by the mob. Jayapal warned that she
believes the âdanger is still clear and it is still presentâ. âOur Democracy is very fragile,
and the cult of the âbig lieâ is still very in action,â she said, referring to unsubstantiated
claims from former President Trump that mass voter fraud swayed the 2020 election. Jayapal added that she believes
it is âcritically importantâ those responsible for the riot â including Trump, she said â be held accountable. Another congresswoman, New
Jersey Democrat and long-time Navy veteran Mikie Sherrill, said she witnessed âso
many acts of courageâ during the riot, including hearing fellow representatives calling their family and behaving with ""calm and dignity"" as the crowd entered the Capitol. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio
Democrat, remembered moments of chaos as she sheltered with her young aides. âReflecting on the moments
of terror and tragedy, and a Confederate flag being flown in the United States
Capitol, and Capitol Police officers putting their lives at risk for us, I am
reminded on the advancements that weâve made as a nation. Today we stand
strong,â she said. Republican lawmakers were conspicuous by their absence, and none of the party's leaders participated in today's events. Representative Pramila Jayapal taking cover during the 6 January riot. A number of US lawmakers
have named Capitol Police officer Billy Evans as a victim of the 6 January riot
â despite the fact he was killed in an unrelated incident in April 2020. US President Joe Biden, for
example, invoked Evansâ name in his speech marking the 6 January anniversary, saying ""he lost his life defending the Capitol"". Similarly, Ohio congressman
Tim Ryan included Evans on a list of officers who died âin the weeks and monthsâ
after 6 January, while Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a statement
that Evans and his colleagues' actions on that day âwill stand as a shining
example of heroism and braveryâ. Evans, however, was killed
three months after the 6 January riot when a car crashed into a security
barrier and the driver lunged at the officer with a knife. Here is the BBC's storyabout the 2 April 2021 attack. The suspect, a 25-year-old Indiana man, was shot dead. No police officer was killed on the day of the Capitol riot. Officer Brian
Sicknick died of natural causes a day later after suffering two strokes. Capitol Police officer Billy Evans was killed in an April attack. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. As a proud 'Latino for Trump', Gabriel attended the 6 January rally near the US Capitol in ""a genuine show of support"" for the outgoing president. He says he went back to his hotel, never saw the riot itself and avoided the area thereafter. ""What I saw were people who were extremely disappointed that Republicans failed them. That's why a lot of people had showed up,"" he tells the BBC. ""We pride ourselves on being the party of critical thinking, common sense and responsibility. There was a select minority that had no regard for that and expressed some sort of horrible herd mentality,"" he continues. Gabriel - a founding member of the New York Young Republicans' Hispanic Caucus - feels that the focus of the past year has been less on justice and more about persecuting Trump supporters. ""People need to stop saying that this is our generationâs 9/11,"" he stresses. ""The comparison is extremely disingenuous and egregious. Close to 3,000 Americans died on 9/11 and it sparked a 20-year war on terror."" We've heard a lot of praise today from lawmakers for Capitol Police officers, but one congressman is putting his money where his mouth is. Minnesota representative Dean Phillips has been giving out free lunches to police officers and other Capitol Hill staff members who protected lawmakers during the riot. Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington Erin Little and Trevor Valenti Erin Little and Trevor Valenti from Rhode Island were working at the same restaurant when rioters seized the Capitol last year. They remember watching the events unfold alongside their patrons in disbelief. âIt made everyone around the world think that America is lost,â Valenti said. âI think the world still considers us a laughing stock,â Little added.  Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky Those from further afield spoke to the BBC about Americaâs place on 
the international stage as they watched the Capitol riot unfold from 
their home countries. Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky, visiting Washington from Sao Paulo, Brazil, called the riot âan abuse of 
democracyâ that has emboldened more conspiratorial attacks globally.  Nicolas Posada And
 for Nicolas Posada, from Bogota, Colombia, the siege on the Capitol resembled infamous coups that have been seen in Latin America. âThe
 US has always been the country everyone is looking up to,â he said. 
âBut it stopped being that on that day.â US representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, both vocal Trump supporters, just spoke at an event billed as a ""Republican response"" to the main events marking today's anniversary. Gaetz, a Florida congressman, said the riot may have been a âFedsurrectionâ incited by federal
agents and informants. They played videos of individuals encouraging the crowd of rioters, questioning why they had not been arrested, and calling for a counter-investigation into federal informants. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the Capitol riot, has not so far acknowledged that any of its agents or informants incited or took part in the attack on Congress. Gaetz and Greene, a Georgia congresswoman, have described the dozens of inmates being held in Washington DCâs
jail in connection with the riot as âpolitical prisonersâ. Speaking on a podcast hosted
by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon earlier in the day, Gaetz said the ex-president's supporters
âare ashamed of nothingâ and âproud of the workâ on 6 January 2021. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. James is a lifelong Republican who refused to vote for Donald Trump. His vote for Joe Biden in 2020 was the first time he ever cast his presidential ballot for a Democrat. After watching the siege at the Capitol unfold on national television, he wrote to his local Republican Party, begging them to condemn what had happened. ""Your committee is in part responsible for the violence,"" his letter said. ""If you still believe the Trump disinformation, then you should go join a proper cult instead of continuing to destroy the Republican Party from within."" For James, the shock from a year ago has not dissipated and he fears that more violence may come. ""There's a shift in the country with all the misinformation that is promulgated on the internet,"" he tells the BBC. He hopes his party will stop listening to Trump and ""the madness will end at some point"". ""These things go in cycles. The current situation is just so crazy it can't maintain itself."" One of those who died in the riot was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed woman who was shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives. Her mother has been seen speaking to conservative media outlets outside of Congress. ""She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life,"" Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network. Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran, ""came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election"", Witthoeft said. ""She felt like that was her last time to hear him speak. Little did we know that'd be her last time to hear anybody speak after she was murdered by a careless, reckless Capitol Police officer."" ""My daughter was publicly executed,"" she added, with Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene by her side. Babbitt, who operated a pool cleaning business in California, was not the only person to die that day. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Keith Scott attended the pro-Trump protest outside Congress last year and has returned again today Former President Donald Trump has released a second statement to follow up on one he made shortly after President Biden's morning speech. This latest continues to focus on unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people,"" the statement begins. ""They're [the Democrats] the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election."" Using Biden's words from this morning, Trump accuses Democrats of spreading a ""web of lies"" about suspected Russian meddling in 2016, the election he won against Hillary Clinton. He says Americans are ""aggrieved"" because of inflation, the Afghan pull-out, and rising crime. ""America is a laughingstock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection,"" Trump says, calling for voters to ""work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played Then and now: Kevin McCarthy on Trump and Capitol riot Few better exemplify the shifting attitudes of Republican politicians toward Donald Trump since 6 January, from criticism to renewed embrace, than House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The man who hopes to become House Speaker if Republicans take control of the chamber next January condemned the then-president in the days after the 6 January attacks.Now he claims Trump as a close allyâ one whose support probably will be essential if McCarthy wants to realise his political ambitions. It took some time for most Republicans to come to the realisation that if they wanted to stay in the good graces of the rank-and-file of their party - and advance their political careers - they would have to continue to stand by the former president. A year after the Capitol attack, however, that understanding appears to have fully set in, as one by one Trump's critics have changed their tune or been ushered out of power. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played PM speaks out against anti-vax ""mumbo jumbo"" Boris Johnson has accused anti-vaccine campaigners of speaking ""mumbo jumbo"" when it comes to coronavirus jabs. The prime minister said those spreading false information on social media were ""totally wrong"" and it was time for him ""to call them out"". Some European countries are making vaccination mandatory, but Mr Johnson stressed it was important for the UK to maintain its voluntary approach. In the UK, 90% of over-12s have now had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. And nearly 83% have had a second dose, while 60% have had their booster or third primary dose. Thursday'scoronavirus figures,externalshowed 179,756 new cases had been reported in the UK and 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Who is targeting teens with false claims? How Covid misinformation spreads The fertility myths that won't go away Mr Johnson, who was speaking while on a visit to a vaccination centre in Northampton, said: ""I want to say to the anti-vax campaigners, the people who are putting this mumbo jumbo on social media: they are completely wrong. ""You haven't heard me say that before, because I think it's important we have a voluntary approach in this country and we're going to keep a voluntary approach."" Mr Johnson said some other European nations were going for ""coercion"". Italy is the latest country to make vaccination compulsory for some, with all over-50s now being told to have a jab. Austria wasthe first to make it a legal requirement. The prime minister said: ""What a tragedy that we've got all this pressure on the NHS, all the difficulties that our doctors and nurses are experiencing, and we've got people out there spouting complete nonsense about vaccination. ""They are totally wrong, and I think it's time that I, the government, call them out on what they're doing. It's absolutely wrong, it's totally counterproductive, and the stuff they're putting out on social media is complete mumbo jumbo."" He said some 30-40% of the 17,000 patients in hospital with Covid ""haven't actually been vaccinated at all"". This is ""increasingly true"" of those in intensive care, added Mr Johnson, as the ""overwhelming majority of them have not been boosted"". People should ""behave sensibly"" as well as recognising ""the vital importance of vaccination"", he added. The vast majority of adults in the UK have had Covid-19 vaccines - but that hasn't stopped anti-vaccine activists from continuing their crusade against jabs. Their tactics change and evolve according to social media policies and what's in the news. They generally promote unfounded claims about the jabs relating to emotive topics. Some brandish scientific titles in a bid to play on trust in experts. The reasons behind vaccine hesitancy vary. Some can't get a jab because of medical reasons. Others are on the fence, or don't see the personal benefit. It's only a tiny minority of the unjabbed who are ardent anti-vaxxers. But that group is extremely active on social media, sharing posts and videos thatexploit doubt and fearin order to advance their agenda. A select few do it for money or clicks, but others are simplytrue believers being pulled deeper into an online movement. In recent months, it's become clear that anti-vax activists are losing their battle. Some aretrying to create their own small communities. But a few are turning to increasingly aggressive tactics - threatening doctors, journalists and politicians online and even turning up to their houses. Mr Johnson said while Omicron is milder than previous variants, ""the pressures on hospitals are clear"". The number of hospital trusts in England tobe in critical incident statusamid staffing shortages and rising numbers of coronavirus cases is currently thought to be 17. A critical incident is declared when a trust is worried it might not be able to provide core priority services like emergency care. But the prime minister said it was not true that the NHS does not have enough staff to cope with the increasing pressure - with staff numbers increasing, retired staff being called back and volunteers being used. Mr Johnson said the UK vaccination programme would continue to be voluntary ""What we've got to do is give the NHS all the help we can through the next period, with all the simplifications of systems, moving staff from one hospital to another, all the ways we can back staff up, but also make sure that the people who are likely to get ill get vaccinated first,"" he said. ""The saddest words in the English language are 'too late'. When you're in ICU and you haven't been vaccinated, sadly it's too late to get vaccinated, so get boosted now."" How can I get my booster jab? What are the self-isolation rules now? What tests do I need to go on holiday? Asked about Australia's detention of men's tennis world number one Novak Djokovic, amid a row over his vaccination status, Mr Johnson said he shares the view that it is a ""very good idea to get vaccinated"". But he said the decision to detain the tennis player was a ""matter for Australia"". Figures released by NHS England on Thursday suggest fewer than half of all adults in some of England's biggest cities have had a booster or third dose of a Covid vaccine. In Nottingham, the take-up of the extra jab among over-18s is estimated to be 42.8%, while it is 45.7% in Manchester, 49.9% in Birmingham and 49.1% in Liverpool. The figures, for vaccinations given up to 2 January, suggest Newham in London has the lowest rate of take-up for boosters and third doses out of all English local authorities, with 38.5% of all adults having had the extra jab. The Gloucestershire Cotswolds area is estimated to have the highest rate, at 83%.

Figures released by NHS England on Thursday suggest fewer than half of all adults in some of England's biggest cities have had a booster or third dose of a Covid vaccine. In Nottingham, the take-up of the extra jab among over-18s is estimated to be 42.8%, while it is 45.7% in Manchester, 49.9% in Birmingham and 49.1% in Liverpool. The figures, for vaccinations given up to 2 January, suggest Newham in London has the lowest rate of take-up for boosters and third doses out of all English local authorities, with 38.5% of all adults having had the extra jab.

"It is impossible to know yet how high household energy bills might go after the next review of the price cap, one energy boss has told the BBC. Octopus Energy's chief executive Greg Jackson said the sector was working to ""minimise cost increases"". The price cap, which sets the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, means the typical household should pay no more than Â£1,277. Some experts have said it could jump in April as gas prices continue to soar. The new level for the price cap, which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, is due to be announced on 7 February. Government officials have suggested that is the absolute deadline for offering fresh support for firms as costs mount. Have your energy bills gone up recently? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Mr Jackson told the BBC's Today programme: ""The reality is that in the energy sector, the UK buys most of its energy on a global market and we've had to pay about Â£20bn more than usual this year. ""So in one way or another, the UK's going to have to pay that money."" Government discusses support for higher fuel bills Energy bills set to rise by 50%, industry warns Why are gas prices so high? The government and representatives from the Department for Business have been meeting energy bosses in recent weeks to try to tackle the cost-of-living squeeze, as well as attempting to prevent more suppliers from going bust. One option would be to subsidise the energy companies themselves by creating a fund which would allow them to draw on government cash when wholesale gas prices were very high, then pay it back when prices dipped again. Mr Jackson pointed out that energy firms often spread costs by buying gas six, 12 or 24 months in advance in a process called hedging. This video can not be played Serial entrepreneur Greg Jackson previously told the BBC the green energy firm has no HR department But he said a fund would allow companies to ""spread [costs] over a longer period of time, so we smooth the bills for customers in the UK"". He also suggested it was the job of the sector as a whole to drive down costs for consumers. ""I should say that the days of energy companies making fat profits are long gone and the entire sector is loss-making, because we're now so focused on driving costs down for customers,"" he added. ""That's the area where we as companies can work hard."" As the bell rings on a new year, consumers are already prepared to receive some hefty financial body shots. Exactly how much of a stinging blow is not entirely clear as yet. But we do know the big hit will come in April, when tax increases and huge energy price rises take effect. Even if the weather is warmer by then, most people pay their gas and electricity bills in smoothed-out monthly direct debits. The financial pain will be intense and immediate. That is why the details of any potential support packages currently being discussed are so significant. Those individuals and businesses already up against the ropes hope the assistance will be enough to allow them to absorb the punchy bills rather than throw in the towel. Last month, other suppliers warned that more urgency was needed in finding a solution.Ovo Energy's boss Stephen Fitzpatrick predictedthat the rise in wholesale gas prices and its impact on people would be ""an enormous crisis for 2022"". AndEnergy UK, the industry's trade body, warnedbills could soar by another 50% unless the government intervened. Labour has urged the government to use the money raised throughhigher than expected VAT receipts,external, driven by the higher cost of food and energy prices, to cut household energy bills. But a Treasury source told the BBC that rising energy bills would lead to a net reduction in VAT - not an increase. The source claimed that with extra money spent on energy bills, where VAT is relatively lower at 5%, people would be spending less money on other goods which carry higher rates of VAT and therefore there would be a net reduction in the amount raised. The idea of targeted financial support for fuel bills- along the lines of the current Warm Home Discount scheme - is emerging as a frontrunner, however. The current scheme offers those receiving certain state benefits the option to apply for a one-off Â£140 payment every winter. This could be increased and the number of people eligible could be expanded more broadly. Government sources confirmed on Wednesday this was ""under discussion with other options"" and the prime minister referred to the scheme twice in the previous 48 hours. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for the Warm Home Discount scheme to be expanded. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he said: ""The Warm Home Discount, which currently is Â£140 to two million people, I think we should more than double that to at least Â£300, but increase the eligibility to seven and a half million people. ""These are people on Universal Credit, people on disability benefits, people on pension credit. I want to make sure that working-age families with children get real help with their bills."" Warm Home Discount: Worth Â£140 a year. It has been at this level for nearly a decade and is a one-off reduction on bills given by energy companies, although not all suppliers provide it. It is allocated on a first come, first serve basis to some low-income pensioners and younger low-income households who have to apply to receive it. Ministers plan to raise it to Â£150 in 2022, and extended availability to about three million households in England, Wales and Scotland, excluding Northern Ireland Cold Weather Payment: Worth Â£25 for each seven days of sub-zero temperatures in your area between November and the end of March. It is available to broadly the same group of recipients as the Warm Home Discount but it is paid automatically and covers the whole of the UK Winter Fuel Payment: Worth between Â£100 and Â£300. This is non means-tested and paid to households with at least one person of pension age (66 and above), and some younger people on legacy benefits. It is paid automatically and covers the whole of the UK A spokesperson for the Department for Business said that the current energy price cap was ""insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices"". ""We'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy."" The department also pointed to schemes currently in place to help those facing high bills, such as the Warm Home Discount scheme, as well as the Â£500m Household Support Fund, which sees local councils distribute grants to struggling households in England.

"US politicians remembered the Capitol riot one year on, with President Joe Biden blaming Donald Trump Trump ""created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election"" in the lead-up to the attack, Biden said Trump responded with unsubstantiated claims about the election and saying Biden is destroying the nation Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, paid tribute to police officers who confronted the mob The mother of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was killed that day, said her daughter was ""publicly executed"" Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021 in a bid to halt certification of Biden's election win Edited by Jessica Murphy A candlelit vigil was held on the steps of Capitol Hill to cap off the day Night has fallen in Washington, and speeches marking the anniversary of the attack on Congress are wrapping up. The day began with Biden condemning Trump for his ""web of lies"" about the 2020 vote that led to the violence at the Capitol. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi led lawmakers on Capitol Hill in a moment of silence, and expressed hope that Americans would turn to their âbetter angelsâ. Most Republicans left Washington, and accused Democrats of politicising the attack. The day ended with a prayer and candlelit vigil. Today's reporting was by Sam Cabral, Bernd Debusmann, Robin Levinson-King, Sophie Williams and Max Matza. Lewis was a civil rights leader before becoming a congressman We've heard a lot today about the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a law that Democrats are proposing to require states with a history of discriminatory voting laws to obtain federal approval before enacting changes to election laws or practices. Last November, the law failed to pass the Senate for a fourth time that year amid overwhelming opposition from Republicans. Earlier today Vice-President Kamala Harris, who broke barriers last year as the first black woman to hold that office, tweeted her support for the bill. ""We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defence of our democracy,"" she wrote. Next week Biden will travel to Atlanta - where Lewis was from - to give a speech calling for the act to be passed. He has hinted that he may opt for the radical step of ending the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for legislation to pass the Senate. Republicans have warned of a âscorched-earthâ response should Democrats go there. Democrats are also hoping to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which would establish national standards for postal and early voting. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. ""When you think things can't get any worse, this happened? What a way to start the new year!"" That's what Rom thought as he watched the chaos unfold one year ago. A former US Marine who twice voted for Donald Trump, Rom is among a minority of Republican voters who accept the 2020 election results and view Joe Biden as the legitimate president. He strongly disapproved of the riot at the US Capitol and says political violence is unacceptable in a representative democracy like the US, but he does not assign any blame to Trump for what happened, instead calling it the work of ""a few bad apples"". Rom is also disappointed that the incident has been ""politicised by one side for their own benefit, far more than it needed to be"". ""I absolutely was stunned by what happened on January 6, but I was just as stunned throughout 2020 when riots were happening on a nightly basis across the country and nobody was doing anything to stop them,"" he says. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley recalled the ""quintessential heartfelt moment that I was involved with personally"" on the day of the riot. While fleeing the approaching mob, he said he heard congresswoman Pramila Jayapal express concern she was walking too slowly because of the cane she was using that day. Quigley recalls that another Illinois lawmaker, Brad Schneider, overheard her remark and came back to accompany her, saying: ""Then let's all just walk together."" ""I was never more proud at that moment to walk alongside any of you. It reminds me that we have to walk alongside and help guide our country away from darkness."" At a vigil outside the Capitol, members of Congress and citizens alike said a silent prayer, while the Baltimore Urban Inspiration Choir sang Amazing Grace. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry of the Episcopal Church said a prayer for the nation as a whole to heal. ""We come before you because we need your help. We need your help in these troubled times. We need your help for this beloved nation,"" he said. ""We need your help for those who have been traumatised and troubled by the painful events of one year ago and all that has continued since."" Ohio Congresswoman Joyce Beatty recalled that 6 January was her first day as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She said: ""I listened as my young staffers called their parents in a state of terror. Asking me, 'Are we going to die? Will we make it out of this alive?'"" She went on to remember the ""banging"" of a lawmaker on her office door. He was desperately searching for ""a place of refuge"", she said. ""For hours we waited, we prayed for safety,"" said Beatty. She added that she was comforted by the presence of congresswoman Val Demings, a police veteran. Democrats are now holding an outdoor candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building. The speeches are continuing on a less sombre note than earlier, with Democrats coming to the stage to cheers from the audience. They are calling for Democratic priorities to be enacted, including a change to voting rules that they argue are urgently needed in light of Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 vote. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent The Capitol is largely a Republican-free zone today, but two of the most vociferous outriders for former President Trump were here. In a small room on the fifth floor of the Cannon Building, 40 of us crammed in with camera crews and photographers to await House members Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz. They arrived: he in a dark suit, she in a sleeveless dress. What happened on 6 January last year was something orchestrated by the FBI and the CIA, they claimed. All was couched in fairly reasonable tones; they didnât raise their voices, there was no finger wagging. I raise the case of Robert Scott Palmer. He has the honour of receiving the longest jail term so far from the FBI inquiry (63 months for hurling a fire extinguisher at a police officer). Was he an undercover federal agent, I ask? ""Weâre not interested in the facts of individual cases,"" Gaetz tells me. ""I donât know about that,"" says Taylor Greene. I try a couple more times, but despite spending most of their press conference talking about getting to the facts, these are facts they are not interested in discussing. Such are the parallel universes that Americans inhabit today - it is difficult to see right now what exactly is holding the nation together. California congressman Adam Schiff said he was not focused on the ""growing mass of rioters"" outside the building last year, because his attention was absorbed by a speech he was preparing to give on the House floor. ""It was not until our leadership was swiftly removed from the chamber and police announced that we needed to take out our gas masks that I understood the full extent of the danger,"" he said at an event for lawmakers to share their memories of that day. ""When the order came to evacuate, I stayed behind for a while until two Republicans came up to me. ""One of them said: 'You can't let them see you. I know these people. I can talk to these people. I can talk my way through these people. You're in a whole different category.'"" Schiff thanked the police officers who kept lawmakers safe during the riot. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. Simon became a US citizen in 2020 and cast his first vote - reluctantly - for Joe Biden. He felt fear and dread during the Trump years, almost as if he was back in war-torn northern Uganda, where he grew up. He says the the scale of the Capitol riots should be ""shocking for anyone who cares about democracy"". ""If people in America do not believe an election is free and fair, what other nations can believe in democracy again?"" he asks. A small-business owner and father of two children, Simon is gravely concerned that what happened a year ago is far from an isolated incident. ""Between social media disinformation and the dissatisfaction among voters, we have folks who live on a different planet right now,"" he says. ""You cannot govern people who do not believe you are legitimate, and a big faction of Americans do not believe they can be governed by this administration."" US Democrats have been sharing their recollections of the 6 January riot as they mark its anniversary. Among those who spoke was Washington state Democrat Pramila Jayapal, who recalled preparing to
use a cane to âfight backâ if she was attacked by the mob. Jayapal warned that she
believes the âdanger is still clear and it is still presentâ. âOur Democracy is very fragile,
and the cult of the âbig lieâ is still very in action,â she said, referring to unsubstantiated
claims from former President Trump that mass voter fraud swayed the 2020 election. Jayapal added that she believes
it is âcritically importantâ those responsible for the riot â including Trump, she said â be held accountable. Another congresswoman, New
Jersey Democrat and long-time Navy veteran Mikie Sherrill, said she witnessed âso
many acts of courageâ during the riot, including hearing fellow representatives calling their family and behaving with ""calm and dignity"" as the crowd entered the Capitol. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio
Democrat, remembered moments of chaos as she sheltered with her young aides. âReflecting on the moments
of terror and tragedy, and a Confederate flag being flown in the United States
Capitol, and Capitol Police officers putting their lives at risk for us, I am
reminded on the advancements that weâve made as a nation. Today we stand
strong,â she said. Republican lawmakers were conspicuous by their absence, and none of the party's leaders participated in today's events. Representative Pramila Jayapal taking cover during the 6 January riot. A number of US lawmakers
have named Capitol Police officer Billy Evans as a victim of the 6 January riot
â despite the fact he was killed in an unrelated incident in April 2020. US President Joe Biden, for
example, invoked Evansâ name in his speech marking the 6 January anniversary, saying ""he lost his life defending the Capitol"". Similarly, Ohio congressman
Tim Ryan included Evans on a list of officers who died âin the weeks and monthsâ
after 6 January, while Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a statement
that Evans and his colleagues' actions on that day âwill stand as a shining
example of heroism and braveryâ. Evans, however, was killed
three months after the 6 January riot when a car crashed into a security
barrier and the driver lunged at the officer with a knife. Here is the BBC's storyabout the 2 April 2021 attack. The suspect, a 25-year-old Indiana man, was shot dead. No police officer was killed on the day of the Capitol riot. Officer Brian
Sicknick died of natural causes a day later after suffering two strokes. Capitol Police officer Billy Evans was killed in an April attack. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. As a proud 'Latino for Trump', Gabriel attended the 6 January rally near the US Capitol in ""a genuine show of support"" for the outgoing president. He says he went back to his hotel, never saw the riot itself and avoided the area thereafter. ""What I saw were people who were extremely disappointed that Republicans failed them. That's why a lot of people had showed up,"" he tells the BBC. ""We pride ourselves on being the party of critical thinking, common sense and responsibility. There was a select minority that had no regard for that and expressed some sort of horrible herd mentality,"" he continues. Gabriel - a founding member of the New York Young Republicans' Hispanic Caucus - feels that the focus of the past year has been less on justice and more about persecuting Trump supporters. ""People need to stop saying that this is our generationâs 9/11,"" he stresses. ""The comparison is extremely disingenuous and egregious. Close to 3,000 Americans died on 9/11 and it sparked a 20-year war on terror."" We've heard a lot of praise today from lawmakers for Capitol Police officers, but one congressman is putting his money where his mouth is. Minnesota representative Dean Phillips has been giving out free lunches to police officers and other Capitol Hill staff members who protected lawmakers during the riot. Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington Erin Little and Trevor Valenti Erin Little and Trevor Valenti from Rhode Island were working at the same restaurant when rioters seized the Capitol last year. They remember watching the events unfold alongside their patrons in disbelief. âIt made everyone around the world think that America is lost,â Valenti said. âI think the world still considers us a laughing stock,â Little added.  Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky Those from further afield spoke to the BBC about Americaâs place on 
the international stage as they watched the Capitol riot unfold from 
their home countries. Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky, visiting Washington from Sao Paulo, Brazil, called the riot âan abuse of 
democracyâ that has emboldened more conspiratorial attacks globally.  Nicolas Posada And
 for Nicolas Posada, from Bogota, Colombia, the siege on the Capitol resembled infamous coups that have been seen in Latin America. âThe
 US has always been the country everyone is looking up to,â he said. 
âBut it stopped being that on that day.â US representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, both vocal Trump supporters, just spoke at an event billed as a ""Republican response"" to the main events marking today's anniversary. Gaetz, a Florida congressman, said the riot may have been a âFedsurrectionâ incited by federal
agents and informants. They played videos of individuals encouraging the crowd of rioters, questioning why they had not been arrested, and calling for a counter-investigation into federal informants. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the Capitol riot, has not so far acknowledged that any of its agents or informants incited or took part in the attack on Congress. Gaetz and Greene, a Georgia congresswoman, have described the dozens of inmates being held in Washington DCâs
jail in connection with the riot as âpolitical prisonersâ. Speaking on a podcast hosted
by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon earlier in the day, Gaetz said the ex-president's supporters
âare ashamed of nothingâ and âproud of the workâ on 6 January 2021. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. James is a lifelong Republican who refused to vote for Donald Trump. His vote for Joe Biden in 2020 was the first time he ever cast his presidential ballot for a Democrat. After watching the siege at the Capitol unfold on national television, he wrote to his local Republican Party, begging them to condemn what had happened. ""Your committee is in part responsible for the violence,"" his letter said. ""If you still believe the Trump disinformation, then you should go join a proper cult instead of continuing to destroy the Republican Party from within."" For James, the shock from a year ago has not dissipated and he fears that more violence may come. ""There's a shift in the country with all the misinformation that is promulgated on the internet,"" he tells the BBC. He hopes his party will stop listening to Trump and ""the madness will end at some point"". ""These things go in cycles. The current situation is just so crazy it can't maintain itself."" One of those who died in the riot was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed woman who was shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives. Her mother has been seen speaking to conservative media outlets outside of Congress. ""She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life,"" Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network. Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran, ""came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election"", Witthoeft said. ""She felt like that was her last time to hear him speak. Little did we know that'd be her last time to hear anybody speak after she was murdered by a careless, reckless Capitol Police officer."" ""My daughter was publicly executed,"" she added, with Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene by her side. Babbitt, who operated a pool cleaning business in California, was not the only person to die that day. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Keith Scott attended the pro-Trump protest outside Congress last year and has returned again today Former President Donald Trump has released a second statement to follow up on one he made shortly after President Biden's morning speech. This latest continues to focus on unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people,"" the statement begins. ""They're [the Democrats] the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election."" Using Biden's words from this morning, Trump accuses Democrats of spreading a ""web of lies"" about suspected Russian meddling in 2016, the election he won against Hillary Clinton. He says Americans are ""aggrieved"" because of inflation, the Afghan pull-out, and rising crime. ""America is a laughingstock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection,"" Trump says, calling for voters to ""work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played Then and now: Kevin McCarthy on Trump and Capitol riot Few better exemplify the shifting attitudes of Republican politicians toward Donald Trump since 6 January, from criticism to renewed embrace, than House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The man who hopes to become House Speaker if Republicans take control of the chamber next January condemned the then-president in the days after the 6 January attacks.Now he claims Trump as a close allyâ one whose support probably will be essential if McCarthy wants to realise his political ambitions. It took some time for most Republicans to come to the realisation that if they wanted to stay in the good graces of the rank-and-file of their party - and advance their political careers - they would have to continue to stand by the former president. A year after the Capitol attack, however, that understanding appears to have fully set in, as one by one Trump's critics have changed their tune or been ushered out of power. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sage Willoughby, Jake Skuse, Milo Ponsford and Rhian Graham were cleared of criminal damage after a monument to the 17th Century slave trader was pulled down and thrown into Bristol's harbourside last June. Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended juries amid criticism from some Conservative MPs after four people who removed a statue of slave trader Edward Colston were cleared of criminal damage. The statue was thrown into Bristol harbour during a protest in 2020. Responding to the verdict, one MP suggested the jury system ""should be addressed"" if it was a ""barrier"" to doling out punishments. But Mr Rees-Mogg said juries are the ""great sublime protector of liberties"". A lawyer for the defence Blinne Ni Ghralaigh welcomed the not guilty verdict saying: ""In this case, they determined that a conviction for the removal of this statue - that glorified a slave trader involved in the enslavement of over 84,000 black men, women and children as a 'most virtuous and wise' man - would not be proportionate."" The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Colston verdict 'landmark' in Britain's slave consciousness However the decision has angered a number of Conservative MPs. MP for Ipswich Tom Hunttold the Telegraph:,external""If you've broken the law and committed criminal damage you should be punished. If the jury is a barrier to ensuring they are punished then that needs to be addressed."" Former communities secretary Robert Jenrick tweeted: ""We undermine the rule of law, which underpins our democracy, if we accept vandalism and criminal damage are acceptable forms of political protest. They aren't. Regardless of the intentions."" And another Conservative, Michael Fabricant, said the verdict could ""give rise to other statues being damaged"". ""The Cenotaph and the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square have been vandalised in the past by anti-racism protesters, and there are now fears that extremists will be 'emboldened',"" he added. However, Leader of the House of Commons Mr Rees-Mogg said he did not think the Bristol verdict put other monuments at risk. Speaking in Parliament, the senior minister said: ""I shall not be going out of here immediately afterwards and drawing a moustache on the statue on Oliver Cromwell much though I am opposed to regicides in principle and think they deserve to be removed from pedestals broadly speaking."" He told MPs that monuments should be protected and only removed through ""due process"", but added that ""one of our greatest monuments is the jury system which is the great sublime protector of our liberties"". ""Juries must be free to come to decisions that they choose to come to on the facts that are in front of them in relation to a specific case and what they hear from the prosecuting counsel, from the defence counsel and from the judge,"" he said. Asked about the jury's decision, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wouldn't comment on the case itself, but argued that it was ""wrong"" for people to ""go round seeking retrospectively to change our history"". Colston's statue was thrown in Bristol's harbourside during a Black Lives Matter protest And speaking earlier in the day, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said new powers in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill would close a ""potential loophole"" limiting the prosecution of people who damage memorials. The bill - currently going through Parliament - would allow courts to consider the ""emotional or wider distress"" caused by damage to public property and raise the maximum sentence to 10 years - regardless of the cost of damage. It will also formalise the process of applying for the removal of statues, with ministers being given a final veto. The House of Lords will continue its scrutiny of the bill on Monday 10 January.

"This video can not be played Watch: Officer Harry Dunn is still traumatised by the attack on the Capitol President Joe Biden will blame Donald Trump for the US Capitol riot as he marks the anniversary of the attack on the seat of American democracy. Speaking at Congress, Mr Biden will say his predecessor holds ""singular responsibility"" for the ""chaos and carnage"", said spokeswoman Jen Psaki. Investigators have so far arrested 725 suspects in connection with the attack. Trump supporters stormed the building as Congress was meeting to certify Mr Biden's presidential election victory. Images of US lawmakers cowering from the mob in the gallery of the House of Representatives on that afternoon of 6 January 2021 shocked the world. Mr Trump had urged protesters at a rally outside the White House shortly beforehand to ""peacefully"" march on Congress, but he also exhorted them to ""fight"" and stirred up the crowd with unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud in the election he had just lost. The former president had planned to host a competing news conference on Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, Florida. But he cancelled the event after aides reportedly warned of negative press coverage. A spokesman for Mr Trump, Taylor Budowich, said it was ""unsurprising"" that Mr Biden would spend the day ""trying to further divide our nation"" in an attempt to distract voters from rising inflation and crime and coronavirus school closures. This video can not be played 'A nation in decline' - how the world saw the Capitol riot President Biden - who rarely mentions his predecessor - will speak on Thursday morning in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters. The White House press secretary said the president's speech ""will lay out the significance of what happened at the Capitol, and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw"". ""He will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president - in an attempt to mislead the American people, and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened,"" she added. ""President Biden has been clear-eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy,"" Ms Psaki continued. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will preside over a moment of silence at noon on the chamber floor. An inquiry into the riot is being conducted by a House committee, which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats. The panel is chasing phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed light on events leading up to the attack on Congress. They have issued legal summonses to members of Mr Trump's inner circle. What happened to these Capitol rioters? Five big questions about Trump and the riot Senior Republicans will mostly be outside of Washington on Thursday, with the party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, heading a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr McConnell said in the immediate aftermath of the riot that Mr Trump was ""practically and morally responsible"". Some Republican lawmakers have portrayed the invasion of Congress, in which rioters engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police, as a peaceful protest that was spoiled by a few troublemakers. But conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was lambasted on the right on Wednesday after he labelled the riot ""a violent terrorist attack"". This video can not be played US Rapper Nick Nittoli shares his thoughts on QAnon and the US Capitol riots âSo embarrassedâ US Attorney General Merrick Garland gave an update on the FBI inquiry on the eve of the anniversary, calling the law enforcement operation ""one of the largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations in our history"". ""The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last,"" he said. ""We will follow the facts wherever they lead because 6 January was an unprecedented attack on the seat of our democracy."" He said 140 police officers had been assaulted, including one who was beaten and zapped repeatedly with a stun gun until he had a heart attack. Another screamed for help as rioters crushed him between doors and bludgeoned him with his own weapon, said the attorney general. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol Mr Garland is facing pressure from the left to prosecute the rioters more aggressively, as well as charge the former president himself and his allies. ""We build investigations by laying a foundation,"" Mr Garland said. ""We resolve more straightforward cases first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more complex cases."" Most of the charges so far have been misdemeanours that often entail no jail time in the event of a conviction. These suspects have been charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct, parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building, and obstructing congressional proceedings.Â Who stormed the Capitol? Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded But 325 suspects are facing felonies - more serious counts - such as using a dangerous weapon to assault officers. Mr Garland said 300,000 tips had been submitted by private citizens, and the FBI were still hunting about 2,500 suspects.Â One rioter, an unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt, was shot by an officer while trying to breach the House chamber. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died a day later of natural causes after suffering two strokes while defending the building, according to medical officials. In an opinion piece for the New York Times,externalon Wednesday, the oldest-living former US President, Jimmy Carter, warned that the country ""now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss"". ""Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy. Americans must set aside differences and work together before it is too late."" A week after the riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the House for incitement of insurrection, but acquitted by the Senate, which was then controlled by his fellow Republicans. He is still seen as holding sway over the party. Of 10 Republicans who sided with Democrats in the lower chamber vote, two have resigned amid death threats, three others are facing Trump-backed election challenges, and four more have kept a low profile. Wyoming's Liz Cheney was stripped of her Republican leadership position in the House, but is spearheading the congressional inquiry into the Capitol riot. National divisions over the invasion of Congress are underscored by BBC interviews with American voters. James Clark, 69, a life-long Republican voter in Virginia, said: ""It was truly shocking. President Trump seemed intent on burning down the house before leaving Washington."" But Trump voter Keri Smith, 42, of Texas, argued that the Black Lives Matter protests were worse. ""We've seen stuff crazier than that happening on a weekly basis for the past two years,"" she said. Laura Powers, a disaffected Republican, says she is ""still horrified"" by what she watched on TV that day. ""It was a horrible, dark day for democracy and it should never ever happen again,"" she said. The riot has been described as the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812. It is not the only such attack since that era. In 1983 a female-led communist group bombed the US Senate. No-one was injured. One of the co-defendants in that attack had her sentence in another case commuted by US President Bill Clinton. What happened on 6 January at the Capitol riot?

"US politicians remembered the Capitol riot one year on, with President Joe Biden blaming Donald Trump Trump ""created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election"" in the lead-up to the attack, Biden said Trump responded with unsubstantiated claims about the election and saying Biden is destroying the nation Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Congress, paid tribute to police officers who confronted the mob The mother of Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was killed that day, said her daughter was ""publicly executed"" Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on 6 January 2021 in a bid to halt certification of Biden's election win Edited by Jessica Murphy A candlelit vigil was held on the steps of Capitol Hill to cap off the day Night has fallen in Washington, and speeches marking the anniversary of the attack on Congress are wrapping up. The day began with Biden condemning Trump for his ""web of lies"" about the 2020 vote that led to the violence at the Capitol. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi led lawmakers on Capitol Hill in a moment of silence, and expressed hope that Americans would turn to their âbetter angelsâ. Most Republicans left Washington, and accused Democrats of politicising the attack. The day ended with a prayer and candlelit vigil. Today's reporting was by Sam Cabral, Bernd Debusmann, Robin Levinson-King, Sophie Williams and Max Matza. Lewis was a civil rights leader before becoming a congressman We've heard a lot today about the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a law that Democrats are proposing to require states with a history of discriminatory voting laws to obtain federal approval before enacting changes to election laws or practices. Last November, the law failed to pass the Senate for a fourth time that year amid overwhelming opposition from Republicans. Earlier today Vice-President Kamala Harris, who broke barriers last year as the first black woman to hold that office, tweeted her support for the bill. ""We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defence of our democracy,"" she wrote. Next week Biden will travel to Atlanta - where Lewis was from - to give a speech calling for the act to be passed. He has hinted that he may opt for the radical step of ending the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for legislation to pass the Senate. Republicans have warned of a âscorched-earthâ response should Democrats go there. Democrats are also hoping to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which would establish national standards for postal and early voting. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. ""When you think things can't get any worse, this happened? What a way to start the new year!"" That's what Rom thought as he watched the chaos unfold one year ago. A former US Marine who twice voted for Donald Trump, Rom is among a minority of Republican voters who accept the 2020 election results and view Joe Biden as the legitimate president. He strongly disapproved of the riot at the US Capitol and says political violence is unacceptable in a representative democracy like the US, but he does not assign any blame to Trump for what happened, instead calling it the work of ""a few bad apples"". Rom is also disappointed that the incident has been ""politicised by one side for their own benefit, far more than it needed to be"". ""I absolutely was stunned by what happened on January 6, but I was just as stunned throughout 2020 when riots were happening on a nightly basis across the country and nobody was doing anything to stop them,"" he says. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley recalled the ""quintessential heartfelt moment that I was involved with personally"" on the day of the riot. While fleeing the approaching mob, he said he heard congresswoman Pramila Jayapal express concern she was walking too slowly because of the cane she was using that day. Quigley recalls that another Illinois lawmaker, Brad Schneider, overheard her remark and came back to accompany her, saying: ""Then let's all just walk together."" ""I was never more proud at that moment to walk alongside any of you. It reminds me that we have to walk alongside and help guide our country away from darkness."" At a vigil outside the Capitol, members of Congress and citizens alike said a silent prayer, while the Baltimore Urban Inspiration Choir sang Amazing Grace. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry of the Episcopal Church said a prayer for the nation as a whole to heal. ""We come before you because we need your help. We need your help in these troubled times. We need your help for this beloved nation,"" he said. ""We need your help for those who have been traumatised and troubled by the painful events of one year ago and all that has continued since."" Ohio Congresswoman Joyce Beatty recalled that 6 January was her first day as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She said: ""I listened as my young staffers called their parents in a state of terror. Asking me, 'Are we going to die? Will we make it out of this alive?'"" She went on to remember the ""banging"" of a lawmaker on her office door. He was desperately searching for ""a place of refuge"", she said. ""For hours we waited, we prayed for safety,"" said Beatty. She added that she was comforted by the presence of congresswoman Val Demings, a police veteran. Democrats are now holding an outdoor candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building. The speeches are continuing on a less sombre note than earlier, with Democrats coming to the stage to cheers from the audience. They are calling for Democratic priorities to be enacted, including a change to voting rules that they argue are urgently needed in light of Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 vote. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent The Capitol is largely a Republican-free zone today, but two of the most vociferous outriders for former President Trump were here. In a small room on the fifth floor of the Cannon Building, 40 of us crammed in with camera crews and photographers to await House members Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz. They arrived: he in a dark suit, she in a sleeveless dress. What happened on 6 January last year was something orchestrated by the FBI and the CIA, they claimed. All was couched in fairly reasonable tones; they didnât raise their voices, there was no finger wagging. I raise the case of Robert Scott Palmer. He has the honour of receiving the longest jail term so far from the FBI inquiry (63 months for hurling a fire extinguisher at a police officer). Was he an undercover federal agent, I ask? ""Weâre not interested in the facts of individual cases,"" Gaetz tells me. ""I donât know about that,"" says Taylor Greene. I try a couple more times, but despite spending most of their press conference talking about getting to the facts, these are facts they are not interested in discussing. Such are the parallel universes that Americans inhabit today - it is difficult to see right now what exactly is holding the nation together. California congressman Adam Schiff said he was not focused on the ""growing mass of rioters"" outside the building last year, because his attention was absorbed by a speech he was preparing to give on the House floor. ""It was not until our leadership was swiftly removed from the chamber and police announced that we needed to take out our gas masks that I understood the full extent of the danger,"" he said at an event for lawmakers to share their memories of that day. ""When the order came to evacuate, I stayed behind for a while until two Republicans came up to me. ""One of them said: 'You can't let them see you. I know these people. I can talk to these people. I can talk my way through these people. You're in a whole different category.'"" Schiff thanked the police officers who kept lawmakers safe during the riot. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. Simon became a US citizen in 2020 and cast his first vote - reluctantly - for Joe Biden. He felt fear and dread during the Trump years, almost as if he was back in war-torn northern Uganda, where he grew up. He says the the scale of the Capitol riots should be ""shocking for anyone who cares about democracy"". ""If people in America do not believe an election is free and fair, what other nations can believe in democracy again?"" he asks. A small-business owner and father of two children, Simon is gravely concerned that what happened a year ago is far from an isolated incident. ""Between social media disinformation and the dissatisfaction among voters, we have folks who live on a different planet right now,"" he says. ""You cannot govern people who do not believe you are legitimate, and a big faction of Americans do not believe they can be governed by this administration."" US Democrats have been sharing their recollections of the 6 January riot as they mark its anniversary. Among those who spoke was Washington state Democrat Pramila Jayapal, who recalled preparing to
use a cane to âfight backâ if she was attacked by the mob. Jayapal warned that she
believes the âdanger is still clear and it is still presentâ. âOur Democracy is very fragile,
and the cult of the âbig lieâ is still very in action,â she said, referring to unsubstantiated
claims from former President Trump that mass voter fraud swayed the 2020 election. Jayapal added that she believes
it is âcritically importantâ those responsible for the riot â including Trump, she said â be held accountable. Another congresswoman, New
Jersey Democrat and long-time Navy veteran Mikie Sherrill, said she witnessed âso
many acts of courageâ during the riot, including hearing fellow representatives calling their family and behaving with ""calm and dignity"" as the crowd entered the Capitol. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio
Democrat, remembered moments of chaos as she sheltered with her young aides. âReflecting on the moments
of terror and tragedy, and a Confederate flag being flown in the United States
Capitol, and Capitol Police officers putting their lives at risk for us, I am
reminded on the advancements that weâve made as a nation. Today we stand
strong,â she said. Republican lawmakers were conspicuous by their absence, and none of the party's leaders participated in today's events. Representative Pramila Jayapal taking cover during the 6 January riot. A number of US lawmakers
have named Capitol Police officer Billy Evans as a victim of the 6 January riot
â despite the fact he was killed in an unrelated incident in April 2020. US President Joe Biden, for
example, invoked Evansâ name in his speech marking the 6 January anniversary, saying ""he lost his life defending the Capitol"". Similarly, Ohio congressman
Tim Ryan included Evans on a list of officers who died âin the weeks and monthsâ
after 6 January, while Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said in a statement
that Evans and his colleagues' actions on that day âwill stand as a shining
example of heroism and braveryâ. Evans, however, was killed
three months after the 6 January riot when a car crashed into a security
barrier and the driver lunged at the officer with a knife. Here is the BBC's storyabout the 2 April 2021 attack. The suspect, a 25-year-old Indiana man, was shot dead. No police officer was killed on the day of the Capitol riot. Officer Brian
Sicknick died of natural causes a day later after suffering two strokes. Capitol Police officer Billy Evans was killed in an April attack. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. As a proud 'Latino for Trump', Gabriel attended the 6 January rally near the US Capitol in ""a genuine show of support"" for the outgoing president. He says he went back to his hotel, never saw the riot itself and avoided the area thereafter. ""What I saw were people who were extremely disappointed that Republicans failed them. That's why a lot of people had showed up,"" he tells the BBC. ""We pride ourselves on being the party of critical thinking, common sense and responsibility. There was a select minority that had no regard for that and expressed some sort of horrible herd mentality,"" he continues. Gabriel - a founding member of the New York Young Republicans' Hispanic Caucus - feels that the focus of the past year has been less on justice and more about persecuting Trump supporters. ""People need to stop saying that this is our generationâs 9/11,"" he stresses. ""The comparison is extremely disingenuous and egregious. Close to 3,000 Americans died on 9/11 and it sparked a 20-year war on terror."" We've heard a lot of praise today from lawmakers for Capitol Police officers, but one congressman is putting his money where his mouth is. Minnesota representative Dean Phillips has been giving out free lunches to police officers and other Capitol Hill staff members who protected lawmakers during the riot. Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington Erin Little and Trevor Valenti Erin Little and Trevor Valenti from Rhode Island were working at the same restaurant when rioters seized the Capitol last year. They remember watching the events unfold alongside their patrons in disbelief. âIt made everyone around the world think that America is lost,â Valenti said. âI think the world still considers us a laughing stock,â Little added.  Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky Those from further afield spoke to the BBC about Americaâs place on 
the international stage as they watched the Capitol riot unfold from 
their home countries. Sonia Nussencweig-Hotimsky, visiting Washington from Sao Paulo, Brazil, called the riot âan abuse of 
democracyâ that has emboldened more conspiratorial attacks globally.  Nicolas Posada And
 for Nicolas Posada, from Bogota, Colombia, the siege on the Capitol resembled infamous coups that have been seen in Latin America. âThe
 US has always been the country everyone is looking up to,â he said. 
âBut it stopped being that on that day.â US representatives Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, both vocal Trump supporters, just spoke at an event billed as a ""Republican response"" to the main events marking today's anniversary. Gaetz, a Florida congressman, said the riot may have been a âFedsurrectionâ incited by federal
agents and informants. They played videos of individuals encouraging the crowd of rioters, questioning why they had not been arrested, and calling for a counter-investigation into federal informants. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the Capitol riot, has not so far acknowledged that any of its agents or informants incited or took part in the attack on Congress. Gaetz and Greene, a Georgia congresswoman, have described the dozens of inmates being held in Washington DCâs
jail in connection with the riot as âpolitical prisonersâ. Speaking on a podcast hosted
by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon earlier in the day, Gaetz said the ex-president's supporters
âare ashamed of nothingâ and âproud of the workâ on 6 January 2021. The BBC has asked ordinary Americans from around the country how they see the 6 January attack today. James is a lifelong Republican who refused to vote for Donald Trump. His vote for Joe Biden in 2020 was the first time he ever cast his presidential ballot for a Democrat. After watching the siege at the Capitol unfold on national television, he wrote to his local Republican Party, begging them to condemn what had happened. ""Your committee is in part responsible for the violence,"" his letter said. ""If you still believe the Trump disinformation, then you should go join a proper cult instead of continuing to destroy the Republican Party from within."" For James, the shock from a year ago has not dissipated and he fears that more violence may come. ""There's a shift in the country with all the misinformation that is promulgated on the internet,"" he tells the BBC. He hopes his party will stop listening to Trump and ""the madness will end at some point"". ""These things go in cycles. The current situation is just so crazy it can't maintain itself."" One of those who died in the riot was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed woman who was shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives. Her mother has been seen speaking to conservative media outlets outside of Congress. ""She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life,"" Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network. Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran, ""came to DC to hear Donald Trump speak about a stolen election"", Witthoeft said. ""She felt like that was her last time to hear him speak. Little did we know that'd be her last time to hear anybody speak after she was murdered by a careless, reckless Capitol Police officer."" ""My daughter was publicly executed,"" she added, with Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene by her side. Babbitt, who operated a pool cleaning business in California, was not the only person to die that day. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Keith Scott attended the pro-Trump protest outside Congress last year and has returned again today Former President Donald Trump has released a second statement to follow up on one he made shortly after President Biden's morning speech. This latest continues to focus on unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. ""To watch Biden speaking is very hurtful to many people,"" the statement begins. ""They're [the Democrats] the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election."" Using Biden's words from this morning, Trump accuses Democrats of spreading a ""web of lies"" about suspected Russian meddling in 2016, the election he won against Hillary Clinton. He says Americans are ""aggrieved"" because of inflation, the Afghan pull-out, and rising crime. ""America is a laughingstock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection,"" Trump says, calling for voters to ""work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us"".  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played Then and now: Kevin McCarthy on Trump and Capitol riot Few better exemplify the shifting attitudes of Republican politicians toward Donald Trump since 6 January, from criticism to renewed embrace, than House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The man who hopes to become House Speaker if Republicans take control of the chamber next January condemned the then-president in the days after the 6 January attacks.Now he claims Trump as a close allyâ one whose support probably will be essential if McCarthy wants to realise his political ambitions. It took some time for most Republicans to come to the realisation that if they wanted to stay in the good graces of the rank-and-file of their party - and advance their political careers - they would have to continue to stand by the former president. A year after the Capitol attack, however, that understanding appears to have fully set in, as one by one Trump's critics have changed their tune or been ushered out of power. Â© 2025 BBC.

"High Street giants Next and Greggs have both said they are raising prices as they seek to offset higher wage and manufacturing costs. Next, which reported strong sales over Christmas, said its prices would increase by up to 6% next year. Greggs, Britain's biggest bakery chain, said it had raised prices between 5p and 10p on items across its range of sausage rolls and cakes. A Greggs spokesman said the move was ""very much a last resort"". Next said that prices for its spring and summer clothing and homeware ranges would rise by 3.7% from a year earlier, while it expects a 6% increase for autumn and winter goods. Its forecast,externalcame as it said sales for the three months to 25 December were up 20% compared with pre-pandemic 2019, boosted by a strong revival in ""formal and occasionwear"". Next's online business saw sales soar by 45% from two years ago, whereas sales at its High Street stores were down 5.4%. Next has said costs associated with wages, manufacturing and shipping are increasing Next also upped its profit forecast for the year. It now expects to make an extra Â£22m, taking annual profits to Â£822m, which would be nearly 10% higher than in 2019. The company is forecasting sales of full-price goods to rise by 7% overall in 2022, but it warned that this year could see a tougher trading environment, given the financial pressures facing households, such as higher energy bills. Next also said it was facing higher costs itself, hence the need to increase its prices by more than previously expected. The company said it had seen higher shipping and manufacturing costs. Wage costs were also climbing as a result of the increase in the National Living Wage and because of staff shortages in some areas, ""most notably in warehousing and technology"". Next is the first of the big retailers to tell us its Christmas story. And it's had a strong one. The business had been expecting weaker growth, but it was much better than expected, adding an extra Â£70m of sales helped by a revival in adult formal and ""occasionwear"".  And this was despite lower levels of stock. Online sales were up 45%, which more than offset falling sales in its stores.  Even before the pandemic, more than half of the group's sales were already online, making it well placed to benefit from the huge shift in shopping habits. This performance puts Next firmly in the winner's camp. It says forecasting the year ahead is unusually difficult. With soaring fuel bills and a rise in the cost of living, the big question is, how much discretionary spending consumers will be able to make? It's having to put up prices on products, too. But this is a retailer that's better placed than most to cope with the cocktail of cost increases and challenges facing retailers this year. Analysts praised Next for its performance, with the retailer also announcing a special dividend of 160p a share. ""For all the tales of woe on the High Street, there is one shining jewel to be found in the form of Next,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""There aren't many bricks-and-mortar retailers dishing out special dividends or upgrading guidance multiple times over."" She added that Next had managed its business ""very well - stock levels have reduced, and labour shortages didn't derail performance"". Shoppers return to supermarkets for festive feasts Shoppers shun Christmas sales as footfall drops Greggs' chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said that the decision to raise prices, taken after an end of year review, was unavoidable. ""We try and absorb as many of the cost increases that get passed to us as possible and then put through price increases where we can't avoid it, and we've done that this year,"" he told the PA news agency. ""The question is, does the inflationary pressure recede or go up."" Greggs said sales at its stores had eased in the run-up to Christmas and staff absences increased due to the rise of the Omicron variant. Like-for-like sales for 2021 were down 3.3% compared with the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, but in the fourth quarter, they were up 0.8%. Mr Whiteside, who leads employees across more than 2,000 outlets, also announced that he would step down from the role later this year and retire. He will be replaced by Roisin Currie, who is currently Greggs' retail and property director. ""This looks a solid internal appointment, particularly given her key role in developing the delivery business,"" said analysts at Jefferies. Next is the first major retailer to report on how it performed over the key Christmas trading period, although there were updates from other companies on Thursday. Discount retailer B&M said its full-year profits were set to come in ahead of forecasts, with sales in the three months to 25 December up 14% from pre-pandemic levels. The company also announced its 24,000 staff would get an extra week's wages as a bonus for their ""considerable efforts this year"". Homeware retailer Made.com reported a 38% rise in sales during 2021 to Â£434m. Boss Philippe Chainieux said he was  ""delighted"" with how the business was performing, adding that measures it had implemented were now easing the impact of ""industry-wide supply chain issues"".

"The RAC has accused petrol retailers of ripping off motorists by refusing to pass on wholesale price cuts. The motoring organisation said unleaded petrol fell by 2p a litre, but should have come down by 12p. It estimated drivers were overcharged by Â£5m a day in December as retailers made an average of 16p a litre on petrol instead of the normal 6p. The Petrol Retailers Association objected, saying drivers were likely to have benefited more than that. ""December was a rotten month for drivers as they were taken advantage of by retailers,"" said the RAC's fuel spokesman, Simon Williams. In the past, he said, retailers had always reduced pump prices when wholesale prices dropped. ""This time they've stood strong, taking advantage of all the media talk about 'higher energy prices' and banked on the oil price rising again and catching up with their artificially inflated prices, which it has now done,"" Mr Williams said. Retailers make shocking petrol profit, says RAC Petrol prices hit record high, says RAC Why it's the end of the road for petrol stations But Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""December's pump price data is less reliable because it is taken from fuel card transactions, and there have been far fewer of these transactions because of the reduction in business activity between Christmas and New Year."" He said the retail fuel market remained ""extremely competitive"" and said supermarkets did not use artificially low fuel prices to lure shoppers into their stores at Christmas. ""The costs of running petrol stations rose all year, with electricity up 19%, vastly reduced margins from fuel cards, increased national insurance and wage inflation,"" he added. The RAC said unleaded dropped from 147.47p a litre to 145.48p, when drivers should have seen prices nearer to 135p. Diesel dropped by just under 2p a litre from 150.80p to 148.92p, when drivers should have been paying about 142p, it said. The RAC's data suggested that the price of a litre of unleaded on the wholesale market, including delivery, averaged 106p across December. It said that had a 6p margin been taken by retailers, drivers would have seen an average petrol pump price of around 135p after applying VAT at 20%. The average wholesale cost of delivered diesel was 112p a litre which, with the usual 6p retailer margin, would have given a pump price of about 142p. ""This means it has cost petrol car drivers Â£6 more to fill up a typical 55-litre family car than it should have (Â£80 v Â£74) and for diesel nearly Â£4 more, with a tank costing Â£82 at the end of the month instead of Â£78,"" the RAC said.. It estimated retailers' refusal to reflect lower wholesale prices at the pumps cost petrol car drivers Â£156m in December, or the equivalent of Â£5m a day. Howard Cox, founder of campaigning group FairFuelUK, called for the government to create an independent pricing watchdog. ""If gas, electricity, water and telecoms get price protection bodies, why shouldn't motorists have one too?"" he said. He said that if prices at the pumps were ""honest and transparent and open to scrutiny"", inflation could fall by as much as 1%. ""Pump prices should be 10p lower per litre if the actual wholesale price falls had been passed on honestly."" ""Sadly, the government's efforts to work with the fuel industry so that pump prices are competitive, and market driven, ensuring consumers benefit from lower prices, is not working,"" said MP Craig Mackinlay, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Fuel for Motorists and Hauliers.

"A long-term plan to fix the staffing crisis in the NHS is needed to cut record waiting lists for treatment, the government is being warned. Currently, nearly six million people in England are waiting for routine operations and procedures - many of whom are in pain. A report from MPs says the government needs to address staff shortages - or NHS workers will quit. The government pointed to the extra Â£5.9bn allocated to tackle the issue. There have been repeated warnings over the length of hospital waiting lists in England. As of September 2021, a record 5.8 million patients were waiting for surgery - such as hip or knee replacements - with 300,000 waiting more than a year compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic. Why the NHS is struggling like never before Trusts cancel surgery as NHS Covid pressures mount Emergency patients urged to take lift to hospital 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' In the autumn Budget,the government announcedan extra Â£5.9bn for the NHS in England to help clear the backlog. This was on top ofanother funding package in Septemberto create an extra nine million checks, scans and operations. But in its report published on Thursday, the Commons health and social care select committee said the health service was hugely understaffed and was facing an ""unquantifiable challenge"" in tackling the backlog. While it welcomed the government funding, the committee said NHS England was yet to publish ""how it plans to meet its workforce requirements"", despite this being promised by Health Secretary Sajid Javid by the end of November. It said it wanted the government to draw up a recovery plan for services by April. The report said many NHS staff were feeling under pressure and could quit unless they saw the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" of more staff coming. Jeremy Hunt - the former health secretary who now chairs the committee - said the NHS was short of 93,000 workers and there was ""no sign of any plan to address this"". He described the staffing crisis as ""entirely predictable"", adding: ""The current wave of Omicron is exacerbating the problem, but we already had a serious staffing crisis, with a burnt-out workforce. ""Far from tackling the backlog, the NHS will be able to deliver little more than day-to-day firefighting unless the government wakes up to the scale of the staffing crisis facing the NHS."" Matt, Shirley and David have all been impacted by pressures on the NHS Matt Cudworth, 44, needs urgent open heart surgery, but on New Year's Eve he was told his operation - due this week - had been cancelled. ""My whole life's on hold,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He said he feels stuck in a vicious circle: ""One of the things they've said to me is 'don't get stressed, take it easy'... and yet when things like this happen you're naturally more stressed... which creates more problems."" Following successful treatment for an aggressive form of breast cancer, Shirley Cochrane was told she needed check ups every six months, but that hasn't happened and her doctor told her to ""self manage"". She said: ""When you've had cancer, the fear of it returning is massive."" She said she understood the pressures of the pandemic, but the lack of regular contact with her cancer team left her feeling ""abandoned by the NHS"". David Ibbotson has been waiting for a hip replacement for three years - and this week his operation was cancelled for the third time. He struggles with pain while walking and said: ""If I don't get it done soon the joint in the hip will get worse and worse."" Think tank The Health Foundation estimates that nearly 19,000 more nurses and more than 4,000 more doctors are needed in order to get back to the 18-week standard waiting time for treatment. The MPs also want the government to publish an independent assessment of projected staff numbers every two years. It said it had previously recommended something similar - but it had been voted down by the government. The report said without a forecast of future workforce needs it was impossible to know whether enough doctors, nurses or care staff were being trained. It said it was also concerned about the social care workforce, which has about 105,000 vacancies. Doctors have welcomed the report for highlighting the staffing crisis, with the British Medical Association saying it ""clearly lays out what a gargantuan challenge the NHS faces"". ""The biggest barrier to tackling the backlog caused by the pandemic is a severe staffing crisis and our calls for improved workforce planning have thankfully been heard. It's now time for the government to listen too."" The Royal College of Surgeons said the main issue right now was that more than one in 10 NHS staff members were at home ill or self-isolating. It said it supported the committee's call for independent workforce projections, including an assessment of whether enough staff are being trained. And Minesh Patel, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""After years of failing to deliver the long-term funding and planning the NHS needs, the government must now urgently commit the resources required to support and grow the cancer workforce, so that it can tackle the backlog and provide urgent cancer care to everyone who needs it."" The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement that, alongside the Â£5.9bn, it was investing Â£36bn over three years on checks, scans and for patients. ""We have over 5,100 doctors and nearly 10,000 more nurses in the NHS compared to last year and we're committed to delivering 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament,"" it said. Many NHS trusts are currently struggling to cope amid the Omicron wave and staff shortages, and some hospitals have cancelled operations and declared critical incidents.

"This video can not be played Transport secretary says day two PCRs will be replaced by lateral flow tests The current Covid testing system for people travelling to England has ""outlived its usefulness"", Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says, as Omicron is now ""widespread and worldwide"". Ahead of a rule change later this week, he said the system - introduced to slow Omicron's spread - had ""done its part"". Pre-departure tests will end for fully vaccinated travellers and day two PCRs will be replaced by lateral flow tests. Mr Shapps said ministers would ""ensure a stable system is in place for 2022"". The shake-up, announced on Wednesday, came after travel firms said the measures were not effective now Omicron was spreading widely. What tests do I need to go on holiday? Where do I need to use a Covid passport? Pre-departure Covid travel tests to be scrapped Under the current rules in force until Friday, all fully vaccinated travellers over the age of 12 must show proof of a negative lateral flow or PCR test taken in the two days before coming to the UK. Fully vaccinated people must also pay for a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate while waiting for the result. People who aren't fully vaccinated must currently take PCR tests on both day two and day eight after arriving, and self-isolate for 10 days. But under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday:fully vaccinated travellers and under-18s will no longer need to take a pre-departure test two days before travelling to England. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but won't have to self-isolate while awaiting the result From 04:00 GMT on Sunday:they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. This test must be bought from a private provider - free NHS tests are not allowed Unvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and to self-isolate for 10 days People going abroad should continue to check the travel rules for their destination country. Scotland's health minister Humza Yousaf spoke of his ""frustration"" that the changes were announced for England only, despite UK-wide talks on what the rules should be. He said he would give an update on Thursday afternoon, while Welsh health minister Eluned Morgan said Wales would ""reluctantly"" align with England. Northern Irelandhas confirmed it will also follow suit. Meanwhile, Downing Street said it would continue to look at what it means to be ""fully vaccinated"" given what is known about waning immunity. At the moment, ""fully vaccinated"" refers to people who have had two jabs, but in Scotlandthe term is now being used,externalto mean those who have had their booster. Two doses of some vaccinesoffer almost no protection from an Omicron infection, although they should still greatly reduce the risk of needing hospital care. But a third booster prevents around 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms. Dr Sarah Pitt, virologist at the University of Brighton, said it was ""sensible"" to test people before they got on a plane, as about one in three people who have Covid do not have symptoms but can be infectious to others. ""It's not that you're a special risk from having been travelling, but people should be testing themselves regularly anyway,"" she said. Swabs from PCR tests, which are sent to labs for analysis, can show if the variant causing the infection looks like Omicron, Delta or something else. Asked whether the rule change could mean new variants are missed among people arriving from abroad, he said anyone who had a positive lateral flow test must get a PCR test via the NHS so it can be checked for new variants using sequencing techniques. Mr Shapps said the UK had a much higher level of sequencing than any other country in the world, so it was tracking new variants very carefully ""regardless of whether it starts here or somewhere else"". He warned that stricter travel measures could be reintroduced if another variant of concern emerged, andearlier tweeted,externalthat the rules would be reviewed by the end of the month. The travel industry welcomed the relaxation of the rules. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the changes would make travel ""much simpler and easier"", as customers could now book and travel with ""confidence"". Chief executive of travel association Abta, Mark Tanzer, said it was ""potentially very positive"", but that damage had ""already been done"". ""We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,"" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2, also said the timing of the announcement would make a ""huge difference"". Will the changes affect your travel plans?

"Sales of electric vehicles soared last year, but the market as a whole failed to recover from the Covid pandemic. More electric cars were registered in 2021 than in the previous five years combined, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Yet the industry body said much more investment was needed in charging infrastructure. Meanwhile, an acute lack of computer chips left dealers struggling to get hold of many new conventional models. Overall, 2021 was another dismal year for the motor industry. Preliminary figures from the SMMT show that some 1.65m cars new cars were registered. That was a small increase over 2020, when the impact of the first Covid-related lockdowns and dealer closures sent sales plummeting. But it was still the second-worst figure recorded in nearly three decades, and 28% down on its pre-pandemic level. At the beginning of the year, there was a further lockdown, while any hopes of a lasting recovery later on were dashed by a severe shortage of semiconductors - or computer chips. These are critical components in modern cars, being used in areas such as engine management and emissions control, emergency braking, airbags, entertainment systems and navigation. A modern car can use between 1,500 and 3,000 semiconductors. Tesla criticised after opening Xinjiang showroom What will happen to all the dead car batteries? Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Butoutbreaks of Covid-19 in regions where the chips are made,particularly in southeast Asia, caused factory closures that restricted supplies. The motor industry also faced intense competition for the chips that were available from other sectors, particularly the consumer electronics industry. This forced manufacturers to allocate what supplies they had to the most profitable models, as well as to those which helped them meet emissions targets - notably electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Despite the problems affecting the market as a whole, registrations of electric cars rose more than 75%, from 108,000 in 2020 to 191,000 last year. In December, they accounted for one in every four cars sold, while the second-best selling car in the country during the year was Tesla's electric Model 3. But there were significant regional differences in the take-up of electric models. London and the south east accounted for about 20% of all electric and plug-in hybrid cars registered; Wales and northern England just 10% Nevertheless, the overall trend will be welcomed by the government, which plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel powered cars by 2030, to help meet commitments on climate change. But the SMMT has warned that reductions in the value of the plug-in car grant could send out mixed messages to consumers. In December, the maximum value of the grant, which is meant to bring down the cost of an electric car, was reduced from Â£2,500 to Â£1,500, and the number of eligible models was also narrowed down. ""It's a confusing message,"" said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. ""It's a massive ambition to get the entire market to move to meet net zero by 2030/2035. We would argue you need to use every lever at your disposal."" ""Anything that brings into doubt that commitment doesn't help a consumer who might be wavering."" The industry body said it is also concerned that while electric vehicle sales are rising rapidly, the number of on-street public charging points is not increasing as quickly. ""There will be more people competing for a much more slowly increasing number of on street chargers,"" explained Mr Hawes. ""We want the user experience to be seamless, to be affordable and to be easy. And we just foresee this being one of the barriers to the consumer take-up of these vehicles that we need across the country."" But Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of the Zap Map website, which lists charging points across the country, disagreed that the rollout of new infrastructure has been too slow. ""Electric vehicles are now the norm,"" she said. ""Sales accelerated throughout 2021 and so did the public charging infrastructure. There are nearly 30,000 public chargers in the UK, an increase of more than a third since the end of 2020."" ""But we do need charging to keep growing at pace this year to make sure it is simple for the next generation of EV drivers."" What will happen to all the dead car batteries?

"World No 1 tennis star Novak Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated, has been denied entry to Australia His parents have held a press conference in which they said he was being held as a prisoner by the authorities A court hearing on deporting the Serb star has been adjourned and he remains in a Melbourne detention hotel Speaking about his rival's predicament, Rafael Nadal says the vaccine ""is the only way to stop this pandemic"" ""Everybody is free to take their own decisions, but then there are some consequences,"" he adds The WHO says the world is seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases that are overwhelming health systems around the world The UK reported 179,756 new cases on Thursday, plus 231 deaths Covid testing for people travelling to England has ""outlived its usefulness"", Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says Edited by Paul Gribben A court will decide on Monday whether Novak Djokovic will be deported from Australia We'll soon be bringing our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories. Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben and written by Alex Kleiderman, Alex Therrien, Nathan Williams, Jack Hunter, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. Italy has recorded 219,440 new Covid cases - its highest-ever daily number since the start of the pandemic. That's up on 189,109 infections recorded on Wednesday. And 177 more people have been admitted to intensive care units, up from 132 on Wednesday. As it tries to battle the surge, Italy's government has made it compulsory for over-50s to be vaccinated against Covid. Novak Djokovic's family cried foul at his treatment by Australia at a rally outside Serbia's parliament What has the reaction been in Serbia to Novak Djokovic and his attempted participation in the Australian Open tennis championships? The country's president, Aleksandar Vucic, has led a chorus of outrage in Belgrade, the scene of a rally by supporters outside the Serbian parliament. Djokovic's parents say the tennis star is being treated like a criminal as he awaits a ruling on whether he is to be deported from Australia. Read more herefrom BBC Balkans correspondent Guy Delauney. As we've been reporting, Novak Djokovic has had his visa for Australia revoked, after he was granted an exemption from Covid vaccination rules. We've taken a look at what he has actually said about vaccines: Read the full piece here. Portugal is relaxing restrictions, with children going back
to school from next week and night clubs reopening from 14 January â despite
a record Covid surge. PM Antonio Costa says it's ""evident"" Omicron is
less severe and vaccination has been ""effective"". That's why the
country has seen a ""lower number of hospitalisations, fewer people in ICU
and deaths"", he says. The country hit a daily record of nearly 40,000 infections
on Wednesday. It registered 25 deaths on Thursday, but that's far fewer
than the 300 daily deaths during the previous peak in January. A work from home order is also
being ditched from 14 January. However, people flying into Portugal will still need
to provide a negative Covid test.  Matt PreceyBBC Look East A picture obtained by the Eastern Daily Press showed how closely beds have been placed next to each other An NHS hospital has taken ""extreme measures"" to pack more beds into rooms and require patients to wear masks. An email seen by the BBC from the chief nurse at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) NHS Trust says it is a ""battle situation"". Chief nurse Prof Nancy Fontaine asked staff to fit seven beds in bays meant for six, with less space between them. She said the ""extreme measures"" had been taken as a short-term response to an ""unprecedented emergency"". Read more here. A fresh raft of Covid restrictions will be introduced in Austria from Saturday, including new rules on wearing masks in crowds outdoors. But it is also cutting the isolation time for those infected with Covid to five days if they test negative. Under the new restrictions, people will have to wear masks outside when they can't keep at least 2m (6.5ft) away from others. Chancellor Karl Nehammer says Austrians need to do everything they ""can possibly do together to
prevent another lockdown"". He says existing rules banning the unvaccinated from many public places would be more strictly enforced. Austria went into a lockdown for several weeksat the end of last year to fight a surge in cases. Infections then went down, but have been rising again recently. Newham in east London has the lowest take-up of Covid boosters or third jabs, while Cotswold in Gloucestershire has the highest, new figures suggest. The data from NHS England cover adult vaccinations delivered up to 2 January, and show just38.5%of adults got their third dose or boosted inNewham, while83%took up the offer inCotswold. The figures also estimate take-up of the extra dose was: The daily figures also show that 2,078 people were admitted into hospital across the UK. Looking at the seven-day averages behind the figures, cases are up 29.3%, deaths up 56.1% and hospital admissions up 64.7%. Elsewhere in the data, 247,478 booster vaccines were administered, along with 29,030 first jabs and 41,664 second jabs. A further 179,756 cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There were 231 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. On Wednesday 194,747 cases and 334 deaths were reported.  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned the world was facing a ""tsunami"" of cases The Omicron coronavirus variant appears to be less severe than the previously-dominant strain, Delta, but should not be categorised as ""mild"", the head of the World Health Organization has said. Speaking at a WHO briefing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that as with previous variants Omicron was hospitalising and killing people. He said the world was seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases ""so huge and quick that it is overwhelming health systems around the world"", with hospitals becoming overcrowded and understaffed. His colleague Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at the WHO, said the number of global cases has increased by 71% in the last week and by 100% in the Americas. Dr Tedros renewed the WHO's call for richer nations to share vaccines with the developing world. ""I hope global leaders who have shown such resolve in protecting their own populations will extend that resolve to make sure that the whole world is safe and protected,"" he said. Where are cases the highest around the world? Find outhere. Should
Covid restrictions return to what they were before Omicron struck? That's whata senior epidemiologist in Wales has been saying. Cardiff
University's Prof John Watkins says thanks to booster protection and evidence Omicron
is milder, the threat is no worse than that posed by Delta. Age
is the ""major risk factor for poor outcomes"", Prof Watkins says â and
that factor is being mitigated by high numbers of over-70s taking up the
booster. He
also says the Welsh government should perhaps ""realign"" with England
in terms of restrictions. Waleshas tougher rules, with restrictions on hospitality and nightclubs closed. Wales
has been seeing record Covid cases recently. But, as in the rest of the UK,numbers in hospital are nothing like as badas the previous year. The
daily number in hospital on 31 December was 544 â there were nearly four times
this number with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2020. The
Welsh government has said its current measures and guidance are proportionate. Dozens of people have gathered in front of the
Serbian parliament in central Belgrade to
show their support for Novak Djokovic. It came after the tennis star's father urged his fans to respond to Australia's decision to refuse the world number one entry to the country. Border officials said he had failed to provide adequate proof that he was medically exempt from coronavirus vaccination rules. The player, who arrived in Melbourne for the Australian Open after being granted an exemption by local officials, is being held in a government detention hotel in the city pending a court appeal. His father, Srdjan told a press conference the hotel conditions were ""terrible"", adding: ""Shame on you to do this to Novak, the best tennis player and
athlete and the best man in the world. You will not bring him to his knees, he
will fight against it. ""They could have told him not to come, and all
would be fine. No, they wanted to humiliate him."" The sign carried by this supporter of Novak Djokovic in Belgrade reads: ""They are afraid of the best one. Stop Corona fascism"" This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson calls out anti-vaccine social media posts Earlier, we heard UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticise anti-vaxxers for ""putting mumbo jumbo"" on social media. He told broadcasters this was the first time he was speaking out against anti-vax campaigners who were ""spouting complete nonsense"" about Covid vaccines. He estimated about 30% to 40% of people being treated for Covid in hospital have not been vaccinated at all, as he called on them to get jabbed. But he said he wanted to keep a âvoluntary approachâ to vaccinations in the UK, rather than âcoercionâ seen in other countries. Watch the video above for more. A bit more detail now on thatOffice for National Statistics,externalsurvey wementioned earlier. As a reminder, the survey suggests that about 1.3 million people in the UK have 'long Covid' - or symptoms lasting more than four weeks after an initial infection. Of those, 892,000 (70%) first caught the virus at least 12 weeks ago and 506,000 (40%) at least a year ago. Conducted over four weeks in November and December 2021, the study suggests, of those with long Covid:  University of Exeter senior clinical lecturer Dr David Strain says: ""The stark warning here is that, based on this, in the previous waves, over 800,000 people have their day-to-day activities significantly affected over three months after catching Covid and nearly a quarter of a million report this has a dramatic impact on their quality of life. ""As we continue to see case numbers of Omicron rise, we must be wary that our reliance purely on hospitalisations and death as a measure of the risk from Covid could grossly underestimate the public-health impact of our current Covid strategy.""

Dijana Djokovic and Srdjan Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2016 The parents of Novak Djokovic say the tennis star is being treated like a criminal as he awaits a ruling on whether he is to be deported from Australia, amid a public backlash over a vaccine exemption. Speaking to reporters from the player's restaurant in Belgrade, Djokovic's father Srdjan said the row ""has nothing to do with sport"" and was ""political"". The world number one is being held in a government detention hotel in Melbourne pending a court appeal. His mother, Dijana, said: ""They are keeping him as a prisoner, that's not human and it's not fair."" Australian Open organisers said the Serbian player, who has said he is opposed to vaccination, had been granted medical exemption by two independent medical panels organised by Tennis Australia, the body that runs the event, and Victoria state. A total of 125 passengers who arrived in the northern Indian city of Amritsar on a chartered flight from Italyhave tested positive for Covid. They will be placed in isolation, health officials said. They were among 179 passengers on the flight from Milan which landed in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon. TV pictures showed ambulances lined up outside the airport to take away the infected passengers and crowds outside the entrance gates. The news comes as Italy has announced mandatory Covid vaccination for people aged over 50 in a move to curb record high infections and ease pressure on hospitals there. Meanwhile, India reported more than 90,000 cases on Thursday - a nearly six-fold rise over the past week that experts say is fuelled by the Omicron variant. The country recorded 325 deaths in the 24 hours but only one has been linked to Omicron, officials said. Stephen McDonellChina correspondent, Beijing Xi'an's 13 million residents have been under a strict lockdown for two weeks Health officials in the locked-down city of Xi'an have been sacked following public outrage that a woman suffered a miscarriage after being denied access to a hospital due to Covid rules. Photos and video of the woman outside a hospital in Xi'an have received hundreds of millions of views on social media. She was sitting on a plastic stool, surrounded by a pool of blood. Her niece, who posted the images, said her aunt, who was eight months pregnant, had been denied entry to the hospital after her most recent Covid health test had expired just hours earlier. Strict virus measures have required Covid tests to enter buildings. Now the general manager of the Gaoxin Hospital has been suspended and those directly responsible for not letting her in have been removed from their positions. The director of Xian's health department appeared on television today to apologise. Read more about the lockdown in Xi'an here. The government has admitted the evidence for using masks in schools to reduce the spread of Covid is ""not conclusive"", following a review into the evidence for their use. This uncertainty is acknowledged in a newly published review used by ministers in England to make their decision to expand the use of face coverings for secondary school children to classrooms. The government's own study of 123 schools in England which used masks last autumn did not provide proof of a statistically significant impact, the review says. It also lays out that other studies have provided mixed results, but when taken together the evidence suggests they may help. You can read morehere. The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled early from its Christmas break amid concerns about safety in schools following a rise in Omicron cases. Members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) will meet on Monday after Sinn Fein issued the recall notice and 30 signatures were received. MLAs will debate a motion expressing support for keeping schools open, but that raises ""serious concern at the lack of planning by the Minister of Education (Michelle McIlveen) to ensure the safe reopening of schools"" amid the growth of Omicron. The motion calls on the minister to ""urgently develop a plan that puts the safety of pupils and staff first, through the installation of air monitoring and air filtration devices in all classrooms"". It also calls for McIlveen to address the staffing pressures facing the education system by ""utilising and deploying additional teaching capacity to keep schools open and safe"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"World No 1 tennis star Novak Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated, has been denied entry to Australia His parents have held a press conference in which they said he was being held as a prisoner by the authorities A court hearing on deporting the Serb star has been adjourned and he remains in a Melbourne detention hotel Speaking about his rival's predicament, Rafael Nadal says the vaccine ""is the only way to stop this pandemic"" ""Everybody is free to take their own decisions, but then there are some consequences,"" he adds The WHO says the world is seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases that are overwhelming health systems around the world The UK reported 179,756 new cases on Thursday, plus 231 deaths Covid testing for people travelling to England has ""outlived its usefulness"", Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says Edited by Paul Gribben A court will decide on Monday whether Novak Djokovic will be deported from Australia We'll soon be bringing our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a recap of the main stories. Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben and written by Alex Kleiderman, Alex Therrien, Nathan Williams, Jack Hunter, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. Italy has recorded 219,440 new Covid cases - its highest-ever daily number since the start of the pandemic. That's up on 189,109 infections recorded on Wednesday. And 177 more people have been admitted to intensive care units, up from 132 on Wednesday. As it tries to battle the surge, Italy's government has made it compulsory for over-50s to be vaccinated against Covid. Novak Djokovic's family cried foul at his treatment by Australia at a rally outside Serbia's parliament What has the reaction been in Serbia to Novak Djokovic and his attempted participation in the Australian Open tennis championships? The country's president, Aleksandar Vucic, has led a chorus of outrage in Belgrade, the scene of a rally by supporters outside the Serbian parliament. Djokovic's parents say the tennis star is being treated like a criminal as he awaits a ruling on whether he is to be deported from Australia. Read more herefrom BBC Balkans correspondent Guy Delauney. As we've been reporting, Novak Djokovic has had his visa for Australia revoked, after he was granted an exemption from Covid vaccination rules. We've taken a look at what he has actually said about vaccines: Read the full piece here. Portugal is relaxing restrictions, with children going back
to school from next week and night clubs reopening from 14 January â despite
a record Covid surge. PM Antonio Costa says it's ""evident"" Omicron is
less severe and vaccination has been ""effective"". That's why the
country has seen a ""lower number of hospitalisations, fewer people in ICU
and deaths"", he says. The country hit a daily record of nearly 40,000 infections
on Wednesday. It registered 25 deaths on Thursday, but that's far fewer
than the 300 daily deaths during the previous peak in January. A work from home order is also
being ditched from 14 January. However, people flying into Portugal will still need
to provide a negative Covid test.  Matt PreceyBBC Look East A picture obtained by the Eastern Daily Press showed how closely beds have been placed next to each other An NHS hospital has taken ""extreme measures"" to pack more beds into rooms and require patients to wear masks. An email seen by the BBC from the chief nurse at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) NHS Trust says it is a ""battle situation"". Chief nurse Prof Nancy Fontaine asked staff to fit seven beds in bays meant for six, with less space between them. She said the ""extreme measures"" had been taken as a short-term response to an ""unprecedented emergency"". Read more here. A fresh raft of Covid restrictions will be introduced in Austria from Saturday, including new rules on wearing masks in crowds outdoors. But it is also cutting the isolation time for those infected with Covid to five days if they test negative. Under the new restrictions, people will have to wear masks outside when they can't keep at least 2m (6.5ft) away from others. Chancellor Karl Nehammer says Austrians need to do everything they ""can possibly do together to
prevent another lockdown"". He says existing rules banning the unvaccinated from many public places would be more strictly enforced. Austria went into a lockdown for several weeksat the end of last year to fight a surge in cases. Infections then went down, but have been rising again recently. Newham in east London has the lowest take-up of Covid boosters or third jabs, while Cotswold in Gloucestershire has the highest, new figures suggest. The data from NHS England cover adult vaccinations delivered up to 2 January, and show just38.5%of adults got their third dose or boosted inNewham, while83%took up the offer inCotswold. The figures also estimate take-up of the extra dose was: The daily figures also show that 2,078 people were admitted into hospital across the UK. Looking at the seven-day averages behind the figures, cases are up 29.3%, deaths up 56.1% and hospital admissions up 64.7%. Elsewhere in the data, 247,478 booster vaccines were administered, along with 29,030 first jabs and 41,664 second jabs. A further 179,756 cases have been reported in the UK, according to the government's daily figures. There were 231 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. On Wednesday 194,747 cases and 334 deaths were reported.  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned the world was facing a ""tsunami"" of cases The Omicron coronavirus variant appears to be less severe than the previously-dominant strain, Delta, but should not be categorised as ""mild"", the head of the World Health Organization has said. Speaking at a WHO briefing, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that as with previous variants Omicron was hospitalising and killing people. He said the world was seeing a ""tsunami"" of cases ""so huge and quick that it is overwhelming health systems around the world"", with hospitals becoming overcrowded and understaffed. His colleague Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead at the WHO, said the number of global cases has increased by 71% in the last week and by 100% in the Americas. Dr Tedros renewed the WHO's call for richer nations to share vaccines with the developing world. ""I hope global leaders who have shown such resolve in protecting their own populations will extend that resolve to make sure that the whole world is safe and protected,"" he said. Where are cases the highest around the world? Find outhere. Should
Covid restrictions return to what they were before Omicron struck? That's whata senior epidemiologist in Wales has been saying. Cardiff
University's Prof John Watkins says thanks to booster protection and evidence Omicron
is milder, the threat is no worse than that posed by Delta. Age
is the ""major risk factor for poor outcomes"", Prof Watkins says â and
that factor is being mitigated by high numbers of over-70s taking up the
booster. He
also says the Welsh government should perhaps ""realign"" with England
in terms of restrictions. Waleshas tougher rules, with restrictions on hospitality and nightclubs closed. Wales
has been seeing record Covid cases recently. But, as in the rest of the UK,numbers in hospital are nothing like as badas the previous year. The
daily number in hospital on 31 December was 544 â there were nearly four times
this number with confirmed Covid at the same point in 2020. The
Welsh government has said its current measures and guidance are proportionate. Dozens of people have gathered in front of the
Serbian parliament in central Belgrade to
show their support for Novak Djokovic. It came after the tennis star's father urged his fans to respond to Australia's decision to refuse the world number one entry to the country. Border officials said he had failed to provide adequate proof that he was medically exempt from coronavirus vaccination rules. The player, who arrived in Melbourne for the Australian Open after being granted an exemption by local officials, is being held in a government detention hotel in the city pending a court appeal. His father, Srdjan told a press conference the hotel conditions were ""terrible"", adding: ""Shame on you to do this to Novak, the best tennis player and
athlete and the best man in the world. You will not bring him to his knees, he
will fight against it. ""They could have told him not to come, and all
would be fine. No, they wanted to humiliate him."" The sign carried by this supporter of Novak Djokovic in Belgrade reads: ""They are afraid of the best one. Stop Corona fascism"" This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson calls out anti-vaccine social media posts Earlier, we heard UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticise anti-vaxxers for ""putting mumbo jumbo"" on social media. He told broadcasters this was the first time he was speaking out against anti-vax campaigners who were ""spouting complete nonsense"" about Covid vaccines. He estimated about 30% to 40% of people being treated for Covid in hospital have not been vaccinated at all, as he called on them to get jabbed. But he said he wanted to keep a âvoluntary approachâ to vaccinations in the UK, rather than âcoercionâ seen in other countries. Watch the video above for more.

"A long-term plan to fix the staffing crisis in the NHS is needed to cut record waiting lists for treatment, the government is being warned. Currently, nearly six million people in England are waiting for routine operations and procedures - many of whom are in pain. A report from MPs says the government needs to address staff shortages - or NHS workers will quit. The government pointed to the extra Â£5.9bn allocated to tackle the issue. There have been repeated warnings over the length of hospital waiting lists in England. As of September 2021, a record 5.8 million patients were waiting for surgery - such as hip or knee replacements - with 300,000 waiting more than a year compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic. Why the NHS is struggling like never before Trusts cancel surgery as NHS Covid pressures mount Emergency patients urged to take lift to hospital 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' In the autumn Budget,the government announcedan extra Â£5.9bn for the NHS in England to help clear the backlog. This was on top ofanother funding package in Septemberto create an extra nine million checks, scans and operations. But in its report published on Thursday, the Commons health and social care select committee said the health service was hugely understaffed and was facing an ""unquantifiable challenge"" in tackling the backlog. While it welcomed the government funding, the committee said NHS England was yet to publish ""how it plans to meet its workforce requirements"", despite this being promised by Health Secretary Sajid Javid by the end of November. It said it wanted the government to draw up a recovery plan for services by April. The report said many NHS staff were feeling under pressure and could quit unless they saw the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" of more staff coming. Jeremy Hunt - the former health secretary who now chairs the committee - said the NHS was short of 93,000 workers and there was ""no sign of any plan to address this"". He described the staffing crisis as ""entirely predictable"", adding: ""The current wave of Omicron is exacerbating the problem, but we already had a serious staffing crisis, with a burnt-out workforce. ""Far from tackling the backlog, the NHS will be able to deliver little more than day-to-day firefighting unless the government wakes up to the scale of the staffing crisis facing the NHS."" Matt, Shirley and David have all been impacted by pressures on the NHS Matt Cudworth, 44, needs urgent open heart surgery, but on New Year's Eve he was told his operation - due this week - had been cancelled. ""My whole life's on hold,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He said he feels stuck in a vicious circle: ""One of the things they've said to me is 'don't get stressed, take it easy'... and yet when things like this happen you're naturally more stressed... which creates more problems."" Following successful treatment for an aggressive form of breast cancer, Shirley Cochrane was told she needed check ups every six months, but that hasn't happened and her doctor told her to ""self manage"". She said: ""When you've had cancer, the fear of it returning is massive."" She said she understood the pressures of the pandemic, but the lack of regular contact with her cancer team left her feeling ""abandoned by the NHS"". David Ibbotson has been waiting for a hip replacement for three years - and this week his operation was cancelled for the third time. He struggles with pain while walking and said: ""If I don't get it done soon the joint in the hip will get worse and worse."" Think tank The Health Foundation estimates that nearly 19,000 more nurses and more than 4,000 more doctors are needed in order to get back to the 18-week standard waiting time for treatment. The MPs also want the government to publish an independent assessment of projected staff numbers every two years. It said it had previously recommended something similar - but it had been voted down by the government. The report said without a forecast of future workforce needs it was impossible to know whether enough doctors, nurses or care staff were being trained. It said it was also concerned about the social care workforce, which has about 105,000 vacancies. Doctors have welcomed the report for highlighting the staffing crisis, with the British Medical Association saying it ""clearly lays out what a gargantuan challenge the NHS faces"". ""The biggest barrier to tackling the backlog caused by the pandemic is a severe staffing crisis and our calls for improved workforce planning have thankfully been heard. It's now time for the government to listen too."" The Royal College of Surgeons said the main issue right now was that more than one in 10 NHS staff members were at home ill or self-isolating. It said it supported the committee's call for independent workforce projections, including an assessment of whether enough staff are being trained. And Minesh Patel, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""After years of failing to deliver the long-term funding and planning the NHS needs, the government must now urgently commit the resources required to support and grow the cancer workforce, so that it can tackle the backlog and provide urgent cancer care to everyone who needs it."" The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement that, alongside the Â£5.9bn, it was investing Â£36bn over three years on checks, scans and for patients. ""We have over 5,100 doctors and nearly 10,000 more nurses in the NHS compared to last year and we're committed to delivering 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament,"" it said. Many NHS trusts are currently struggling to cope amid the Omicron wave and staff shortages, and some hospitals have cancelled operations and declared critical incidents.

"The RAC has accused petrol retailers of ripping off motorists by refusing to pass on wholesale price cuts. The motoring organisation said unleaded petrol fell by 2p a litre, but should have come down by 12p. It estimated drivers were overcharged by Â£5m a day in December as retailers made an average of 16p a litre on petrol instead of the normal 6p. The Petrol Retailers Association objected, saying drivers were likely to have benefited more than that. ""December was a rotten month for drivers as they were taken advantage of by retailers,"" said the RAC's fuel spokesman, Simon Williams. In the past, he said, retailers had always reduced pump prices when wholesale prices dropped. ""This time they've stood strong, taking advantage of all the media talk about 'higher energy prices' and banked on the oil price rising again and catching up with their artificially inflated prices, which it has now done,"" Mr Williams said. Retailers make shocking petrol profit, says RAC Petrol prices hit record high, says RAC Why it's the end of the road for petrol stations But Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said: ""December's pump price data is less reliable because it is taken from fuel card transactions, and there have been far fewer of these transactions because of the reduction in business activity between Christmas and New Year."" He said the retail fuel market remained ""extremely competitive"" and said supermarkets did not use artificially low fuel prices to lure shoppers into their stores at Christmas. ""The costs of running petrol stations rose all year, with electricity up 19%, vastly reduced margins from fuel cards, increased national insurance and wage inflation,"" he added. The RAC said unleaded dropped from 147.47p a litre to 145.48p, when drivers should have seen prices nearer to 135p. Diesel dropped by just under 2p a litre from 150.80p to 148.92p, when drivers should have been paying about 142p, it said. The RAC's data suggested that the price of a litre of unleaded on the wholesale market, including delivery, averaged 106p across December. It said that had a 6p margin been taken by retailers, drivers would have seen an average petrol pump price of around 135p after applying VAT at 20%. The average wholesale cost of delivered diesel was 112p a litre which, with the usual 6p retailer margin, would have given a pump price of about 142p. ""This means it has cost petrol car drivers Â£6 more to fill up a typical 55-litre family car than it should have (Â£80 v Â£74) and for diesel nearly Â£4 more, with a tank costing Â£82 at the end of the month instead of Â£78,"" the RAC said.. It estimated retailers' refusal to reflect lower wholesale prices at the pumps cost petrol car drivers Â£156m in December, or the equivalent of Â£5m a day. Howard Cox, founder of campaigning group FairFuelUK, called for the government to create an independent pricing watchdog. ""If gas, electricity, water and telecoms get price protection bodies, why shouldn't motorists have one too?"" he said. He said that if prices at the pumps were ""honest and transparent and open to scrutiny"", inflation could fall by as much as 1%. ""Pump prices should be 10p lower per litre if the actual wholesale price falls had been passed on honestly."" ""Sadly, the government's efforts to work with the fuel industry so that pump prices are competitive, and market driven, ensuring consumers benefit from lower prices, is not working,"" said MP Craig Mackinlay, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Fuel for Motorists and Hauliers.

""My whole life's on hold,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He said he feels stuck in a vicious circle: ""One of the things they've said to me is 'don't get stressed, take it easy'... and yet when things like this happen you're naturally more stressed... which creates more problems."" Following successful treatment for an aggressive form of breast cancer, Shirley Cochrane was told she needed check ups every six months, but that hasn't happened and her doctor told her to ""self manage"". She said: ""When you've had cancer, the fear of it returning is massive."" She said she understood the pressures of the pandemic, but the lack of regular contact with her cancer team left her feeling ""abandoned by the NHS"". David Ibbotson has been waiting for a hip replacement for three years - and this week his operation was cancelled for the third time. He struggles with pain while walking and said: ""If I don't get it done soon the joint in the hip will get worse and worse."" Think tank The Health Foundation estimates that nearly 19,000 more nurses and more than 4,000 more doctors are needed in order to get back to the 18-week standard waiting time for treatment. The MPs also want the government to publish an independent assessment of projected staff numbers every two years. It said it had previously recommended something similar - but it had been voted down by the government. The report said without a forecast of future workforce needs it was impossible to know whether enough doctors, nurses or care staff were being trained. It said it was also concerned about the social care workforce, which has about 105,000 vacancies. Doctors have welcomed the report for highlighting the staffing crisis, with the British Medical Association saying it ""clearly lays out what a gargantuan challenge the NHS faces"". ""The biggest barrier to tackling the backlog caused by the pandemic is a severe staffing crisis and our calls for improved workforce planning have thankfully been heard. It's now time for the government to listen too."" The Royal College of Surgeons said the main issue right now was that more than one in 10 NHS staff members were at home ill or self-isolating. It said it supported the committee's call for independent workforce projections, including an assessment of whether enough staff are being trained. And Minesh Patel, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""After years of failing to deliver the long-term funding and planning the NHS needs, the government must now urgently commit the resources required to support and grow the cancer workforce, so that it can tackle the backlog and provide urgent cancer care to everyone who needs it."" The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement that, alongside the Â£5.9bn, it was investing Â£36bn over three years on checks, scans and for patients. ""We have over 5,100 doctors and nearly 10,000 more nurses in the NHS compared to last year and we're committed to delivering 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament,"" it said. Many NHS trusts are currently struggling to cope amid the Omicron wave and staff shortages, and some hospitals have cancelled operations and declared critical incidents.

"Campaigners had expected Huddersfield's George Hotel to become the home of a new national museum A council has come under fire after making ""a shameful decision"" to axe plans for a National Rugby League Museum in the game's birthplace. Campaigners had expected Huddersfield's George Hotel - where the breakaway competition was established in 1895 - to become the home of a new museum. But Kirklees Council said the venue would not be ""financially viable"" without an ongoing cost to residents. The council has proposed accommodating the museum elsewhere in the town.

"This video can not be played Watch: Officer Harry Dunn is still traumatised by the attack on the Capitol President Joe Biden will blame Donald Trump for the US Capitol riot as he marks the anniversary of the attack on the seat of American democracy. Speaking at Congress, Mr Biden will say his predecessor holds ""singular responsibility"" for the ""chaos and carnage"", said spokeswoman Jen Psaki. Investigators have so far arrested 725 suspects in connection with the attack. Trump supporters stormed the building as Congress was meeting to certify Mr Biden's presidential election victory. Images of US lawmakers cowering from the mob in the gallery of the House of Representatives on that afternoon of 6 January 2021 shocked the world. Mr Trump had urged protesters at a rally outside the White House shortly beforehand to ""peacefully"" march on Congress, but he also exhorted them to ""fight"" and stirred up the crowd with unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud in the election he had just lost. The former president had planned to host a competing news conference on Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort home in Palm Beach, Florida. But he cancelled the event after aides reportedly warned of negative press coverage. A spokesman for Mr Trump, Taylor Budowich, said it was ""unsurprising"" that Mr Biden would spend the day ""trying to further divide our nation"" in an attempt to distract voters from rising inflation and crime and coronavirus school closures. This video can not be played 'A nation in decline' - how the world saw the Capitol riot President Biden - who rarely mentions his predecessor - will speak on Thursday morning in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters. The White House press secretary said the president's speech ""will lay out the significance of what happened at the Capitol, and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw"". ""He will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president - in an attempt to mislead the American people, and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened,"" she added. ""President Biden has been clear-eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy,"" Ms Psaki continued. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will preside over a moment of silence at noon on the chamber floor. An inquiry into the riot is being conducted by a House committee, which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats. The panel is chasing phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed light on events leading up to the attack on Congress. They have issued legal summonses to members of Mr Trump's inner circle. What happened to these Capitol rioters? Five big questions about Trump and the riot Senior Republicans will mostly be outside of Washington on Thursday, with the party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, heading a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr McConnell said in the immediate aftermath of the riot that Mr Trump was ""practically and morally responsible"". Some Republican lawmakers have portrayed the invasion of Congress, in which rioters engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police, as a peaceful protest that was spoiled by a few troublemakers. But conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was lambasted on the right on Wednesday after he labelled the riot ""a violent terrorist attack"". This video can not be played US Rapper Nick Nittoli shares his thoughts on QAnon and the US Capitol riots âSo embarrassedâ US Attorney General Merrick Garland gave an update on the FBI inquiry on the eve of the anniversary, calling the law enforcement operation ""one of the largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations in our history"". ""The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last,"" he said. ""We will follow the facts wherever they lead because 6 January was an unprecedented attack on the seat of our democracy."" He said 140 police officers had been assaulted, including one who was beaten and zapped repeatedly with a stun gun until he had a heart attack. Another screamed for help as rioters crushed him between doors and bludgeoned him with his own weapon, said the attorney general. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol Mr Garland is facing pressure from the left to prosecute the rioters more aggressively, as well as charge the former president himself and his allies. ""We build investigations by laying a foundation,"" Mr Garland said. ""We resolve more straightforward cases first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more complex cases."" Most of the charges so far have been misdemeanours that often entail no jail time in the event of a conviction. These suspects have been charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct, parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building, and obstructing congressional proceedings.Â Who stormed the Capitol? Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded But 325 suspects are facing felonies - more serious counts - such as using a dangerous weapon to assault officers. Mr Garland said 300,000 tips had been submitted by private citizens, and the FBI were still hunting about 2,500 suspects.Â One rioter, an unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt, was shot by an officer while trying to breach the House chamber. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died a day later of natural causes after suffering two strokes while defending the building, according to medical officials. In an opinion piece for the New York Times,externalon Wednesday, the oldest-living former US President, Jimmy Carter, warned that the country ""now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss"". ""Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy. Americans must set aside differences and work together before it is too late."" A week after the riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the House for incitement of insurrection, but acquitted by the Senate, which was then controlled by his fellow Republicans. He is still seen as holding sway over the party. Of 10 Republicans who sided with Democrats in the lower chamber vote, two have resigned amid death threats, three others are facing Trump-backed election challenges, and four more have kept a low profile. Wyoming's Liz Cheney was stripped of her Republican leadership position in the House, but is spearheading the congressional inquiry into the Capitol riot. National divisions over the invasion of Congress are underscored by BBC interviews with American voters. James Clark, 69, a life-long Republican voter in Virginia, said: ""It was truly shocking. President Trump seemed intent on burning down the house before leaving Washington."" But Trump voter Keri Smith, 42, of Texas, argued that the Black Lives Matter protests were worse. ""We've seen stuff crazier than that happening on a weekly basis for the past two years,"" she said. Laura Powers, a disaffected Republican, says she is ""still horrified"" by what she watched on TV that day. ""It was a horrible, dark day for democracy and it should never ever happen again,"" she said. The riot has been described as the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812. It is not the only such attack since that era. In 1983 a female-led communist group bombed the US Senate. No-one was injured. One of the co-defendants in that attack had her sentence in another case commuted by US President Bill Clinton. What happened on 6 January at the Capitol riot?

"On 6 January, 2021, people around the United States were shocked by images coming from the US Capitol. The pictures - many of which were captured by news agency photojournalists on hand to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's electoral win - depicted rioters trespassing in government offices, or roaming the Senate chamber, or assaulting police officers. This week, a House of Representatives select committee set up to investigate the events will begin public hearings aimed at piecing together what happened and who can be held accountable. While the committee can refer cases for prosecution, it is up to the Justice Department to determine if charges are actually filed. But for many of the rioters, the snaps taken that day have already come back to haunt them. To date, more than 810  have been arrested in nearly every US state and Washington DC. More than 60 so far have been sentenced to incarceration, with US officials vowing that more prosecutions are likely in the future. Investigators are seeking public help in identifying over 350 rioters, including 250 suspected of attacking police officers. Here are five of the most iconic pictures of rioters and what's happened to them since 6 January. Among the most widely shared images was that of Jacob Anthony Chansley, a 34-year old who referred to himself as the ""QAnon Shaman"". An ardent Trump supporter, Chansley was pictured wearing horns and a bearskin headdress during the riot, quickly becoming one of the most recognisable figures from the siege. Chansley was arrested just days after the riot. In November, he was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his involvement, in addition to 36 months of supervised release. In court, Chansley said he now believes it was ""wrong"" to enter the Capitol and that he hopes to ""evolve"". His sentence is one of the longest so far doled out to 6 January rioters. He is currently being held in a low-security federal prison in Arizona. Another rioter, 36-year-old Florida resident Adam Johnson, was famously pictured walking - wearing a Trump beanie - between guide ropes meant for tours at the Capitol. He was carrying a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House and posed in front of a painting depicting the surrender of British General John Burgoyne in the American Revolutionary War. Johnson, who was dubbed ""Podium Guy"" by social media users in the wake of the riot, was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and theft of government property just days later. In November, Johnson pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building. The other charges were dropped by prosecutors in exchange for a guilty plea. Additionally, Johnson - who has expressed interest in writing a book - agreed to hand over any publishing profits to the government for a five-year period. Early this year, he was sentenced to 75 days in prison and was also fined $5,000 (Â£3,996). Ahead of his prison sentence, Johnson reportedly planned to host an ""Adam is going to prison"" party at a Florida restaurant. The event was eventually cancelled by the venue. ""Come help me celebrate my last Friday of freedom before I go to prison for the lamest charge in history,"" a Facebook page for the event read. Another Trump supporter, Richard Barnett, was pictured sitting with one boot on a desk in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The image of Mr Barnett - dressed in a baseball cap and chequered shirt - went viral, as did pictures of the notes he and others left on Mrs Pelosi's desk. Mr Barnett now faces multiple charges in connection with the riot, including obstruction of an official proceeding, entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and in April rejected the government's offer of a plea deal. He is currently not in jail. Mr Barnett's trial is scheduled to begin on 6 September. A fourth rioter, Kevin Seefried, was photographed holding a Confederate battle flag while walking through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Mr Seefried and his son, Hunter, were arrested a week after the riot and hit with multiple charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol Grounds. The father-son duo is scheduled to begin a bench trial - in which their culpability will be determined by a judge, rather than a jury - on 13 June. Aaron Mostofsky, a Trump supporter, in the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 The son of a prominent and politically connected New York City judge, Aaron Mostofsky was famously pictured wearing a fur pelt as a ""caveman"" and holding a police riot shield and wooden stick inside the US Capitol during the 6 January riot. He told the New York Post he felt that supporters of President Trump ""were cheated"" in the election. ""I don't think 75 million people voted for Trump - I think it was close to 85 million,"" he told the newspaper. ""I think certain states that have been red for a long time turned blue and were stolen, like New York."" Mostofsky was arrested in New York six days after the riot and charged with multiple offences, including theft of government property, assaulting or impeding officers and disorderly conduct. In February, he pleaded guilty to one felony charge of civil disorder, as well as several misdemeanor charges. Three months later, he was sentenced to eight months in prison followed by 12 months of supervised release, including 200 hours of community service and $2,000 (Â£1,600) restitution.

"Trump told his supporters to march on the Capitol at a 'Stop the Steal' rally on 6 January It has been exactly a year since a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory. The most comprehensive account of the events leading up to and during that day is still ongoing, the focus of a special House of Representatives committee set up for that purpose. Established in a contentious 1 July House vote after attempts to create an independent inquiry failed, the committee - made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans - has conducted more than 250 interviews and issued at least 45 subpoenas over the course of its investigation. According to committee members, most of those contacted have agreed to co-operate. A handful of those closest to Donald Trump, however, have resisted. They've cited executive privilege, a legal principle that protects candid communications between presidents and their advisers. Two so far, Trump confidante Steve Bannon and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, have been cited for contempt of Congress by the House. Bannon is facing a criminal trial next year. As its investigatory work - and legal battles - continue, there are a number of gaps and key questions that the committee is seeking to address. Here are a few of the most pressing ones. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the congressional investigation, recently set out some of what his committee is trying to learn about the Washington DC rallies that served as a precursor to the attack on the Capitol. ""We need to know who organised, planned, paid for and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organisers had with officials in the White House and Congress,"" he said. One of those organisers, far-right conservative activist Ali Alexander, has already testified to the committee â and said he was in touch with the White House and Republican members of Congress ahead of time. The exact nature of these contacts have yet to be publicly revealed. Alexander's public opening statement during his committee deposition laid some of the blame for the day on the leaders of Women for America First, which organised the event near the White House at which Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol. He said they did little to tamp down the violence and may have been at a hotel a block from the White House, ""drinking champagne"" when the Capitol was attacked. The activities at that hotel, the Willard Intercontinental, have been of particular interest to the congressional committee. Steve Bannon, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump confidant Roger Stone were a few of the prominent names linked to hotel gatherings. The committee indicated in its contempt of Congress resolution that it believes Bannon had direct contact with Trump about the 6 January rally on at least one occasion. And Jones said that the White House asked him to lead the march to the Capitol. Right-wing radio host Alex Jones addressed the crowd ahead of the riot After weeks of calls, tweets and unsuccessful legal battles, Trump set his sights on 6 January as the pivotal day that would determine whether he could successfully overturn the results of the election. ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,"" he tweeted on 19 December. ""Be there, will be wild!"" He followed that up 11 days later with another tweet: ""JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!"" According to a report by the Washington Post, there was ample evidence that right-wing militant groups were preparing to travel to the Capitol on 6 January and that they were taking their guidance from the president's public statements. Federal law enforcement and the US military, however, were reluctant to make extensive moves to prepare, for fear of drawing the president's attention â and ire. A suggestion by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley to lock down the capital city was dismissed as being too provocative. Milley, according to the Post, was also concerned military forces dispatched to Washington could receive countermanding orders from the president. On 5 January, Bannon said on his podcast, recorded at the Willard Hotel, that a ""revolution"" was coming and ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow"". That same evening, Trump â after reportedly hearing the growing crowds of supporters gathered outside the White House â tweeted: ""Washington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore!"" Several of the rally organisers, according to a report by the investigative journalism website ProPublica, were concerned that 6 January might turn violent â and the march from the White House to the Capitol was of particular concern. Trump supporters march from the White House to the Capitol ""A last-minute march, without a permit, without all the metro police that'd usually be there to fortify the perimeter, felt unsafe,"" Dustin Stockton, one of the White House rally organisers who has been subpoenaed by the committee, told ProPublica. Stockton wanted these concerns passed along to the White House, something he says he was assured took place. During his White House speech, however, Trump specifically encouraged rally attendees to head to the Capitol. He said they should do so ""peacefully and patriotically,"" but at other points told them to ""fight like hell"". One protester was shot by police while trying to enter the floor of the House of Represenatitves Ever since the days of Richard Nixon, presidential scandals have been defined by two questions. What did the president know, and when did he know it? Those are still relevant in the Capitol attack investigation, but there's also a third: What did the president do once he knew? A big chunk of the committee's investigation has been trying to piece together the president's activities on 6 January â before, during and after the attack. It's why the committee has engaged in a protracted legal battle to obtain documents â call and meeting logs, notes and speech drafts â from the National Archives related to that day. Already there are some details about the pressure the president was under to respond more forcefully when the Capitol came under attack. Republican Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler has recounted how Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy phoned the president and urged him to call off the attackers. When the president demurred, the conversation devolved into an obscenity-laden shouting match. Republican Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville also spoke with the president and told him things were not going ""very good"", adding that he and Vice-President Mike Pence were being evacuated from the Capitol. ""I know we've got problems,"" Trump replied. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows provided the investigating committee with text messages and emails he received from conservative television personalities and members of the president's own family, urging him to get the president to make a public address and take more action to stop the violence. ""He has to lead now,"" Donald Trump Jr wrote. ""It has gone too far and gotten out of hand."" ""I'm pushing it hard,"" Meadows replied. The battle at the Capitol went on for hours The president's actions, however, are the big black hole in the middle of the investigation. If Meadows pushed, how did the president respond? There are reports that the president spent most of the afternoon watching television in his private White House dining room. The committee has subpoenaed White House officials who may have been around the president that day and is currently in a legal fight over government records that may help to fill in some of that black hole. On the morning of 6 January, US Park Police were already clashing with pro-Trump protestors at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Officers were directed to stand back and ""monitor only"". After the Stop the Steal rally and Trump's speech urging the crowd to march to the Capitol, the violence escalated. Pro-Trump rioters attacked police around the Capitol and forced their way into the building, eventually occupying the Senate chamber and ransacking the offices of congressional leaders. Shortly before the rioters entered the Capitol itself, Major General William Walker, commander of the DC National Guard, made a request to acting Secretary of Defence Christopher Miller for permission to deploy his forces to handle the crisis. That authorisation wouldn't reach Walker for more than two hours, and National Guard soldiers would not arrive in numbers at the Capitol until an hour after that. A US Marine guards the White House West Wing on 6 January The committee is looking for further evidence of communication between the Capitol and the Pentagon and contact, if any, between the Pentagon and top White House officials, including the president. The Capitol attack represented a stunning lapse of security in a seat of US governmental power, and there's still no clear idea who bears the most responsibility. One of the more remarkable revelations in the approximately 9,000 documents former Trump Chief-of-Staff Meadows turned over to the congressional committee before he stopped co-operating were emails about a 36-page PowerPoint presentation that circulated in the White House and among congressional Republicans. The exact author of the document has yet to be determined, but it contains many familiar and long-since invalidated claims of election fraud. What is extraordinary about it, however, is the scope of its recommendations. It suggested the president declare a national state of emergency, discard all electronically tabulated ballots and put a federalised National Guard in charge of overseeing a hand recount of paper ballots in key states. Such steps would have no precedent in US history. The committee is also looking into reports that the president was pressuring his own Justice Department to declare the election corrupt, telling senior officials, according to notes taken by one of the participants, that they should ""just say the election was corrupt (and) leave the rest to me and the (Republican) congressman"". On 3 January, the president reportedly contemplated forcing the resignation of acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replacing him with Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general who had already drafted a letter to election officials Georgia suggesting that Biden's win was fraudulent and calling on them to declare Trump the rightful winner. The president backed down after Rosen and other Justice Department officials threatened to resign en masse. Clark has so far refused to co-operate with the 6 January inquiry and could be the next individual cited for contempt of Congress. Vice-President Mike Pence was the final target of Trump's pressure â and key members of his staff are currently co-operating with the congressional investigation. The committee is seeking to learn more about a White House meeting the two had on 4 January with John Eastman, a Chapman University law professor who believed Pence could throw out state results and declare Trump the president or, at the very least, delay certification of the results until Republican-controlled legislatures could move to support Trump. According to news reports, the pressure to discard the election results continued into the evening of 6 January, with Eastman informing Pence's legal counsel that there was still time for him to refuse to certify Biden's victory, even with the Capitol still full of lingering teargas fumes and broken glass from the day's violence.

"The rules on testing are to be eased for people travelling to England, the government has announced, following calls from the travel industry. From 04:00 GMT on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers coming to England will no longer have to take a test before they travel. And from Sunday, rather than taking a PCR test on day two of arrival, they can take a cheaper lateral flow. The rules for self-isolating on arrival will also change. The shake-up was confirmed by Boris Johnson earlier, following calls from travel firms who said the measures were not effective now that Omicron was spreading widely. Under the current rules in force until Friday, all fully-vaccinated travellers over the age of 12 must show proof of a negative test lateral flow or PCR test taken in the two days before coming to the UK. Fully vaccinated people must also pay for a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate while waiting for the result. People who aren't fully vaccinated must currently take PCR tests on both day two and day eight after arriving, and self-isolate for 10 days. But under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday 7 January, people who are fully vaccinated and those aged under-18 will no longer need to take a test two days before travelling to England from countries outside the UK and the Common Travel Area. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but they will no longer have to self-isolate while awaiting the result From 04:00 GMT on Sunday 9 January they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. But this test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests are not allowed Unvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pre-departure test ""discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense"". The announcement comes after airlines said passenger testing was making no real impact, with data last week suggesting one in 25 people in England had the virus. They also said compulsory testing had held back the sector's recovery. Mr Johnson met his cabinet earlier and alongside changes to travel tests, the governmenthas said it will ease Covid testing rulesfor people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson said he hoped the country could ""ride out"" the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed. That rule change will come into force on 11 January and apply to England only for now. Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: ""I have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK."" Currently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK. They then have to take another test - which this time must be a PCR test - within the first two days after their arrival in the UK. But at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 - and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid. But UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant - so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to ""keep out Omicron"". Read more. John Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights. ""I'm frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,"" he told the BBC. Mr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid Â£212 each for PCR testing. However, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around Â£30 per person and wasn't worth the added worry about new variants. ""It's bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,"" he said, adding that it would ""worsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life"". David Hughes will save around Â£800 However, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around Â£400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another Â£400. ""Having returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we'll be returning to the UK Covid free,"" he told the BBC. Cancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added. In response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA - The Travel Association, said the two announcements were ""potentially very positive"" for the travel sector, but that damage had ""already been done"". ""We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,"" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a ""huge difference"". Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing ""exponentially"" after the rule change. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a ""critical booking window"" for the industry. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"", as customers could now book and travel with ""confidence"". The trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. UK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Will Omicron stall airlines' recovery in 2022? Ahead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron. It said that passenger numbers at MAG's airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced. Tim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC's Today programme the research showed there was a ""basis for taking out all tests"" related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK. ""We are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn't be doing it and we should take those measures out,"" he added. Separately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: ""With so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it's likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.""

"Campaigners had expected Huddersfield's George Hotel to become the home of a new national museum A council has come under fire after making ""a shameful decision"" to axe plans for a National Rugby League Museum in the game's birthplace. Campaigners had expected Huddersfield's George Hotel - where the breakaway competition was established in 1895 - to become the home of a new museum. But Kirklees Council said the venue would not be ""financially viable"" without an ongoing cost to residents. The council has proposed accommodating the museum elsewhere in the town. Peter McBride, cabinet member for regeneration at the authority, said: ""With the impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry, we have had to give careful consideration of our investments on behalf of local taxpayers. ""But Huddersfield is the birthplace of rugby league and the sport is an essential part of our heritage. That's why we're offering to give a home to the museum as part ofour major regeneration plansin the heart of the town,"" he added. A plaque outside the hotel details its unique links to the origins of rugby league It comes after Huddersfield fought off bids from Bradford, Leeds and Wigan in 2020 to win the right to host the museum. Supporters argued The George Hotel had been central to the town's winning bid. According tothe Local Democracy Reporting Service, Andrew Cooper, the leader of the green group on the council, said: ""This was a competitive process which Kirklees won against other towns on the basis of the museum being based in the George Hotel. ""Kirklees [Council] has acted in poor faith by reneging on this agreement and now risks losing the rugby league museum from the town where the sport was created,"" he added. The hotel, close to the town's railway station, closed in 2013, and was bought by the council. It is currently undergoing renovations.

"Vodafone is delaying the reintroduction of roaming charges in Europe by three weeks. The phone network had planned to bring in post-Brexit roaming fees on 6 January, matching other networks that plan to do so in 2022. But it said more time was needed for testing, and the change will now come in at the end of January. EE has also delayed resuming its roaming charges, which were planned for January, until March. Before the UK left the EU, users were able to use their calls, texts, and data allowance in their mobile plans in any EU country. But the EU trade deal of December 2020 gave mobile operators the option of reintroducing charges. The Three network has also said it will bring in roaming charges between the UK and Europe, though their change is planned for May 2022. That means that of the largest mobile networks, only O2 has not announced any plans for the reintroduction of roaming fees. Mobile roaming charges: What you need to know Three to bring in Europe roaming charges Explaining the reason for delaying its planned changes, Vodafone said it was not ready to bring in the new system. ""We have pushed back the introduction of roaming charges to the end of January, giving time for further testing to ensure the best possible experience for customers purchasing our Â£1 per day bundles. Until then, customers will continue to be able to roam without charges."" The Â£1 a day charge is Vodafone's best price, and only applies when bought in an eight or 15-day bundle. The usual planned price is Â£2 per day in fees, matching EE and Three's planned pricing. EE said the shift in its plans was caused by unspecified technical delays. ""Making big changes to billing systems in mobile phone networks is always risky,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight and founder of the Mobile Phone Museum. ""The backlash and negative publicity for any network operator that does not get it right would be immense if a customer ended up with an eye-watering roaming bill. ""My guess is that rather than rushing out a change, the operators are delaying the introduction to be absolutely sure everything is working. ""Given the current Covid situation it's not like lots of people are travelling, so the operators are not going to be massively exposed on unexpected roaming costs.""
