"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"If you are planning a holiday in a country in the European Union (EU), you might be wondering whether your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) will still be valid. As part of the deal announced on 24 December 2020, the UK and the EU agreed that the cards can still be used until their expiry dates. After that, the government will issuea new Global Heath Insurance Card(GHIC) which will replace the EHIC for the majority of UK citizens. What is an EHIC? The EHIC currently entitles you to state-provided medical treatment if you fall ill or have an accident in any EU country, or in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, where the scheme also applies. The same applies to EU citizens who are in the UK. The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions and routine maternity care, as well as emergency care. Individuals with chronic illnesses, for example those who require dialysis, can travel knowing they will receive treatment on the same terms as the citizens of the country they are visiting. The UK has issued27 million EHIC cards.,external The cards are valid until they expire. They last five years and the expiry date is printed on the front. You can no longer apply for a new EHIC. If your EHIC has expired (or is about to), you should apply for its replacement -the new UK GHIC,external. It will cover chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care as well as emergencies, but treatments such as dialysis or chemotherapy will have to be pre-arranged to ensure they are available at your destination. The GHIC will not be valid in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland. The government website says that the GHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. It advises that you should also buy travel insurance which includes health cover as the GHIC  - like the EHIC - does not cover any private medical healthcare such as mountain rescue in ski resorts or being flown back to the UK. The easiest was to get one is by usingthe GHIC online application form,external. You should apply about two weeks before your EHIC expires, as the new card usually arrives within 10 days, according to the government website. UK students who are planning to study in an EU country won't be able to use the online application. They'll have to send theirapplication by post,external, together with a letter from their UK university, in order to apply for a GHIC that's time limited to the length of their course. You will also have to apply by post if you are not a British or Irish citizen, and must attach your visa or residence permit. EU nationals (as well as citizens of Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) who were living in the UK before the end of 2020, will be able to continue using the NHS for their healthcare while resident here. They are also entitled to apply fora new UK-issued EHIC card,external. Their new EHIC will be valid in the EU along with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. An estimated 3.7 million EU nationals lived in the UK in 2019,external, making up 5.6% of the UK population. UK state pensioners who were in the EU before the end of 2020, UK students who had started a course in an EU country before then and so-called ""frontier workers"" (people who work in one state and live in another) will all also be able to apply for a new UK-issued EHIC card. Their rights are guaranteed by the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, which iswritten into UK law. The same agreement guarantees the rights of UK nationals who were resident in the EU before the end of 2020. They will be able to continue using their EU-issued EHIC card when travelling within the EU. The UK hasreciprocal health deals,externalwith a few non-EU countries, including Australia and New Zealand, under which visitors can receive urgent treatment at a reduced cost or for free. In other words, visitors are treated as if they are resident of the country in question. But unlike the EHIC, the agreements do not cover pre-existing conditions.

"Virgin Media O2 has announced it will not start charging Virgin Mobile or O2 customers extra for using their phones in Europe. Three, EE and Vodafone are all reintroducing roaming fees for customers travelling to the EU. Between 2017 and the end of 2020, UK consumers were able, within reason, to use the minutes, texts and data included on their mobile phone tariffs when travelling in the EU. But since January 2021, UK operators have been allowed to reintroduce so-called roaming charges because the UK left the EU and theBrexit trade dealdid not rule them out. None of the networks will be charging for roaming in the Republic of Ireland. From 23 May 2022, Three customers who have signed up or upgraded from October 2021 will have to pay Â£2 a day to use the minutes and data from their UK contracts in EU countries. It is also introducing a Â£5 a day charge for roaming in some countries outside the EU, where it previously allowed free roaming. EE will also be charging Â£2 a day in Europe. It will introduce the charges in January 2022 for customers who joined or upgraded their contracts after 7 July 2021. There will be 30-day packages available for people travelling for longer periods. Vodafone has three types of tariff: Its cheapest sim-only deals do not allow any use apart from emergency calls outside the UK and Ireland Some of its more expensive Xtra plans include roaming at no extra charge The rest of its tariffs offer roaming for Â£2 a day. Eight-day and 15-day passes are available for Â£1 a day. EE to reintroduce Europe roaming charges Vodafone to bring back roaming charges from January Three brings in EU roaming charges Virgin Mobile and O2 users will not face EU roaming charges All four of the big operators previously said they had no plans to introduce roaming charges. Whether or not your operator is imposing extra charges, there are ""fair use limits"" on the amount of time that customers will be allowed to use their phones abroad. UK customers have been told that their operators will charge extra if they spend more than half their time overseas, generally measured by being in another country for more than 62 days in a four-month period. That could have happened while the UK was still part of the EU, but some operators have only just started enforcing it. Similarly, data limits are also subject to fair use restrictions. Customers of O2 have a monthly data limit of 25GB and will be charged Â£3.50 for each GB after that. Vodafone's limit is also 25GB with a Â£3.13 charge per GB after that. Three has cut its fair use limit from 20GB a month to 12GB and will charge Â£3 per GB above that. The planned Â£2-a-day fees are still relatively small compared with the costs customers had to pay before the EU banned roaming charges. In the past some people returned from European trips to face bills for hundreds or even thousands of pounds. The UK's trade deal,externalwith the EU said that both sides would encourage operators to have ""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. The UK government also passed legislation to provide some safeguards for consumers: A Â£45-a-month limit on the amount they could be charged for using mobile data abroad before having to opt into further use Requirements for customers to be informed when they have reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Operators also have to take ""reasonable steps"" to avoid customers being charged for accidental roaming in Northern Ireland, which could happen if a phone there locked on to a mobile signal coming from the Republic of Ireland Without the EU rules in place, the charges levied depend on agreements between UK operators and their counterparts in EU countries. Both sides may have seen this as an opportunity to make some money both from UK customers visiting EU countries and EU customers coming to the UK. The four main operators in the UK declined to comment on the commercial deals they have with other operators. The UK governmentrecommends that customers check the details of their individual tariff,externalwith their phone operator before travelling.

"This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" Two men have told the BBC they were abused hundreds of times by Michael Jackson, from the ages of seven and 10. Wade Robson, 36, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the singer had sexually abused him from the age of seven and tried to rape him when he was 14. James Safechuck, 40, told the programme Jackson had sexually abused him ""from the age of 10 until around 14"". Jackson's family say there's ""not one piece of evidence"" to prove the claims. The two men have also spoken out in the documentary Leaving Neverland. Asked if the abuse had occurred ""hundreds and hundreds of times"", both Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck agreed that this had been the case. Mr Robson told the programme: ""Every time I was with him, every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me."" Jackson had fondled him, ""touching my entire body"", and made him watch the singer performing a sex act, he said. And then, when he was 14, Jackson had tried to rape him. ""That was one of the last sexual abuse experiences we had,"" Mr Robson told the programme. In Leaving Neverland, Wade Robson (pictured) says Jackson sexually abused him in the 1990s Jackson had groomed him to believe they ""loved each other - and this is how we show our love"", he said. ""And then he would immediately follow that up with, 'But If anybody else ever found out what we are doing, you and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives and our lives would fall apart,' he and I would fall apart,"" Mr Robson told the programme. ""All of this was terrifying to me. ""The idea of being pulled away from Michael - this man, this other-worldly figure, this god to me who had now become my best friend - no way was I going to do anything that would pull me away from him."" Michael Jackson doc director challenges 'cult of celebrity' Jackson doc is 'disturbing and devastating' Channel 4 rejects Jackson estate complaint over documentary Mr Robson said Jackson had told him ""I was his best friend and the only person he had ever done these sexual acts with"". ""So therefore I was - out of all the boys in the world - the chosen one, I thought,"" he said. Mr Safechuck told the programme his abuse had begun with Jackson teaching him how to perform a sex act, at the age of 10. ""Then you start French kissing - he said I taught him how to do that,"" Mr Safechuck said. And this had been followed by further abuse and other sex acts. Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme's full interview with Wade Robson and James Safechuck from 10:00 GMT on the BBC News Channel in the UK. Mr Safechuck told the programme Jackson had been able to abuse him over such a sustained period of time because he had also successfully groomed his parents. ""There's a long grooming process where Michael inserts himself into your family and becomes a part of your family,"" he said. ""It takes him a while to build up the trust - it doesn't happen overnight."" And he then ""makes a wedge between you and your parents - and he isolates you from everybody else"". ""At the same time when you're being abused, a part of you is dying,"" Mr Safechuck added. Mr Robson also described Jackson as a ""master manipulator"". He had driven ""this wedge between myself and my father, [and] my mother and my father"" to make it easier for the abuse to occur, he told the programme. He also said part of the responsibility for the abuse should fall ""at the door of all the other people, all the other employees that were around Michael and me and James [Safechuck] all the time, who looked the other way"". Fans turned the entrance to Neverland into a shrine after the singer died In response, Michael Jackson's brothers Tito, Marlon and Jackie, and nephew Taj Jackson rejected the claims in Leaving Neverland - which is broadcast in the UK next week - that the singer had abused children. Taj said his uncle's behaviour had seemed odd to some but had been ""very innocent"", adding: ""His naivety was his downfall."" And Marlon said there was ""not one piece of evidence"" to back up the allegations. Michael Jackson's estate, meanwhile said Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck had previously ""testified under oath that these events never occurred"". ""They have provided no independent evidence and absolutely no proof in support of their accusations, which means the entire film hinges solely on the word of two perjurers,"" it said.

"This video can not be played In footage shown to jurors by the defence, Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed playing with fairy lights in a tent at the festival A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a festival and filmed her as she died has been found guilty of manslaughter. Louella Fletcher-Michie was found dead in woodland near the Bestival site in Dorset after taking the drug 2CP. Ceon Broughton did little to help his girlfriend - the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie - for six hours as he feared breaching a suspended jail term. He filmed Ms Fletcher-Michie, 24, and branded her a ""drama queen"" as she lay dying on 11 September 2017. Broughton, 30, of Island Centre Way, Enfield, London, was also found guilty at Winchester Crown Court of supplying the Class A drug 2CP. Both verdicts were unanimous and he is due to be sentenced on Friday morning. Speaking outside court, Mr Michie said: ""Regardless of the outcome of this harrowing trial there were never going to be any winners. ""We began our life sentence on what would have been Louella's 25th birthday. Ceon's life sentence is knowing that he didn't help Louella to live."" Louella Fletcher-Michie died after a ""significant period of suffering"", jurors heard The trial heard the pair had gone into woodland to take drugs on the eve of Ms Fletcher-Michie's 25th birthday but Broughton had ""bumped up"" his girlfriend's dose. She was found dead by a security steward 400m from the festival's hospital tent. The court heard the couple liked to film each other when they were taking drugs and jurors were shown footage from the day in which Broughton could be seen playing with a fidget spinner. Broughton then filmed his girlfriend as she became ""disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"" and continued recording after her apparent death. Ceon Broughton will be sentenced on Friday An angry exchange at court on 21 February between Ms Fletcher-Michie's father and Broughton can now be reported. During a break in proceedings, Mr Michie shouted ""evil, evil"" and ""not even sorry"" as his family walked towards an exit. Broughton grabbed a wooden table and threw it against a wall, breaking it into pieces. He then stormed into the waiting area of another courtroom and damaged a water cooler before being restrained by police and his legal team. John Michie said: ""Ceon's life sentence is knowing that he didn't help Louella to live"" During the trial, the court heard Broughton had contacted friends and Ms Fletcher-Michie's family, sending them maps showing his location. Her parents drove 130 miles (209km) from London to the festival at Lulworth Castle but when Ms Fletcher-Michie's brother Sam also contacted Broughton, urging him to seek medical help, he called her a ""drama queen"" and told him to ""call back in an hour"". Mr Fletcher-Michie told the court that when he asked Broughton what drugs his sister had taken, Broughton told him it was 2CP but added: ""I bumped it up a bit."" Defence barrister Stephen Kamlish QC said that ""no-one has ever been known to die from taking this drug [2CP] or taking an overdose"". Jurors heard Broughton failed to act because he had been handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, a month before. Ms Fletcher-Michie was found dead by a security steward 400m from the festival's hospital tent Broughton had already pleaded guilty to supplying 2CP to Ms Fletcher-Michie and her friend at Glastonbury Festival in 2017. Following the trial, senior investigating officer Neil Devoto called Broughton's actions ""selfish and shameful"". He said: ""Even when she lay motionless, struggling for breath and dying, he continued to take photos and videos and message friends. ""All he needed to do was walk a few hundred metres to an on-site hospital."" Simon Jones, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Broughton's ""callous"" actions decided Ms Fletcher-Michie's ""destiny, depriving her of a future"". He added: ""His actions and, most importantly, his inactions were driven by his desire for self preservation and the selfish need not to draw the authorities' attention to him having supplied drugs to Louella.""

"This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" Two men have told the BBC they were abused hundreds of times by Michael Jackson, from the ages of seven and 10. Wade Robson, 36, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the singer had sexually abused him from the age of seven and tried to rape him when he was 14. James Safechuck, 40, told the programme Jackson had sexually abused him ""from the age of 10 until around 14"". Jackson's family say there's ""not one piece of evidence"" to prove the claims. The two men have also spoken out in the documentary Leaving Neverland. Asked if the abuse had occurred ""hundreds and hundreds of times"", both Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck agreed that this had been the case. Mr Robson told the programme: ""Every time I was with him, every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me."" Jackson had fondled him, ""touching my entire body"", and made him watch the singer performing a sex act, he said. And then, when he was 14, Jackson had tried to rape him. ""That was one of the last sexual abuse experiences we had,"" Mr Robson told the programme. In Leaving Neverland, Wade Robson (pictured) says Jackson sexually abused him in the 1990s Jackson had groomed him to believe they ""loved each other - and this is how we show our love"", he said. ""And then he would immediately follow that up with, 'But If anybody else ever found out what we are doing, you and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives and our lives would fall apart,' he and I would fall apart,"" Mr Robson told the programme. ""All of this was terrifying to me. ""The idea of being pulled away from Michael - this man, this other-worldly figure, this god to me who had now become my best friend - no way was I going to do anything that would pull me away from him."" Michael Jackson doc director challenges 'cult of celebrity' Jackson doc is 'disturbing and devastating' Channel 4 rejects Jackson estate complaint over documentary Mr Robson said Jackson had told him ""I was his best friend and the only person he had ever done these sexual acts with"". ""So therefore I was - out of all the boys in the world - the chosen one, I thought,"" he said. Mr Safechuck told the programme his abuse had begun with Jackson teaching him how to perform a sex act, at the age of 10. ""Then you start French kissing - he said I taught him how to do that,"" Mr Safechuck said. And this had been followed by further abuse and other sex acts. Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme's full interview with Wade Robson and James Safechuck from 10:00 GMT on the BBC News Channel in the UK. Mr Safechuck told the programme Jackson had been able to abuse him over such a sustained period of time because he had also successfully groomed his parents. ""There's a long grooming process where Michael inserts himself into your family and becomes a part of your family,"" he said. ""It takes him a while to build up the trust - it doesn't happen overnight."" And he then ""makes a wedge between you and your parents - and he isolates you from everybody else"". ""At the same time when you're being abused, a part of you is dying,"" Mr Safechuck added. Mr Robson also described Jackson as a ""master manipulator"". He had driven ""this wedge between myself and my father, [and] my mother and my father"" to make it easier for the abuse to occur, he told the programme. He also said part of the responsibility for the abuse should fall ""at the door of all the other people, all the other employees that were around Michael and me and James [Safechuck] all the time, who looked the other way"". Fans turned the entrance to Neverland into a shrine after the singer died In response, Michael Jackson's brothers Tito, Marlon and Jackie, and nephew Taj Jackson rejected the claims in Leaving Neverland - which is broadcast in the UK next week - that the singer had abused children. Taj said his uncle's behaviour had seemed odd to some but had been ""very innocent"", adding: ""His naivety was his downfall."" And Marlon said there was ""not one piece of evidence"" to back up the allegations. Michael Jackson's estate, meanwhile said Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck had previously ""testified under oath that these events never occurred"". ""They have provided no independent evidence and absolutely no proof in support of their accusations, which means the entire film hinges solely on the word of two perjurers,"" it said.

"Rhiannon Davies pictured with her daughter Kate, who was born at Ludlow Community Hospital Families who have alleged failings at an NHS trust could pull out of an inquiry into their babies' deaths. Some object to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists being part of the overseeing review panel. Rhiannon Davies,whose baby Kate died in 2009, said its role in the review of Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust, the biggest inquiry into claims of maternity failure, was ""inappropriate"". NHS Improvement (NHSI) defended the inquiry as ""independent"". NHSI, the regulator that is heading the review, invited the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) to participate in the scrutiny panel, despite being aware of concerns about its recent history at the health trust which families say puts the college in a compromising position. Ms Davies has fought alongside Kayleigh Griffiths,whose daughter Pippa diedavoidably in 2016, to establish the review. Pippa Griffiths died at one day old after contracting meningitis Ms Davies said: ""NHSI have chosen to invite some highly inappropriate individuals. ""I will be taking some time to consider whether I will allow Kate's case to be part of the review."" She added: ""This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity that has been afforded the entire NHS by Kate and by Pippa."" A spokesperson for NHSI said: ""The review remains independent and NHS Improvement will ensure that families are given the answers they need and that lessons are learnt."" More than 200 families have contacted the reviewof maternity care at the trust, many of whom allege that babies and mothers died avoidably or suffered long-term harm as a result of poor care. The allegations are mainly centred on a period from 1998 to 2017, although a few cases date back further. A spokesperson for the RCOG said it ""refutes"" any claims it is ""compromised"". ""The RCOG has a remit to improve standards of healthcare for women in the UK and around the world, working tirelessly to deliver this in the most comprehensive way possible. The RCOG has not received any correspondence from families."" Maternity services were visited by inspectors in August 2018 In the summer of 2017, the trust invited the college to carry out a review of its maternity services, which found significant problems, including ""patient safety issues"". The trust did not publish the report and the college failed to tell regulators of its concerns. Baby death review: What do we know? 'Bullying culture' at baby deaths trust Latest news from the West Midlands In December 2017, there were three unexpected deaths in the maternity unit, including that ofDevan and Gavin Cadwallade's daughter. The college agreed to meet representatives from the trust in London, in April 2018, who were keen to show that services were improving. In what the college itself described as an unprecedented move, it agreed to write a second report, which highlighted improvements in care, despite what families alleged was the shaky nature of the evidence provided by the trust. The trust highlighted this second report when it published both reports in the summer of last year. However, in August, the regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) conducted an inspection of maternity servicesat the trust and rated them inadequate. The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust said it was working with all parties. This is a spectacularly boneheaded decision by NHS Improvement. The families had confidence in the review team being led by experienced midwife Donna Ockenden, and trusted her to uncover the extent of the failures at the Shrewsbury trust. A panel of professionals reviewing the work of the Ockenden team was always part of the terms of reference of the inquiry, but the families are incredulous that the college, whom they regard as being complicit in the trust's failures, have been invited to participate. There are any number of independent gynaecologists and obstetricians they could have invited instead, and the decision highlights once more that NHS regulators often give the impression of acting like a cosy club, oblivious to the concerns of families and patients.

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""Highly dangerous"" to ask for Brexit delay Environment minister George Eustice has quit the government over Theresa May's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit, if her deal is rejected. The MP said it would be ""dangerous"" to go to the EU ""cap in hand at the 11th hour and beg for an extension"". He feared it could mean a long delay or that Brexit ""may never happen at all"" and said the UK must be prepared to walk away without a deal. The PM said she was focused on leaving the EU with a deal on 29 March. Mr Eustice is a longstanding Brexiteer, who stood as a UKIP MEP candidate before joining the Conservatives. Tory MP Bone denies Brexiteers are split Theresa May offers MPs Brexit delay vote He told the BBC he would back the withdrawal deal the prime minister has negotiated with the EU, despite some reservations. ""I do think it's preferable to have an orderly Brexit and crucially, it's preferable to get Brexit done,"" he said. ""We have to get legally out of the European Union as quickly as possible within this window. If we don't and we end up with a long delay of two years, as some would like, then I really do fear we will be in a disastrous situation and Brexit may never happen at all."" Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who himself quit the government in November, suggested any delay to Brexit would reward the EU for its ""intransigence"" and reduce the chances of getting a deal. ""The issue with delay is at this point in time it weakens our leverage - why would the EU make concessions now?"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""I think from the EU's point of view it signals to them that actually their intransigence pays off and that's the wrong message for the UK to be sending to Brussels at this moment."" Mr Eustice, the MP for Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall, is the 14th member of Theresa May's government to resign over Brexit and said he was doing so with ""tremendous sadness"". But in his resignation letter, he said he feared that the EU would end up ""dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country"". He added: ""We cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door."" By the BBC's Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar George Eustice resigned because he believes Mrs May's been manoeuvred into putting Brexit itself in doubt. For him, the breaking point was allowing MPs to vote on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit, he's one of many Brexiteers who are convinced the danger of a disruptive exit might add to the pressure on the EU to make concessions. And he's especially upset about Mrs May promising a vote on whether to delay Brexit beyond 29 March, if only for a short time. The prime minister was driven to volunteer those concessions by the fear of being defeated in the Commons this week, and having to concede them anyway. Her de-facto deputy David Lidington, and Chief Whip Julian Smith, warned Mrs May plainly that she had no choice. A core of ministers, senior, junior and their parliamentary aides, were willing to sacrifice their jobs if necessary to bring about that defeat. She gave in, and hated doing so. But the fear of George Eustice - shared by other Brexiteers is that once Brexit is delayed, the government loses control. Read John's blog Mr Eustice's resignation comes after Theresa May's decision on Tuesday to allow MPs a vote on delaying the UK's departure from the EU, or ruling out a no-deal Brexit, if they again reject the withdrawal deal she has negotiated with the European Union. The UK scheduled departure date from the EU is still 29 March - but that could be delayed if Theresa May fails to get her deal through Parliament in a vote she has promised will take place on or before 12 March. In her reply, the prime minister said she was sorry he was resigning and praised his work as the longest serving minister at the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs since the department was created, in 2001. She said: ""I agree with you that Parliament must now come together and honour the referendum result by voting for a deal which will give businesses and citizens the certainty they need and deserve. ""Our absolute focus should be on getting a deal that can command support in Parliament and leaving on 29 March. ""It is within our grasp and I am grateful to have your continued support in that important mission."" Praising Mr Eustice on Twitter, his former boss Environment Secretary Michael Gove said he would be ""very much missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Weekend lie-ins do not make up for being sleep-deprived during the week, a study suggests. Researchers took two groups of healthy people and limited their sleep to no more than five hours a night. One group had their sleep restricted for the whole study, while the other was able to catch up at the weekend. Both groups snacked more at night, gained weight, and showed signs of deteriorating metabolic health, compared to the start of the study. ""In the end, we didn't see any benefit in any metabolic outcome in the people who got to sleep in on the weekend,"" said lead author Chris Depner, an assistant research professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder. Should we all become early risers? A few nights of bad sleep upsets brain Lark or night owl? Blame your ancestors Research has shown that too little sleep can increase the risk of a range of health problems, including obesity and type-2 diabetes, in part by boosting the urge to snack at night and by decreasing insulin sensitivity, or the ability of the body to regulate blood sugar. For this new study, researchers wanted to find out what happens when people cycle back and forth between a sleep-deprived work week and two days of catch-up. They took 36 people, aged 18 to 39, and for two weeks kept them in a laboratory, where their food intake, light exposure and sleep were monitored. Although the numbers may appear small, experts said this was quite a large number of participants for a sleep study of this kind. Participants were divided into three groups: one was allowed no more than five hours per night over nine nights (sleep-restricted group) the second was allowed no more than five hours for five days followed by a weekend when they could sleep as much as they liked before returning to two days of restricted sleep (weekend recovery group) and a third was allowed plenty of time to sleep - nine hours each night for nine nights (control group) Experts say the study reinforces the message of good ""sleep hygiene"", such as avoiding looking at screens too close before bed Both sleep-restricted groups gained a small amount of weight over the course of the study (slightly more than 2.2lbs or 1kg) and became less sensitive to insulin, according to the study,published in the journal Current Biology.,external While those in the recovery group saw mild improvements at the weekend (including reduced night-time snacking), those benefits went away when the sleep-restricted work week resumed. On some health measures, the weekend recovery group had worse outcomes. Insulin sensitivity declined by 13% in the sleep-restricted group, while in the weekend recovery group it worsened by between 9% and 27%. One problem was that the people who were given the opportunity to catch up on sleep struggled to do so. In the end, the recovery group achieved only 66 minutes more sleep on average at the weekend. Experts not involved in the research said that although the effects on health shown in the study were small, it was possible that over months and years the impact could become large. They said the findings reinforced existing advice that it is important to sleep enough during the week, and ideally keep a regular sleep schedule. But if you are unable to keep to a regular sleep and wake time, it does not mean a lie-in is necessarily bad for you. The study focused on how sleep restriction and catching up on rest at the weekend affects metabolic health, rather than, for example, mental health or cognitive ability. Malcolm von Schantz, professor of chronobiology at the University of Surrey, added: ""Whilst I think we should urge everybody to work towards a regular schedule if they can, I don't think we should tell people who don't have that luxury that they mustn't sleep in during the weekend.""

"Ben Tye, aka Amber Dextris, will compete in the final of the event on 10 March A finalist in the first Miss Drag UK pageant has spoken of his shock at receiving an endorsement from none other than Theresa May. The prime minister appears to have taken time out of her Brexit-dominated schedule to tweet - and send a signed letter of support - to Ben Tye. Mr Tye, 22, from Dovercourt in Essex, will compete in the final of the event on 10 March as alter ego Amber Dextris. He described the reaction to the PM's support as ""absolutely crazy"". Mrs May had initially responded to a tweet sent by BBC journalist Chris Gibson, asking if she was a fan of the drag queen reality series, Ru Paul's Drag Race. ""Must admit I haven't had a chance to catch up on @RuPaulsDragRace,"" she replied, ""but wishing Ben all the best in raising money for a great cause @SandsUK."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Tye said he was shocked to receive Mrs May's support, as well as a letter and signed photo in the post. ""I looked at my phone on a break at work and I was a bit confused - I literally threw it on a table in shock,"" he said. Theresa May sent a signed letter and photo to Mr Tye ""I think it's fantastic. She has a lot on her plate but she took the time to send something personal like that. It's a positive thing."" Mrs May's tweet was sent at the same time she would have been preparing to address a conference in London to establish stronger economic links with Jordan. Her schedule could hardly be busier, amid an ever-evolving Brexit quagmire, including Thursday's resignation of Agriculture Minister George Eustice. The tweet was met with scorn from some, particularly one competitor from RuPaul's Drag Race, the hit reality TV show which sees drag queens compete to become America's next drag superstar. Giovanni Palandrani, stage name Aquaria, tweeted: ""Honestly thanks for the support but no thanks. ""Get your policies together and then feel comfortable enjoying our art. Mess."" Mr Tye said the signed letter and picture would be sold to raise money for Sands UK, the charity supported by the pageant.

""Comic Relief is a 20-year-old formula that asks comedians to perform and sends celebrities - most often white - out to Africa, and that image evokes for lots of ethnic minorities in Britain, a colonial image of a white beautiful heroine holding a black child, with no agency, no parents in sight.

"This video can not be played Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman explains the allegations against Benjamin Netanyahu Israel's attorney general intends to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges. Mr Netanyahu faces possible charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases. The prime minister is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage. Mr Netanyahu, who faces an election, said in a TV address that the case would ""collapse like a house of cards"". In a defiant broadcast, he repeated his assertion that he is the victim of a left-wing ""witch-hunt"" intended to topple him ahead of the closely contested election on 9 April. Is Israeli PM in more trouble now than ever before? Netanyahu: The commando turned PM A final hearing, probably after the election, will determine whether the charges go forward. The prime minister will have an opportunity to make his case then. Mr Netanyahu is set to be charged with fraud and breach of trust for accepting expensive gifts - including cigars, pink champagne and jewellery worth $264,100 (Â£199,200)  - from an Israeli-born Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan and the Australian billionaire James Packer. The gifts from Mr Milchan are alleged to have been in return for help with a US visa and tax breaks. Mr Milchan and Mr Packer face no charges and have denied any wrongdoing. Benjamin Netanyahu (L) faces possible charges levelled by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit In two other cases, Mr Netanyahu is accused of trying to get more favourable press coverage for himself. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit says he is considering charges of fraud and breach of trust in both, and bribery in one of them. The most serious case is seen as that involving media mogul Shaul Elovitch, controller of Israel's largest telecom company, Bezeq. The allegations explained Mr Netanyahu is accused of seeking favourable coverage from an Elovitch-owned news site in return for regulatory decisions that would benefit the media mogul. Mr Elovitch, himself facing legal proceedings, has strongly denied any wrongdoing. Opposition parties have said there is no way Mr Netanyahu should carry on as prime minister if he is charged. Mr Mandelblit has said the Supreme Court will determine whether he must resign. Mr Elovitch appeared last week at a court hearing In his address, Mr Netanyahu said: ""The left knows it cannot beat us at the polling booth, so for the past three years they have been carrying out an unprecedented witch hunt which has one aim - to topple the right-wing government which I lead."" Earlier, his Likud party said the prospect of charges amounted to ""political persecution"". ""Unilateral publication of the attorney general's announcement just a month before the elections, without giving the prime minister an opportunity to refute these false accusations, is a blatant and unprecedented intervention in the elections."" It could be significant, especially as Mr Netanyahu already heads a fragile coalition. He and his right-wing Likud party face a serious challenge in the elections from a newly-announced centrist alliance led by ex-army chief Benny Gantz and TV journalist-turned-politician Yair Lapid. And recent polls suggest Likud could lose support and the ability to form a coalition if charges are levelled against the prime minister. Mr Netanyahu has also come under fire this week for attempting to shore up votes by negotiating a merger of the religious pro-settlement Jewish Home party with the ultra-right Jewish Power party, which includes followers of the late anti-Arab extremist rabbi Meir Kahane. Two powerful pro-Israel lobby groups in the US, Aipac and the American Jewish Committee, made rare criticism of Mr Netanyahu's move, describing Jewish Power as a ""racist and reprehensible party"". By Yolande Knell, BBC News, Jerusalem Benjamin Netanyahu had hoped to make history this year - if he stays in office he's set to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister. But he's now also a step closer to becoming the first sitting prime minister to be charged with criminal offences. His Likud party made last-ditch efforts to block publication of this decision at the High Court, arguing it could have a big impact on April's election, but the move was rejected. Mr Netanyahu is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise and there is currently no legal barrier to stop him staying in office if he's re-elected - even if the attorney general makes a final decision to charge him after a hearing due in the coming months. However, many will question the prime minister's ability to handle affairs of state if he's simultaneously defending himself in court.

"YouTube says it will switch off comments on almost all videos featuring under-18s, in an attempt to ""better protect children and families"". Several brands stopped advertising on YouTube after discovering that paedophiles were leaving predatory comments on videos of children. YouTube had originally disabled comments on videos that were attracting predatory and obscene comments. But it will now disable comments on almost all videos of minors by default. It said the change would take effect over several months. TheBBC first reported that paedophiles were leaving explicit commentson YouTube videos back in 2017. As well as leaving obscene or sexual comments, they were also using the comments section to signal content of interest to other paedophiles. At the time, YouTube said it was ""working urgently"" to clean up the site. However, in February this year advertisers including AT&T, Nestle and Hasbro suspended their ads after more predatory activity was found. In a blog post,external, YouTube said its new policy meant videos of very young children would automatically have the comments section disabled. The move is likely to include videos of toddlers uploaded by parents, as well as short films featuring children by established YouTube stars. Videos of older children and teenagers will typically not have the comments disabled, unless a specific video is likely to attract predatory attention. That could include, for example, a video of a teenager doing gymnastics. YouTube told the BBC it would use algorithms to detect which videos contained children. Millions of hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube every day. A small number of YouTube content creators will be allowed to enable comments on videos featuring children. These channels will be trusted partners such as family video-bloggers or known YouTube stars. However, they will be required to actively moderate their comments and demonstrate that their videos carry a low risk of attracting predatory comments. AT&T and Hasbro pull YouTube ads over abuse claims Predatory comments prompt YouTube ad suspension YouTube said it had developed a system that was better at detecting predatory comments and removing them. Previously, it had said it would stop video-makers earning ad revenue if paedophiles left explicit comments on their videos, but this will no longer be necessary. In addition to updating its comments policy, YouTube said it had terminated several channels that were ""endangering"" children. The ban included several channels that were adding shocking content in the middle of children's cartoons. It named FilthyFrankClips as one of the banned channels. It had released a video instructing children how to cut themselves. ""Nothing is more important to us than ensuring the safety of young people on the platform,"" said YouTube chief executiveSusan Wojcicki on Twitter,external. YouTube's app for children - YouTube Kids - has been criticised for using algorithms to curate content. Inappropriate videos have repeatedly been discovered on the service. The comments left by fans on YouTube videos help the platform's algorithms decide which videos to serve up and recommend to viewers. Creators have expressed concern that being forced to disable comments on their videos will affect the growth of their channels. Despite the wide-ranging new policy, comments will remain part of the recommendation algorithm. ""We understand that comments are an important way creators build and connect with their audiences,"" YouTube said in a statement. ""We also know that this is the right thing to do to protect the YouTube community."" Andy Burrows from the child protection charity NSPCC said the announcement was an ""important step"". ""We know that offenders are twisting YouTube videos for their own sexual gratification, using them to contact other predators and using the comments section as shop window to child abuse image sites,"" he said.

"Net migration to the UK from countries outside the European Union has hit its highest level for 15 years, the Office for National Statistics says. Figures show 261,000 more non-EU citizens came to the UK than left in the year ending September 2018 - the highest since 2004. In contrast, net migration from EU countries has continued to fall to a level last seen in 2009. The figures,externalare the last set before the UK is due to leave the EU next month. And separate figures released by the Home Office show the number of EU nationals applying for British citizenship hit an all-time high last year, rising by 23% to about 48,000. In December, the prime minister said the government was sticking to its longstanding ambition to bring net migration down to the ""tens of thousands"". The ONS has put net migration in the year to September at 283,000. It says more than 625,000 people moved to the UK and about 345,000 people left. Jay Lindop, director of the Centre for International Migration at the ONS, said: ""Decisions to migrate are complex and a person's decision to move to or from the UK will always be influenced by a range of factors, including work, study and family reasons. ""Different patterns for EU and non-EU migration have emerged since mid-2016, when the EU referendum vote took place."" Overall, net migration, immigration and emigration figures have remained broadly stable since the end of 2016, the ONS said. Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? How has EU migration changed the UK? Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said the UK was continuing to attract and retain highly skilled workers, including doctors and nurses, but was ""committed to controlled and sustainable migration"". ""As we leave the EU, our new immigration system will give us full control over who comes here for the first time in decades, while enabling employers to have access to the skills they need from around the world."" She added that the government had ""always been clear"" it wanted EU citizens to stay and the EU Settlement Scheme, which allows EU nationals to apply to stay, made that simple. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Since the referendum in June 2016 a clear pattern has emerged.  Immigration to the UK from the European Union has declined while the number of people coming from outside the bloc has gone up. It may be that the two trends are not related, but it seems likely that they are. With fewer EU workers available than before, businesses and the public sector appear to be looking further afield to fill vacancies. That's reflected in the statistics for those arriving with a ""definite job"". The number of EU citizens in that category dropped from 108,000 in the 12 months before the referendum to 70,000 in the year to last September, whereas non-EU migrants coming to Britain with a definite job offer went up from 51,000 to 69,000. It may be a foretaste of things to come after Brexit, when the government is able to restrict EU migration in a way that hasn't been possible before. The ONS report also showed: More citizens from Central and Eastern European countries known as the EU8 - which includes Poland, Slovakia and Lithuania - are leaving the UK than arriving. This pattern differs from all other EU countries The number of people coming to the UK for work has fallen to its lowest level since 2014 - this follows a fall in the number of EU citizens arriving to work More people are coming to the UK to study, with non-EU student immigration at its highest level since 2011 Madeleine Sumption, from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the data showed Britain was not as attractive to EU migrants as it was a couple of years ago. ""That may be because of Brexit-related political uncertainty, the falling value of the pound making UK wages less attractive, or simply the fact that job opportunities have improved in other EU countries,"" she said. She added that EU net migration happened to be unusually high in the run-up to the referendum, so at least some of the decline would probably have happened even without Brexit. Diane Abbott, Labour's shadow home secretary, said: ""Once again the number of migrants coming here vastly outstrips its unworkable 100,000 net migration target. ""Its policy is not really about reducing numbers but allows it to maintain a constant campaign against migration and migrants."" She criticised the immigration bill currently going through Parliament and accused the home secretary of promising more business access to overseas workers, at the same time as effectively removing all their rights. Marley Morris, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre-left think tank, said the ""marked fall"" in EU net migration meant the government needed to ""act now to reassure EU citizens and contain the economic damage"". ""It must ramp up its communications campaign on settled status, send a strong message to employers that rights must be protected, and clarify its proposals for a no deal scenario."" How has EU migration changed the UK? Post-Brexit immigration system unveiled UK migration steady despite EU arrivals dip How has immigration changed since the referendum?

"This video can not be played 'I felt as though I didn't count. It was all right for him to do what he had done. He got put away for it but that was it' A woman who fought for compensation after being sexually abused by her stepfather as a child has said she is ""over the moon"" the law is changing. The government is scrapping the ""same roof"" rule, which blocked victims of violent crimes before 1979 from compensation if they lived with their attacker at the time of the incident. The change applies to England, Wales and Scotland. It followsa number of successful legal challengesagainst the rule. A similar rule in Northern Ireland - known as the ""same household"" rule - is also being reviewed. The change is part of a wider review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme,which was launched in September 2018. The scheme makes taxpayer-funded payments to victims of violent crime. 'Same roof' abuse payout rule challenged 'I trusted my daughter's abuser with my life' The woman - not named for legal reasons and known as JT - was abused by her stepfather between the ages of four and 17 but was previously denied compensation because of the ""same roof"" rule. The policy was originally designed to ensure perpetrators did not benefit from compensation paid to their victims. However ministers have acknowledged it had an unfair impact on victims of crimes such as child sexual abuse, who had no choice about who they lived with. The law was changed in 1979 so that future victims could claim compensation if they no longer lived with their attacker and were unlikely to do so again. However it was not made retrospective, so those abused before 1979 were not eligible for compensation. Now the government has introduced legislation to abolish the rule, so all victims abused by someone they lived with can reapply for compensation - regardless of when the attack took place. In 2012 JT's stepfather was convicted of eight offences including rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 14 years. At the time, JT said she could not believe she was not eligible for compensation. A relative who was also abused by the same man but did not live with him at the time was eligible. ""I knew it was unfair so I thought, 'I'm going to fight it',"" she told BBC News. In July 2018 she won a landmark court case against the ""same roof"" rule, and the right to claim compensation. JT said she was overjoyed that the government was now changing the law. ""I've been fighting for so long, I never thought this would happen,"" she said. ""I just can't explain how happy I am to think that other people like me that may come forward can apply for compensation."" JT - who says she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks and nightmares because of the abuse she experienced - is still waiting to receive her compensation. ""Until that money is in my hand I still can't quite believe [the rule] has been overturned,"" she said. Victims Minister Edward Argar said the ""same roof"" rule was out-dated and unfairly denied access to compensation"" He said the change would help to ensure victims of crime get the support they need and deserve. Baroness Newlove, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, said it would mean all victims of historic abuse would be treated equally. ""I have always felt that the rule was unfair,"" she said. ""It has caused unnecessary distress to many victims and survivors, especially within families, where some siblings have been eligible for criminal injuries compensation and yet others have not, solely on the grounds of the date on which, the abuse took place.""

"This video can not be played BBC's Laura Bicker explains why Trump is the 'biggest loser' from the summit A summit between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended without agreement after the US refused North Korean demands for sanctions relief, the US president has said. ""It was all about the sanctions,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that."" North Korea said it had made ""realistic proposals"" at the summit. The two leaders had been expected to announce progress on denuclearisation. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" Mr Trump said. Speaking at a news conference after the summit, in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, Mr Trump said no plans had been made for a third summit, but he expressed optimism about a ""good outcome"" in the future. And on his flight back to the United States, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was very hopeful that officials from both sides could resume talks before too long. The original White House programme for the day had planned for a ""joint agreement signing ceremony"" as well as a working lunch for the two leaders, but expectations were abruptly dashed with the cancellation of both. According to Mr Trump, Mr Kim made a significant offer - to dismantle all of the Yongbyon complex, the research and production facility at the heart of North Korea's nuclear programme. But in return Mr Kim wanted all sanctions on North Korea lifted, something the US was not prepared to offer. There was also a question over the network of facilities that extend beyond Yongbyon. Last month, Stephen Biegun, the US state department special representative for North Korea,said North Korea had committed in pre-summit talks,externalto destroy all of the nation's plutonium- and uranium-enrichment facilities, dependent on unspecified US measures in return. Yongbyon is North Korea's only known source of plutonium but the country is believed to have at least two other facilities where uranium is enriched. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Yongbyon: The heart of NK's nuclear programme Kim's hiding sister and other unreal moments Those unspecified US measures appear now to have been complete sanctions relief, which Mr Trump would not offer. The US president also suggested in his news conference that Mr Kim had offered only the destruction of Yongbyon and not North Korea's entire nuclear apparatus. The president said that when he raised the issue of a second enrichment facility apart from Yongbyon, the North Korean delegation was ""surprised"" by what the US knew. North Korea's foreign minister later said that Pyongyang had been seeking partial sanctions relief, not a complete lifting. The North had offered to permanently stop nuclear and long-range rocket testing, the minister added. The first summit between the two leaders, which took place in Singapore in June 2018, was criticised for having produced little in terms of substance, leading to anticipation that Mr Trump would push at the summit in Hanoi to produce an agreement on denuclearisation. The failure will be viewed as a setback for self-styled deal-maker Mr Trump, who has talked up his historic rapprochement with Mr Kim as a significant policy achievement. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un answered a question from a foreign reporter Some saw the president's decision to not agree a deal as a good move. ""From Mr Trump's perspective it will be a loss he can weather,"" Andray Abrahamian, a North Korea expert at Stanford University, wrote in a column for the BBC. ""A 'bad deal' in which he gave away a lot would inspire years of debate and pushback from US foreign-policy elites. With this, he's spun it as saveable through working-level talks."" The summit came as Mr Trump was facing increased scrutiny at home in the US over his business dealings and alleged ties to Russia, after hisformer lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen testified before Congress on Wednesday. A statement from South Korea's presidential office called the breakdown of talks ""regrettable"" but said the US and North Korean leaders had made ""more meaningful progress than at any time prior"". South Korean leader Moon Jae-in has worked to improve bilateral relations between the two Koreas, and played a role in arranging the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore. A later statement from President Moon said he had held a 25-minute phone conversation with Mr Trump and ""looked forward to productive results at follow-up consultations between the US and North Korean leaders"". China, North Korea's main ally, said it hoped both sides would keep talking. ""Solving this problem is definitely not something that can be achieved overnight,"" foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. US media extensively covered remarks by Mr Trump about an American student, Otto Warmbier, who died from extensive injuries shortly after he was released from North Korean detention in 2017. The Hanoi summit as it happened North Korea in nine charts How did Otto Warmbier end up in a coma? The president said he had raised the Warmbier case with Mr Kim and believed the North Korean leader's assurances that he knew nothing of the student's treatment. ""Some really bad things happened to Otto - some really really bad things. But he tells me that he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word,"" Mr Trump said. Warmbier, who was 22, was arrested for taking a propaganda poster from a hotel while on a visit to Pyongyang in January 2016. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour. Mr Trump is not thought to have pressed Mr Kim during their talks on North Korea's wider human rights record. According to Human Rights Watch, the United Nations and international powers, the North Korean regime is among the world's worst human rights abusers, with an estimated 80,000 - 120,000 political prisoners and a history of murder, torture, and sexual violence perpetrated against its citizens. There is uncertainty about what exactly both sides mean by denuclearisation. Washington has previously said North Korea must unilaterally give up its all of its nuclear weapons and destroy all of its nuclear facilities before there can be any sanctions relief, but that condition is known to be a sticking point for the North Koreans. It is thought Mr Kim views denuclearisation as a mutual arrangement in which the US withdraws its military presence on the Korean peninsula. Mr Kim and Mr Trump walk together during a break from talks in Hanoi Asked at the news conference on Thursday what he meant by denuclearisation, Mr Trump said: ""To me it's pretty obvious, we have to get rid of the nukes."" Mr Trump said the US delegation ""had some options and this time we decided not to do any of the options"". The pair seemed to get along at the Hanoi summit, as they did at the previous summit in Singapore. They took a poolside stroll for the cameras, although neither appeared to say much. Speaking after the talks in Hanoi, Mr Trump said Mr Kim was ""quite a guy and quite a character"" and described their relationship as ""very strong"". Despite the lack of an agreement, the second summit would appear to build on a significant shift in the tenor of the relationship between the two nations. In late 2017, they were exchanging vitriolic threats, with Mr Trump calling Mr Kim ""little rocket man"" and Mr Kim calling Mr Trump a ""mentally deranged dotard"". Before the summit, there was talk of a possible political declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War, which finished with an armistice rather than a full peace treaty. With the abrupt end of the talks, that peripheral goal seemed to have been kicked into the long grass.

"This video can not be played 'I felt as though I didn't count. It was all right for him to do what he had done. He got put away for it but that was it' A woman who fought for compensation after being sexually abused by her stepfather as a child has said she is ""over the moon"" the law is changing. The government is scrapping the ""same roof"" rule, which blocked victims of violent crimes before 1979 from compensation if they lived with their attacker at the time of the incident. The change applies to England, Wales and Scotland. It followsa number of successful legal challengesagainst the rule. A similar rule in Northern Ireland - known as the ""same household"" rule - is also being reviewed. The change is part of a wider review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme,which was launched in September 2018. The scheme makes taxpayer-funded payments to victims of violent crime. 'Same roof' abuse payout rule challenged 'I trusted my daughter's abuser with my life' The woman - not named for legal reasons and known as JT - was abused by her stepfather between the ages of four and 17 but was previously denied compensation because of the ""same roof"" rule. The policy was originally designed to ensure perpetrators did not benefit from compensation paid to their victims. However ministers have acknowledged it had an unfair impact on victims of crimes such as child sexual abuse, who had no choice about who they lived with. The law was changed in 1979 so that future victims could claim compensation if they no longer lived with their attacker and were unlikely to do so again. However it was not made retrospective, so those abused before 1979 were not eligible for compensation. Now the government has introduced legislation to abolish the rule, so all victims abused by someone they lived with can reapply for compensation - regardless of when the attack took place. In 2012 JT's stepfather was convicted of eight offences including rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 14 years. At the time, JT said she could not believe she was not eligible for compensation. A relative who was also abused by the same man but did not live with him at the time was eligible. ""I knew it was unfair so I thought, 'I'm going to fight it',"" she told BBC News. In July 2018 she won a landmark court case against the ""same roof"" rule, and the right to claim compensation. JT said she was overjoyed that the government was now changing the law. ""I've been fighting for so long, I never thought this would happen,"" she said. ""I just can't explain how happy I am to think that other people like me that may come forward can apply for compensation."" JT - who says she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks and nightmares because of the abuse she experienced - is still waiting to receive her compensation. ""Until that money is in my hand I still can't quite believe [the rule] has been overturned,"" she said. Victims Minister Edward Argar said the ""same roof"" rule was out-dated and unfairly denied access to compensation"" He said the change would help to ensure victims of crime get the support they need and deserve. Baroness Newlove, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, said it would mean all victims of historic abuse would be treated equally. ""I have always felt that the rule was unfair,"" she said. ""It has caused unnecessary distress to many victims and survivors, especially within families, where some siblings have been eligible for criminal injuries compensation and yet others have not, solely on the grounds of the date on which, the abuse took place.""

"Pro-choice activists protested outside the offices of the Tucuman provincial government News that doctors performed a caesarean section on an 11-year-old rape victim has reignited a debate on Argentina's abortion rules. The girl became pregnant after being raped by her grandmother's 65-year-old partner and had requested an abortion. However, her request was delayed by almost five weeks, and some doctors refused to carry out the procedure. Eventually doctors carried out a C-section instead, arguing it would have been too risky to perform the abortion. The baby is alive but doctors say it has little chance of surviving. The girl was 23 weeks pregnant when - after several delays - she was to have the abortion. The debate on whether to relax Argentina's abortion laws continues to rage Local media report that the girl had been clear from the beginning that she wanted to terminate her pregnancy, telling officials: ""I want this thing the old man put inside me taken out."" Abortion is legal in Argentina in cases of rape or if the mother's health is in danger, but in the case of the 11-year-old girl uncertainty about who her legal guardian was caused delays. No going back in Argentina's abortion debate The women protesting in the Argentina abortion debate The girl's mother agreed with her daughter's wishes but because the girl had been placed in the grandmother's care some time earlier, the mother's consent was at first deemed not enough. However, because the grandmother had been stripped of her guardianship for co-habiting with the rapist, she could not provide the necessary consent either. By the time the issue had been settled, the girl was in the 23rd week of her pregnancy. Further problems surfaced when a number of doctors at the local hospital refused to carry out the procedure, citing their personal beliefs. On Tuesday, the health authorities in the northern state of TucumÃ¡n instructed the hospital director to follow a family judge's decision and to carry out the ""necessary procedures to attempt to save both lives"". The family court which the statement quoted has since come forward to say it had made no mention of saving two lives. The doctors who performed the C-section said they did so not because of the instruction to ""save both lives"" but because the abortion would have been too risky. But human rights groups Andhes puts the blame on the TucumÃ¡n state health authorities, and pro-choice groups have said that what happened to the girl amounted to ""torture"". Abortion is a contentious issue in Argentina and this latest incident comes six months after a divisive debate about whether abortions should be legalised in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. A bill to that effect was defeated in the senate, much to the dismay of pro-choice groups which had been campaigning for a loosening of the laws for years.

"This video can not be played Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman explains the allegations against Benjamin Netanyahu Israel's attorney general intends to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges. Mr Netanyahu faces possible charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases. The prime minister is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage. Mr Netanyahu, who faces an election, said in a TV address that the case would ""collapse like a house of cards"". In a defiant broadcast, he repeated his assertion that he is the victim of a left-wing ""witch-hunt"" intended to topple him ahead of the closely contested election on 9 April. Is Israeli PM in more trouble now than ever before? Netanyahu: The commando turned PM A final hearing, probably after the election, will determine whether the charges go forward. The prime minister will have an opportunity to make his case then. Mr Netanyahu is set to be charged with fraud and breach of trust for accepting expensive gifts - including cigars, pink champagne and jewellery worth $264,100 (Â£199,200)  - from an Israeli-born Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan and the Australian billionaire James Packer. The gifts from Mr Milchan are alleged to have been in return for help with a US visa and tax breaks. Mr Milchan and Mr Packer face no charges and have denied any wrongdoing. Benjamin Netanyahu (L) faces possible charges levelled by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit In two other cases, Mr Netanyahu is accused of trying to get more favourable press coverage for himself. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit says he is considering charges of fraud and breach of trust in both, and bribery in one of them. The most serious case is seen as that involving media mogul Shaul Elovitch, controller of Israel's largest telecom company, Bezeq. The allegations explained Mr Netanyahu is accused of seeking favourable coverage from an Elovitch-owned news site in return for regulatory decisions that would benefit the media mogul. Mr Elovitch, himself facing legal proceedings, has strongly denied any wrongdoing. Opposition parties have said there is no way Mr Netanyahu should carry on as prime minister if he is charged. Mr Mandelblit has said the Supreme Court will determine whether he must resign. Mr Elovitch appeared last week at a court hearing In his address, Mr Netanyahu said: ""The left knows it cannot beat us at the polling booth, so for the past three years they have been carrying out an unprecedented witch hunt which has one aim - to topple the right-wing government which I lead."" Earlier, his Likud party said the prospect of charges amounted to ""political persecution"". ""Unilateral publication of the attorney general's announcement just a month before the elections, without giving the prime minister an opportunity to refute these false accusations, is a blatant and unprecedented intervention in the elections."" It could be significant, especially as Mr Netanyahu already heads a fragile coalition. He and his right-wing Likud party face a serious challenge in the elections from a newly-announced centrist alliance led by ex-army chief Benny Gantz and TV journalist-turned-politician Yair Lapid. And recent polls suggest Likud could lose support and the ability to form a coalition if charges are levelled against the prime minister. Mr Netanyahu has also come under fire this week for attempting to shore up votes by negotiating a merger of the religious pro-settlement Jewish Home party with the ultra-right Jewish Power party, which includes followers of the late anti-Arab extremist rabbi Meir Kahane. Two powerful pro-Israel lobby groups in the US, Aipac and the American Jewish Committee, made rare criticism of Mr Netanyahu's move, describing Jewish Power as a ""racist and reprehensible party"". By Yolande Knell, BBC News, Jerusalem Benjamin Netanyahu had hoped to make history this year - if he stays in office he's set to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister. But he's now also a step closer to becoming the first sitting prime minister to be charged with criminal offences. His Likud party made last-ditch efforts to block publication of this decision at the High Court, arguing it could have a big impact on April's election, but the move was rejected. Mr Netanyahu is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise and there is currently no legal barrier to stop him staying in office if he's re-elected - even if the attorney general makes a final decision to charge him after a hearing due in the coming months. However, many will question the prime minister's ability to handle affairs of state if he's simultaneously defending himself in court.

"Net migration to the UK from countries outside the European Union has hit its highest level for 15 years, the Office for National Statistics says. Figures show 261,000 more non-EU citizens came to the UK than left in the year ending September 2018 - the highest since 2004. In contrast, net migration from EU countries has continued to fall to a level last seen in 2009. The figures,externalare the last set before the UK is due to leave the EU next month. And separate figures released by the Home Office show the number of EU nationals applying for British citizenship hit an all-time high last year, rising by 23% to about 48,000. In December, the prime minister said the government was sticking to its longstanding ambition to bring net migration down to the ""tens of thousands"". The ONS has put net migration in the year to September at 283,000. It says more than 625,000 people moved to the UK and about 345,000 people left. Jay Lindop, director of the Centre for International Migration at the ONS, said: ""Decisions to migrate are complex and a person's decision to move to or from the UK will always be influenced by a range of factors, including work, study and family reasons. ""Different patterns for EU and non-EU migration have emerged since mid-2016, when the EU referendum vote took place."" Overall, net migration, immigration and emigration figures have remained broadly stable since the end of 2016, the ONS said. Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? How has EU migration changed the UK? Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said the UK was continuing to attract and retain highly skilled workers, including doctors and nurses, but was ""committed to controlled and sustainable migration"". ""As we leave the EU, our new immigration system will give us full control over who comes here for the first time in decades, while enabling employers to have access to the skills they need from around the world."" She added that the government had ""always been clear"" it wanted EU citizens to stay and the EU Settlement Scheme, which allows EU nationals to apply to stay, made that simple. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Since the referendum in June 2016 a clear pattern has emerged.  Immigration to the UK from the European Union has declined while the number of people coming from outside the bloc has gone up. It may be that the two trends are not related, but it seems likely that they are. With fewer EU workers available than before, businesses and the public sector appear to be looking further afield to fill vacancies. That's reflected in the statistics for those arriving with a ""definite job"". The number of EU citizens in that category dropped from 108,000 in the 12 months before the referendum to 70,000 in the year to last September, whereas non-EU migrants coming to Britain with a definite job offer went up from 51,000 to 69,000. It may be a foretaste of things to come after Brexit, when the government is able to restrict EU migration in a way that hasn't been possible before. The ONS report also showed: More citizens from Central and Eastern European countries known as the EU8 - which includes Poland, Slovakia and Lithuania - are leaving the UK than arriving. This pattern differs from all other EU countries The number of people coming to the UK for work has fallen to its lowest level since 2014 - this follows a fall in the number of EU citizens arriving to work More people are coming to the UK to study, with non-EU student immigration at its highest level since 2011 Madeleine Sumption, from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the data showed Britain was not as attractive to EU migrants as it was a couple of years ago. ""That may be because of Brexit-related political uncertainty, the falling value of the pound making UK wages less attractive, or simply the fact that job opportunities have improved in other EU countries,"" she said. She added that EU net migration happened to be unusually high in the run-up to the referendum, so at least some of the decline would probably have happened even without Brexit. Diane Abbott, Labour's shadow home secretary, said: ""Once again the number of migrants coming here vastly outstrips its unworkable 100,000 net migration target. ""Its policy is not really about reducing numbers but allows it to maintain a constant campaign against migration and migrants."" She criticised the immigration bill currently going through Parliament and accused the home secretary of promising more business access to overseas workers, at the same time as effectively removing all their rights. Marley Morris, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre-left think tank, said the ""marked fall"" in EU net migration meant the government needed to ""act now to reassure EU citizens and contain the economic damage"". ""It must ramp up its communications campaign on settled status, send a strong message to employers that rights must be protected, and clarify its proposals for a no deal scenario."" How has EU migration changed the UK? Post-Brexit immigration system unveiled UK migration steady despite EU arrivals dip How has immigration changed since the referendum?

"Simone Mastrelli pleaded guilty to unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm A man who left a Liverpool fan in a coma in an attack outside the club's Anfield stadium ahead of a Champions League semi-final tie has been jailed. Simone Mastrelli pleaded guilty to attacking Sean Cox, 53, who was left with brain injuries, before Liverpool played Roma last April. At Preston Crown Court, Mastrelli, 30, from Rome, was jailed for three and a half years. Mr Cox, of Dunboyne, County Meath, suffered severe head injuries. Mastrelli, who was extradited last month after being arrested on a European Arrest Warrant in Italy, picked out Mr Cox because of the Liverpool scarf he was wearing. Sean Cox travelled to Liverpool from Ireland with his brother Martin The balaclava-clad Italian was at the fore of a group of between 50 and 60 of Roma's ""Ultra"" fans - many covering their heads and faces and some carrying belts as weapons. The court heard Mr Cox and his brother, Martin, had ""sadly by pure coincidence"" come across the group in Walton Breck Road, near The Albert pub. Mastrelli knocked Mr Cox unconscious with a single blow to the face. He has been undergoing treatment at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire for a ""profound"" brain injury which has left him unable him to communicate his needs, the court heard. Members of the Liverpool squad held up a banner in support of Sean Cox at a match against Napoli in August Prosecutor Keith Sutton said: ""The reality is that he is unlikely to live independently again."" The court heard that prior to the attack, the sales director was a ""busy husband and father of three children"". Speaking as Mastrelli watched from the dock, Mr Cox's daughter, Shauna, read a personal victim statement. ""Before this brutal and vicious attack my dad was a fit and confident man, a man of integrity with a huge passion for life who represented everything which is good. ""My dad went to watch his beloved team, Liverpool, and he never came home."" Judge Mark Brown said Mastrelli delivered the blow and then ""went into the stadium to enjoy the match, which was particularly callous given what had just happened"". Liverpool fan 'can't talk after attack' Roma fined by Uefa after Liverpool tie 'Hope in hearts' for Liverpool attack fan Mastrelli fought extradition in several appeals before he was brought to the UK last month. Alison Gurden, mitigating, said he was a family man himself and was ""distraught"" at the suffering he had caused. Liverpool later lost to Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final Mastrelli entered a guilty plea to unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Cox. He pleaded not guilty to a separate count of violent disorder, which he was told would lie on file. Another Roma fan, Filippo Lombardi, 21, was cleared in October of inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Cox, although he was jailed for three years for violent disorder. A third man, Daniele Sciusco, 29, from Rome, admitted violent disorder and was jailed in August for two and a half years.

"Pakistan says Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman is being treated well Crowds of Indians have gathered near a border crossing with Pakistan ahead of the release of an Indian fighter pilot captured by Pakistan. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said the pilot would be released as a ""peace gesture"" on Friday. India's military welcomed the move. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's plane was shot down in the disputed region of Kashmir on Wednesday. Both countries are under international pressure to calm tensions. On Friday Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the events of the past few days had ""brought our nation closer"". Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Who is captured Indian pilot Abhinandan? Khan vs Modi: Who won the war of perception? ""The way the nation has supported our armed forces is extraordinary and I bow to every Indian for that,"" he said. On Thursday Mr Khan repeated his call for the de-escalation of the situation, saying that Pakistan and India ""have to live in peace"". He has also pushed for talks with Delhi. Wing Commander Abhinandan was shot down in a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani jets after Pakistani air strikes on Indian-controlled territory on Wednesday. Pakistan's information ministry tweeted a video showing the captured Indian pilot Images then circulated of his capture, which were both condemned for what appeared to be a physical attack at the hands of residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, and praised for the actions of the Pakistani soldiers who intervened to protect him. Villagers recount dramatic capture of pilot Pakistan's information ministry published - but subsequently deleted - a video showing the blindfolded pilot, who could be heard requesting water, just after he had been captured. This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet Villagers in Horran threw stones at the pilot, who fired several warning shots in response, eyewitnesses later told the BBC. He is being hailed as a hero in India. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Tuesday,India struck what it said was a militant camp in Pakistanin retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian troops in Kashmir on 14 February. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to retaliate to the Indian raids with air strikes on Wednesday. That led to a dogfight and the Indian fighter jet being shot down in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Enthusiastic supporters awaited the pilot's return Tens of thousands of troops remain positioned on either side of the border in the disputed region. On Friday, four Indian security personnel were killed and eight others injured in a raid on militants in India-administered Kashmir. At the height of the tension Pakistan closed its airspace, disrupting major air routes. Flight operations partially resumed on Friday and will reopen fully on Monday, the country's civil aviation authority said. The sequence of events over the last few days have rapidly shifted from being seen as a boost for the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections, to a general feeling of disenchantment over the way things have turned out. On Wednesday evening, when news of the captured pilot dominated headlines, India's opposition parties issued a statement in which they attacked the ruling BJP for ""blatant politicisation of the armed forces' sacrifices"". In a series of tweets, India's finance minister Arun Jaitley hit back, saying the joint statement was ""being used by Pakistan to bolster its case"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played 'I felt as though I didn't count. It was all right for him to do what he had done. He got put away for it but that was it' A woman who fought for compensation after being sexually abused by her stepfather as a child has said she is ""over the moon"" the law is changing. The government is scrapping the ""same roof"" rule, which blocked victims of violent crimes before 1979 from compensation if they lived with their attacker at the time of the incident. The change applies to England, Wales and Scotland. It followsa number of successful legal challengesagainst the rule. A similar rule in Northern Ireland - known as the ""same household"" rule - is also being reviewed. The change is part of a wider review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme,which was launched in September 2018. The scheme makes taxpayer-funded payments to victims of violent crime. 'Same roof' abuse payout rule challenged 'I trusted my daughter's abuser with my life' The woman - not named for legal reasons and known as JT - was abused by her stepfather between the ages of four and 17 but was previously denied compensation because of the ""same roof"" rule. The policy was originally designed to ensure perpetrators did not benefit from compensation paid to their victims. However ministers have acknowledged it had an unfair impact on victims of crimes such as child sexual abuse, who had no choice about who they lived with. The law was changed in 1979 so that future victims could claim compensation if they no longer lived with their attacker and were unlikely to do so again. However it was not made retrospective, so those abused before 1979 were not eligible for compensation. Now the government has introduced legislation to abolish the rule, so all victims abused by someone they lived with can reapply for compensation - regardless of when the attack took place. In 2012 JT's stepfather was convicted of eight offences including rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 14 years. At the time, JT said she could not believe she was not eligible for compensation. A relative who was also abused by the same man but did not live with him at the time was eligible. ""I knew it was unfair so I thought, 'I'm going to fight it',"" she told BBC News. In July 2018 she won a landmark court case against the ""same roof"" rule, and the right to claim compensation. JT said she was overjoyed that the government was now changing the law. ""I've been fighting for so long, I never thought this would happen,"" she said. ""I just can't explain how happy I am to think that other people like me that may come forward can apply for compensation."" JT - who says she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks and nightmares because of the abuse she experienced - is still waiting to receive her compensation. ""Until that money is in my hand I still can't quite believe [the rule] has been overturned,"" she said. Victims Minister Edward Argar said the ""same roof"" rule was out-dated and unfairly denied access to compensation"" He said the change would help to ensure victims of crime get the support they need and deserve. Baroness Newlove, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, said it would mean all victims of historic abuse would be treated equally. ""I have always felt that the rule was unfair,"" she said. ""It has caused unnecessary distress to many victims and survivors, especially within families, where some siblings have been eligible for criminal injuries compensation and yet others have not, solely on the grounds of the date on which, the abuse took place.""

"This video can not be played President Trump defends Kim Jong-un over US student who died after being jailed by North Korea US President Donald Trump has defended North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the case of an American college student who died after being jailed by North Korea. Speaking in Hanoi after his summit with Mr Kim broke down, Mr Trump said he did not believe the North Korean leader was aware of Otto Warmbier's ordeal. Mr Trump said: ""He tells me he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word."" Warmbier was jailed in North Korea in December 2015 during an organised tour. Pyongyang authorities returned the 22-year-old to the US in a coma in June 2017, and he died days later in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. Trump-Kim talks break down over sanctions His case raised tensions at a time when the Trump administration was exchanging vitriolic comments with North Korea. Mr Trump told reporters he had mentioned the Warmbier case to Mr Kim and the North Korean leader said he was not aware of it at the time, and was regretful. This video can not be played Speaking after his arrest, US student Otto Warmbier said he was ""a poor scapegoat"" The US president said: ""I did speak about it, and I don't believe that he would have allowed that to happen. ""It just wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen. Prisons are rough, they're rough places, and bad things happened."" He said Mr Kim ""felt very badly about it"", adding: ""He knew the case very well, but he knew it later.  In those prisons, those camps, you have a lot of people."" Last June, at Mr Trump's first summit with North Korea's leader, he credited Warmbier's death with the change in US-North Korea relations. Mr Trump described the leaders' relationship as ""very strong"" ""I think without Otto, this would not have happened,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""Something happened from that day. It was a terrible thing. It was brutal. A lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including North Korea. I really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain."" Warmbier's parents were guests of honour at President Trump's State of the Union address in 2018. The family have said their son was ""murdered"" by the North Korean authorities. Warmbier's parents at Mr Trump's State of the Union address Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, was detained in Pyongyang during an organised tour, accused of stealing a hotel poster. He was later charged with spying for the US and held for 17 months. This is not the first time Mr Trump has expressed a willingness to believe a foreign leader. His response to Mr Kim echoes his reaction to Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding Russian interference in the 2016 US election. ""Every time he sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that,'""Mr Trump said after meeting Mr Putin in Asia last year,external. ""I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it."" Amid backlash from lawmakers and US media over appearing to believe a foreign power over his own intelligence officials,Mr Trump later clarified his statements, saying he accepted the intelligence community's conclusion, but adding: ""Could be other people also. A lot of people out there."" More recently, with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,Mr Trump continued to defend Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmandespite CIA officials believing the prince ordered the killing. ""[It] could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" ""I hate the cover-up,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""And I will tell you this, the crown prince hates it more than I do. And they vehemently deny it."" The Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, pointed out that Mr Trump had believed Mr Putin in the past. The California lawmaker said: ""It's strange.  I don't know. There is something wrong with Putin, Kim Jong-un - in my view, thugs - that the president chooses to believe."" House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, another California Democrat and a fierce Trump critic, said the president's response was ""detestable"". Allow Twitter content?

"Sister Kim Yo-jong (left) is influential in North Korea - but appeared keen to avoid the limelight Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un went for dinner together and then spent a day in talks, but were ultimately unable to reach an agreement. The summit was punctuated with photo opportunities displaying the camaraderie between the leaders, and they took every opportunity to flatter each other with looks and words. It was also notable for having significantly more time in the glare of the camera which recorded all - scripted and unscripted.  Here are the most extraordinary moments. You might think answering questions from an international journalist is hardly noteworthy, but with North Korea things are always different. Asked by a reporter if he was confident about a deal, Mr Kim said through an interpreter: ""It's too early to tell, but I wouldn't say I'm pessimistic. For what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out."" Hanoi summit as it happened Trump and Kim in Hanoi: Your need-to-know guide North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis All smiles and happy to answer questions That was likely the very first time Kim Jong-un responded to the question from international media and the question came from David Nakamura of the Washington Post.

Later he seemed to get quite used to the questions, as reporters shouted out off-the-cuff questions as they were briefly allowed to address the room where bilateral talks were taking place. Asked whether he was ""willing to denuclearise,"" he replied ""If I'm not willing to do that, I won't be here right now."" It's what he said in Singapore too, but it pleased Mr Trump who chimed in: ""That might be the best answer you've ever heard"". The quickfire exchange between Mr Kim, Mr Trump and reporters, yielded more noteworthy moments. At one point it was as if media questions to Mr Kim made Mr Trump more nervous than the North Korean leader himself. The US president sharply reprimanded a reporter telling them they can't talk to the North Korean leader, as they would to him - a strange moment where he seemed to unconsciously acknowledge and almost pay heed to the North Korean leader's more controlling relationship with his press. ""Don't raise your voice please, this isn't like dealing with Trump,"" he said to reporters. Kim Jong-un's response? Not fussed at all. ""They all seem to be anxious."" Allow Twitter content?

At a characteristically frank and wide-ranging press conference, Mr Trump took a question about Otto Warmbier, the American student who was detained in North Korea over a prank and who died days after he was returned to the US in July 2017. His case was a cause for the Trump administration at a time when it was exchanging vitriol with North Korea. He told reporters he brought the case up with Mr Kim and Mr Kim said he was not aware of it at the time, and was regretful. Mr Trump said that he took Mr Kim at his word on this - stunning many observers. ""I did speak about it, and I don't believe that he would have allowed that to happen. It just wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen. Prisons are rough, they're rough places, and bad things happened."" He says Mr Kim ""felt very badly about it"", adding: ""He knew the case very well, but he knew it later. [...] In those prisons, those camps, you have a lot of people.

Mr Warmbier's parents were guests of honour at President Trump's State of the Union address in 2018. There has since been huge peak in interest in Otto Warmbier after his sad case was brought up at the press conference with Mr Trump, with Google searches for his name spiking significantly.

"See you at the next summit? The second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ended without any deal or agreement. Washington insists though that dialogue with Pyongyang will continue and the collapse of the Hanoi summit is not a major disappointment. Here's a roundup of North Korea experts looking at the summit and what to make of its sudden end. Ankit Panda, senior editor, The Diplomat The ""no deal"" outcome could have been seen coming a mile away. Indeed, a serious reading of public North Korean statements since last year's Singapore summit would have revealed the core issue that resulted in a lack of agreement. The day after the Singapore summit, North Korean state media paraphrased Kim Jong-un as noting Pyongyang would take ""additional good-will measures"" if the US took ""genuine measures."" By that date, North Korea had dismantled its nuclear testing site at Punggye-ri and announced a moratorium on nuclear tests and intercontinental-range ballistic missile tests. Weeks later, North Korea would also partially and reversibly dismantle a missile-engine test stand. When Mr Kim met South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a third summit in Pyongyang last September, they referenced North Korea's nuclear facilities at Yongbyon as an example of something the North would put on the table in exchange for ""corresponding measures"" from the US. Finally, on 1 January this year, Kim Jong-un made the same point in his New Year's address: corresponding measures would lead to progress in the US-North Korea diplomatic relationship. This phrase was misinterpreted to mean any range of US concessions, including a possibly a declaration to end the Korean War, when it really meant sanctions relief. All smiles and yet no final deal Trump-Kim talks break down over sanctions North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Critically, the sequence matters to North Korea: the US would have to agree for sanctions relief up front for any further concessions on denuclearization to flow. In effect, Yongbyon will remain off the table until the US provides sanctions relief. Donald Trump confirmed this is precisely what caused the breakdown of talks at his press conference on the second day of the Hanoi summit. As long as Washington remains unwilling to take the first step on sanctions relief, this process will likely remain stuck. The longer it remains stuck, the more likely it is to collapse. Jenny Town, managing editor, 38 North It is surprising that they didn't come away with a preliminary deal, as they clearly had the outline for one going into the final round of pre-summit negotiations. The tone of the press conference was relatively positive, indicating that the administration still sees a way forward and intends to continue negotiations. That's encouraging for now, while also offering some relief to those who thought the US would accept a ""bad deal"". However, in the meantime, no concrete obligations have been placed on either side and I would suspect that offers of confidence building measures that we've seen coming from North Korea in the past - such as dismantling of the nuclear test site - are unlikely to continue. Of all the stakeholders in this process, the lack of movement on the US-North Korea agenda puts South Korea in a very awkward position, unable to secure the sanctions exemptions they were hoping for as part of this deal, which would facilitate the resumption of inter-Korean economic cooperation. Moreover, despite the president's stated will to continue negotiating with North Korea, in the current domestic political environment, there is a real risk of the momentum for this issue waning amidst a sea of competing interests. Mr Trump might focus more on domestic policies than North Korea's guns Andray Abrahamian, Stanford University Fundamentally, this summit was supposed to kick off a process through which the two countries were going to try to move to a more win-win relationship, rather than the zero-sum ""I win, you lose"" frame that has dominated US-North Korea relations since, well, forever. As such, you have to say that everybody lost. From Mr Trump's perspective it will be a loss he can weather, however. A ""bad deal"" in which he gave away a lot would inspire years of debate and pushback from US foreign-policy elites. With this, he's spun it as save-able through working-level talks and will head home and the news cycle will move on. This is the risk for North Korea. Momentum is hard to build between these two countries and there is every chance now that Donald Trump becomes distracted by politics in the US and this window of opportunity closes. Who knows who the next president will be and what he or she aspires to with North Korea? Oliver Hotham, managing editor, NK News That the North Koreans went into this agreement demanding ""all sanctions"" be lifted, as Trump said, suggests there is an increasing desperation on the part of Pyongyang for relief, and that they see any other kind of deal as essentially pointless - we'll have to see their response in the coming day. North Korea's economy is suffering severely from the sanctions It is also a major embarrassment for the South Korean government, which had planned a major announcement on the ""Future of Korean peace and prosperity"" tomorrow and had hopes for a major expansion of cooperation with the North in the wake of this summit. China and Russia, too, will be very frustrated with this outcome. The mood in Pyongyang may be tempered, however, by Mr Trump's comments that he will not increase sanctions against the country, and that he would ""love"" to see them lifted in the near future. The message is that while no formal relief is going to happen anytime soon, the days of ""maximum pressure"" are long gone. Olivia Enos, policy analyst, Asian Studies Center, The Heritage Foundation President Trump made the right decision to walk away from a deal. North Korea's ask to remove all sanctions was untenable and also illegal. According to US and UN sanctions, sanctions cannot be removed until complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program takes place and the regime makes human rights improvements. The 80,000 to 120,000 North Korean people inside those prisons camps are being exploited by Kim Jong-un as free labour to fund and architect his nuclear and missile weapons program. Reports indicate that some may even have chemical and biological weapons tested on them. Authorities brutally crack down on any dissent Failure to reach a deal in Hanoi demonstrates the need to craft a more comprehensive policy toward North Korea one that see human rights and denuclearization as interconnected. Future diplomacy, if it's even possible, should reflect the multifaceted nature of current US law. As it happened: Kim and Trump fail to reach deal What missiles has North Korea been testing?

"After the US-North Korea summit talks in Hanoi ended abruptly, President Donald Trump said his stumbling block with Kim Jong-un was over one key point: What North Korea would get in exchange for disabling its Yongbyon nuclear facility. Yongbyon is the site that produces material that could be used in North Korea's nuclear weapons. Long ahead of the Hanoi talks, rumours have swirled that Pyongyang could offer to shut Yongbyon, or parts of it, in exchange for sanctions relief. Melissa Hanham, defence expert at One Earth Future, explains the notorious site which is the heart of North Korea's nuclear programme. The Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Centre is a sprawling campus that primarily serves a military mission - producing fissile material for North Korea's nuclear weapons. Its construction began in 1961, after North Korea reached two nuclear agreements with the Soviet Union. The Kuryong River runs through the campus, and its water is used to cool the adjacent reactors. Some parts of the site hold administrative and scientific support facilities - but it's the reactors and other assets which the US eventually hopes to see dismantled. They include the following. The IRT-2000 reactoris the smallest and oldest reactor at Yongbyon. It was finished in 1965 under the supervision of the Soviet Union and originally used low-enriched uranium for scientific purposes and to produce medical isotopes. Until 1973, the Soviet Union provided the fuel rods to run the reactor, but North Korea later converted the reactor to highly-enriched uranium. Pyongyang claims it can already put nukes on missiles  While this reactor cannot produce much fissile material for North Korea, there is some concern that it could produce isotopes like tritium or lithium deuteride using the nearby isotope production laboratory. Just a few grams of tritium can be used in a warhead to boost its efficiency, thereby allowing for a smaller and lighter design for a missile. Trump-Kim talks break down over sanctions North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis The five megawatt reactoris the most famous reactor in the campus. It was built using illicitly procured designs for the UK's Calder Hall reactor, and completed in 1986. This reactor produced the bulk of the plutonium for North Korea's weapons, and was at the centre of several diplomatic confrontations and breakthroughs. Today, it is capable of operation using water from the nearby Kuryong River. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has had occasional access to the reactor, depending on North Korea's willingness to allow inspectors in. There have been two previous attempts to ""shut down"" the reactor - both later reversed by North Korea when relations soured. In September 2010, satellite imagery revealed the beginnings of large new structure south of the 5 MW Reactor. While it was not initially apparent what the structure was, a party of visiting US scientists was told that it was to bean experimental light water reactorintended for electricity production in 2010. Today, the reactor appears complete externally but is yet to show concrete evidence of operation. No outsiders have visited since its completion. This facility is reallya plutonium reprocessing facilityused to transform spent fuel rods from the reactors into weapons-useable material. North Korea originally told the IAEA that the facility was training nuclear scientists, however the IAEA concluded it was really for reprocessing. The North sees its nuclear capabilities as key to military deterrence The outsized facility was designed to handle plutonium from both the 5 MW reactor and the nearby 50 MW reactor which was abandoned before completion. Satellite imagery shows vehicle activity and construction around the site. However, reprocessing facilities have few signatures that show outsiders when they're operating, or how much plutonium is reprocessed. In 2010 North Korea revealed that it had converted its Fuel Fabrication Facility intoa uranium enrichment facility. Scientists that visited the site estimated that the building contained nearly 2,000 centrifuges. Construction in 2013 doubled the floor space of the facility, but it is unknown whether the number of centrifuges also doubled. The US suspected that North Korea was operating a secret uranium enrichment program fuelled by Pakistani AQ Khan's illicit network for decades. While Yongbyon is the only facility that North Korea has declared, it is widely believed that there are at least two other sites. In 2018, open-source research identified a probable site near Kangson, North Korea. A deal to shut down Yongbyon - or parts of it - would not apply to other enrichment facilities in the country. These facilities are extremely hard to detect and can be hidden easily. Iran chose to build its enrichment facilities underground and in a mountain. It is unlikely that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons. However, if measures are taken to verifiably monitor or even irreversibly dismantle these facilities at Yongbyon, it would mean North Korea is no longer able to produce plutonium or tritium for its nuclear weapons program. Uranium would still be of concern, as only one of the suspected uranium enrichment facilities is at Yongbyon. Nonetheless, this would represent a significant cap to Pyongyang's ability to make additional nuclear warheads.

"Children in custody in England and Wales are being exposed to ""harrowing incidents"" of physical and sexual abuse, a report has found. There were 1,070 reported incidents of abuse between 2009-2017 - many more than previously thought, the child abuse inquiry said. Most claims were made against staff. Inquiry chair, Professor Alexis Jay, said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the accounts heard, and warned children in institutions were still at risk. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) looked at young offender facilities, secure training centres and secure children's homes as part of a wider investigation into child abuse in England and Wales. Many of the incidents involved staff inappropriately touching detainees during body searches or instances of restraint. The report includes examples from adult victims and survivors who were abused as children while in custody, as well as recent examples. Prof Jay said: ""I am also deeply disturbed by the continuing problem of child sexual abuse in these institutions over the last decade. ""It is clear these children, who are some of the most vulnerable in society, are still at risk of sexual abuse. I hope our report and recommendations can help protect them better in future."" Over a thousand incidents of abuse were reported over a seven year period, which is a ""shockingly high"" figure, considering the current population of children in custody is around 900. Pope compares sex abuse to human sacrifice The terror of young offender institutions Government challenged on children's rights The inquiry found children who are detained can be as young as nine-years-old, often come from unhappy and disrupted childhoods, and are ""the most vulnerable in society"". The report examined institutional failures and said cultural factors in custodial institutions could prevent proper prevention, exposure and investigation of child abuse. It said children in detention could often lack credibility due to their age, mental health or offending behaviour. It said the closed nature of institutions meant the normal scrutiny of parents, friends and visitors was not possible. The inquiry heard two weeks of evidence in July last year. It found recent examples of abuse, including an allegation that a female member of staff had abused children at Medway secure training centre in Kent in 2015. At Rainsbrook secure training centre in Warwickshire, members of staff allegedly allowed two young people to go into a bedroom together, knowing that one of the young people was going abuse the other. The report said there was a power imbalance between staff and children, where staff were trained to use force, including ""pain compliance techniques"". They are methods allowed by Ministry of Justice guidance, including manipulating a person's joints or activating pressure points to achieve 'good order and discipline'. For example, staff members may bend a child's thumb or wrist. The report said the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) should prohibit the use of ""pain compliance techniques"", and said it should work with the DFE on policies to safeguard children in institutions. Children were dependent on staff for every part of day-to-day life, including access to privileges, food and visits, it said. The independent inquiry has called for the Department for Education and the Youth Custody service to review whether children who need help for welfare reasons should be placed with children who are in the criminal justice system, and whether this increased the risk of sexual abuse. Justice Minister Edward Argar said the details in the report were shocking. He said the government recognised the need for reform to ensure the safety, welfare and rehabilitation of young people are prioritised. He added: ""We are already conducting an urgent review into safeguarding in the youth estate, rolling out new specialist training for staff and have commissioned an independent review of pain-inducing restraint techniques.""

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""Highly dangerous"" to ask for Brexit delay Environment minister George Eustice has quit the government over Theresa May's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit, if her deal is rejected. The MP said it would be ""dangerous"" to go to the EU ""cap in hand at the 11th hour and beg for an extension"". He feared it could mean a long delay or that Brexit ""may never happen at all"" and said the UK must be prepared to walk away without a deal. The PM said she was focused on leaving the EU with a deal on 29 March. Mr Eustice is a longstanding Brexiteer, who stood as a UKIP MEP candidate before joining the Conservatives. Tory MP Bone denies Brexiteers are split Theresa May offers MPs Brexit delay vote He told the BBC he would back the withdrawal deal the prime minister has negotiated with the EU, despite some reservations. ""I do think it's preferable to have an orderly Brexit and crucially, it's preferable to get Brexit done,"" he said. ""We have to get legally out of the European Union as quickly as possible within this window. If we don't and we end up with a long delay of two years, as some would like, then I really do fear we will be in a disastrous situation and Brexit may never happen at all."" Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who himself quit the government in November, suggested any delay to Brexit would reward the EU for its ""intransigence"" and reduce the chances of getting a deal. ""The issue with delay is at this point in time it weakens our leverage - why would the EU make concessions now?"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""I think from the EU's point of view it signals to them that actually their intransigence pays off and that's the wrong message for the UK to be sending to Brussels at this moment."" Mr Eustice, the MP for Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall, is the 14th member of Theresa May's government to resign over Brexit and said he was doing so with ""tremendous sadness"". But in his resignation letter, he said he feared that the EU would end up ""dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country"". He added: ""We cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door."" By the BBC's Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar George Eustice resigned because he believes Mrs May's been manoeuvred into putting Brexit itself in doubt. For him, the breaking point was allowing MPs to vote on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit, he's one of many Brexiteers who are convinced the danger of a disruptive exit might add to the pressure on the EU to make concessions. And he's especially upset about Mrs May promising a vote on whether to delay Brexit beyond 29 March, if only for a short time. The prime minister was driven to volunteer those concessions by the fear of being defeated in the Commons this week, and having to concede them anyway. Her de-facto deputy David Lidington, and Chief Whip Julian Smith, warned Mrs May plainly that she had no choice. A core of ministers, senior, junior and their parliamentary aides, were willing to sacrifice their jobs if necessary to bring about that defeat. She gave in, and hated doing so. But the fear of George Eustice - shared by other Brexiteers is that once Brexit is delayed, the government loses control. Read John's blog Mr Eustice's resignation comes after Theresa May's decision on Tuesday to allow MPs a vote on delaying the UK's departure from the EU, or ruling out a no-deal Brexit, if they again reject the withdrawal deal she has negotiated with the European Union. The UK scheduled departure date from the EU is still 29 March - but that could be delayed if Theresa May fails to get her deal through Parliament in a vote she has promised will take place on or before 12 March. In her reply, the prime minister said she was sorry he was resigning and praised his work as the longest serving minister at the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs since the department was created, in 2001. She said: ""I agree with you that Parliament must now come together and honour the referendum result by voting for a deal which will give businesses and citizens the certainty they need and deserve. ""Our absolute focus should be on getting a deal that can command support in Parliament and leaving on 29 March. ""It is within our grasp and I am grateful to have your continued support in that important mission.""

"Simone Mastrelli pleaded guilty to unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm A man who left a Liverpool fan in a coma in an attack outside the club's Anfield stadium ahead of a Champions League semi-final tie has been jailed. Simone Mastrelli pleaded guilty to attacking Sean Cox, 53, who was left with brain injuries, before Liverpool played Roma last April. At Preston Crown Court, Mastrelli, 30, from Rome, was jailed for three and a half years. Mr Cox, of Dunboyne, County Meath, suffered severe head injuries. Mastrelli, who was extradited last month after being arrested on a European Arrest Warrant in Italy, picked out Mr Cox because of the Liverpool scarf he was wearing. Sean Cox travelled to Liverpool from Ireland with his brother Martin The balaclava-clad Italian was at the fore of a group of between 50 and 60 of Roma's ""Ultra"" fans - many covering their heads and faces and some carrying belts as weapons. The court heard Mr Cox and his brother, Martin, had ""sadly by pure coincidence"" come across the group in Walton Breck Road, near The Albert pub. Mastrelli knocked Mr Cox unconscious with a single blow to the face. He has been undergoing treatment at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire for a ""profound"" brain injury which has left him unable him to communicate his needs, the court heard. Members of the Liverpool squad held up a banner in support of Sean Cox at a match against Napoli in August Prosecutor Keith Sutton said: ""The reality is that he is unlikely to live independently again."" The court heard that prior to the attack, the sales director was a ""busy husband and father of three children"". Speaking as Mastrelli watched from the dock, Mr Cox's daughter, Shauna, read a personal victim statement. ""Before this brutal and vicious attack my dad was a fit and confident man, a man of integrity with a huge passion for life who represented everything which is good. ""My dad went to watch his beloved team, Liverpool, and he never came home."" Judge Mark Brown said Mastrelli delivered the blow and then ""went into the stadium to enjoy the match, which was particularly callous given what had just happened"". Liverpool fan 'can't talk after attack' Roma fined by Uefa after Liverpool tie 'Hope in hearts' for Liverpool attack fan Mastrelli fought extradition in several appeals before he was brought to the UK last month. Alison Gurden, mitigating, said he was a family man himself and was ""distraught"" at the suffering he had caused. Liverpool later lost to Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final Mastrelli entered a guilty plea to unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Cox. He pleaded not guilty to a separate count of violent disorder, which he was told would lie on file. Another Roma fan, Filippo Lombardi, 21, was cleared in October of inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Cox, although he was jailed for three years for violent disorder. A third man, Daniele Sciusco, 29, from Rome, admitted violent disorder and was jailed in August for two and a half years.

"Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said Luciana Berger had been ""bullied out of her own party"" MP Luciana Berger's decision to quit the party over anti-Semitism was Labour's ""worst day of shame"" in its 120-year history, Tom Watson has said. Labour's deputy leader said Ms Berger had been ""bullied out of her own party by racist thugs"". The Liverpool Wavertree MP is one ofnine MPs to quit Labour, criticising the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. On Wednesday, Labour suspended MP Chris Williamson for saying the party had been ""too apologetic"" on anti-Semitism. Mr Watson said there would be an inquiry into Mr Williamson's conduct. But campaign group Jewish Voice for Labour is calling for his suspension to be rescinded. Labour MP suspended in anti-Semitism row Sajid Javid vows to tackle anti-Semitism The group said he had simply been highlighting figures that showed complaints over the past 10 months had led to 453 cases of anti-Semitism being investigated, which involved a tiny fraction of Labour's membership. ""The existence of anti-Semitism in the party, as everywhere in society, is not in doubt,"" the groupsaid in a statement.,external ""It needs to be contested - and the party's beefed-up disciplinary processes are doing just that. ""But these figures, and the experience of the hundreds of our Jewish members in the Labour Party, give the lie to the false narrative that the party is rife with anti-Semitism. ""Such a description bears no resemblance to reality."" The row comes afterfootage was published by the Yorkshire Post,,externalshowing Mr Williamson, who is a close ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, telling activists Labour had been ""too apologetic"" over anti-Semitism and was being ""demonised as a racist, bigoted party"".

""He's entitled to a fair hearing but I've been very, very concerned that his comments have almost been deliberately inflammatory and causing offence to not just parliamentary colleagues but people in the Jewish community who understandably have a real concern about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A number of Labour MPs welcomed the decision by the party, on Twitter. But Margaret Hodge questioned why it had taken so long to suspend Mr Williamson, adding: ""In the current climate not to show strong, immediate, determined action to stand out anti-Semitism was a mistake. The fact it has finally happened is a relief."" Luciana Berger has joined the Independent Group of MPs Mr Watson said he was seeking a meeting with Mr Corbyn to discuss the party's response to anti-Semitism. He told Today: ""When Luciana Berger left the Labour Party, I thought it was the worst day of shame in the Labour Party's 120-year history - a pregnant young MP bullied out of her own party by racist thugs. ""The one thing I say to my colleagues and half a million Labour Party members is that I am not going to allow them to be tainted by racism, so I am going to speak out on anti-Semitism for as long as it takes to root it out and deal with it.""

"The two boats were still tied up at Clogherhead Harbour in County Louth on Thursday Two Northern Ireland fishing boats have been impounded by the Irish Navy. They were detained in Dundalk Bay on Tuesday for alleged breaches of fishing regulations. It follows the collapse of a gentleman's agreement allowing vessels from NI and the Republic reciprocal access to each other's inshore waters. MPs in Westminster have asked the UK government to explain why the two boats were impounded. Conservative MP Iain Duncan-Smith said the move had happened ""without a huge amount of justification"" while Democratic Unionist Party MP Jim Shannon said he was ""appalled"". This video can not be played Jim Shannon 'appalled' over fishing boats seizure ""The fishing boats are very clearly British fishing boats, they were illegally seized in waters that are disputed, waters that belong to this great nation."" A spokesman for the Irish Navy said the two trawlers had been escorted to Clogherhead by a fisheries protection vessel and handed over to police. The Northern Ireland-registered boats, The Amity and The Boy Joseph, were fishing for crabs, lobsters and whelks. At present, Northern Ireland vessels are banned from fishing inside the Republic of Ireland's six-mile limit. But the Republic's fleet has not been excluded from Northern Ireland waters. Fishing industry representatives have been complaining about the situation since the collapse of the so-called Voisinage Agreement in 2016. They say it is evidence there is already a ""hard border"" in the Irish Sea. Prawn trawlers from Northern Ireland favour the sheltered waters of Dundalk Bay in the winter The agreement collapsed after Irish fisherman challenged its legality in Dublin's Supreme Court and it ruled in their favour. The Irish government promised to legislate to regularise the situation, but it has not yet done so. It has been claimed this is due to the fact it has now become a potential bargaining chip in wider Brexit fisheries negotiations. Prawn trawlers from the Northern Ireland fleet favour the sheltered waters of Dundalk Bay in the winter.

"After the US-North Korea summit talks in Hanoi ended abruptly, President Donald Trump said his stumbling block with Kim Jong-un was over one key point: What North Korea would get in exchange for disabling its Yongbyon nuclear facility. Yongbyon is the site that produces material that could be used in North Korea's nuclear weapons. Long ahead of the Hanoi talks, rumours have swirled that Pyongyang could offer to shut Yongbyon, or parts of it, in exchange for sanctions relief. Melissa Hanham, defence expert at One Earth Future, explains the notorious site which is the heart of North Korea's nuclear programme. The Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Centre is a sprawling campus that primarily serves a military mission - producing fissile material for North Korea's nuclear weapons. Its construction began in 1961, after North Korea reached two nuclear agreements with the Soviet Union. The Kuryong River runs through the campus, and its water is used to cool the adjacent reactors. Some parts of the site hold administrative and scientific support facilities - but it's the reactors and other assets which the US eventually hopes to see dismantled. They include the following. The IRT-2000 reactoris the smallest and oldest reactor at Yongbyon. It was finished in 1965 under the supervision of the Soviet Union and originally used low-enriched uranium for scientific purposes and to produce medical isotopes. Until 1973, the Soviet Union provided the fuel rods to run the reactor, but North Korea later converted the reactor to highly-enriched uranium. Pyongyang claims it can already put nukes on missiles  While this reactor cannot produce much fissile material for North Korea, there is some concern that it could produce isotopes like tritium or lithium deuteride using the nearby isotope production laboratory. Just a few grams of tritium can be used in a warhead to boost its efficiency, thereby allowing for a smaller and lighter design for a missile. Trump-Kim talks break down over sanctions North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis The five megawatt reactoris the most famous reactor in the campus. It was built using illicitly procured designs for the UK's Calder Hall reactor, and completed in 1986. This reactor produced the bulk of the plutonium for North Korea's weapons, and was at the centre of several diplomatic confrontations and breakthroughs. Today, it is capable of operation using water from the nearby Kuryong River. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has had occasional access to the reactor, depending on North Korea's willingness to allow inspectors in. There have been two previous attempts to ""shut down"" the reactor - both later reversed by North Korea when relations soured. In September 2010, satellite imagery revealed the beginnings of large new structure south of the 5 MW Reactor. While it was not initially apparent what the structure was, a party of visiting US scientists was told that it was to bean experimental light water reactorintended for electricity production in 2010. Today, the reactor appears complete externally but is yet to show concrete evidence of operation. No outsiders have visited since its completion. This facility is reallya plutonium reprocessing facilityused to transform spent fuel rods from the reactors into weapons-useable material. North Korea originally told the IAEA that the facility was training nuclear scientists, however the IAEA concluded it was really for reprocessing. The North sees its nuclear capabilities as key to military deterrence The outsized facility was designed to handle plutonium from both the 5 MW reactor and the nearby 50 MW reactor which was abandoned before completion. Satellite imagery shows vehicle activity and construction around the site. However, reprocessing facilities have few signatures that show outsiders when they're operating, or how much plutonium is reprocessed. In 2010 North Korea revealed that it had converted its Fuel Fabrication Facility intoa uranium enrichment facility. Scientists that visited the site estimated that the building contained nearly 2,000 centrifuges. Construction in 2013 doubled the floor space of the facility, but it is unknown whether the number of centrifuges also doubled. The US suspected that North Korea was operating a secret uranium enrichment program fuelled by Pakistani AQ Khan's illicit network for decades. While Yongbyon is the only facility that North Korea has declared, it is widely believed that there are at least two other sites. In 2018, open-source research identified a probable site near Kangson, North Korea. A deal to shut down Yongbyon - or parts of it - would not apply to other enrichment facilities in the country. These facilities are extremely hard to detect and can be hidden easily. Iran chose to build its enrichment facilities underground and in a mountain. It is unlikely that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons. However, if measures are taken to verifiably monitor or even irreversibly dismantle these facilities at Yongbyon, it would mean North Korea is no longer able to produce plutonium or tritium for its nuclear weapons program. Uranium would still be of concern, as only one of the suspected uranium enrichment facilities is at Yongbyon. Nonetheless, this would represent a significant cap to Pyongyang's ability to make additional nuclear warheads.

"This video can not be played A train collided with a buffer stop and burst into flames next to a busy platform The deadly fire at Cairo's main railway station on Wednesday happened because the train driver left the cabin without putting the brakes on, Egypt's public prosecutors believe. They say a preliminary investigation indicates the driver stepped off the train to argue with a colleague. But the driver, who has been arrested, blames corroded brakes, reports say. The train hit a buffer stop at Ramses Station, sparking a huge fire. At least 20 people were killed and 40 injured. The collision caused the train's fuel tank to explode, setting the platform and nearby buildings alight. Egypt country profile Witnesses described seeing several severely burned bodies in the latest disaster to hit Egypt's rundown railways. They say the driver left the moving train to start an altercation with another driver on an adjacent lane over the right of way or a minor incident. The unattended locomotive then sped off and hit the buffer stop. A platform kiosk was engulfed by fire But the driver says the train was faulty otherwise ""it would not have moved by itself"". ""The brakes are corroded and the wheels are corroded,"" the driver is quoted as saying by Egypt's ON TV channel. The privately owned news website al-Shorouk has cited a source as saying the train was undergoing maintenance when it started moving at speed without a conductor. The source adds that this is not the first incident of its kind, explaining that there had been two other cases of a train moving without a conductor that had not resulted in any deaths or injuries. Transport Minister Hisham Arafat resigned hours after Wednesday's disaster. During a visit to the scene, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli vowed to severely punish anyone who was found to have been negligent. ""We will identify who is responsible for the accident and they will be held accountable,"" he said. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi extended his condolences to the families of those who died and pledged to ensure that the injured received the support they needed. Local media published what they said wasCCTV footage showing people on the busy platform as the train hits the buffer at high speed and explodes,external. Another video, taken from a CCTV camera above a nearby subway staircase, appears to showpeople fleeing as a fireball engulfs the platform,external. ""I saw a man pointing from the locomotive as it entered the platform, and screaming 'There are no brakes! There are no brakes!' before he jumped out of the locomotive,"" witness Ibrahim Hussein told Reuters news agency. ""I don't know what happened to him."" The train's fuel tank exploded after the crash Egypt's railway system has a poor safety record, which many observers blame on a lack of investment by successive governments and poor management. In August 2017, 43 people were killed and more than 100 injured whentwo passenger trains collided outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. The country's deadliest rail accident occurred south of Cairo in 2002, whena fire ripped through an overcrowded passenger train,external, killing more than 370 people.

"The app lets users make short videos and set them to music, before sharing with followers Short-form video sharing app TikTok has been handed the largest ever fine for a US case involving children's data privacy. The company has agreed to pay $5.7m (Â£4.3m) and implement new measures to handle users who say they are under 13. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the Musical.ly app, which was later acquired and incorporated into TikTok, knowingly hosted content published by underage users. It has ordered TikTok to delete the data. Additionally, as of Wednesday, TikTok users in the US will be required to verify their age when they open the app. However, like many social networks, age verification is implemented on a trust basis - a person signing up simply has to lie about their date of birth in order to get around the check. ""We care deeply about the safety and privacy of our users,"" the firm said. ""This is an ongoing commitment, and we are continuing to expand and evolve our protective measures in support of this."" Children 'afterthought' for social media companies Mobile app data sharing 'out of control' Despite this, TikTok said it would not be asking existing users in other countries, including the UK, to verify their age as the settlement only applied to the US. After being one of the most downloaded apps of 2018, TikTok has an estimated base of 1 billion users worldwide. But the FTC was concerned about how old some of those users were. Its report said the Musical.ly app had 65 million users in the US, a ""large percentage"" of which were underage. TikTok's parent company, China-based ByteDance, acquired Musical.ly in 2017, and incorporated it into TikTok, discontinuing the original Musical.ly app. The apps allowed members to create short videos, set to music, to share with other users. ""For the first three years [of its existence], Musical.ly didn't ask for the user's age,"" the FTC's statement read. ""Since July 2017, the company has asked about age and prevents people who say they're under 13 from creating accounts. But Musical.ly didn't go back and request age information for people who already had accounts."" The FTC noted media reports suggesting adults on Musical.ly had contacted children who were obviously under 13 because ""a look at users' profiles reveals that many of them gave their date of birth or grade in school"". TikTok users in the US will be required to verify their age when they open the app According to the regulators complaint, Musical.ly was contacted by more than 300 concerned parents in just a two-week period in September 2016. While the profiles of the children involved were subsequently deactivated, the content the child had posted was not deleted. The FTC said TikTok would be fined because of what it saw a Musical.ly's failure to adhere to the basic principles of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as Coppa. Obligations include being upfront in how children's data is collected and used, as well as a mechanism by which to inform parents their child is using the service, and obtain their consent. The company was also said to have not responded adequately to parents' requests to delete data, and subsequently held onto that data for longer than was reasonable. TikTok would not share estimates on how many underage users had been, or still were, on the platform. TikTok's settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt, but the BBC understands the firm does not plan to contest any of the FTC's allegations. The process of deleting the data in question has begun, but the firm could not give an estimate of how long it would take. To comply with regulations in future, TikTok said it was launching an ""experience"" for under-13 users that would strip out much of the functionality of the main app. ""While we've always seen TikTok as a place for everyone, we understand the concerns that arise around younger users,"" the company said. ""In working with the FTC and in conjunction with todayâs agreement, weâve now implemented changes to accommodate younger US users in a limited, separate app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience."" That app experience will disable the ability for users to just about everything TikTok offers, such as ""share their videos on TikTok, comment on others' videos, message with users, or maintain a profile or followers"". TikTok told the BBC it did not plan to provide the under-13 experience to users outside of the US, and instead would continue to limit use to those 13 and above. On social media, panicked TikTok users reported being locked out of their accounts because of making mistakes when entering the date. Users responded by saying the process did not work properly, or that they did not have the required verification. ""I'm sorry but this is ridiculous, I don't have a government ID and I'm 14,â wrote one user on Twitter. The firm admitted it was ""a bit complicated"". ___ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Sophia, Omar and Tahir all opted to have their stomachs removed after finding out they had a cancer gene Three siblings have had their stomachs removed after testing positive for a cancer gene following the deaths of their mother and sister. Tahir Khan, 44, Sophia Ahmed, 39, and Omar Khan, 27, underwent the surgery after a series of tests at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Their mother and sister both died from stomach cancer. The siblings, from Walsall, said the operation had saved their lives and ""eliminated"" the risk. However, Tahir's daughter has now been found to have the same gene. The siblings' mother Pearl Khan was 49 when she died 16 years ago, six months after she was diagnosed. Their 32-year-old sister Yasmin Khan died about six years ago. Latest news from the West Midlands Tahir said: ""We didn't even think about genetic testing at that time but Sophia was very tenacious and worked with Cancer Research UK to get us all tested."" The screening and tests for all four of the remaining siblings, including their other sister Tracy Ismail, 49, took from about 12 months to three years. They identified three of them were carriers and each decided to undergo the operation as a preventative measure. Sophia had the operation first, followed by Tahir and Omar. Tracy, who was the only sibling to find out she did not have the gene, said: ""They told me my results first, so I just thought we would all be the same. ""It was very bittersweet. I was totally devastated. ""At one point we were told that if we hadn't had the testing done, I'd be the only sibling left. ""Knowing what my mum and sister had gone through and so quickly, I encouraged them to have the procedure done, and they're all still here."" The siblings' mum Pearl Khan and sister Yasmin Khan both died from cancer Sophia said: ""I read in my sister Yasmin's notes in hospital that they thought it may be genetic so I did some research and found out the hospital in Cambridge was doing a study with Cancer Research so I contacted them and went from there. ""Everyone thought I was mad until we had the results come back and when we saw it was three of us out of the four, I knew it was worth it."" Sophia said she can ""still eat and do everything"" and added: ""The only issue is maintaining my weight and my vitamin deficiencies but in comparison to having stomach cancer and a few years to live, I can't complain. ""I even had a baby after the operation, they thought I might be malnourished or the baby would be tiny, but everything was absolutely fine."" Cancer Research UK said,externalsome tests are available for an inherited faulty gene that can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Tests forgastric cancer,externalcan include a blood test and chest X-ray, faecal sample testing, an endoscopy, ultrasound scan and laparoscopy. Agastrectomy,externalis the name of the procedure of removing part or all of the stomach. During the procedure, a small pouch is created by connecting the gullet to either the small intestine or the remaining section of stomach. This means that the patient will still have a working digestive system, although it will not function as well as it did before. For about two weeks after the operation patients are fed through a tube into the vein, but eventually will be able to eat most foods and liquids. However, people who have had the procedure will need to eat more frequently and smaller portions, rather than three large meals a day, and take vitamin supplements to get the right amount of nutrition. Now, the food the siblings eat goes into a ""small pouch"" that was made by connecting the oesophagus to the intestine. ""I used to be 15st but now I'm only just over 10,"" Tahir said. ""I have to graze constantly because my body just can't get the nutrients it needs otherwise. ""My brother, on the other hand, he still eats like a horse."" Omar has a different view of the procedure. He said: ""At first after everything with my mum and sister I didn't want anything to do with hospitals or doctors or anything like that. ""But seeing my Sophia go through the procedure and have a baby afterwards, I thought 'I've got no excuse'. ""It was a really hard decision for me but it was the best one I've ever made. ""I still can eat whatever I like - burgers, steaks - the only thing I get is exhaustion and cold sweats but I'm still breathing and I'm so thankful for that."" The screening and tests for all of the siblings took from about 12 months to three years However, Tahir's daughter, Farah, who is 21, has since tested positive for the gene too. He said: ""I am worried about my daughter's future, but I say to her we have all gone through it and are fine now, so whatever happens she'll be OK."" Tahir underwent his surgery five and a half years ago after his test found he had clusters of cancerous cells in his stomach lining. ""They said I effectively had cancer but because it was contained in my stomach lining and I had all that removed, it eliminated it. I could have had only days, weeks, maybe a year maximum left before I would have been diagnosed with terminal cancer. ""There's no doubt in my mind that having the tests and the procedure done saved my life."" Dad's dilemma over genetic cancer test Breast removal sisters to lose ovaries Dad meets baby born three hours before he dies Dr Marc Tischkowitz, consultant physician in medical genetics at the University of Cambridge, said: ""This is a very rare, specific type of stomach cancer. ""It's a gene that carriers can have for their lifetime and means that they are at risk of developing cancer any time.""

"Engineering giant Rolls-Royce swung into loss last year, as it increased the charge for fixing problems with its Trent 1000 engines. The company also took a charge of Â£186m after Airbus said it was stopping production of its A380 superjumbo aircraft. Rolls-Royce reported a pre-tax loss of Â£2.9bn for 2018, down from a profit of Â£3.89bn the previous year. The firm also withdrew a bid to supply an engine for a new Boeing plane. The company's shares were the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 - down more than 4% at one point. Underlying operating profit, which strips out the exceptional items, jumped 71% to Â£633m, up from Â£317m in 2017. ""Underlying financial results are ahead of expectations, with good growth in profit and cash flow. Following the restructuring we announced in June last year we are starting to see the crucial behavioural changes needed to sustain our momentum,"" chief executive Warren East said. The company announced last summer that it was cutting 4,600 jobsover two years as part of a major reorganisation. May's deal 'better than no deal': Rolls boss Rolls-Royce profits hit by engine faults Last year, a fault with Rolls-Royce's Trent 1000 engines grounded planes at British Airways and other airlines. The engine powers Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. At the time, the company said the issues would take ""some years"" to fix. It said parts in its Trent 1000 engines were wearing out faster than expected but that it ""had a solution"" to the problem. In its results statement, Rolls-Royce said it had increased the charge it had taken on fixing problems with its Trent 1000 engines to Â£790m, up from Â£554m. Rolls-Royce also said that following the Airbus decision to stop delivery of the A380 in 2021 it had assessed the impact on its Trent 900 engine programme and associated customers and suppliers. As a result it had recorded an exceptional item of Â£186m in the 2018 results which ""relates to onerous contracts, tooling write-offs and the acceleration of depreciation and amortisation on associated Trent 900 programme assets"". The company is refocusing its business on civil aerospace, defence and power systems. However, it has said it will no longer compete to supply engines for Boeing's proposed new mid-sized jetliner to fill a gap between the narrow and wide-body aircraft. ""We are unable to commit to the proposed timetable to ensure we have a sufficiently mature product which supports Boeing's ambition for the aircraft,"" Rolls-Royce said. Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst George Salmon said many parts of Rolls-Royce were operating more efficiently than they had in the last few years, ""but Warren East hasn't quite got Rolls-Royce firing on all cylinders"". There were ""bright spots"", he said, such as a Â£611m net cash position and Â£568m of free cash flow, ""a critical figure for Rolls since management put it front and centre of the investment case"". However, he added: ""While Rolls deserves credit for freeing up cash by changing its supplier terms, much of the improvement is being driven by extra upfront payments and Â£70m of restructuring costs have been excluded. ""While these results look strong, the multitude of adjustments and mitigating factors mean we think the champagne will have to stay on ice for now.""

"London-focused estate agent Foxtons has swung to a loss and says the housing market in the capital is in a ""prolonged downturn"". The company reported a loss of Â£17.2m for last year,external, partly due to the costs of closing six offices. It made a profit of Â£6.5m in 2017. Foxtons added that Brexit uncertainty was ""impacting consumer confidence"". Separately,the Nationwide said the UK market remained ""subdued"",external, with prices up 0.4% in February from a year ago. Foxtons said annual revenues fell 5% to Â£111.5m, with the weakness in property sales being offset slightly by a ""resilient lettings performance"". The estate agent was pushed into the red by one-off charges of Â£15.7m, which included the costs of closing six offices: Beckenham, Enfield, Loughton, Ruislip, Park Lane and Barnes. Foxtons said it was able to cover 85% of London from 61 branches and had no current plans for further closures. ""Our performance in 2018 was impacted by a further deterioration in the sales market, with transaction levels falling for another year from their already low levels,"" said chief executive Nic Budden. However, the company said that in the long term, London remained ""a highly attractive property market"". The Nationwide said that house prices in February dipped 0.1% from the month before, with the average property now costing Â£211,304. The Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, said: ""Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but survey data suggests that sentiment has softened. ""Measures of consumer confidence weakened around the turn of the year and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer enquiries over the same period. ""While the number of properties coming onto the market also slowed, this doesn't appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.""

"Ian Paisley made the comments during the Northern Ireland Affairs committee A DUP MP has accused the children's commissioner and an education expert of talking Northern Ireland ""right into the gutter"". Ian Paisley made the comments in response to claims by Sir Robert Salisbury. Sir Robert previously reported on education funding in Northern Ireland for the Department of Education (DE). He said some of NI's top schools are ""exam factories"" which can create stress for pupils, but do very well. Children's Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma was also giving evidence on Wednesday. At one point during the hearing Ian Paisley MP said Sir Robert was ""talking my country down"". ""I've only been in the room 20 minutes, but I must say I feel you've talked Northern Ireland right into the gutter,"" he said. ""Congratulations, if I was a child listening to this I'd be depressed listening to you two."" Sir Robert Salisbury previously reported on education funding in Northern Ireland for the Department of Education Sir Robert told BBC Radio Ulster on Wednesday that despite Mr Paisley's comments, there is ""a long rump of under-achievement in Northern Ireland"". He added: ""Many children are not getting the qualifications and the start in life that they deserve"". ""We can bury our heads in the sand and try to convince ourselves that the problem doesn't exist, or we can try to do something about it."" The Northern Ireland Affairs committee of MPs is holding an inquiry into education funding in Northern Ireland. At the meeting, Sir Robert said it was an ""enduring myth"" that Northern Ireland had one of the best education systems in Europe. ""It has a long tail of underachievement and that long tail of underachievement is still there and it's stubbornly there, and it's not really being tackled,"" he said. ""The school system - the success of it - should be measured on how it treats the least able youngsters in its society, not how it treats the most able. ""Some of the top schools in Northern Ireland for the top students do extremely - well, often they're exam factories which creates the stress but they do very well."" Later, in response to a query from Lady Hermon, Sir Robert conceded that the term ""exam factories"" was ""a bit harsh"". ""I was getting at schools that spoon-feed their students to pass exams at the end,"" explained Sir Robert. Mr Paisley subsequently said that the term exam factories was ""derisory"" and ""dismisses a significant number of high-achieving young adults in Northern Ireland"". Meanwhile, Ms Yiasouma replied: ""When a high-achieving 10 A-star student tells me that they attend an exam factory it's not for me to say that they don't, it's for me to say why is that and how can that be different."" Ms Yiasouma also told the committee that academic selection was the ""biggest injustice in our education system"". ""If Northern Ireland is to have a shared future we need to educate Protestant and Catholic children and our increasingly diverse community together and we need to educate our boys and girls together, but for me the greatest injustice is what we do to our children from socially disadvantaged areas,"" she said. ""It's not a fair education system."" ""Ask any child who goes to a non-selective school, who comes from a poorer community and they are like the child with their nose to the sweetie shop and they can't afford to go in."" Koulla Yiasouma is Northern Ireland's Children's Commissioner Sir Robert said that there were too many schools - especially small ones - in Northern Ireland. ""We clearly have far too many types of schools, we have far too many tiny schools and we have been living beyond our means for a long time,"" he said. ""The money is spread too thinly - this funding crisis we have now was inevitable."" ""Schools have cut down as much as they can at the moment but there's a point at which they can't manage."" Ms Yiasouma said that the number of different types of schools had contributed to a ""crisis"" in education. ""We have an unsustainable education system,"" she said. ""Some of that unsustainability is because of our multi-sectors that we have, but we're not going to overcome that any time soon."" Mr Campbell said he would support reform within the education system DUP MP Gregory Campbell said that a ""Bengoa-style overhaul"" of the education system would be widely supported - referring to a review of Northern Ireland's health service. ""Some of our schools are at the top end in the United Kingdom,"" he said. ""But for me that's not good enough - that simply isn't good enough."" Meanwhile, Lady Hermon said there was ""optimism"" that there would soon be a settlement in anongoing pay dispute with teachers. But Ms Yiasouma called for central government to fund any pay rise, as she said schools could not cover it from their existing budgets.

"US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un have failed to reach a deal Mr Trump said the talks failed over North Korean sanctions demands The US president said there hadn't been enough progress on denuclearisation for the US to agree They were following up on their historic meeting last year in Singapore, which delivered a vague but optimistic agreement The main topic of discussion was whether North Korea will ever agree to give up its nuclear weapons There has been no word from Mr Kim following the talks Got questions about the summit? Tweet us @BBCNewsAsia Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Rebecca Seales and Kevin Ponniah That's it from our coverage of this extraordinary day. Most analysts and media had been expecting at least some small deal to emerge from the second round of talks between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un - perhaps a loose peace declaration (but the Korean War is still not over), or North Korea agreeing to close its Yongbyon plant (which instead will keep producing fissile material for nuclear weapons), or an agreement on sanctions (which will continue to stop North Korea from trading or interacting freely with the outside world). Instead, Mr Trump emerged with little more than nice words, saying: ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times."" The sticking point was sanctions, he said. ""They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that."" Thanks for following us today. We'll keep bringing you the latest news and analysis onthe BBC News website. South Korea's president says it is ""regrettable"" that the talks failed, but that the leaders ""have made more meaningful progress than at any time prior"". His full statement says Mr Kim and Mr Trump ""expanded the scope and depth of their understanding"" and that Mr Trump had expressed commitment to continuing talks. President Moon Jae-in says suggestions the discussions of sanctions relief shows the relationship has been ""raised to a new level"". The rather muted statement ends with hoping for ""active dialogue"" and says South Korea will help both parties ""maintain momentum for dialogue"". It would be fair to say this isn't the statement Moon Jae-in hoped to be sending today. One thing to remember amid all the debriefing is that we have not yet heard from the North Koreans. Mr Kim did not give a press conference like Mr Trump, of course, and it may be some time before we get a sense of how he and his delegation responded, or what their demands were of Mr Trump. From BBC Monitoring Mr Trump has already left on his plane to go back home but what about Mr Kim? Well, his armoured train - on which he travelled to Vietnam - is supposedly undergoing maintenance service in China, so heâll probably have to take a flight if he wants to leave early.South Korean media outlets report that his olive-green train is currently stationed in Nanning,external, China, located close to Hanoi. The Yonhap news agency speculates that the train could be parked somewhere in China, such as Beijing or Guangzhou, where Kim could board it after flying to the area.http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/02/103_264594.html We've had word that on board Air Force One Mr Trump is making his likely quite tricky phone call to South Korea's Moon Jae-in, a man who has invested much in rapprochement with North Korea. Joel Wit, a former State Department official who has negotiated often with North Korea and now runs the 38 North research group has this take on the summit outcome. Allow Twitter content?

If you want to indulge yourself and read the full text of the press conference Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo gave after their unproductive talks, the people atVox are one of several sites to have written it up,external. The North Korean leader is set to spend more time in Vietnam - and will begin an official two-day visit on Friday, the Vietnamese foreign ministry has said. Mr Kim is expected to tour economic sites to learn from the one-party communist state, which maintains extremely tight control and stifles dissent, while having a thriving market economy. The North Korean leader will then have a long train ride back home. It took him two days to travel to Vietnam.

In any case - Kim Jong-un doesn't look too happy with that particular specimen. We've got the first response from South Korea - which of course is deeply invested in this process. The government says the failure to reach a deal is ""disappointing"" but adds that progress made was ""more than ever"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Several of you have asked us on Facebook about landmines and the DMZ. Victoria Telford asks: ""Denuclearisation is likely to be a long slow process if it happens, but clearing the highly symbolic border zone of over a million landmines would be a huge peace-building step. It would be a powerful statement of peace to rid that area of landmines, especially if a humanitarian de-mining group were to do it. Is this on the table for discussion?"" We asked the BBC's Laura Bicker: ""North and South Korea have been working to de-mine small parts of the DMZ. Firstly to enable teams to look for the remains [of the war dead and others killed in the area] and also to turn the Joint Security Area - the area around the blue huts - into a tourist zone.""This is something they do alongside and with the permission of the UN Command at the DMZ. The hope is more of this work will take place between the two Koreas. But they donât need Donald Trumpâs permission for this."" Hope that helps, Victoria. Some of what the US president said earlier This video can not be played Donald Trump on talks with Kim Jong-un: 'Sometimes you have to walk' Air Force One has lifted off. Vietnamese officials at the airport are making the most of history and getting a quick group photo in front of Air Force One before it takes off. President Trump said he would call South Korea's President Moon Jae-in from the plane. That may be a tricky phone call. The BBC's Robin Brant, who's in Seoul, says the abrupt end to the Hanoi summit will inevitably knock the momentum Mr Moon has built with his enthusiastic support for the talks and closer links between the two Koreas. ""The truth is that much closer economic co-operation is predicated on an end to UN sanctions, which we now know wonât happen soon. But President Moon will push on with plans to link up cross-border road and rail knowing heâs got what he wants most: a stable security environment. According to Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un promised no new nuclear or missile testing."" Unexpectedly, there's been huge peak in interest in Otto Warmbier after his sad case was brought up at the press conference with Mr Trump. Lots of people are Googling his name wanting to know the story behind that question.Here's our story from 2017 on how a student trip ended in jail and death. Mr Trump is clearly not spending a minute more in Hanoi - he's at the airport now, saying goodbye to his Vietnamese hosts. We haven't heard anything from Kim Jong-un - so our understanding of what happened today is only based on what President Trump has said. But what will the North Korean regime tell its people?

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Now that we know that the sanctions on North Korea were the deal-breaker, what could Pyongyang do next? In his 2019 New Yearâs speech, Kim Jong-un had said that North Korea could be forced to adopt a ânew wayâ if the US did not lift sanctions. What that could entail is up for debate. Here's what he said:  Only if the United States does not keep its promise made in front of the world, misjudges our people's patience, tries to unilaterally force us to do something, and continues with sanctions and pressure on our Republic, we might have no choice but to be obliged to reluctantly seek a new way to defend the country's sovereignty and the state's supreme interest and achieve peace and stability on the Korean peninsulaâ Kim Jong-un Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mistakes that led to child sexual grooming scandals are being repeated with gangs, a report by the Children's Commissioner for England has warned. It estimates there are 27,000 children aged between 10 and 17 in England who identify as being part of a gang. Anne Longfield said gangs were using ""sophisticated techniques"" to groom vulnerable children and using ""chilling levels of violence"" to retain them. The Home Office said it was ""committed to protecting vulnerable children"". The report adds that 313,000 children know a gang member - and, of those, 34,000 have experienced violent crime. Reality Check: Counting the kids in gangs The children forced to sell drugs 'Everybody thinks it's only boys who join gangs' Child sexual exploitation: How the system failed Ms Longfield said those suffering from mental health issues or abuse and neglect in their family life were particularly susceptible to grooming from gangs. A street gang is defined as a group of young people who hang around together and have a specific area or territory, have a name or other identifier, possibly have rules or a leader, and who may commit crimes together. Sarah - not her real name - became involved in a gang when she was 12, following a period of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of a family member. Now 14, she told BBC Radio 5 live that she began by doing drugs such as cocaine with a gang before going on to sell drugs for them - sometimes walking for up to three hours at a time to sell ""the tiniest bit of weed"". This video can not be played 'Sarah' describes how she was caught up in gangs and dealing drugs - interview voiced by an actor Her brother, who is two years older than her, was also involved. ""Cos we were so young and we were getting money, we were like, 'Yes, money's rolling in,'"" she said. ""We were still both innocent to what was happening because we still both didn't really understand what was going on."" But Sarah was also regularly drinking alcohol and doing drugs, and eventually reached a point where she would ""sleep with someone just to get money or just to get a bit of weed"". ""It got to that stage where it was really bad and then obviously that's when the police had to step in."" Looking back, Sarah, who is no longer in the gang, says she ""hated"" who she was - ""I was violent, I was just a horrible person."" Researchers said that, for some children, gang membership represents little more than a loose social connection and not all young members are involved in crime or serious violence. ""For many children, involvement in these gangs is not a voluntary act,"" the report added. ""In some areas children are considered members of a gang based purely on their location, their family or their wider associations."" This video can not be played Matthew, who was groomed as a child, talks about how he ended up grooming children himself Gangs have sought to diversify their recruitment as police have become better at spotting ""traditional"" members, the paper found. It said techniques for recruiting children are similar to grooming for sexual abuse - as exposed by child abuse scandals in cities includingRotherham,OxfordandHuddersfield- starting with ""inducements"". In one case, there was said to have been a ""written manual"" setting out a clear timeframe for entrapment. Ms Longfield said gangs then use ""chilling levels of violence"" to keep them compliant. ""Rather than seeing this as a lifestyle choice that these children are involved in, I want people to see that they are vulnerable children that are being groomed and need protecting,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The report's estimate of the number of children in gangs was calculated using figures from the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) annual crime survey, which asks a representative sample of households about their experience of crime. For the past three years, it has asked children aged 10 to 15 whether they considered themselves to be a member of a street gang. This figure was then scaled up to give a number for the whole population for a single year. However the report says that only about 6,500 children involved in gangs are actually known to authorities. ""Many local areas are not facing up to the scale of the problem,"" Ms Longfield said. She added that warning signs such as missing school and turning up at A&E with knife wounds were not being acted on and very little help was available for parents who asked for it. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Corey Junior Davis - known as CJ - was shot at close range in a Newham playground in 2017 When 14-year-old Corey Junior Davis - known by his family as CJ - told social services that he needed protection from violent gang members who wanted to coerce him into selling drugs, he was treated as a criminal, not a victim. CJ was a bright young man - but his severe form of ADHD led to him being excluded from his secondary school. His behaviour worsened - and at the pupil referral unit where he was supposed to be safe, gangs circled as they looked for new recruits they could control. He was so scared he ordered a bulletproof vest and ""Rambo"" style knife for ""protection"". But when he found the courage to reveal to the authorities how he was being targeted, nobody acted to genuinely protect him. In September 2017, he was shot and killed in what remains an unsolved murder. An official review found that his local authority completely failed to act on the cries for help from both CJ and his mother, Keisha McLeod. Today, Ms McLeod says nothing has been learned from her son's awful death. And that's why the Children's Commissioner's warning is so important. Responding to the report, the NSPCC said: ""Until recently, sexually exploited children were seen as part of the problem and complicit in joining gangs. We cannot afford to make that mistake this time around. ""When authorities come into contact with young people in criminal cases, they must understand how coercion and grooming has lured and trapped these children into committing crime."" Fellow children's charity Barnardo's added: ""It's worrying that many children involved in gangs are not known to services. ""Seriously stretched police and social workers are struggling to support growing numbers of children with complex needs, and help is rarely offered before they reach crisis point."" The Children's Commissioner is now calling on the government to make child criminal exploitation a ""national priority"". In response, a government statement said: ""We have proposed a new statutory duty on partners across education, social services and health to work together to tackle violence as part of a public health approach, and are providing Â£220m to support children and young people at risk of becoming involved in violence and gangs."" When contacted by the BBC, the children's commissioner for Northern Ireland said it did not have data on how many children were involved in gangs, adding that young people were more likely to be involved in paramilitary groups. The children's commissioner for Wales also had not collected data on the number of young people in gangs, but said it was taking a ""proactive approach"" to the issue and held regular nationwide meetings with children's groups. ""Resulting from that we are working with agencies like the police to work in a child centred way, respecting all of their human rights."" The commissioner for Scotland referred the BBC to astudy,externalthat concluded incidents involving gangs of young people using weapons in public places in the country were declining.

"Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman Dramatic new details have emerged about the capture of Indian air force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman by Pakistani forces. People in Horran village threw stones at the pilot, who fired several warning shots, eyewitnesses told the BBC. The jet was shot down in Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Wednesday after a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani warplanes. Pakistan released the pilot on Friday. Prime Minister Imran Khan revealed the decision in parliament after a speech in which he said Pakistan was focused on de-escalation. India struck militant camps in Pakistan on Tuesday after an attack on its security forces earlier this month. Pakistan said it had no choice but to retaliate with air strikes on Wednesday. Horran's village chief recounted Wednesday's dramatic capture in an interview with the BBC. ""My objective was to capture the pilot alive. I had seen the Indian flag on his parachute and knew he was Indian,"" said Mohammad Razzaq Chaudhry. The 58-year-old said he saw the MiG-21 fighter jet getting hit and falling to the ground on Wednesday morning. He said he had rushed to the spot as other villagers also headed there. Pakistan 'to free Abhinandan' Who is the Indian pilot captured by Pakistan? India demands Pakistan release pilot ""I was afraid they will harm him or he would harm them,"" said Mr Chaudhry, who is affiliated with Prime Minister Imran Khan's PTI party. On reaching the site, he heard the pilot ask some of the villagers whether he had landed in India - and one of them, a quick-thinking young boy, said yes. Pakistan's information ministry tweeted a video purporting to show a captured Indian pilot ""He unbuckled himself from his parachute and raised patriotic slogans but the boys around him responded by saying, 'Long live Pakistan!' That is when he pulled out his gun and fired in the air to scare them."" But, Mr Chaudhry added, this caused the men around the pilot to become aggressive. He said they picked up stones and as they hurled them at him, he started to run while firing more shots in the air. ""The boys chased him until he fell into a stream and one of my nephews who was also armed shot him in the leg,"" Mr Chaudhry said. ""My nephew asked him to drop his pistol, which he did. Then someone else caught him and pinned him down to prevent him from using any other weapon that he might have."" India and Pakistan in 'uncharted waters' Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it He said the pilot then pulled out papers from his pocket and tried to stuff them all in his mouth to destroy them. But the villagers were able to snatch some of the papers from him, which they later gave to the army. ""Our boys were angry and continued to force their way closer to him to punch and slap him, though some of them tried to stop the aggressors. I also told them not to harm him, to leave him alone until the army officers arrived."" This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet After a dogfight in disputed Kashmir on Wednesday morning, India had initially said that all of its pilots were accounted for, contradicting Pakistani claims that they had captured a pilot. But Pakistan's information ministry then released - and later deleted - a video showing the pilot blindfolded and with blood on his face. In later footage, Wing Commander Abhinandan could be seen sipping tea. He appeared to have been cleaned up and said Pakistani officers were treating him well. His capture is being seen as a major setback for India. Correspondents say there is speculation that the pilot could be released soon into Indian custody as diplomatic pressure on Pakistan continues to build. On Thursday US President Donald Trump became the latest world leader to appeal to the two countries to pursue peace. He said he had ""reasonably decent"" news from India and Pakistan, sparking hopes that tensions could de-escalate. Both India and Pakistan have said that they are not looking for war.

"Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will back another EU referendum after his alternative Brexit plan was again defeated in the Commons. But the Labour leader said he will also continue to push for ""other available options"" including a general election. John McDonnell said the party would table an amendment for a referendum when the ""meaningful vote"" on Theresa May's deal returns to Parliament. The shadow chancellor also told ITV's Peston show he would vote for remain. It came as MPs voted to endorse Theresa May's Brexit strategy - but only after she made a series of concessions. Brexit next steps: How did my MP vote? Kuenssberg: Numbers lesson for May and Corbyn Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Brexitcast - Boring people into submission The PM also faced a Brexiteer rebellion, after 20 Tory MPs voted against proposals, backed by the government, to delay the UK's 29 March departure date if there is a no-deal scenario. But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was not among the 20 Tory rebels, although he did abstain in the vote, offered an olive branch to Mrs May, as she continues to seek concessions from the EU on the controversial Irish backstop clause. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tories said he disagreed with those who were demanding changes to the legal text of the withdrawal agreement and would accept an appendix to it. Is Jacob Rees-Mogg softening his stance? Writing in The Daily Mail,external, he said: ""I really do not mind what form of words the Attorney General and the EU agree on regarding the backstop - as long as it expires before the next election and has the same legal status as the deal."" Other leading figures in the ERG, including deputy chairman Steve Baker, have previously dismissed the legal annex to Mrs May's agreement being negotiated by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. Labour's Brexit proposals - which would see the UK join an EU customs union - were defeated by 323 votes to 240, a bigger margin than the last time MPs voted on them. Mr Corbyn confirmed to MPs on Monday he wouldback another public vote if such a defeat took place- after resisting calls to do so from pro-EU Labour MPs. After Wednesday's vote, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will back a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome. ""We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election."" Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson have put forward a compromise plan to back Mrs May's deal with the condition that it is then put to a confirmatory public vote. Former shadow cabinet minister Owen Smith, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, said: ""Now that Labour's version of Brexit has been rejected by Parliament, I expect Jeremy Corbyn to throw his full weight behind campaigning for a public vote."" Labour MP David Lammy, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for another referendum, said: ""It's become clear today that there is no majority in the House for May's deal, but also that Labour's alternative plan cannot command a majority either. ""In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no-deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government's botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal."" But Labour former minister Caroline Flint said the party should not back a further referendum despite the defeat of Mr Corbyn's plan. She said: ""I think the British public want us to get on with this and sort out a deal that works."" She said Labour's leadership should ""engage in negotiation, to use the leverage you have got, to get a better deal"". MPs also rejected an SNP motion saying the UK should not leave the EU without a deal ""under any circumstances"" - by 324 votes to 288. Labour MP Yvette Cooper's amendment, which the government supported, was backed by 502 votes to 20, with a small group of Tory Brexiteers voting against it. The amendment contained Mrs May's commitment on giving MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if both her deal and no-deal are rejected by MPs. Mrs May announced this policy as she promised MPs a meaningful vote on her deal by 12 March - just 17 days before the UK is set to leave the EU. The move was designed to head off a possible defeat when MPs voted on Ms Cooper's amendment. This video can not be played Did Theresa May's latest statement rule out a no-deal Brexit, and what might happen next? Ms Cooper did not drop her amendment, because she wanted to hold the prime minister to her word - although the government has said it accepted the proposal. Conservative MP Alberto Costa's amendment, which seeks to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa, even if there is a no-deal Brexit, was nodded through by MPs, after the government said they supported it. Mr Costa said he was still forced to resign as an aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell because of a convention that members of the government cannot table amendments to government motions. Conservative MP Caroline Spelman opted not to put her amendment - calling for the PM's promise to give MPs a vote on delaying Brexit to be made legally binding - to the vote, after reassurances by the government. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis accused Jeremy Corbyn of being ""happy to ignore the biggest democratic vote in our nation's history"" by saying he would back another referendum.

"US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un have failed to reach a deal Mr Trump said the talks failed over North Korean sanctions demands The US president said there hadn't been enough progress on denuclearisation for the US to agree They were following up on their historic meeting last year in Singapore, which delivered a vague but optimistic agreement The main topic of discussion was whether North Korea will ever agree to give up its nuclear weapons There has been no word from Mr Kim following the talks Got questions about the summit? Tweet us @BBCNewsAsia Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Rebecca Seales and Kevin Ponniah That's it from our coverage of this extraordinary day. Most analysts and media had been expecting at least some small deal to emerge from the second round of talks between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un - perhaps a loose peace declaration (but the Korean War is still not over), or North Korea agreeing to close its Yongbyon plant (which instead will keep producing fissile material for nuclear weapons), or an agreement on sanctions (which will continue to stop North Korea from trading or interacting freely with the outside world). Instead, Mr Trump emerged with little more than nice words, saying: ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times."" The sticking point was sanctions, he said. ""They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that."" Thanks for following us today. We'll keep bringing you the latest news and analysis onthe BBC News website. South Korea's president says it is ""regrettable"" that the talks failed, but that the leaders ""have made more meaningful progress than at any time prior"". His full statement says Mr Kim and Mr Trump ""expanded the scope and depth of their understanding"" and that Mr Trump had expressed commitment to continuing talks. President Moon Jae-in says suggestions the discussions of sanctions relief shows the relationship has been ""raised to a new level"". The rather muted statement ends with hoping for ""active dialogue"" and says South Korea will help both parties ""maintain momentum for dialogue"". It would be fair to say this isn't the statement Moon Jae-in hoped to be sending today. One thing to remember amid all the debriefing is that we have not yet heard from the North Koreans. Mr Kim did not give a press conference like Mr Trump, of course, and it may be some time before we get a sense of how he and his delegation responded, or what their demands were of Mr Trump. From BBC Monitoring Mr Trump has already left on his plane to go back home but what about Mr Kim? Well, his armoured train - on which he travelled to Vietnam - is supposedly undergoing maintenance service in China, so heâll probably have to take a flight if he wants to leave early.South Korean media outlets report that his olive-green train is currently stationed in Nanning,external, China, located close to Hanoi. The Yonhap news agency speculates that the train could be parked somewhere in China, such as Beijing or Guangzhou, where Kim could board it after flying to the area.http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/02/103_264594.html We've had word that on board Air Force One Mr Trump is making his likely quite tricky phone call to South Korea's Moon Jae-in, a man who has invested much in rapprochement with North Korea. Joel Wit, a former State Department official who has negotiated often with North Korea and now runs the 38 North research group has this take on the summit outcome. Allow Twitter content?

The North Korean leader is set to spend more time in Vietnam - and will begin an official two-day visit on Friday, the Vietnamese foreign ministry has said. Mr Kim is expected to tour economic sites to learn from the one-party communist state, which maintains extremely tight control and stifles dissent, while having a thriving market economy. The North Korean leader will then have a long train ride back home. It took him two days to travel to Vietnam.

Several of you have asked us on Facebook about landmines and the DMZ. Victoria Telford asks: ""Denuclearisation is likely to be a long slow process if it happens, but clearing the highly symbolic border zone of over a million landmines would be a huge peace-building step. It would be a powerful statement of peace to rid that area of landmines, especially if a humanitarian de-mining group were to do it. Is this on the table for discussion?"" We asked the BBC's Laura Bicker: ""North and South Korea have been working to de-mine small parts of the DMZ. Firstly to enable teams to look for the remains [of the war dead and others killed in the area] and also to turn the Joint Security Area - the area around the blue huts - into a tourist zone.""This is something they do alongside and with the permission of the UN Command at the DMZ. The hope is more of this work will take place between the two Koreas. But they donât need Donald Trumpâs permission for this."" Hope that helps, Victoria. Some of what the US president said earlier This video can not be played Donald Trump on talks with Kim Jong-un: 'Sometimes you have to walk' Air Force One has lifted off. Vietnamese officials at the airport are making the most of history and getting a quick group photo in front of Air Force One before it takes off. President Trump said he would call South Korea's President Moon Jae-in from the plane. That may be a tricky phone call. The BBC's Robin Brant, who's in Seoul, says the abrupt end to the Hanoi summit will inevitably knock the momentum Mr Moon has built with his enthusiastic support for the talks and closer links between the two Koreas. ""The truth is that much closer economic co-operation is predicated on an end to UN sanctions, which we now know wonât happen soon. But President Moon will push on with plans to link up cross-border road and rail knowing heâs got what he wants most: a stable security environment. According to Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un promised no new nuclear or missile testing."" Unexpectedly, there's been huge peak in interest in Otto Warmbier after his sad case was brought up at the press conference with Mr Trump. Lots of people are Googling his name wanting to know the story behind that question.Here's our story from 2017 on how a student trip ended in jail and death. Mr Trump is clearly not spending a minute more in Hanoi - he's at the airport now, saying goodbye to his Vietnamese hosts. We haven't heard anything from Kim Jong-un - so our understanding of what happened today is only based on what President Trump has said. But what will the North Korean regime tell its people?

In his 2019 New Yearâs speech, Kim Jong-un had said that North Korea could be forced to adopt a ânew wayâ if the US did not lift sanctions. What that could entail is up for debate. Here's what he said:  Only if the United States does not keep its promise made in front of the world, misjudges our people's patience, tries to unilaterally force us to do something, and continues with sanctions and pressure on our Republic, we might have no choice but to be obliged to reluctantly seek a new way to defend the country's sovereignty and the state's supreme interest and achieve peace and stability on the Korean peninsulaâ Kim Jong-un Â© 2025 BBC.

"Customers suffered dozens of digital banking shutdowns last year, according to new figures that reveal the scale of banks' IT problems for the first time. UK banks have begun publishing the number of operational and security incidents that have occurred, under a voluntary scheme overseen by the financial regulator. The data reveals major banks typically suffer well over one outage a month. Barclays reported the most problems, but said many were minor incidents. Which banks do customers love or hate? NatWest worker told customer 'vegans should be punched' Banks were told by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to show evidence of the quality of the service they were providing. The aim was to make it easier for customers to compare what banks were offering and to switch accounts. As a result, banks nowpublish details,externalon their websites showing the time it takes to open an account and to replace a lost or stolen card if you bank with them. The figures suggest that typically overdrafts can be provided very quickly, often on the same day, whereas lost or stolen cards take more than five days on average to replace. Other details include how and when customers can make payments, cancel cheques, and whether 24-hour help is available. This month, for the first time, the data also shows the frequency of IT-related shutdowns. Prior to this there had been little evidence available about the number of times bank services have been unavailable owing to security or operational incidents. The figures cover the nine months to the end of last year, and analysis by the BBC reveals that most major High Street banks suffered more than ten shutdowns between April and December. Barclays had the highest number of incidents with 41 over the nine months. A spokesman for the bank said: ""We take IT resilience extremely seriously and we welcome transparency for our customers which is why we report every incident to the regulator, even minor glitches that have minimal impact on customers."" He added that the bank's service was designed to allow customers to use other channels, such as branches and telephone banking when problems occurred. Moreover, the bank had its ownstatus page,externalto keep customers informed of which services were working and which were not, he said. Lloyds Bank suffered the second highest number of outages with 37 recorded instances, and other brands in the Lloyds Banking Group jointly had 31. Recently customers expressed their frustration with one Lloyds brand, MBNA, after IT updates made it difficult for customers to pay off their credit cards. Allow Twitter content?

The scale of the problem is significant, according to financial analyst Andrew Hagger, of Moneycomms. ""There will be occasions when there are minor glitches,"" he said. ""But there comes a time when [the banks] have got to overhaul these systems. When banks are pushing us towards online and mobile banking, some savings from branch closures and profits should be apportioned to getting systems up to speed."" A spokeswoman for UK Finance, which represents the banks, said that providers worked ""around the clock"" to minimise disruption and get services working again when incidents occurred. ""Operational resilience is crucial in a modern financial system and is a key priority for the industry,"" said. UK Finance said its members invested billions of pounds in ensuring IT and human systems were ""robust and secure"". Nicky Morgan. who chairs the Treasury Committee, which has an ongoing inquiry into IT failures in the financial sector, said: ""IT failures at banks are a regular occurrence. We all think 'please don't let it be mine', but these failures now seem to have an air of inevitability. ""These figures are concerning, especially considering that the availability of these online services is vital as more and more customers are ushered online."" The number of shutdowns does not necessarily translate to poor customer satisfaction. Barclays, despite recording the highest number of incidents, was ranked second inofficial rankings,externalfor mobile and online banking, and joint fifth for overall satisfaction in a survey of 16,000 banking customers.

"Mistakes that led to child sexual grooming scandals are being repeated with gangs, a report by the Children's Commissioner for England has warned. It estimates there are 27,000 children aged between 10 and 17 in England who identify as being part of a gang. Anne Longfield said gangs were using ""sophisticated techniques"" to groom vulnerable children and using ""chilling levels of violence"" to retain them. The Home Office said it was ""committed to protecting vulnerable children"". The report adds that 313,000 children know a gang member - and, of those, 34,000 have experienced violent crime. Reality Check: Counting the kids in gangs The children forced to sell drugs 'Everybody thinks it's only boys who join gangs' Child sexual exploitation: How the system failed Ms Longfield said those suffering from mental health issues or abuse and neglect in their family life were particularly susceptible to grooming from gangs. A street gang is defined as a group of young people who hang around together and have a specific area or territory, have a name or other identifier, possibly have rules or a leader, and who may commit crimes together. Sarah - not her real name - became involved in a gang when she was 12, following a period of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of a family member. Now 14, she told BBC Radio 5 live that she began by doing drugs such as cocaine with a gang before going on to sell drugs for them - sometimes walking for up to three hours at a time to sell ""the tiniest bit of weed"". This video can not be played 'Sarah' describes how she was caught up in gangs and dealing drugs - interview voiced by an actor Her brother, who is two years older than her, was also involved. ""Cos we were so young and we were getting money, we were like, 'Yes, money's rolling in,'"" she said. ""We were still both innocent to what was happening because we still both didn't really understand what was going on."" But Sarah was also regularly drinking alcohol and doing drugs, and eventually reached a point where she would ""sleep with someone just to get money or just to get a bit of weed"". ""It got to that stage where it was really bad and then obviously that's when the police had to step in."" Looking back, Sarah, who is no longer in the gang, says she ""hated"" who she was - ""I was violent, I was just a horrible person."" Researchers said that, for some children, gang membership represents little more than a loose social connection and not all young members are involved in crime or serious violence. ""For many children, involvement in these gangs is not a voluntary act,"" the report added. ""In some areas children are considered members of a gang based purely on their location, their family or their wider associations."" This video can not be played Matthew, who was groomed as a child, talks about how he ended up grooming children himself Gangs have sought to diversify their recruitment as police have become better at spotting ""traditional"" members, the paper found. It said techniques for recruiting children are similar to grooming for sexual abuse - as exposed by child abuse scandals in cities includingRotherham,OxfordandHuddersfield- starting with ""inducements"". In one case, there was said to have been a ""written manual"" setting out a clear timeframe for entrapment. Ms Longfield said gangs then use ""chilling levels of violence"" to keep them compliant. ""Rather than seeing this as a lifestyle choice that these children are involved in, I want people to see that they are vulnerable children that are being groomed and need protecting,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The report's estimate of the number of children in gangs was calculated using figures from the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) annual crime survey, which asks a representative sample of households about their experience of crime. For the past three years, it has asked children aged 10 to 15 whether they considered themselves to be a member of a street gang. This figure was then scaled up to give a number for the whole population for a single year. However the report says that only about 6,500 children involved in gangs are actually known to authorities. ""Many local areas are not facing up to the scale of the problem,"" Ms Longfield said. She added that warning signs such as missing school and turning up at A&E with knife wounds were not being acted on and very little help was available for parents who asked for it. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Corey Junior Davis - known as CJ - was shot at close range in a Newham playground in 2017 When 14-year-old Corey Junior Davis - known by his family as CJ - told social services that he needed protection from violent gang members who wanted to coerce him into selling drugs, he was treated as a criminal, not a victim. CJ was a bright young man - but his severe form of ADHD led to him being excluded from his secondary school. His behaviour worsened - and at the pupil referral unit where he was supposed to be safe, gangs circled as they looked for new recruits they could control. He was so scared he ordered a bulletproof vest and ""Rambo"" style knife for ""protection"". But when he found the courage to reveal to the authorities how he was being targeted, nobody acted to genuinely protect him. In September 2017, he was shot and killed in what remains an unsolved murder. An official review found that his local authority completely failed to act on the cries for help from both CJ and his mother, Keisha McLeod. Today, Ms McLeod says nothing has been learned from her son's awful death. And that's why the Children's Commissioner's warning is so important. Responding to the report, the NSPCC said: ""Until recently, sexually exploited children were seen as part of the problem and complicit in joining gangs. We cannot afford to make that mistake this time around. ""When authorities come into contact with young people in criminal cases, they must understand how coercion and grooming has lured and trapped these children into committing crime."" Fellow children's charity Barnardo's added: ""It's worrying that many children involved in gangs are not known to services. ""Seriously stretched police and social workers are struggling to support growing numbers of children with complex needs, and help is rarely offered before they reach crisis point."" The Children's Commissioner is now calling on the government to make child criminal exploitation a ""national priority"". In response, a government statement said: ""We have proposed a new statutory duty on partners across education, social services and health to work together to tackle violence as part of a public health approach, and are providing Â£220m to support children and young people at risk of becoming involved in violence and gangs."" When contacted by the BBC, the children's commissioner for Northern Ireland said it did not have data on how many children were involved in gangs, adding that young people were more likely to be involved in paramilitary groups. The children's commissioner for Wales also had not collected data on the number of young people in gangs, but said it was taking a ""proactive approach"" to the issue and held regular nationwide meetings with children's groups. ""Resulting from that we are working with agencies like the police to work in a child centred way, respecting all of their human rights."" The commissioner for Scotland referred the BBC to astudy,externalthat concluded incidents involving gangs of young people using weapons in public places in the country were declining.

"As North Korea and the United States continue to trade threats, we have little idea how the war of words is perceived to the people of North Korea because the regime of Kim Jong-un maintains an iron grip over the population, carefully controlling access to the outside world. The country is often depicted as isolated and thoroughly out of step with the 21st century. Statistics are hard to get and often based on estimates, but what can they tell us about life in the North? Kim Il-sung effectively founded North Korea in 1948 and his family dynasty has ruled the country ever since, with control passing from father to son. In the same period South Korea has managed six republics, a revolution, a couple of coups and the transition to free and fair elections. In total 12 presidents have led the country, covering 19 terms of office. Three million mobile phones might seem like a lot - but in a country of 25 million it amounts to just over one out of every ten people. Most mobile users are likely to be concentrated in the capital Pyongyang. By contrast, with a population of some 51 million there are more mobile phone subscriptions than people in South Korea. With effectively a single network, Koryolink, North Korea's mobile market is limited but growing. Originally established as a partnership with Egyptian telecom firm Orascom, it was for many years the only option. However, in 2015 Orascom discovered that North Korea was setting up a rival network, Byol, and was forced to disclose to investors that it had effectively lost control over the service's three million plus subscribers. There's reason to be sceptical about those subscriber numbers though. Research by theUS-Korea Institute at SAIS,externalsuggests that some growth might be down to North Koreans calculating that it's cheaper to buy an additional subscription than additional air time. As well as a scarcity of mobiles, the vast majority of North Koreans are only permitted access to the country's 'private internet' - effectively a closed intranet operating on a national scale. Reports in 2016 suggested that North Korea has just 28 registered domains. It may sound like an urban myth, but there is some research to suggest that North Korean men are on average shorter than their South Korean counterparts. Professor Daniel Schwekendiek from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul studied the heights of North Korean refugees measured when they crossed the border into South Korea and found an average 3-8cm (1.2 -3.1 inch) difference. Schwekendiek points out that the height difference cannot be attributed to genetics, because the two populations are the same. He also rejects criticism that suggests that refugees are more likely to be impoverished, and therefore of smaller stature. Food shortages are thought to be the main factor in why North Koreans are generally shorter. Read more: Are North Koreans really shorter than South Koreans? Images from North Korea's capital Pyongyang often show stretches of wide, pristine motorway  unoccupied by traffic, but outside the city it's another story. North Korea has some 25,554 km of roads, according to 2006 figures, but just 3% are actually paved,  amounting to a meagre 724km (449 miles). It's also estimated that only about 11 out of every 1,000 North Koreans owns a car, which means a long queue at the bus stop for most people who need to travel. Public transport is ubiquitous in North Korea North Korea relies on coal exports to keep its economy above water - but it's hard to measure their true value as the data comes from countries receiving the coal. Much of North Korea's coal is exported to China, which banned imports in February 2017. However some analysts question the nature of the sanction. ""There are folks who track ships and have seen North Korean ships docking at coal terminals at Chinese ports even after the ban. I do believe that China has disrupted coal imports, but not completely,"" says Kent Boydston, research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Until 1973 North and South Korea were pretty evenly matched in terms of wealth. Since then, South Korea has rocketed ahead to become one of the world's leading industrial producers, with companies like Samsung and Hyundai becoming global household names. North Korea stagnated in the 1980s as the country stuck rigidly to its state-run system. While North Korea is the 52nd largest country by population, it is considered to have the world's fourth largest army. Military spending is estimated to account for as much as 25% of GDP, and almost every North Korean man undergoes some form of military training. Read more about North Korea's military strength A series of famines in the late 1990s caused a sharp drop in life expectancy in North Korea, but even without that factor, the North lags nearly 12 years behind. Food shortages persist and are one of many reasons why South Koreans generally live longer. In 2017South Korea's birth rate hit a record lowas the country continued a decade-long struggle to boost the country's birth rate. It has spent about $70bn (Â£53bn) handing out baby bonuses, improving paternity leave and paying for infertility treatment. Produced by Alex Murray and Tom Housden.

"Mike Hall was fatally struck by a car during a road race in Australia The death of champion British cyclist Mike Hall in a road race in Australia was ""avoidable"", a coroner has found. Mr Hall, 35, died almost instantly when he was hit by a car on a highway near Canberra in 2017. One of the world's best ultra-endurance cyclists, he had been riding in the Indian Pacific Wheel Race at the time. A coroner noted the accident happened in the dark and said it should prompt a thorough review of local road and bicycle laws. ""Mr Hall's death was avoidable, which makes the loss of this remarkable person even more keenly felt by his family and the community,"" Dr Bernadette Boss said on Thursday. The inquest had heard that the coast-to-coast race - in which cyclists ride a 5,500km (3,400 miles) route from Fremantle to Sydney - was known for its difficulty. Mr Hall, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, had been in second place when he was hit by a car travelling at 100km/h (62 mph) at 06.22 local time on 31 March. He suffered fatal head, spinal and abdominal injuries, the inquest heard. A tribute to Mike Hall at the site of the crash Dr Boss noted that the driver, Shegu Bobb, had reported not seeing Mr Hall in the darkness. She said Mr Hall had been wearing dark clothing, but that she could not determine whether he was wearing adequate reflective material. Dr Boss said the investigation was ""to some degree compromised by the loss of significant evidence"" because police had not retained all of Mr Hall's clothing and bicycle equipment. No charges have been laid against Mr Bobb, who had been on his way to work at the time of the accident. He initially thought he had struck a kangaroo, the inquest heard. Police testified that Mr Bobb had been distracted by a parked car as he turned on to the highway, and had no time to avoid the collision. Dr Boss said the incident should provide a ""catalyst"" for better safety rules, making six recommendations - including calling for a review of local road intersections. She also recommended that Australia consider making it mandatory for all cyclists to have flashing rear lights when riding at night. Mr Hall won the 2012 World Cycle Race and had been living in Monmouthshire, South Wales. His death shocked the sport and prompted memorial rides in Australia and the UK. It also led to a suspension of the annual event.

"US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un have failed to reach a deal Mr Trump said the talks failed over North Korean sanctions demands The US president said there hadn't been enough progress on denuclearisation for the US to agree They were following up on their historic meeting last year in Singapore, which delivered a vague but optimistic agreement The main topic of discussion was whether North Korea will ever agree to give up its nuclear weapons There has been no word from Mr Kim following the talks Got questions about the summit? Tweet us @BBCNewsAsia Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Rebecca Seales and Kevin Ponniah That's it from our coverage of this extraordinary day. Most analysts and media had been expecting at least some small deal to emerge from the second round of talks between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un - perhaps a loose peace declaration (but the Korean War is still not over), or North Korea agreeing to close its Yongbyon plant (which instead will keep producing fissile material for nuclear weapons), or an agreement on sanctions (which will continue to stop North Korea from trading or interacting freely with the outside world). Instead, Mr Trump emerged with little more than nice words, saying: ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times."" The sticking point was sanctions, he said. ""They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that."" Thanks for following us today. We'll keep bringing you the latest news and analysis onthe BBC News website. South Korea's president says it is ""regrettable"" that the talks failed, but that the leaders ""have made more meaningful progress than at any time prior"". His full statement says Mr Kim and Mr Trump ""expanded the scope and depth of their understanding"" and that Mr Trump had expressed commitment to continuing talks. President Moon Jae-in says suggestions the discussions of sanctions relief shows the relationship has been ""raised to a new level"". The rather muted statement ends with hoping for ""active dialogue"" and says South Korea will help both parties ""maintain momentum for dialogue"". It would be fair to say this isn't the statement Moon Jae-in hoped to be sending today. One thing to remember amid all the debriefing is that we have not yet heard from the North Koreans. Mr Kim did not give a press conference like Mr Trump, of course, and it may be some time before we get a sense of how he and his delegation responded, or what their demands were of Mr Trump. From BBC Monitoring Mr Trump has already left on his plane to go back home but what about Mr Kim? Well, his armoured train - on which he travelled to Vietnam - is supposedly undergoing maintenance service in China, so heâll probably have to take a flight if he wants to leave early.South Korean media outlets report that his olive-green train is currently stationed in Nanning,external, China, located close to Hanoi. The Yonhap news agency speculates that the train could be parked somewhere in China, such as Beijing or Guangzhou, where Kim could board it after flying to the area.http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/02/103_264594.html We've had word that on board Air Force One Mr Trump is making his likely quite tricky phone call to South Korea's Moon Jae-in, a man who has invested much in rapprochement with North Korea. Joel Wit, a former State Department official who has negotiated often with North Korea and now runs the 38 North research group has this take on the summit outcome. Allow Twitter content?

If you want to indulge yourself and read the full text of the press conference Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo gave after their unproductive talks, the people atVox are one of several sites to have written it up,external. The North Korean leader is set to spend more time in Vietnam - and will begin an official two-day visit on Friday, the Vietnamese foreign ministry has said. Mr Kim is expected to tour economic sites to learn from the one-party communist state, which maintains extremely tight control and stifles dissent, while having a thriving market economy. The North Korean leader will then have a long train ride back home. It took him two days to travel to Vietnam. Jean Lee, former bureau chief for the Associated Press in Pyongyang, has tweeted that this was never going to be an easy meeting. Allow Twitter content?

In any case - Kim Jong-un doesn't look too happy with that particular specimen. We've got the first response from South Korea - which of course is deeply invested in this process. The government says the failure to reach a deal is ""disappointing"" but adds that progress made was ""more than ever"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Several of you have asked us on Facebook about landmines and the DMZ. Victoria Telford asks: ""Denuclearisation is likely to be a long slow process if it happens, but clearing the highly symbolic border zone of over a million landmines would be a huge peace-building step. It would be a powerful statement of peace to rid that area of landmines, especially if a humanitarian de-mining group were to do it. Is this on the table for discussion?"" We asked the BBC's Laura Bicker: ""North and South Korea have been working to de-mine small parts of the DMZ. Firstly to enable teams to look for the remains [of the war dead and others killed in the area] and also to turn the Joint Security Area - the area around the blue huts - into a tourist zone.""This is something they do alongside and with the permission of the UN Command at the DMZ. The hope is more of this work will take place between the two Koreas. But they donât need Donald Trumpâs permission for this."" Hope that helps, Victoria. Some of what the US president said earlier This video can not be played Donald Trump on talks with Kim Jong-un: 'Sometimes you have to walk' Air Force One has lifted off. Vietnamese officials at the airport are making the most of history and getting a quick group photo in front of Air Force One before it takes off. President Trump said he would call South Korea's President Moon Jae-in from the plane. That may be a tricky phone call. The BBC's Robin Brant, who's in Seoul, says the abrupt end to the Hanoi summit will inevitably knock the momentum Mr Moon has built with his enthusiastic support for the talks and closer links between the two Koreas. ""The truth is that much closer economic co-operation is predicated on an end to UN sanctions, which we now know wonât happen soon. But President Moon will push on with plans to link up cross-border road and rail knowing heâs got what he wants most: a stable security environment. According to Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un promised no new nuclear or missile testing."" Unexpectedly, there's been huge peak in interest in Otto Warmbier after his sad case was brought up at the press conference with Mr Trump. Lots of people are Googling his name wanting to know the story behind that question.Here's our story from 2017 on how a student trip ended in jail and death. Mr Trump is clearly not spending a minute more in Hanoi - he's at the airport now, saying goodbye to his Vietnamese hosts. We haven't heard anything from Kim Jong-un - so our understanding of what happened today is only based on what President Trump has said. But what will the North Korean regime tell its people?

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Now that we know that the sanctions on North Korea were the deal-breaker, what could Pyongyang do next? In his 2019 New Yearâs speech, Kim Jong-un had said that North Korea could be forced to adopt a ânew wayâ if the US did not lift sanctions. What that could entail is up for debate. Here's what he said:  Only if the United States does not keep its promise made in front of the world, misjudges our people's patience, tries to unilaterally force us to do something, and continues with sanctions and pressure on our Republic, we might have no choice but to be obliged to reluctantly seek a new way to defend the country's sovereignty and the state's supreme interest and achieve peace and stability on the Korean peninsulaâ Kim Jong-un Â© 2025 BBC.

"Limits on how much internet gamblers can stake and spend online would be introduced if Labour was in power, the shadow culture secretary has promised. Tom Watson said the tougher rules would tackle ""Britain's hidden epidemic"" and said current laws were ""unfit for the digital age"". Labour's plans would also include a limit on the speed of play. The government said it constantly reviews regulations and does ""not hesitate to act when needed"". In his speech at the Institute for Public Policy Research in London on Thursday, Labour's deputy leader will refer to the case of a young gambling addict with a brain injurywho lost Â£210,000 in onlinebetting. 'I've gambled my compensation away' The tricky issue of problem gambling 'I worry about the next generation' According to the Gambling Commission,,externalwhich regulates the industry, Britain has the largest regulated online gambling market in the world, generating Â£4.7bn for companies per year - and is expected to grow. The commission said there were no restrictions in online stakes, prizes or the speed of play. Problem gambling should be treated ""as a public health emergency"", Labour's Tom Watson says Ahead of his speech, Mr Watson said problem gambling should be treated ""as a public health emergency"". ""Whereas gambling in the offline world is highly regulated, the lack of controls on online gambling is leading to vulnerable consumers suffering huge losses,"" he said. Online companies, he said, ""have a responsibility to protect their customers from placing bets that they cannot afford. But too often, these operators have either neglected the care of their customers or have been too slow in their due diligence. ""We need to see a culture of limits introduced to internet gambling: a system of thresholds placed on the spend, stake and speed... that will give safeguards to consumers."" Under the plans, Labour would create a new category in the current legislation - which is the 2005 Gambling Act - specifically for online betting. Mr Watson's speech follows a number of moving accounts from people who have struggled with gambling addiction. Last month, a woman who built up debts of Â£70,000 by gambling online said it was easier to lose money on the internet than in a casino because ""it just seems like digits"". ""You're in this online virtual reality so you're not dealing with what you're dealing with in reality,""says Kelly Field, who shared her story with the makers of ITV's Cleaning Up. The TV programme followed the story of an office cleaner, played by Sheridan Smith, who turns to crime to cover her gambling debts. Kelly Field, left, told the makers of Sheridan Smith's Cleaning Up about her experience Ms Field said online gambling ""feels like playing computer games when you're a kid"". ""You've got your high scores, your lives left. It just seems like digits, it's not really money. That's why people lose so much."" She said she hid her addiction at first, choosing to ""smile and hide the credit card bill"". But the pressure of the financial losses and lies took its toll on her. ""You isolate yourself so much for everybody. You get trapped in a cycle of playing to win, losing, then playing to win back whatever you've lost, and then losing more. You miss appointments, social events,"" she said. ""It takes a part of you that you never get back. You are physically and mentally not the person that you were before."" Mr Watson said he was launching a consultation to gather information about the relationship between gambling and online video games. Loot boxes - which contain virtual items which can be bought by players with cash - will be among the subjects covered in the review. A spokesman for the Remote Gambling Association said: ""We fully embrace the need to move faster to tackle problem gambling through effective regulation based on innovation, evidence and customer data and we are committed to working with the government and opposition to achieve that goal."" 'Women need help for gambling addiction too' Problem gambling scheme 'too easy to cheat' Online gambling checks to be strengthened Limits on players' spending were proposedin a review by the Gambling Commission,externalin March last year. The commission said it would consult on the limits, which in theory would only be increased once further checks - for example on whether the player could afford it - were carried out. The review said that although online firms have a lot of data on players which they could use to identify problem gamblers, progress by the online industry ""has been significantly slower than we expected and required"". Earlier this month,the commission announced,externalit was bringing in new rules which mean online gambling firms must verify a customer's age before the customer can withdraw winnings. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it was ""paramount"" that vulnerable people are protected from harm. ""There are robust requirements to safeguard players across every form of gambling and to prevent money-laundering. All operators must adhere to these rules if they wish to operate in the British market. ""We constantly keep regulations under review and do not hesitate to act when needed. The Gambling Commission has a range of powers, for offline and online gambling, and we expect it to take the strongest possible action against any company that breaks the rules.""

"Anti-social behaviour was down in 14-year-old boys and girls between 2005 and 2015 Adolescents are more likely to feel depressed and self-harm, and are less likely to get a full night's sleep, than 10 years ago, a study suggests. Yet smoking, alcohol and anti-social behaviour - often linked to mental health problems - were less common for 14-year-olds in 2015 than in 2005. Factors behind mental health problems may be changing, the University College London researchers said. The rise in depressive symptoms was ""deeply worrying"", a charity said. Researchers from London and Liverpool analysed data from two large cohorts of 14-year-olds - the first group from around Bristol, born in 1991-92, and the second from across the UK, born in 2000-01. There were 5,600 young people surveyed in the first group and 11,000 in the second. In 10 years, based on a standard questionnaire on mood and feelings, levels of depression in this age group rose from 9% to 15%. Adolescents who said they had hurt themselves on purpose rose from 12% to 14%. The rate of increase was similar for boys and girls, although girls are more likely to self-harm. While obesity and poor body image also rose, fewer 14-year-olds in 2015 had tried alcohol, binge drinking, smoking and having sex - compared with those surveyed a decade before. They were also less likely to have tried cannabis or other drugs - 4.3%, down from 5%. When it came to sleeping, the 2015 cohort were more likely to go to bed later and wake up earlier, meaning that more of them slept less than the recommended eight hours for teenagers. Cannabis use in teens linked to depression In charts: Report into children's mental health 'The moment I crossed over into a different world' Dr Praveetha Patalay, associate professor at UCL and co-author of the study in theInternational Journal of Epidemiology,external, said the research gave a bigger picture of adolescent health, not only mental health in isolation. ""It's a holistic view, with some things getting worse and some improving. ""We have to remember that lots of things are changing for young people - in different directions."" She said that although the study could not pinpoint causes of mental health difficulties, it could be valuable in identifying what the risk factors are for mental health problems. In her early teenage years Lauren Nicole Coppin Campbell, now 21, began to suffer with body image and low self-esteem. For her, the images of people she was seeing on social media and in popular culture had a negative impact. ""I didn't feel like the people I was seeing on my feed we're representative of me. ""You rarely saw curvy, chubby, black women or girls who were being portrayed as beautiful or intelligent. ""On social media or other media you often see stereotypes - the bigger woman is the comedian, the funny person you laugh at or who you feel sorry for."" Before she was 16, she began forcing herself to be sick in a bid to obtain what she calls a ""twisted image of perfection."" At times it felt like there was no escape. ""It isn't just online,"" she added. ""You can go to school or see friends on the weekend and they might start talking about Kylie Jenner or whoever else who may make you feel you're lesser than."" Lauren is now working as a plus size model and is an ambassador forThe Be Real Campaign,external. Emma Thomas, chief executive of charity YoungMinds, said the rise in 14-year-olds self-harming or experiencing depressive symptoms was ""deeply worrying"". ""The factors behind mental health problems are often complex, but we know that stress at school, bullying, concerns about body image, and the pressures associated with social media can all have a big impact,"" she said. ""To make matters worse, it's often far too difficult for young people to get mental health support, which means that their problems can escalate unnecessarily."" Self-harming increased among girls and boys over the period of the study Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""This study provides further confirmation that young people today are struggling with mental health problems more than their 90s counterparts. ""The sharp rise in levels of depression and the increase in self-harm are worrying, as are the concerns our young people have around their body image.""

"Anna Burns won the Â£50,000 prize in 2018 for her novel Milkman The Booker Prize will be funded by venture capitalist Sir Michael Moritz for the next five years after the Man Group, the previous sponsor, withdrew. The prestigious literary award will be paid for by Crankstart, the charity run by Sir Michael and wife Harriet Heyman. Welsh-born Sir Michael, who is based in San Francisco, is worth $3.4bn (Â£2.5bn),according to Forbes magazine,external. But the prize will not bear his name - it will be known as The Booker Prize after 18 years as the Man Booker Prize. Last year's Â£50,000 prize was won by Belfast writer Anna Burns for Milkman. Sir Michael will also support The International Booker Prize. Sir Michael was knighted in 2013 He began his career as a journalist for Time magazine and wrote the first biography of Steve Jobs and Apple in 1984. He went on to join Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, investing in companies including Google, LinkedIn and PayPal. Harriet Heyman is a former writer for Life and The New York Times, and published a novel in 1989. Sir Michael said: ""Neither of us can imagine a day where we don't spend time reading a book. The Booker Prizes are ways of spreading the word about the insights, discoveries, pleasures and joy that spring from great fiction. ""Just like The Booker, I was born in Britain and before coming to America was reared on English literature. Harriet and I feel fortunate to be able to support prizes that together celebrate the best fiction in the world."" The couple founded Crankstart in 2000 to support and organise scholarship funds for university students from low-income families. By Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor The corporate sponsorship market is notoriously difficult for fundraisers working in the arts sector. Brands aren't exactly queuing up to pour cash into exhibitions, fancy extensions, and annual prizes. Those that do often don't hang around for long, and the more loyal can sometimes lead to negative publicity (such as BP) or strained relations. With this in mind, the Booker Prize will be very pleased to have found a donor willing to make a major philanthropic gift without demanding his name be attached to the prize, nor - one imagines - instructing his marketing team to milk the relationship for all that it is worth. Arts organisations across the country will be looking on enviously, and, I suspect, forming a queue to invite Sir Michael to lunch.

"US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un have failed to reach a deal Mr Trump said the talks failed over North Korean sanctions demands The US president said there hadn't been enough progress on denuclearisation for the US to agree They were following up on their historic meeting last year in Singapore, which delivered a vague but optimistic agreement The main topic of discussion was whether North Korea will ever agree to give up its nuclear weapons There has been no word from Mr Kim following the talks Got questions about the summit? Tweet us @BBCNewsAsia Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Rebecca Seales and Kevin Ponniah That's it from our coverage of this extraordinary day. Most analysts and media had been expecting at least some small deal to emerge from the second round of talks between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un - perhaps a loose peace declaration (but the Korean War is still not over), or North Korea agreeing to close its Yongbyon plant (which instead will keep producing fissile material for nuclear weapons), or an agreement on sanctions (which will continue to stop North Korea from trading or interacting freely with the outside world). Instead, Mr Trump emerged with little more than nice words, saying: ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times."" The sticking point was sanctions, he said. ""They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that."" Thanks for following us today. We'll keep bringing you the latest news and analysis onthe BBC News website. South Korea's president says it is ""regrettable"" that the talks failed, but that the leaders ""have made more meaningful progress than at any time prior"". His full statement says Mr Kim and Mr Trump ""expanded the scope and depth of their understanding"" and that Mr Trump had expressed commitment to continuing talks. President Moon Jae-in says suggestions the discussions of sanctions relief shows the relationship has been ""raised to a new level"". The rather muted statement ends with hoping for ""active dialogue"" and says South Korea will help both parties ""maintain momentum for dialogue"". It would be fair to say this isn't the statement Moon Jae-in hoped to be sending today. One thing to remember amid all the debriefing is that we have not yet heard from the North Koreans. Mr Kim did not give a press conference like Mr Trump, of course, and it may be some time before we get a sense of how he and his delegation responded, or what their demands were of Mr Trump. From BBC Monitoring Mr Trump has already left on his plane to go back home but what about Mr Kim? Well, his armoured train - on which he travelled to Vietnam - is supposedly undergoing maintenance service in China, so heâll probably have to take a flight if he wants to leave early.South Korean media outlets report that his olive-green train is currently stationed in Nanning,external, China, located close to Hanoi. The Yonhap news agency speculates that the train could be parked somewhere in China, such as Beijing or Guangzhou, where Kim could board it after flying to the area.http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/02/103_264594.html We've had word that on board Air Force One Mr Trump is making his likely quite tricky phone call to South Korea's Moon Jae-in, a man who has invested much in rapprochement with North Korea. Joel Wit, a former State Department official who has negotiated often with North Korea and now runs the 38 North research group has this take on the summit outcome. Allow Twitter content?

The North Korean leader is set to spend more time in Vietnam - and will begin an official two-day visit on Friday, the Vietnamese foreign ministry has said. Mr Kim is expected to tour economic sites to learn from the one-party communist state, which maintains extremely tight control and stifles dissent, while having a thriving market economy. The North Korean leader will then have a long train ride back home. It took him two days to travel to Vietnam.

In any case - Kim Jong-un doesn't look too happy with that particular specimen. We've got the first response from South Korea - which of course is deeply invested in this process.

Several of you have asked us on Facebook about landmines and the DMZ. Victoria Telford asks: ""Denuclearisation is likely to be a long slow process if it happens, but clearing the highly symbolic border zone of over a million landmines would be a huge peace-building step. It would be a powerful statement of peace to rid that area of landmines, especially if a humanitarian de-mining group were to do it. Is this on the table for discussion?"" We asked the BBC's Laura Bicker: ""North and South Korea have been working to de-mine small parts of the DMZ. Firstly to enable teams to look for the remains [of the war dead and others killed in the area] and also to turn the Joint Security Area - the area around the blue huts - into a tourist zone.""This is something they do alongside and with the permission of the UN Command at the DMZ. The hope is more of this work will take place between the two Koreas. But they donât need Donald Trumpâs permission for this."" Hope that helps, Victoria. Some of what the US president said earlier This video can not be played Donald Trump on talks with Kim Jong-un: 'Sometimes you have to walk' Air Force One has lifted off. Vietnamese officials at the airport are making the most of history and getting a quick group photo in front of Air Force One before it takes off. President Trump said he would call South Korea's President Moon Jae-in from the plane. That may be a tricky phone call. The BBC's Robin Brant, who's in Seoul, says the abrupt end to the Hanoi summit will inevitably knock the momentum Mr Moon has built with his enthusiastic support for the talks and closer links between the two Koreas. ""The truth is that much closer economic co-operation is predicated on an end to UN sanctions, which we now know wonât happen soon. But President Moon will push on with plans to link up cross-border road and rail knowing heâs got what he wants most: a stable security environment. According to Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un promised no new nuclear or missile testing."" Unexpectedly, there's been huge peak in interest in Otto Warmbier after his sad case was brought up at the press conference with Mr Trump. Lots of people are Googling his name wanting to know the story behind that question.Here's our story from 2017 on how a student trip ended in jail and death. Mr Trump is clearly not spending a minute more in Hanoi - he's at the airport now, saying goodbye to his Vietnamese hosts. We haven't heard anything from Kim Jong-un - so our understanding of what happened today is only based on what President Trump has said. But what will the North Korean regime tell its people?

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Now that we know that the sanctions on North Korea were the deal-breaker, what could Pyongyang do next? In his 2019 New Yearâs speech, Kim Jong-un had said that North Korea could be forced to adopt a ânew wayâ if the US did not lift sanctions. What that could entail is up for debate. Here's what he said:  Only if the United States does not keep its promise made in front of the world, misjudges our people's patience, tries to unilaterally force us to do something, and continues with sanctions and pressure on our Republic, we might have no choice but to be obliged to reluctantly seek a new way to defend the country's sovereignty and the state's supreme interest and achieve peace and stability on the Korean peninsulaâ Kim Jong-un Â© 2025 BBC.

"US President Donald Trump is meeting North Korea's Kim Jong-un in Vietnam this week - for the second time. The hope is the two former arch enemies can iron out some form of agreement on North Korea's controversial nuclear weapons programme. If you want to get your head around what's going on this week, here are some of the basics. We've pointed you towards more detailed articles if you want to know more. The same thing they talked about when they had their historic first meeting last June in Singapore: nuclear weapons. Most of the world wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons - a process usually called denuclearisation. But North Korea has consistently said it won't do so until it no longer feels it faces a threat from the US and others. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Because of this, North Korea is under a wide range of sanctions which stop it from trading or interacting normally with the wider world. It wants to take the least possible action to secure an easing of those sanctions. Can second Trump-Kim summit succeed? Soundtrack to a US-N Korea success story No, not at all. When they met last year, Trump and Kim signedthe Singapore Declaration, which was high on optimism but low on detail. They said they were committed to peace and denuclearisation, but they've never agreed what this actually means nor how it will happen. North Korea has blown up its nuclear testing site- though it doesn't really need it anymore as it knows its nukes work - but there isno indication it's done anything else to stop its nuclear development. In fact, senior US intelligence officials sayNorth Korea will never give them up, because it believes they're ""critical to regime survival"". In recent weeks Mr Trump has appeared to scale back his ambitions, saying he'd be happy as long as North Korea doesn't test any more missiles or nuclear bombs, which is the status quo right now. The US might also push for North Korea to simply provide a full list of all its nuclear tech - but even this is something it's never been willing to do. Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US Nuclear bombs are the most powerful weapons ever created. With a few exceptions, the world has agreed there should be no new nuclear-capable states. North Korea has broken international laws and treaties by developing its own nuclear arsenal. Aside from the very real fear it might one day use these weapons in anger, it could potentially sell the technology to other states, make mistakes that lead to accidents or if the government collapsed, they could fall into the wrong hands. If North Korea is allowed to have its own nuclear weapons, it could encourage other states to pursue the same path. What did N Korea's nuclear tests achieve? Yes, potentially. It has repeatedly said it would not be afraid to use nuclear or conventional weapons if threatened. Kim Jong-un watching a missile test in September 2017 The countries most nervous about that are its neighbours - South Korea and Japan. (The US has tens of thousands of troops in both those countries.) But North Korea also claims to have missiles powerful enough to reach the US mainland. There's also been a growing cyber security threat from North Korea in recent years. Most analysts agree, though, that were North Korea ever to initiate conflict it would be a suicidal move for the regime. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Technically yes. The Korean War ended with a formal halt in fighting - an armistice - but a peace treaty has never been signed. Under a post-war pact, the US still has more than 23,000 military personnel based in South Korea andconducts regular training drills with South Korean troops. One outcome of the summit might be some form of peace declaration, something Kim certainly wants. That won't be a formal peace treaty - that's a complicated political process with huge practical implications - but more a symbolic gesture that would make both leaders look good to their home bases. Watch: The US war that never ended As a communist country Vietnam shares some political similarities with North Korea and also has a history of conflict with the US. It's seen as a possible model for North Korea to follow if it were to emerge from isolation. Kim will be spending some time while there looking at industry and commerce. If he's to reach a deal with the US, overturning decades of anti-US propaganda, he'll need to convince North Korea's elite that there's gain in it for them. Kim also won't need to worry about protests - Vietnam won't allow demonstrations - and journalists covering the summit are being closely monitored. Why Kim will be looking closely at Vietnam The government is one of the most brutal in the world, exercising total control over people's lives. The World Food Programme believes more than 10 million people are undernourished. This video can not be played Jessie Kim escaped North Korea after a childhood selling alcohol at local markets For the political and urban elite, life has got a lot better in recent years, despite sanctions, but rights experts say nothing much has changed as the North has started engaging diplomatically. Human rights will almost certainly not be discussed at the Trump-Kim summit, but they may discuss a deal to allow in some humanitarian relief or to let families separated since the war see each other again. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis The sorry fate of North Korea's diplomat defectors This is a question that gets Googled a lot - because of satellite pictures like this. That dark section in the middle is North Korea, sandwiched between China, South Korea and Japan. Nighttime satellite images show a speck of light from the capital, Pyongyang, but almost no lights elsewhere The answer is that North Korea doesn't have an extensive or reliable supply of electricity.  The power stations and hydroelectric dams are old and suffer from a shortage of fuel and spare parts. Supply of power is prioritised for military or official purposes. Outside cities, many people rely on expensive and noisy generators, however, according to NK News,solar panels - which are cheap and reliable - are becoming increasingly popular,externalfor domestic use. In pictures: Growing up in North Korea This is often asked online, in response to stories about the threat posed by North Korea. In theory yes it could, but few experts will say that's a good idea. For starters there's the ethical question - there are 25 million people in North Korea - most of them victims of the government, not part of the problem. Removing Kim and the senior leadership would risk huge instability in a vulnerable and impoverished country - that would inevitably lead to a refugee crisis, which North Korea's neighbours want to avoid at all costs, and destabilise the whole region. And North Korea has nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and a vast standing army. Unless they were all disabled at once, it would strike back, even if briefly.

"The report found Suffolk County Council had ""poorly planned"" the transfer of the autistic girl An autistic teenager missed school for five months after a transfer blunder by Suffolk County Council, a report found. The child - who cannot be named - was moved from a specialist school to local mainstream classes in the middle of her GCSE studies in July 2016. An investigation by the Social Care Ombudsman found ""poor planning"" by the council, which failed to consider the girl's ""significant needs"". The council has apologised to the child and her mother for the failings. The report - published on Thursday - said the teenager had been attending an out-of-county independent school for five years when the council decided to move her to a local school in July 2016. There was no evidence her needs had changed, and it had taken 14 months to issue anEducation, Health and Care Plan,externalfor the girl, the report said. The Year 11 pupil was left without full-time education for a whole school term as a result until a place at another independent school was found for her. There were ""significant faults with the council's handling of the situation"", the investigation concluded. The council moved the child to a mainstream school without checking support was in place, the report found Michael King, the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman, said: ""It had taken a long time for this girl - who has significant needs - to settle at her school, and yet Suffolk County Council moved this girl despite the evidence supplied by the school and her educational psychologist. ""A lack of resources should never be the primary factor in deciding the best provision for a child with educational needs. ""This has been compounded by the council's poor planning throughout the 14 months, and its admission it was unaware of the provision it had within its own boundaries."" Special needs pupils 'spend years out of school' Exclusion of autistic boy unlawful, judge rules How does someone with autism go shopping? The council has been ordered to pay the teenager Â£1,200 for the loss of one term of education - and Â£1,000 for the ""uncertainty and distress"" she faced. Her mother will also receive compensation.

"This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has claimed Mr Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. During Wednesday's testimony, Cohen said Mr Trump directed covert plans for a Trump hotel, even while he denied having any business in Russia. He also said Mr Trump knew about a leak of hacked Democratic emails, and called him a ""racist"", ""conman"" and ""cheat"". Mr Trump accused Cohen of ""lying in order to reduce his prison time"". Takeaways from Cohen testimony Cohen's opening statement in full And speaking after Thursday's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, the US president reiterated that Cohen ""lied a lot"" during his congressional testimony. This video can not be played Trump criticises former lawyer Michael Cohen's testimony But Mr Trump said his former lawyer provided no evidence about alleged collusion between the Trump campaign with Russia during the 2016 US presidential elections. ""He didn't lie about one thing. He said, no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, I wonder why he didn't lie about that, too, like everything else,"" Mr Trump said. Cohen, 52, will start a three-year prison term in May for the campaign finance violation of paying hush money to one of Mr Trump's alleged mistresses, tax evasion and lying to Congress. In his public testimony to the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday, he said Mr Trump ""knew of and directed"" plans for a Trump Tower Moscow, while stating publicly that he had no dealings in Russia. ""At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him,"" Cohen testified, ""he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie."" ""He wanted me to lie,"" the witness added. However, Cohen has been convicted of lying to Congress when he testified in 2017 that attempts to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow had stopped by January 2016. Reaction to the hearing Trump's tower in Moscow that never was He has since acknowledged negotiations actually continued until June 2016 in the midst of the election campaign, though the real estate project ultimately did not go ahead. Cohen apologised on Wednesday for his earlier false statements to Congress, which he claimed were ""reviewed and edited"" by Mr Trump's lawyers. Jay Sekulow, counsel to President Trump, said in a statement after the hearing: ""Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false."" Cohen also suggested federal prosecutors in New York are investigating some unspecified crime involving Trump. This video can not be played Michael Cohen: Trump told me 'Don Jr had worst judgement in world' Cohen said he was in Mr Trump's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser, called the then-Republican presidential candidate. The witness said Mr Stone rang Mr Trump to let him know he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who told him there would be a ""massive dump"" of emails within a couple of days that would politically embarrass Hillary Clinton's White House campaign. Cohen said Mr Trump responded along the lines of ""wouldn't that be great"". Mr Trump has denied having prior knowledge about Wikileaks' disclosure of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the election. The messages - which US authorities say were hacked by Russian intelligence - caused a damaging rift among Democrats by exposing how party officials preferred Mrs Clinton over her challenger for the presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders. Mr Stone, a self-proclaimed political dirty trickster, is currently facing charges of lying to Congress about his communications with Wikileaks and witness tampering. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer ByPaul Wood,World Affairs Correspondent, BBC News Anyone who's met Michael Cohen recently will tell you that he's burning with anger at having to take the blame for crimes he says were instigated by Trump. It seems he's spent weeks being intensively prepped by his lawyers for this moment and intends to do the President fatal damage. The White House talking points - farmed out to surrogates such as Donald Trump Jr - are that he's a ""disgraced liar"" and ""convicted perjurer"". Cohen certainly knows he has - as he says in his testimony - a credibility problem. That's why he's attempting to wield a stiletto, not swing an axe, each charge backed up by what he calls ""documents that are irrefutable"" - hence the dramatic production of a cheque apparently signed by Trump (the alleged refund for paying off Stormy Daniels). He didn't talk much about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. In fact, he said he had no direct knowledge of collusion. He did, though, say he witnessed Trump in a telephone conversation during the campaign that showed he knew in advance Wikileaks was about to publish emails hacked - by Russia - from the Democratic Party. That would be hugely significant, if true. Trump has always denied it. Cohen testified that, contrary to Mr Trump's repeated claims, he seemed to have advance knowledge of a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between his campaign aides and a Russian lawyer promising ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton. The June 2016 meeting has been investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is winding up a 21-month justice department inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with an alleged Kremlin plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Cohen spoke about an incident when Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, walked behind his father's desk and told him in a low voice: ""The meeting is all set."" Mr Trump, Cohen told the hearing, replied: ""OK good, let me know."" Importantly, Cohen also said under oath that he has no direct evidence that Mr Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. ""I do not,"" he said. ""I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions."" What might 'Mueller report' look like? Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Cohen told lawmakers Mr Trump is a racist. He said: ""He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a 'shithole.' ""This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. ""While we were once driving through a struggling neighbourhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. ""And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him."" Cohen provided what he said was evidence of reimbursements he received from the president for hush money the lawyer has admitted paying to a porn star who says she had an affair with Mr Trump. He submitted to the committee a copy of his $130,000 (Â£97,000) wire transfer to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet - a payment which led to Cohen's conviction for campaign finance violations. Cohen also gave the panel a copy of a $35,000 cheque dated August 2017 - one of a series he said Mr Trump signed to pay him back in instalments. Trump says hush money payments were legal ""Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets,"" Cohen said. ""She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly - and she did not deserve that."" During the hearing, the president's fellow Republicans pilloried committee Democrats for inviting a man convicted of lying to Congress. Jim Jordan of Ohio called Cohen - who lost his law licence on Tuesday - a ""fraudster"" and ""cheat"". But committee chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, defended the decision to give Cohen a public platform, saying it was the panel's job to search out the truth. After the hearing, when asked whether the president committed a crime while in office, Chairman Cummings said: ""It appears that he did"". He did not offer any further detail on what crime he thought Mr Trump committed.

"This video can not be played US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un are meeting for a second day of talks North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has told reporters that he would not be at a summit with US President Donald Trump if he were not ready to denuclearise. The leaders are in Vietnam for talks on nuclear disarmament. They are under pressure to reach concrete measures after making little progress following a historic first summit last year. But the summit has been cut short by two hours and it's not clear why. Mr Trump earlier said there was ""no rush"" to reach a deal. But when Mr Kim told reporters that if he was not ready to denuclearise he ""wouldn't be here"", the US leader responded: ""That might be the best answer you've ever heard."" Analysts say it remains unclear what exactly Mr Kim means by denuclearisation. The pair were holding a discussion at a conference table with aides and cameras present, after the first round of closed-door discussions in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. Mr Trump and Mr Kim are believed to be discussing a roadmap for removing nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula and could also announce a formal treaty ending the Korean War or even the establishment of liaison offices. The first summit last June in Singapore between two leaders who had previously only exchanged vitriol was certainly a historic moment. Now, they are both very conscious of the need to answer their critics with signs of concrete progress. Washington had previously said North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief, but that condition is known to be a sticking point for the North Koreans. Follow our live updates What Trump wants from Kim talks Speaking ahead of their talks, Mr Trump appeared to again address scepticism about the success and progress of their last summit, saying he wanted to get the ""right deal"". ""I've been saying very much from the beginning that speed is not that important to me. I very much appreciate no testing of nuclear rockets, missiles, any of it,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he had ""great respect"" for Mr Kim. Meanwhile, answering his first question from a foreign reporter, Mr Kim said: ""It's early to tell, but from my instincts, I do have a feeling that good results will emerge.""

Mr Trump replied it was ""not a bad idea - both ways"". There is no direct channel between the US and North Korea at the moment and a liaison office would be the first step to normalise relations between the two countries. Mr Kim was also asked if they were discussing the issue of human rights in his country, a subject that was not raised in Singapore. Mr Trump - who separately warned reporters not to ""raise"" their voices with Mr Kim - stepped in and said they were ""discussing everything"". Mr Kim did not answer.

"Mistakes that led to child sexual grooming scandals are being repeated with gangs, a report by the Children's Commissioner for England has warned. It estimates there are 27,000 children aged between 10 and 17 in England who identify as being part of a gang. Anne Longfield said gangs were using ""sophisticated techniques"" to groom vulnerable children and using ""chilling levels of violence"" to retain them. The Home Office said it was ""committed to protecting vulnerable children"". The report adds that 313,000 children know a gang member - and, of those, 34,000 have experienced violent crime. Reality Check: Counting the kids in gangs The children forced to sell drugs 'Everybody thinks it's only boys who join gangs' Child sexual exploitation: How the system failed Ms Longfield said those suffering from mental health issues or abuse and neglect in their family life were particularly susceptible to grooming from gangs. A street gang is defined as a group of young people who hang around together and have a specific area or territory, have a name or other identifier, possibly have rules or a leader, and who may commit crimes together. Sarah - not her real name - became involved in a gang when she was 12, following a period of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of a family member. Now 14, she told BBC Radio 5 live that she began by doing drugs such as cocaine with a gang before going on to sell drugs for them - sometimes walking for up to three hours at a time to sell ""the tiniest bit of weed"". This video can not be played 'Sarah' describes how she was caught up in gangs and dealing drugs - interview voiced by an actor Her brother, who is two years older than her, was also involved. ""Cos we were so young and we were getting money, we were like, 'Yes, money's rolling in,'"" she said. ""We were still both innocent to what was happening because we still both didn't really understand what was going on."" But Sarah was also regularly drinking alcohol and doing drugs, and eventually reached a point where she would ""sleep with someone just to get money or just to get a bit of weed"". ""It got to that stage where it was really bad and then obviously that's when the police had to step in."" Looking back, Sarah, who is no longer in the gang, says she ""hated"" who she was - ""I was violent, I was just a horrible person."" Researchers said that, for some children, gang membership represents little more than a loose social connection and not all young members are involved in crime or serious violence. ""For many children, involvement in these gangs is not a voluntary act,"" the report added. ""In some areas children are considered members of a gang based purely on their location, their family or their wider associations."" This video can not be played Matthew, who was groomed as a child, talks about how he ended up grooming children himself Gangs have sought to diversify their recruitment as police have become better at spotting ""traditional"" members, the paper found. It said techniques for recruiting children are similar to grooming for sexual abuse - as exposed by child abuse scandals in cities includingRotherham,OxfordandHuddersfield- starting with ""inducements"". In one case, there was said to have been a ""written manual"" setting out a clear timeframe for entrapment. Ms Longfield said gangs then use ""chilling levels of violence"" to keep them compliant. ""Rather than seeing this as a lifestyle choice that these children are involved in, I want people to see that they are vulnerable children that are being groomed and need protecting,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The report's estimate of the number of children in gangs was calculated using figures from the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) annual crime survey, which asks a representative sample of households about their experience of crime. For the past three years, it has asked children aged 10 to 15 whether they considered themselves to be a member of a street gang. This figure was then scaled up to give a number for the whole population for a single year. However the report says that only about 6,500 children involved in gangs are actually known to authorities. ""Many local areas are not facing up to the scale of the problem,"" Ms Longfield said. She added that warning signs such as missing school and turning up at A&E with knife wounds were not being acted on and very little help was available for parents who asked for it. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Corey Junior Davis - known as CJ - was shot at close range in a Newham playground in 2017 When 14-year-old Corey Junior Davis - known by his family as CJ - told social services that he needed protection from violent gang members who wanted to coerce him into selling drugs, he was treated as a criminal, not a victim. CJ was a bright young man - but his severe form of ADHD led to him being excluded from his secondary school. His behaviour worsened - and at the pupil referral unit where he was supposed to be safe, gangs circled as they looked for new recruits they could control. He was so scared he ordered a bulletproof vest and ""Rambo"" style knife for ""protection"". But when he found the courage to reveal to the authorities how he was being targeted, nobody acted to genuinely protect him. In September 2017, he was shot and killed in what remains an unsolved murder. An official review found that his local authority completely failed to act on the cries for help from both CJ and his mother, Keisha McLeod. Today, Ms McLeod says nothing has been learned from her son's awful death. And that's why the Children's Commissioner's warning is so important. Responding to the report, the NSPCC said: ""Until recently, sexually exploited children were seen as part of the problem and complicit in joining gangs. We cannot afford to make that mistake this time around. ""When authorities come into contact with young people in criminal cases, they must understand how coercion and grooming has lured and trapped these children into committing crime."" Fellow children's charity Barnardo's added: ""It's worrying that many children involved in gangs are not known to services. ""Seriously stretched police and social workers are struggling to support growing numbers of children with complex needs, and help is rarely offered before they reach crisis point."" The Children's Commissioner is now calling on the government to make child criminal exploitation a ""national priority"". In response, a government statement said: ""We have proposed a new statutory duty on partners across education, social services and health to work together to tackle violence as part of a public health approach, and are providing Â£220m to support children and young people at risk of becoming involved in violence and gangs."" When contacted by the BBC, the children's commissioner for Northern Ireland said it did not have data on how many children were involved in gangs, adding that young people were more likely to be involved in paramilitary groups. The children's commissioner for Wales also had not collected data on the number of young people in gangs, but said it was taking a ""proactive approach"" to the issue and held regular nationwide meetings with children's groups. ""Resulting from that we are working with agencies like the police to work in a child centred way, respecting all of their human rights."" The commissioner for Scotland referred the BBC to astudy,externalthat concluded incidents involving gangs of young people using weapons in public places in the country were declining.

"This video can not be played US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un are meeting for a second day of talks North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has told reporters that he would not be at a summit with US President Donald Trump if he were not ready to denuclearise. The leaders are in Vietnam for talks on nuclear disarmament. They are under pressure to reach concrete measures after making little progress following a historic first summit last year. But the summit has been cut short by two hours and it's not clear why. Mr Trump earlier said there was ""no rush"" to reach a deal. But when Mr Kim told reporters that if he was not ready to denuclearise he ""wouldn't be here"", the US leader responded: ""That might be the best answer you've ever heard."" Analysts say it remains unclear what exactly Mr Kim means by denuclearisation. The pair were holding a discussion at a conference table with aides and cameras present, after the first round of closed-door discussions in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. Mr Trump and Mr Kim are believed to be discussing a roadmap for removing nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula and could also announce a formal treaty ending the Korean War or even the establishment of liaison offices. The first summit last June in Singapore between two leaders who had previously only exchanged vitriol was certainly a historic moment. Now, they are both very conscious of the need to answer their critics with signs of concrete progress. Washington had previously said North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief, but that condition is known to be a sticking point for the North Koreans. Follow our live updates What Trump wants from Kim talks Speaking ahead of their talks, Mr Trump appeared to again address scepticism about the success and progress of their last summit, saying he wanted to get the ""right deal"". ""I've been saying very much from the beginning that speed is not that important to me. I very much appreciate no testing of nuclear rockets, missiles, any of it,"" Mr Trump said, adding that he had ""great respect"" for Mr Kim. Meanwhile, answering his first question from a foreign reporter, Mr Kim said: ""It's early to tell, but from my instincts, I do have a feeling that good results will emerge.""

"This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Michael Cohen is unleashing a series of explosive accusations directed towards Donald Trump touching on multiple controversies that have bedevilled the president during his time in office. Here are five takeaways from his dramatic testimony to Congress. Mr Cohen suggests the president had advance knowledge of his son's June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians and that WikiLeaks was poised to release damaging information about Democrats. He says the president personally signed cheques reimbursing him for a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He alleges that the president was fully aware of ongoing negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow well into the 2016 presidential campaign. All the latest from the hearing Many of these assertions rely almost exclusively on Cohen's word - the word of a man who has already admitted to lying to Congress and to the federal government on his taxes. What's more, while his allegations are certainly politically damaging, they aren't incontrovertible evidence of legal misconduct by the president. This video can not be played Michael Cohen: Trump told me 'Don Jr had worst judgement in world' If there is a case to be made against Mr Trump, it will have to rely on more than the word of his former lawyer and fixer. That's not to undersell the blockbuster nature of the day's proceedings, however. The public now has a chance to determine, under the glare of the spotlight, whether Cohen lied in the past to protect the president or is lying now to protect himself. Or, perhaps, a bit of both. Most of the early attention paid to Michael Cohen's testimony involved his connections to the assortment of controversies that have swirled around Mr Trump since he became president. It's one thing to read the advance text of a committee statement, however, and it's another to see it in the flesh. If there were any doubts about how effective Cohen would be as a witness, he quickly put them to rest. Cohen - in a dark suit, with his voice occasionally wavering - testified about what it was like to work with Mr Trump for more than a decade. What he learned, he said, made him ashamed. He called his former boss a racist, a cheat and a conman. He says he had both good and bad attributes, but that bad outweighed the good. ""Since taking office,"" Cohen said, ""he has become the worst version of himself."" Republicans were quick to pounce. Mark Meadows asked why, if Cohen was so ashamed, he stuck with Mr Trump for 10 full years. Wasn't it a possibility, he suggested, that Cohen was bitter that he didn't get a White House job and was taking it out on his former boss? ""I got exactly what I wanted,"" Cohen replied, noting that he preferred to spend his time in New York, with his teenage children. That may have been the case two years ago, but there's little chance Cohen wanted - or imagined - the situation he finds himself in now. Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have repeatedly hit on what could be the most legally damaging part of Cohen's testimony on Wednesday. Mr Trump's former lawyer has presented new, documentary evidence of payments made to him by Mr Trump - including a cheque with the president's signature. He says this money was a reimbursement for his 2016 election eve hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels. The adult film star was poised to claim that she and Mr Trump had sexual relations in the 2006. US government prosecutors in New York have said that Mr Cohen's payment to Daniels constituted an undisclosed campaign contribution in violation of federal election law - a charge to which Cohen has pleaded guilty. If Cohen can help draw a connection between the Daniels payment and the president himself, it could implicate Mr Trump in a crime. The president's legal team has responded to similar allegations in the past by arguing that the payments to Cohen were part of a retainer fee and that Mr Trump had no knowledge of Cohen's illegal activities and was relying on his lawyer to know and abide by campaign finance law. The more evidence Cohen presents to back up his claim that Mr Trump was fully aware of the hush-money payments, the more difficult it becomes for him to maintain this position. The Republican strategy for responding to Cohen's testimony has been clear from the beginning. They want to paint the former lawyer as a convicted liar who can't be trusted on any count. They're less concerned about rebutting the individual allegations - about Trump Tower, Russia business dealings, hush-money payments or WikiLeaks revelations - than they are in dismissing Cohen's testimony as the work of an untruthful man being put forward by enemies of the president for political purposes. Congressman Paul Gosar went so far as to hold up a large sign with ""Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire!!"" emblazoned over a picture of the witness. Cohen has tried to parry these charges multiple ways. One is to claim that he has come to the realisation, after Mr Trump's performance as president, of how damaging his support of his former boss has been. He cited the Charlottesville violence, the Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin and the president's coarseness on Twitter as prime examples. That could be a tough sell, however, given the litany of allegations Cohen has levelled against Mr Trump that predate his time as president. A more effective counter has been when Cohen has tried to hold himself up as a cautionary tale - that he is making amends because his life has come crashing down and not the other way around. ""I protected Trump for 10 years,"" he told the committee. ""The more people that follow Mr Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering."" He called himself the ""picture perfect example of what not to do"". Cohen isn't going to convince many that he's a saint or a sympathetic figure. When he's been his most effective on Wednesday is when he hasn't tried to. Donald Trump wrapped up his day in Vietnam around the time Cohen began his congressional committee testimony. After a lavish dinner of chilled shrimp, grilled steaks and ""chocolate lava cake"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, he returned to his hotel room, where if past history is any guide, he probably reviewed the day's news coverage. What he saw couldn't have made him happy. US media - including his favourite, Fox News - are giving the Cohen hearings wall-to-wall coverage. The president's second summit with Mr Kim, being billed as ""historic"" by the White House, has been relegated to a secondary story. That might change on Thursday, when the two leaders hold a joint press event where they could announce the results of their negotiations. But for one day at least his former lawyer - who he once said was a ""fine man with a wonderful family"" and later called a ""rat"" - held the national stage. Cohen has given Democrats on the Oversight and Reform Committee a number of threads to pursue in further hearings and investigations. It isn't a stretch to imagine that portions of his testimony could someday be cited by Democrats as evidence for impeachment hearings. In addition Cohen hinted at other potential presidential wrongdoing and illegalities - including a conversation with the president in June 2018 - that he couldn't discuss because they are currently being investigated by US attorneys in New York. The president is half a world away, but the fallout from Cohen's day on Capitol Hill - a day when Cohen called the president a racist, a conman and a cheat, and Republicans called Cohen a liar - will be waiting for him when he gets home.
