"This video can not be played Matthew Rees helped David Wyeth up The Mall to the finish line of the London Marathon It's been hailed as the defining image of this year's London Marathon: runner Matthew Rees stopping to help fellow competitor David Wyeth after he almost collapsed just metres from the finish line. But why do some runners' legs turn to jelly? With the end in sight, David Wyeth's legs began to buckle. Staggering along The Mall, head dropping, it looked like he would not complete the race. But - in a show of comradeship that has quickly gone viral - fellow runner Matthew Rees stopped, pulled Mr Wyeth up and they completed the 26.2 mile challenge together. ""I saw David and his legs had completely collapsed beneath him,"" the Swansea Harriers runner told BBC Breakfast. ""I went over and he said 'I've got to finish' and I said 'you will' and I helped him up."" His struggle is reminiscent of an exhausted Jonny Brownlee, who was helped over the finish line by brother Alistair in the Triathlon World Series in Mexico last year. Jonny required treatment but later tweeted he was OK, with a photo of himself lying in a hospital bed on a drip. This video can not be played Jonny Brownlee helped over finish line by brother Alistair in Mexico At the time, Alistair said: ""I wish the flippin' idiot had paced it right and crossed the finish line first. ""You have to race the conditions. I was comfortable in third. I raced the conditions, I took the water on, made myself cool and I was alright."" London Marathon Coach Martin Yelling says it is like runners have ""run out of petrol"". ""At the end of a marathon runners usually have given so much physically that their energy levels are completely depleted - the term is hitting the wall,"" he says. ""What that means is your body is struggling to find enough physical energy to move forward, the body is trying to tell you to stop."" He says there is a clear wrestle between physical exhaustion and ""incredible mental strength"" in runners who have hit the wall. ""For every-day runners it is about learning to understand how your body responds. ""We would call it listening to your body."" Training for a marathon, pacing yourself and the correct fuel and hydration is important in avoiding the wall and the so-called ""jelly legs"", he says. Other runners were helped by others as they collapsed before the London Marathon finish line Tim Navin-Jones, from running club London City Runners, is one runner who can sympathise, having ""hit the wall"" himself during the New York Marathon. ""Your mind is telling you to keep going and your body is getting to the point where it says 'no',"" he says. ""Your legs really do turn to jelly - it is horrific. ""It is like being a really horrible version of drunk. It is sheer exhaustion."" Mr Navin-Jones, who has run five marathons among other distances, says it is difficult to know how to pace a marathon for those who have not done it before. A common mistake is runners starting a race too fast, he says. Emma Ross, head of physiology at the English Institute of Sport, says runners ""hit the wall"" in a marathon when they run out of carbohydrate to use as a fuel for running. ""So what you want to try and do is keep your carbohydrate stores topped up during the race to prevent you from predominantly having to use fat as a fuel,"" she says. ""When we use fat as a fuel, we have to go slower because as a process of burning energy it is a more complex and a slower system, so we can only support slower exercise."" She also warns that dehydration causes a decrease in blood volume, which makes the heart work harder, so it is important for runners to keep hydrated. Runner Gary McKee completed 100 marathons in 100 days for MacMillan Cancer Support, finishing on Sunday at the London Marathon. Gary McKee completed 100 marathons in 100 days for MacMillan Cancer Support, raising more than Â£67,000 The 47-year-old, from Cleator Moor in Cumbria, says he managed to not hit the wall as he paced himself carefully during his challenge. He says runners have to recognise when their body is telling them to stop. ""It is down to hydration. You will come to a point when you are tired. ""Have you overexerted yourself? Have you had enough calories? Enough carbs? ""The more you train, the higher your fitness levels become, so you can sustain it (running) for longer. ""If you understand what your body wants, just give it what it wants."" 'It's just being human, isn't it?' Video, 00:00:52'It's just being human, isn't it?'

"Emmanuel Macron is a passionate Europhile The relief in Brussels is palpable. It believes it is (almost) back from the brink. A passionate Europhile, Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign is as much blue and yellow as it is the ""tricolour"" of France. The EU, he believes, should to be at the heart of French politics, with more integration in finance, defence and migration. He wants to breathe life into the now-spluttering Franco-German motor; to take a lead role with Germany to - in his eyes - Make Europe Great Again. Angela Merkel and the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker can hardly conceal their delight. Both were quick to get on the phone to congratulate Mr Macron on his strong showing in Sunday's vote. By this autumn fervent Eurocrats hope to look back fondly to a string of electoral defeats for populist Eurosceptics in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then Germany. But they shouldn't count their chickens. Euroscepticism is widespread in France, whether or not Marine Le Pen becomes president. Marine Le Pen tapped into anti-EU feeling In the post-industrial north-east of France, with its hopelessly high unemployment, and in the resentful south-east with its struggling small businesses, globalisation and the EU are seen as joint public enemy number one. The nostalgic nationalism peddled by Ms Le Pen is a source of comfort and hope. ""In the name of the people"" is her campaign slogan. Woman of the people is her image. A guide to the final candidates French election poll tracker Five things we learned from round one Europe reacts to French election Markets sense relief after French vote Online calls for boycott She was the only presidential candidate amongst 11 to hold their Sunday night election party outside Paris, basing herself in the troubled town of HÃ©nin-Beaumont where she first made a political name for herself as a local councillor. Sharpening her political claws against Emmanuel Macron, she is now keen to portray him as an arrogant elite-educated former banker, best friend of Brussels and the French bourgeoisie. And if Ms Le Pen beats the odds and garners France's top political job, that would spell the end of the European project as we know it. She wants France out of the euro - which so many French blame for high prices and uncompetitiveness. And she dreams of the EU's demise, favouring a looser union of European nations over what she calls Brussels-domination. The two will now go head-to-head in the second round Post-Brexit Britain would then be high up on her list of preferred European partners. But before that could happen, current Brexit negotiations and future trade talks would be left hanging as the EU slowly imploded. There would be chaos across EU countries which would affect Britain too. A President Macron, when it comes to Brexit, would likely play hardball. He would help to keep the EU united in negotiations, making it harder for the UK to pick off individual countries, attempting to pressure or entice them to make a sweeter Brexit deal. But EU passion aside, Mr Macron is not wedded to ideology. He is a newcomer to politics who claims to be neither right- nor left-wing. During his meeting with Theresa May in February he said post-Brexit economic, defence and security co-operation with Britain must remain close. As a former (if not long-standing) Minister of the Economy in France, he is unlikely to turn up his nose at a good trade deal with the UK.

"The claim:260,000 children in Scotland are living in poverty, 40,000 up on last year. Reality Check verdict:The best available figures suggest he is right to say there has been a jump in child poverty in Scotland to 260,000 after several years of little change. Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn addressed the Scottish Trades Union Congressin Aviemore on Monday. He highlighted the increase in relative child poverty in Scotland, saying that 260,000 children are living in relative poverty, which is up 40,000 on last year. The figures come froma Scottish Government publication,,externalwhich calculates relative poverty as living in households with incomes below 60% of the median income for the UK, after housing costs have been paid. The median income is the one for which half of UK households have a higher income and half have a lower one. The most recent figure is for the financial year 2015-16, and suggests that 260,000 children were living in relative poverty after housing costs, which is 26% of children in Scotland. That's up from 220,000 or 22% in 2014-15. The figures in this report come from the Family Resources Survey, which collects information about 2,700 households in Scotland. That's a large survey, but it still has a margin of error, so when it suggests that 260,000 children are living in poverty it means that the statisticians are 95% confident that the actual figure is somewhere between 190,000 and 320,000. That means that even though 40,000 is an unusually large increase, it is well within the margin of error and so the change is not statistically significant. The Scottish Government proposed aChild Poverty Bill last year.The bill will set ambitious targets for reducing child poverty by 2030. The report itself warns against placing too much emphasis on a single year's figures. ""More data will be required to judge whether these changes are indicative of a longer term trend,"" it says. Nonetheless, these are official figures and they are the best figures available, suggesting there may have been a jump after several years of little change.

"Children of the 1980s, rejoice - the original Bananarama line-up is back together at last. Which got us thinking - lots of 80s bands have reformed over recent years but which ones are we still wishing would reunite? Frankie says relax - still the best slogan T-shirt ever Liverpool band Frankie Goes to Hollywood, fronted by Holly Johnson, are still best remembered for their debut single Relax, which was famously banned by the BBC in 1984 due to its sexual lyrics but topped the UK singles chart for five consecutive weeks. The band went on to become only the second act in the history of the UK charts (after Gerry and the Pacemakers) to reach number one with their first three singles when Two Tribes and The Power of Love also hit the top spot. But their glory was short-lived. Their second album, Liverpool, released in 1986, failed to live up to expectations and a backstage bust-up between Johnson and bassist Mark O'Toole at their final gig at Wembley Arena sounded the death knell. While various reincarnations of the band have since reformed, we're still waiting for the original line-up to hit us ""with those laser beams."" 2. The Smiths The Smiths - we are never, ever, ever, getting back together Never gonna happen. Yes, we know. But just imagine! Johnny Marr and Steven Morrissey formed the band in 1982 with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. They went on to release 17 singles and four studio albums, becoming one of the most influential bands of the 1980s. Hits included This Charming Man, Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now, How Soon is Now?, Big Mouth Strikes Again, Panic and Girlfriend in a Coma. But the dream combo of Marr's melodies and Morrissey's musings was broken with the band's acrimonious split in 1987. In Marr's autobiography Set The Boy Free, he revealed that the official version of him walking out on the band wasn't the full story. The tipping point, says Marr, was when Morrissey didn't turn up for the video shoot of the single Shoplifters Of The World Unite, and ordered him to sack their latest manager. Whatever the truth, Marr also wrote that he and Morrissey discussed the possibility of a reunion back in 2008. We're still waiting. 3. Curiosity Killed the Cat Ben Vol-au-vent Parrot, as Smash Hits liked to call him Ring a bell? We've been wondering whatever happened to the beautiful beret-wearing Ben with the exotic-sounding surname Volpeliere-Pierrot (although Smash Hits preferred to call him Ben Vol-au-vent Parrot), not to mention Julian, Nick and Migi. The band enjoyed 80s success with soulful pop hits including Down to Earth, Ordinary Day, Name and Number and Misfit. They split after a last hurrah with a cover of Johnny Bristol's Hang On In There Baby in 1992. While Ben has joined some 80s tours singing solo the band have never reunited as a four-piece. It's 30 years this year since Misfit and Ordinary Day entered the charts, so perhaps now would be a good time to hit the road again? It wasn't a real 80s band without the obligatory sax It's well documented thatPaul Weller would only reform The Jam if his children were ""destitute"",external. But what about his later band, Style Council, which he formed with Mick Talbot, formerly of The Merton Parkas and Dexy's Midnight Runners? The Style Council had hits such as Walls Come Tumbling Down!, Shout to the Top, You're the Best Thing and Long, Hot Summer. The band broke up in 1989. Weller has since said they didn't get the credit they deserved. ""I thought we were quite misunderstood,externaland misrepresented. Yet, at the end of the day, we made some good records and I wrote some good songs around that time, songs I still stand by, and I think that will last as well."" The Housemartins - ""the fourth best band in Hull""? Formed in Hull in the 1980s, The Housemartins line-up changed frequently over the years but most of us will remember its most famous members, Paul Heaton and Norman Cook AKA Fatboy Slim. Caravan of Love and Happy Hour were probably their best known hits and Heaton and Cook went on to further success with The Beautiful South and Beats International/Fatboy Slim. In 2009, Mojo magazine got The Housemartins' original members together for a photo-shoot and interview but they said they would not be reforming. So it looks like we won't be hearing from ""the fourth best band in Hull"" - as The Housemartins often described themselves - anytime soon. Don't Leave Me This Way Jimmy! While Bronski Beat continued following the departure of vocalist Jimmy Somerville in 1985, they are still best remembered for the hits they had with him at the helm, including Why?, Smalltown Boy and It Ain't Necessarily So. Somerville, of course, went on to form The Communards with Richard Coles, who is now a Church of England priest and Radio 4 presenter. But will we see either of these bands back together? Larry Steinbachek, former keyboardist with Bronski Beat, sadly died at the age of 56 in January. And the Communards? Coles and Somerville fell out,not least because Coles lied when he told Somerville he had HIV,external. The two are back in touch now but with Coles' commitments to the Church, a reunion seems unlikely. 7. The Thompson Twins The Thompson triplets - sorry, Twins, in their most recognised form Yep, it's our wildcard entry - the band that was named after the two bumbling detectives Thomson and Thompson in The Adventures of Tintin. The band had various line-up changes over the years but they were best known as the mid-80s trio consisting of Tom Bailey, Alannah Currie and Joe Leeway. Their hits included Hold Me Now, Doctor! Doctor! and You Take Me Up but Leeway left the band in 1986 and Bailey and Currie could never replicate their earlier success (although they did have a dance hit in 1991 called Come Inside). The pair had two children together and moved to New Zealand. While they did briefly reunite with Leeway on a Channel 4 show in 2001, they have so far resisted the urge to go down the nostalgia road and reform. In 2014, Bailey began performing the band's hits asThe Thompson Twins' Tom Bailey,externaland continues to tour in 2017.

"We're as confused as these guys... A British woman's revealed she fell pregnant with twins, then conceived while carrying them and gave birth to triplets. It's called superfoetation - when someone conceives then conceives again between two weeks and a month later. It's extremely rare in humans. This is only the sixth time it's happened in 100 years. Fertility expert Professor Simon Fishel says: ""It ought not to happen, but it does."" ""The first case was reported in 1865 and there have been odd ones every now and again over the decade."" Most of us assume that once a woman becomes pregnant then that's it, but not according to the man who delivered the first IVF baby in 1978. ""Evolution is designed, especially in women, that they don't release another egg,"" he says. ""If they ever did then it shouldn't be fertilised because the sperm shouldn't be able to get through. ""Even if that happens the lining of the womb would be unable to accept another embryo as changes have taken place while the foetus is growing in there."" It is remarkable for superfoetation to occur, but there's not always a happy ending. ""There have been cases where the other foetus has died in the womb as one could stop growing and have to be delivered early,"" says the professor. One of the questions raised is how the foetuses will cope in the womb and whether they will end up competing at feeding time. ""It depends on the quality of the placenta, that is the most important thing for nutrition and development of the growing baby,"" Prof Fishel adds. ""If the placenta develops normally then it's fine but if the placenta fuses then that can cause problem. In the superfoetation situation we've seen here, it's worked fine."" It's claimed it's more prevalent in animals such as rodents, rabbits, horses and sheep. Although rare in humans these miracle births do happen and sometimes can be even more extreme. ""There was a case in Rome some time ago where they estimated it was about three to four months difference,"" says Prof Fishel.

"Ever since he glided down a golden escalator to announce hiscandidacy, I've been talking to voters about Donald Trump. Around dinner tables in Arkansas and Alabama, at rallies in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and on plane journeys to New Hampshire and Nevada, I've been gauging views in more than 20 states. So how do people rate the Trump presidency so far? We contacted 100 people who had spoken to the BBC during the primaries, campaign and beyond. Our #Trump100 focus group consisted of 50 who had voted for Mr Trump, and 50 who didn't. Judging by the responses, there is still a huge divide in the way Americans view issues like immigration, abortion and the role of government - and those views remain deeply entrenched. The strike on Syria was one of the few areas which didn't elicit a partisan response, with some Trump voters disagreeing with it and some Clinton voters supporting the action. This video can not be played The divided newlyweds split over Trump's performance Healthcare and tax reform were two policy areas mentioned the most frequently. Both issues are priorities for President Trump and are among the most challenging in his in-tray. Overall, those who voted for Mr Trump think he's doing a fantastic job. For those who didn't, the needle has barely changed - some even want him impeached. Here is what some of them told us about his first 100 days. When I met Jan Berry at her home in Arkansas back in October, she had nothing good to say about Donald Trump. A lifelong Republican and a committed Christian, she felt her party's nominee was boorish and brash. But despite her reservations, she cast a ballot for Mr Trump. ""I did a lot of soul searching, and the thing that helped me make the decision had to do with Hillary Clinton's views on abortion,"" she says. ""I haven't really regretted my vote, even though there are lots of things Mr Trump has done that are ridiculous and embarrassing,"" she says. His decision to nominate conservative justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a reason Berry, along with many other reluctant Trump voters we spoke to, still backs him. Highs: Appointing Gorsuch and picking non-politicians for his cabinet. ""At first I wasn't sure about Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, as he was from Exxon, but I've been so impressed with him,"" she says. Lows: His refusal to shake Angela Merkel's hand in the Oval Office. ""I thought that was about the lowest thing he's done, in front of the whole world. It just embarrassed me."" Voters talk to the BBC: Talking Trump at 30,000ft 50 Trump fans explain why they love him What Trump supporters want from their president A first-time voter and student at Florida International University, Ally Bross was one of the youngest supporters of Mr Trump I met, and one of the most emphatic. As a native of Orlando, Ally saw the Pulse nightclub shooting harden her political views. ""When Trump said we're going to fix terrorism, we are going to put an end to Isis, I was all for it,"" she says. But the elation she felt in November evaporated after the president's strike against a Syrian airbase. ""I feel like he's putting us in the middle of a war,"" she says. She is concerned that there will be more action to come against North Korea. Ally broadly supported the travel ban, but is unhappy with the way it was rolled out. As a student at a diverse university, she saw friends struggle to get back into the country with their green cards. ""It shouldn't have been so strict. You can't just block everybody out,"" she says. ""I don't want America to become that"". Highs:""I love that he helped Flint, Michigan after they had a crisis with their water,"" she said, referring to a $10m grant for Flint awarded by Trump's Environmental Protection Agency, which had been approved by President Obama. Lows: Aside from the Syria strike, Ally is disappointed that the president failed to repeal and replace Obamacare. ""I think the government needs to get their butts out of our health care"". Lori Hack couldn't bring herself to vote for Donald Trump, even though she is an active member of the Republican party. ""My issue back then was that [Trump] had no record to back up what he was saying,"" she says. Lori initially expressed concerns about the president's lack of experience in governing, but is coming around. ""Being a president is different to running a company,"" she says. ""I think he's realised this is not a joke."" Lori is also impressed by his ""phenomenal"" choice of Neil Gorsuch and his unrelenting stance on immigration. ""He talked about sending people back across the border if they were here illegally, and he's doing that too"". Highs: President Trump's action on immigration. ""It's about securing the border,"" Lori, who supports the border wall, says. ""If you want to come in you'll have to go through the front door, the back door needs to be sealed."" Lows: ""I'm disappointed he's got his daughter and son-in-law in the White House - they're Democrats and their positions are more liberal."" More from the BBC: The scandal Trump can't shake What has Trump done so far as president? Trump's cabinet: The people around the president Sean Kehren's tears for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic convention made him an instant social media star as theCrying Peter Pan Man. When I met Sean then, he was sad to see Mr Sanders miss out on becoming the Democratic nominee, but ready to shift his support to Hillary Clinton. ""I didn't think we had the most charismatic candidate but her policies were things I cared about,""  he says. Sean accepts that Donald Trump won the electoral college, but wonders whether it was with the help of ""outside forces,"" namely Russia. This video can not be played Crying Bernie Sanders fan explains why Sean is now working full time as a political organiser, and has his eyes on the 2018 mid-term elections. ""Democrats need to keep up the pressure at town halls and have our voices heard."" Highs: Sean struggles to list any accomplishments, but does feel that son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka are ""steadier hands"" in the White House, even if they lack experience. Lows: Hiring right-wing advisers like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka. ""They've all studied how, when populations get into a reactionary mood, how you can really change a country."" I met James while he was volunteering for the Trump campaign in Virginia. Despite pollsters saying otherwise, he never doubted Mr Trump would win. ""I have never been so elated in my entire life,"" he says. ""I thank God, the saviour."" James, a former banker, is pleased with President Trump's first few months in the White House. He believes his meetings with everyone from the President of China to the Congressional Black Caucus show a willingness to be open and transparent. James is less concerned about how transparent the president's taxes are. ""The IRS already scrutinised his tax returns. If there was anything bad in them they would have caught them,"" he says. Highs: James supports the president's regular trips to Florida. ""I think Mar-A-Lago is a beautiful and wonderful place to bring foreign dignitaries."" Lows: The roll out of the travel ban - a common complaint from Trump supporters. ""It had hiccups,"" he says. ""I blame his advisers."" Beth Howard lives in rural Iowa, and bakes pies so delicious, she's made them her living. I got to sample her pastry prowess in January 2016, ahead of the Iowa caucus. She hosted a discussion around her kitchen table with both Republicans and Democrats. Beth was a passionate Hillary Clinton supporter, and like many Democrats in our #Trump100 panel, she struggles to find any positives in the Trump presidency. ""I'm a lot more pessimistic than I was before."" This video can not be played Can Iowa voters talk about their differences over pie? Along with tens of thousands of other women, Beth travelled to Washington DC to take part in the Women's March in January. It was the first time she participated in a political protest. Since the election she has also started baking what she describes as ""protest pies,external"" and volunteering with refugee and immigration assistance groups in Iowa, to help those she believes have been adversely affected by the president's policies. Those who support Mr Trump's agenda so far ""care more about money than people,"" she says. Beth was also unhappy that the president has brought his family members to work in the White House, ""These people aren't qualified to run our country,"" she says. Highs: She was unable to think of anything. Lows: She feels Mr Trump has destroyed America's reputation in the world. ""It's just this American cowboy mentality and arrogance that upsets me the most.""

"Emmanuel Macron is a passionate Europhile The relief in Brussels is palpable. It believes it is (almost) back from the brink. A passionate Europhile, Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign is as much blue and yellow as it is the ""tricolour"" of France. The EU, he believes, should to be at the heart of French politics, with more integration in finance, defence and migration. He wants to breathe life into the now-spluttering Franco-German motor; to take a lead role with Germany to - in his eyes - Make Europe Great Again. Angela Merkel and the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker can hardly conceal their delight. Both were quick to get on the phone to congratulate Mr Macron on his strong showing in Sunday's vote. By this autumn fervent Eurocrats hope to look back fondly to a string of electoral defeats for populist Eurosceptics in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then Germany. But they shouldn't count their chickens. Euroscepticism is widespread in France, whether or not Marine Le Pen becomes president. Marine Le Pen tapped into anti-EU feeling In the post-industrial north-east of France, with its hopelessly high unemployment, and in the resentful south-east with its struggling small businesses, globalisation and the EU are seen as joint public enemy number one. The nostalgic nationalism peddled by Ms Le Pen is a source of comfort and hope. ""In the name of the people"" is her campaign slogan. Woman of the people is her image. A guide to the final candidates French election poll tracker Five things we learned from round one Europe reacts to French election Markets sense relief after French vote Online calls for boycott She was the only presidential candidate amongst 11 to hold their Sunday night election party outside Paris, basing herself in the troubled town of HÃ©nin-Beaumont where she first made a political name for herself as a local councillor. Sharpening her political claws against Emmanuel Macron, she is now keen to portray him as an arrogant elite-educated former banker, best friend of Brussels and the French bourgeoisie. And if Ms Le Pen beats the odds and garners France's top political job, that would spell the end of the European project as we know it. She wants France out of the euro - which so many French blame for high prices and uncompetitiveness. And she dreams of the EU's demise, favouring a looser union of European nations over what she calls Brussels-domination. The two will now go head-to-head in the second round Post-Brexit Britain would then be high up on her list of preferred European partners. But before that could happen, current Brexit negotiations and future trade talks would be left hanging as the EU slowly imploded. There would be chaos across EU countries which would affect Britain too. A President Macron, when it comes to Brexit, would likely play hardball. He would help to keep the EU united in negotiations, making it harder for the UK to pick off individual countries, attempting to pressure or entice them to make a sweeter Brexit deal. But EU passion aside, Mr Macron is not wedded to ideology. He is a newcomer to politics who claims to be neither right- nor left-wing. During his meeting with Theresa May in February he said post-Brexit economic, defence and security co-operation with Britain must remain close. As a former (if not long-standing) Minister of the Economy in France, he is unlikely to turn up his nose at a good trade deal with the UK.

"It was on the cards but still a shock: the two parties that have run France for nearly 60 years have lost power. So what has the French presidential election told us that we did not already know? Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front has only two MPs and Emmanuel Macron's En Marche! (On the move) only emerged as a political movement in April 2016. And yet one of these two politicians will be the president of France and between them they attracted almost half the vote. Emmanuel Macron has never before been elected and now is favourite for the presidency It is a new French revolution that leaves the centre-right Republicans and the Socialist left on the sidelines. Yes, Mr Macron has served as economy minister in the outgoing Socialist government and was previously the president's protege. But he has never before been elected to a public position, and had to resign from the cabinet as his Socialist colleagues increasingly disowned him and his ideas. France heads into uncharted waters We knew Socialist President FranÃ§ois Hollande was unpopular but the party's candidate, BenoÃ®t Hamon, fell short even of his poll ratings, attracting just 6.35% of the vote. And yet five years ago it was all so different, with electoral dominance in the National Assembly and Senate as well as the ElysÃ©e palace. Not since 1969 has the left fared so poorly in France. BenoÃ®t Hamon fared worse than any other Socialist since the 1960s The seeds of this disaster were sown by the party's own public primary vote for choosing a candidate. A rebel in the party, Mr Hamon won the January vote convincingly, defeating the former prime minister, Manuel Valls. But because he was a rebel he never had the complete backing of most of the cabinet. Mr Valls even sided with Emmanuel Macron. Voters deserted the party, largely for Mr Macron or far-left firebrand Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. A guide to the final candidates World reacts to French election Markets sense relief after French vote Never before has the National Front (FN) attracted so many voters. More than 7.6 million French voters backed Marine Le Pen. The last time her party came anywhere close to that number was in regional elections in 2015, with 6.8 million votes. But the opinion polls do not augur well for her, even though arguably everything was in place for an optimal outcome. Polls suggest Marine Le Pen is on course for less than 40% of the vote in the second round The Le Pen team have fought for years to ""detoxify"" the FN brand; for years she was leading the opinion polls, her party won regional and European elections and the two mainstream parties were at a low ebb. And yet she still lost ground to Emmanuel Macron as the vote approached. A Harris Interactive poll suggests only 13% of voters believe she is likely to win on 7 May. Is that because her party is seen as a voice of protest, incapable of taking power? Recent experience from the Brexit referendum in the UK in June 2016 and the Donald Trump presidential victory in the US has told us to be wary of opinion polls and maybe not completely trust them. People do not always tell pollsters what they really think and some have called into question the methodology used. What does this mean for Brexit? But the French election may have restored some faith in the polling organisations, which accurately predicted the decline in support for Marine Le Pen and the rise of Emmanuel Macron. It was only in the days before the vote that the polls showed him pulling ahead, and that was the result that emerged. They also captured the rise of Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon - whose popularity swelled after his well-received performance in televised debates. The centre right were favourites to win. Their candidate, FranÃ§ois Fillon, was chosen in a popular vote and things were looking good. But then came the bombshell allegations that his wife was paid public money for work she did not do and that he had a liking for expensive suits and watches. So maybe it was not such a good idea: FranÃ§ois Fillon speaks to supporters on 24 April The Republicans were caught in a slow-motion car crash but because Mr Fillon had won the primary there was no Plan B. And the only possible alternatives looked little better. For a start, Mr Fillon refused to go. But veteran Alain JuppÃ© was deemed no better because he had been banned from politics for a decade in an earlier party-funding scandal. And ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has had his own problems with France's judiciary too. In the end securing almost 20% of the vote was an achievement, but the Republicans never really stood a chance.

"Brexit is a major issue at the UK general election - here's what we know about where the main parties across the UK stand. In short: Prime Minister Theresa May was against Brexit before the EU referendum but now says there can be no turning back and that ""Brexit means Brexit"". The reason she gave for calling a general election was to strengthen her hand in negotiations with the EU. How the party sees Brexit:The Conservatives' priorities were set out in a12 point plan,externalpublished in January and theletterformally invoking Brexit in March. Key elements include: No longer being bound by EU law and European Court of Justice rulings Quitting the EU single market and seeking a ""comprehensive"" free trade deal in its place Striking trade deals with other countries around the world A ""great repeal bill"" to convert existing EU law into UK legislation to be retained or scrapped Being prepared to walk away from talks: ""No deal is better than a bad deal."" Aiming for an ""early agreement"" to resolve the status of expats in the UK and EU Leaving the EU customs union and seeking a new customs agreement An as-yet unspecified immigration system to replace the free movement of EU citizens, aiming to bring total net migration below 100,000 Keeping all employment rights currently guaranteed by EU law Promising the ""voices and interests"" of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be heard What we don't know:The Conservatives have not said how they will control migration from the EU after Brexit. They have also not committed to the size of any separation payment they would accept, beyond saying the UK would meet its international obligations. They have not specified which matters returning from Brussels will be handed to devolved administrations and which will be kept at Westminster. Negotiating style:Mrs May has talked tough towards the EU in recent weeks, claiming some key figures were trying to interfere in the general election and promising to be a ""bloody difficult woman"" during negotiations. Where the MPs stand: More Tory MPs backed Remain than Leave in last year's referendum - but they now strongly support the UK leaving - in February, only one voted against the government beginning Brexit by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. All but one Tory MPs supported Theresa May in invoking Brexit Risks and rewards:Theresa May would use an election victory to say the country is uniting around her approach to Brexit, and has moved on from the divisions of the referendum campaign. But her uncompromising approach to leaving could upset some of the 48% who wanted to stay in, with the Lib Dems hoping to capitalise in areas - like London's Richmond Park in last year's by-election - that backed Remain. In short:The Labour Party campaigned against Brexit in the referendum but now says the result must be honoured, and is aiming for a ""close new relationship with the EU"" with workers' rights protected. How the party sees Brexit:Labour has set out several demands and tests it says Brexit must meet: Protecting all existing workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental protections Aiming for ""tariff-free access"" to the EU single market, while accepting ""unchanged access"" is impossible Leaving the option of the customs union on the table Refusing to accept a ""no deal"" scenario No second referendum on the final deal - but giving MPs a decisive say on what happens next Guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals living and working in the UK to stay in the country from ""day one"" No target numbers for migration levels Remaining in EU schemes like Erasmus and the 80bn euro (Â£69bn) Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme Protecting EU structural funding for the rest of the Parliament A ""presumption of devolution"" whereby devolved powers transferred from Brussels will automatically go to devolved nations and regions What we don't know:Like the Conservatives, Labour has yet to spell out how it will manage migration after Brexit, and has not been drawn on the size of ""divorce bill"" it would be willing to pay. Negotiating style:Jeremy Corbyn says he is aiming for ""sensible and serious negotiations"" and will not be ""threatening Europe"". Where the MPs stand:The vast majority of Labour MPs backed Remain ahead of the referendum - but most followed party orders to allow Article 50 to be invoked in February's vote. Risks and rewards:Labour is hoping its acceptance of the result will fend off attacks from the Tories and UKIP in Leave-backing areas - including Stoke Central where it won February's by-election. But there are divisions among MPs on the best way forward, and Labour faces the challenge of having to appeal to both sides of a polarising debate. General election: Your questions answered Brexit: All you need to know The Lib Dems hope a pro-EU stance will help them repeat their Richmond Park success In short:The Liberal Democrats are strongly pro-EU, and have promised to stop what they call a ""disastrous hard Brexit"". How they see Brexit:Central to the Lib Dems' offer is another referendum - this time on the terms of the final Brexit deal - in which the party would campaign to stay in the EU. The Lib Dems also say they will fight with ""every fibre of their being"" to protect existing aspects of EU membership, such as the single market, customs union and the free movement of people. They would guarantee EU citizens' rights and remain in Europe-wide schemes like Erasmus. Where the MPs stand:All of the Lib Dem MPs backed staying in the EU, and seven out of nine opposed triggering Article 50, with two abstaining. Risks and rewards:The Lib Dems are hoping their pro-EU pitch will help them gather voters in pro-Remain areas, as when they captured Richmond Park in London in December's by-election. But according to estimates based on the referendum results, two of their sitting MPs represent areas that backed Leave last June - which might make the party's second referendum policy a tough sell on the doorstep. In short:SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon wants Scotland to have a special status after Brexit and for a second independence referendum to take place before the UK leaves. How they see Brexit:The SNP's manifesto says it will demand a place for the Scottish government at the Brexit negotiating table. It says it will fight to keep Scotland in the EU single market. The SNP says it will also press the UK government to guarantee the status of NHS workers from mainland Europe, and oppose any attempt to treat the fishing industry as a ""bargaining chip"". Once negotiations are complete, and before the UK has left, the SNP wants a referendum on Scottish independence to take place. Where the MPs stand:The SNP's 54 MPs voted en masse against triggering Article 50 and are expected to maintain their vocal opposition to Brexit in the next Parliament. Risks and rewards:The SNP will hope to harness Scotland's support for remaining in the EU (it voted Remain by 62% to 38%). But a significant minority of its supporters are thought to have backed Leave - while the Tories are said to be targeting the Moray seat of SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, where Remain only narrowly saw off the Leave campaign in the EU referendum. UKIP says it will ensure the government does not ""backslide"" on Brexit In short:UKIP has long campaigned to leave the EU - and having finished on the winning side in the referendum, is now styling itself as the ""guard dog of Brexit"". How they see Brexit:The party has set six ""key tests"" for Brexit: Supremacy of Parliament, full control of migration, a ""maritime exclusive economic zone"" around the UK's coastline, a seat on the World Trade Organisation, no ""divorce"" payment to the EU and for Brexit to be ""done and dusted"" by the end of 2019. Green Party of England and Wales joint leader Caroline Lucas has called for a second EU referendum on the Brexit deal reached with Brussels, and the Greens have promised ""full opposition"" to what they call ""extreme Brexit"". Plaid Cymru, which campaigned to stay in the EU, says it accepts that the people of Wales voted to leave, but says single market membership should be preserved to protect Welsh jobs. The DUP campaigned in favour of leaving the EU - and, in its manifesto for this year's Assembly elections, said it wanted to see a ""positive"" relationship with the rest of Europe, involving ""mutual access to our markets to pursue common interests"". Having campaigned to stay in the EU, the SDLP's MPs have opposed the invoking of Article 50, saying it is being done ""against the will of people in Northern Ireland"", where most people voted to Remain in the EU. Before the referendum, the Ulster Unionist party said that on balance, it was better for Northern Ireland to stay in the EU - although not all its members agreed. It says it would honour the referendum result, and wants ""unfettered"" access to the single market and no hard border with the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Fein has accused the Conservative government of ""seeking to impose Brexit on Ireland"". It wants Northern Ireland to have a ""designated special status"" inside the EU.

"What do you do when the central policy on which your party was formed and has long campaigned becomes the domain of a political rival? If you're UKIP, get radical. Theresa May has framed this election in terms of Brexit. The Conservatives are the party which will deliver on the referendum result, she has said, while other parties - namely Labour and the Lib Dems - want to frustrate the process. In doing so she's stolen a march on UKIP; the party which for so long was the sole advocate of leaving the EU. It hasn't abandoned Brexit. It has said it will continue to ""hold the government's feet to the fire"" and push for the kind of EU exit it wants, adamant there's still a role to play. But UKIP needs a new unique selling point. Cue a plethora of policies designed to appeal to the party's core voters; a moratorium on new Islamic schools in the state system, Sharia courts outlawed and a ban on face coverings in public places. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not standing this time This is a return to right-wing territory in which UKIP has dabbled before. A step away from the libertarian values the party has said in the past that it stands for. It's an extension of the party's popular stance on controlled immigration; limit the number of people who come to the UK and ensure those who do fully integrate into society. But it's more than that. UKIP has long appealed to a certain emotion among parts of the electorate, portraying itself as the true protector of British values, proud to stand up for a way of life it claims is at risk of erosion from political correctness. Its integration agenda was quickly labelled by some as offensive, even Islamophobic, but for UKIP these policies are true patriotism, a defence of the realm and its values from what it calls ""crude multiculturalism"". UKIP still sees itself as the party prepared to say things other politicians won't, unafraid to risk offence to create debate. It takes credit for forcing other parties to talk frankly about immigration; now they hope to do the same with integration and in doing so ensure their relevance beyond Brexit and appeal to their traditional supporters. The Tories have stomped on UKIP turf, so the party's trying to break new ground. If it's more radical as a consequence? So be it. The question is whether it will be enough.

"Lib Dem membership has passed the 100,000 mark following a surge of new joiners since Theresa May announced a snap general election. The party said it has signed up 12,500 new members since last week - and is expected to reach its highest total in its history ""within days"". Leader Tim Farron said Lib Dems are the only party opposing Mrs May's ""hard Brexit agenda"". He insisted the party would not enter a coalition with the Tories or Labour. The biggest membership number the Lib Dems have had since their formation was 101,768 members in 1994. Election live: Rolling text and video updates Lib Dems raise Â£500,000 in 48 hours Tim Farron vows to fight 'hard Brexit' The recent flurry of interest means more than 50,000 members have joined since last year's European referendum - and more than 67,500 since the party's electoral low point, at the 2015 general election. Mr Farron, who pledged to build the membership to 100,000 when he became leader in 2015, said reaching the goal ""tells us that there's an appetite for change in British politics and Liberal Democrats are the vehicle for that change"". He said: ""People want a strong opposition to Theresa May's hard Brexit agenda and the Liberal Democrats are the only party challenging them up and down the country."" In an appeal to would-be supporters, he said: ""This election is your chance to change the direction of our country. If you want to stop a disastrous hard Brexit, if you want to keep Britain in the single market, if you want a strong opposition to fight for an open, tolerant and united Britain - this is your chance."" The Lib Dem leader also repeated his insistence that there are ""no circumstances whatsoever"" that the party will go in to a coalition with the Conservatives or Labour after the 8 June election, given the current approaches of those two parties. He also dismissed an informal arrangement to offer his party's support on budget measures and other key votes to help a minority Tory or Labour administration. On Sunday he told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""What Britain needs in this election is clarity and a contest. Theresa May has called this election because she believes it'll be a coronation. ""The Liberal Democrats are determined to make it a contest with a clear alternative position, and I don't want people thinking a vote for the Liberal Democrats is a proxy for anything else.""

"On general election polling day, broadcasters are obliged to refrain from coverage of campaigning and stick to uncontroversial accounts of politicians voting or the weather. But there could be an important news story that day relating to one of the main issues of the campaign - the state of the health service. Thursday 8 June is the day announced by NHS England for the publication of its monthly statistics. These cover a raft of data, including waiting times for accident & emergency and the number of people waiting longer than they should for cancer treatment and routine surgery. Election live: Rolling text and video updates BBC NHS Health Check In the absence of campaign coverage before the close of polls at 22:00 BST, the NHS figures published that day for the month of April may generate a certain amount of broadcast and online media interest. Given trends revealed in previous months, it's likely that waiting lists will be longer than a year earlier although there may have been improvement on previous months. NHS England updated its publications calendar only last week after the prime minister's announcement of the general election on 8 June. The monthly performance statistics are usually published on the Thursday of the first full week of a month so the choice of date is logical. The date chosen for the previous month's statistics is 11 May and the data then may fuel exchanges between the parties at the height of the campaign. This data publication issue has not occurred before because in previous campaigns NHS England was not putting out such a wide range of statistics on a single day each month. The current system only started in the summer of 2015. As things stand and if the chosen date is not altered, voters could head to the polling stations with the performance of the NHS one of the main news stories of the day. So are any other important health announcements due during the campaign? Whitehall's traditional ""purdah"" during an election period has begun. This obliges government departments and other public sector organisations to refrain from new policy announcements. The idea is to stop a government rushing out initiatives close to polling day. Usually purdah takes effect when parliament is dissolved but this time it has been imposed more than a week before that. There have been claims, denied by government sources, that closing down the official news machine early is part of Downing Street's attempt to tightly control the agenda. Pre-announced official statistics, like the NHS England performance figures, are not affected by purdah. It is the same for economic data announcements like unemployment and inflation which go ahead as usual. There is, however, uncertainty around one other key health service publication - the quarterly financial figures from hospitals and other trusts in England. The regulator NHS Improvement would normally publish in late May the total deficits for trusts for the three months ending in March. These are especially important as they cover the final quarter of the financial year and so give the full year total. The state of NHS finances is a political hot potato and these figures are sure to generate more heated debate. But will they be published during the campaign? Unlike pre-announced official statistics, the precise date for the NHS Improvement financial data is not confirmed until close to the chosen publication date. I am told there is a debate at a high level of the NHS over whether they should be released, as would be expected, a couple of weeks before polling day in June. There is a delicate balance to be struck between the public's right to see normally published information from autonomous NHS bodies and the need to take on board the sensitivities of a campaign. Some delicate decisions have to be made.

"Edvard Munch's The Scream: One of the world's most famous works of art Norwegian scientists have put forward a new theory to explain the inspiration behind one of the most famous works of art ever produced. The Scream (1892), by Edvard Munch, depicts a figure holding its face, which is making an agonised expression. But look above this individual and the sky is full of colourful wavy lines. The researchers say these are probably Mother of Pearl Clouds - rare phenomena that would have had a big impact on anyone who saw them for the first time. ""Today the general public has a lot more scientific information but you can imagine back in his day, he'd probably never seen these clouds before,"" said Helene Muri from the University of Oslo. ""As an artist, they no doubt could have made quite an impression on him."" Dr Muri was speaking here in Vienna at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly. Mother Of Pearl Clouds seen at LÃ¸renskog, Norway, in 2014 From Munchâs diary notes, 1890-1892 ""I went along the road with two friends â the sun set I felt like a breath of sadness - The sky suddenly became bloodish red I stopped, leant against the fence, tired to death - watched over the flaming clouds as blood and sword the city - the blue-black fjord and the city - My friends went away - I stood there shivering from dread - and I felt this big, infinite scream through nature"" The unusual sky formation in The Scream has previously been ascribed to volcanic effects. Just nine years before Munch's first rendering of The Scream, Krakatoa famously blew its top. This eruption in what is now Indonesia was one of the biggest such events in recorded history, and its sulphurous emission circled the globe to generate some spectacular sunsets. But the Norwegian group argues that the wavy shapes painted by Munch are a far better match for what are termed Polar Stratospheric (Type II) Clouds; or as they are also sometimes called - Nacreous Clouds. This video can not be played Helene Muri: ""They would have made quite an impression on the artist"" Their rarity comes from the very particular conditions needed in their formation, at altitudes between 15km and 20km. These requirements include not only very cold winter air, down at minus 80-85C, but a good degree of humidity as well. Atmospheric flow up and over mountains helps because it can inject moisture from the troposphere into the stratosphere, followed by a process called adiabatic cooling that can then greatly reduce air temperatures. ""That's when you can get very small ice crystals of about one micrometer,"" explained Dr Muri. ""These clouds are very thin and are best seen just before sunrise and after sunset, when the sun is below the horizon. ""You get these very distinct colourings, from the combination of scattering, diffraction and internal refraction of the sunlight on these tiny ice crystals."" Dr Muri has lived in the Oslo area for 25 years. She says she has seen the iridescent clouds only once with her own eyes - and she knows precisely when and what to look for. Such phenomena could have taken Munch completely by surprise, she believes. The background to The Scream was Oslo fjord, but what was the inspiration? The team first started investigating the possible link between the unusual meteorology and The Scream when consultant Svein Fikke observed a display of the clouds in 2014. He managed to take a series of stunning photos, and then started delving deeper into the story. Some very rare cloud types are reported to be increasing in frequency and distribution, perhaps due to climate change. An example would be Noctilucent Clouds. These are the highest clouds on Earth, forming at altitudes of 80km and more. There is evidence to suggest they are becoming more visible at lower latitudes than used to be the case. It is conceivable similar trends might occur with Nacreous Clouds, Dr Muri said, although no statistics can justify such a statement yet. ""We know that the troposphere is warming and expanding while the stratosphere above is compressing and cooling. So, the temperature characteristics of minus 80C and below might become commonplace in the future,"" she speculated.

"UKIP's proposed ban on full veils worn by some Muslim women has ""great public support"", the party's deputy leader has claimed. Peter Whittle said wearing a burka or niqab is ""an absolute symbol of the subjectification of women"". UKIP wants no new Islamic schools in the state system until the Muslim community ""is better integrated"". But Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas likened UKIP's integration agenda to ""full throttled Islamaphobia"". She spoke out after UKIP used a central London event to broaden its agenda beyond its successful campaign for Brexit. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates What you need to know about the election UKIP manifesto to include burka ban The party says it wants girls at risk of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) to have annual school-based medical examinations. It also wants failure to report FGM to be made into a specific criminal offence. Mr Whittle insisted his party wants people ""to integrate properly"", adding that UKIP firmly believes ""a multi-ethnic society can be a harmonious and successful one if it's bound together by an overarching attachment to Britain and British identity"". This video can not be played UKIP leader Paul Nuttall says full-face veils hinder integration But he argued that face coverings ""such as the Islamic veil are a deliberate barrier to integration - they say 'don't speak to me, I will not speak to you',"" adding that they are ""a potent symbol of female oppression"" and a ""security risk"". ""When it comes to things like the veil, France has banned it, Belgium has banned it,"" he told the BBC. ""The biggest parliamentary party in the European Parliament has recently called for an EU-wide ban on it."" Other UKIP policies unveiled ahead of the 8 June general election include: Medical practitioners having the right to waive patient confidentiality and report cases of abuse of children The Crown Prosecution Service pursuing the prosecution of parents of FGM victims Crimes where race is a factor, such as in the Rotherham child sexual exploitation cases, treated as hate crimes A ban on Sharia law and the setting up of a legal commission to disband Sharia courts Ensuring all official documents are in English. Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, claimed UKIP's integration agenda was ""an assault on multiculturalism and an attack on Muslims - it's full throttled Islamaphobia"". ""Now that the referendum has passed Nuttall's party is desperately scrabbling around for relevance and seems to have settled upon attacks on Muslims and fringe far right politics as their new home,"" she said. Former Lib Dem home office minister Baroness Featherstone claimed UKIP's FGM medical checks were ""horrifically heavy-handed"", arguing they would ""alienate the very communities we are trying to reach out to"". ""We should be training our teachers and other providers such as community experts to identify those at risk and teaching children themselves that FGM is wrong and to come forward if they fear for themselves or a friend,"" she said. This video can not be played Will Nuttall stand in general election? But Labour shadow home office minister Diane Abbott appeared to back the policy for mandatory medical checks during a Westminster Hall debate in 2014. At the time she said: ""It is a disgrace and a shame that in 2014 we cannot protect those young girls in London and other big cities.  We have to face up to the need for prosecution and for routine medical examination."" Former UKIP member and donor, Arron Banks said he was not in favour of his party's proposed ban on the full face veil. ""I think people have a right to their religious beliefs,"" he told BBC's Sunday Politics show. ""I think there are certain circumstances where if it's a security issue - maybe the airports, or public transport - it's acceptable, but I'm not in favour of curtailing people's [freedoms]."" However, he stood by the previous call he made on Twitter for a ban on Muslim immigration into the UK. The former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, proposed a burka ban in 2010. But the party later dropped the policy, and it did not appear in its 2015 manifesto. Full-face veils are already banned in public in some European countries, including France.

"Shoe repair and key-cutting business Timpson likes to hire Mr Happys If you had to pick a Mr Men character that you thought was most like yourself, which would you choose? Mr Happy? Mr Grumpy? Mr Clever? Or perhaps Mr Impossible? With global sales of more than 120 million, many of us remember the much-loved Roger Hargreaves books from our childhood. But as enjoyable as the tales are to read, few of us would have thought that they had a practical application in the world of business. Well that's the case at UK shoe repair and key-cutting business Timpson, which recruits new staff solely according to which Mr Men characters their personalities resemble. You can turn up for your Timpson interview with the world's finest CV or resume, and all the interviewer will do is work out whether you are a Mr Lazy (you don't have a hope), or a Mr Cheerful (you have a very good chance). ""We purely interview for personality,"" says Mr Timpson, who has been leading his family's firm for the past 42 years. John Timpson came up with the Mr Men recruitment policy ""We're not bothered by qualifications or CVs. We just look at the candidate and work out who they are, are they Mr Grumpy, Mr Slow, Mr Happy? ""If they tick all the right boxes then we put them in the shop for half the day. That's it, I dreamt that up years ago."" In explaining the thinking behind this rather novel approach to recruitment, Mr Timpson, 74, says that while you can train someone to do a job, you cannot train their personality. And if you look at the continuing performance of the business, the Mr Men method appears to work rather well. Timpson, a household name in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, saw sales rise 8% to Â£130m in the year to September 2015, with pre-tax profits up 65% to Â£10.3m. As you have no doubt already gathered, Mr Timpson doesn't like to run his company - which was set up by his great-grandfather in 1865 - according to business convention. Another factor that he says has been integral to its success is what he calls an ""upside-down management approach"", which gives the 1,325 Timpson branches a vast amount of autonomy. The firm has 1,325 branches across the UK and Republic of Ireland Mr Timpson, who has the chairman role, says: ""You can't train for great service, it's not by issuing rules or notices in the back of the staffroom. ""You only get great people when you give them the freedom, so we let them [staff] charge what they want. Here you can't tell people [the workers] what to do. ""So very often if a customer doesn't have the money, they can say 'don't worry, give us the money next time'."" Timpson employees can also spend up to Â£500 to settle a customer complaint, without having to check first with head office or a senior manager. But how does Mr Timpson ensure that workers are running a business and not a charity? He returns to the hiring process. Move along please Mr Grumpy ""When store managers pick people, they get good people,"" he says. ""And the staff get a weekly bonus depending on how the shop is doing. They're not giving the business away, we're trusting them to be commercial."" Another key policy at Timpson is to hire people who have a criminal record, with 10% of its 4,700 employees having served time in prison. The first Timpson shop opened in Oldham, now part of Greater Manchester, in 1865 Giving former criminals a second chance was the brainchild of Mr Timpson's son James, who since 2011 has been the firm's chief executive. Mr Timpson senior says: ""I was a little apprehensive at what other people would think, but I was proved wrong. ""Our colleagues take great pride it in, and our customers like it too."" John Timpson first joined the Manchester-based family firm as a teenager, working in a number of stores. At the time the company didn't just repair shoes, but also made and sold them. After university he joined shoemaking rival Clarks on a graduate scheme, before moving back to the family firm, and working his way up to buying director by the age of 27. Mr Timpson had to regain control of the business in the 1970s However, in 1973 Mr Timpson and his father were forced out of the business after a boardroom bust up that saw his uncle take control. The business did not fare too well without them though, and in 1975 Mr Timpson returned as managing director, and it was the uncle's turn to depart. Eight years later Mr Timpson led a Â£42m management buy-out from the firm's then parent group, returning it to family ownership. It was during this time that he made the decision to sell the shoe shops ""because they were heading nowhere"", and instead focus on shoe repairs. The firm has since gone on to diversify into key cutting, watch repairs and selling house signs. It has also bought photography businesses Max Spielmann and Snappy Snaps, and the dry cleaning division of Johnson Services. Retail analyst Richard Hyman says other store chains could learn a lot from Timpson. ""Timpson couldn't be a more unglamorous or unexciting business to be in, yet they manage to be dynamic and innovative,"" says Mr Hyman. ""They are a breath of fresh air. Son James Timpson now holds the chief executive role ""Timpson as a group is alive and kicking, and that's more than can be said for a lot more mainstream retailers."" While Mr Timpson has no plans to retire, it is his son James who now looks after the day-to-day running of the company. This has enabled Mr Timpson senior to write a newspaper column and release a number of business books, including his latest entitled Keys To Success. In addition to his career in business Mr Timpson has had a very busy family life. In addition to five kids of their own, he and his late wife Alex - who died last year aged 69 - fostered no less than 90 children throughout their marriage. Mr Timpson says that fostering ""taught me a lot about people"". Timpson staff are given a lot of autonomy ""I still try to help children in schools, and educate teachers on why children in the care system often behave the way they do."" Often travelling around the UK to visit stores, Mr Timpson says ""it's really nice going to a shop that's well run"". ""It's bloody nice when a customer says how nice that guy was. It's also nice to have a company that has values based on kindness and generosity. ""You can do good and make money at the same time.""

"The Tories have announced a key new detail in how their proposed energy price cap would work. It will be an ""absolute"" cap, based on the way limits for pre-payment meters have worked since the beginning of April. The party has rejected the idea of a relative cap, which would limit the difference between the cheapest fixed-price deal and the more expensive Standard Variable Tariff (SVT) to, say, 6%. That model was particularly controversial, as critics said suppliers would simply increase the price of fixed-rate deals, to maintain the differential with SVTs. The idea of any form of capping was rejected by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last summer. However, when it issued itsfinal report,external, the CMA admitted its members were divided on the issue. If the Conservatives win the election, the regulator Ofgem would be asked to introduce a price cap along the lines of one introduced in April to cap prices on households with pre-payment meters. Currently 16% of consumers are forced to buy their energy in advance, usually because their credit rating is poor. The CMA ordered a cap on their charges because such households do not benefit from the competition that exists for all other consumers. Under this system, the CMA has come up with an initialmaximum figure for prices,externalin each region of the UK, usually in line with the cheapest existing pre-payment meter tariff. That number is adjusted every six months, taking into account wholesale energy costs, inflation, environmental obligations and the cost of transporting energy around the network. But the CMA has always stressed that the pre-payment meter cap is temporary. By the time every home has a smart meters installed, it expects competition between suppliers to be working properly. As a result this cap is due to expire in 2020. The cap is also designed to allow suppliers to price below the level of the cap if they want to. However, critics say that suppliers would be likely to increase their prices up to the level of the cap. ""In New Zealand, a price cap resulted in price bunching up around the cap, and a loss of competition,"" said Iain Conn, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica. He also said that a cap in Spain resulted in a shortfall in infrastructure spending, which had to be plugged by the government. An absolute cap would be fundamentally different tothe controlsadvocated by Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 election. He had proposed a price freeze for just 20 months. As far as we know, the Tory cap would be permanent. Consumer groups are generally opposed to the idea of any sort of cap, as it would tend to give consumers a false sense of security. Householders might think they are getting a good deal, so would make even less effort to switch suppliers. ""They're really difficult to get to work in practice,"" says Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at comparison site Uswitch. He also believes that a cap would create higher prices in the long term, and entrench the position of the big six suppliers. At the end of its two-year enquiry the CMA rejected the idea of a price cap on standard variable tariffs, saying that a cap would run an ""excessive risk"" of undermining the competition process. Nevertheless the economist Martin Cave, a member of the enquiry, argued that a broader cap was necessary ""to address the scale of detriment"" because millions of the poorest consumers are still paying too much for their gas and electricity. In December 2016 Ofgemsaid that 66% of consumerswere still on expensive SVTs, and paying up to Â£260 a year too much. Since then, five of the big six suppliers have announced plans to raise their SVT prices, or have already done so. There is also some evidence that fixed-price deals have also risen, closing the gap with SVTs. But whether that is because of increasing wholesale costs - or because suppliers have been acting to mitigate the effects of a cap in advance - is hard to determine. While Ofgem has repeatedly said there was no justification for them doing so, it has so far refused to comment on the Conservative idea of a cap.

"Sue is her mother Patricia's carer The life of a carer can be very difficult. For Sue Jenkins, whose 88-year-old mother Patricia needs round-the-clock care, it is very hard indeed. Two years ago, Patricia was diagnosed with dementia. An accident four years earlier broke her back and since then she has been disabled, doubly incontinent and using a wheelchair. ""I have given up my life,"" says Sue. ""I used to sail a lot. I used to do so many things. I'm a very outward-going person. But I take care of my mother. And that's it. ""Love is something that drives you to give up those things. You'll give up anything."" But she's struggling. She cares for her mother 24 hours a day. Even taking the time to speak to us was difficult. Her mother calls for her constantly. She can't spend very much time away from Sue before becoming agitated. There are professional carers who come to the house to help, but none lives with them full time and it seems a big part of what Sue does is to manage them. More than 20 professional carers have come and gone over the last few months because Patricia's behaviour can be so difficult. ""Dementia strips the person of their personality,"" says Sue ""She has a lot of challenging behaviour,"" says Sue. ""Screaming, hitting out. It's horrible because dementia strips the person of their personality."" Her eyes fill with tears as she talks. The physical exhaustion of a life with little sleep is obvious. But the emotional strain of watching her mother deteriorate is pushing her to breaking point. ""I've lost my friend. My best friend. She's there - somewhere inside. But the person I dearly love and dearly want to talk to about so many things has left me already. ""And the thought of losing her fills me with complete dread. Because my life is very much her,"" she says. I ask her what it's like when her mother hits her. ""It's heartbreaking. It can make you feel useless. As she's saying that, it can make you want to run for the hills and just run into the night. ""And there have been many occasions when I've wanted to run off, thinking I was a useless carer."" The thought of losing her mum fills Sue with ""complete dread"" It costs more than Â£2,800 a week to keep Patricia at home. That money is paid by local care services. But the authorities have twice tried to stop the money. Sue says it is an attempt to force her to put her mother in a home. That is something she is adamant she will never do. ""I've seen what goes on in those places. It would kill her,"" she says. She feels hounded by the authorities and says it's taking valuable time away from her and her mother. She's says she is sometimes up through the night replying to emails, while still caring for her mother. ""It's been absolutely devastating. The hours that have been stolen from me - email after email after email - chasing and phoning,"" she says. ""The government wants to encourage people to stay in their own homes and nurse people in their own homes. And say there's support out there. But there isn't. ""It's the most isolating situation anyone could find themselves in,"" she adds. Sue says there are now only ""occasional little laughs"" with her mum There are more than 6 million people in the UK who look after sick or elderly relatives full time. Those numbers have been steadily increasing. But so have the pressures on people like Sue. UK Homecare Association this month said900 carers are quitting the industry every day. Government ministers say they will spend an extra Â£2bn on social care over three years. And earlier this week, Luke Hall, a Conservative MP on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said carers made ""a huge contribution to society"". ""It's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do,"" he said. ""That's why we already increased the rate of carer's allowance, meaning an additional Â£450 a year for carers since 2010."" For Sue, her dedication to her mother has meant she has sacrificed her own happiness. Her husband left her six years ago when she decided to look after her mother. ""You find that having any kind of relationship is very difficult. It would take a very understanding man to understand my situation."" Life has become increasingly lonely for her. Yet she tries to remain positive. ""It is worth it. There are occasional little laughs. Not often these days, but they're there. It's love. It's what you do. It's deep.""

"The group meets to provide mutual support It is a sunny Saturday afternoon and sausages are sizzling on the barbecue, wine is flowing and children shuttle between the swings and a plate of cupcakes. This gathering in Nottingham looks like any group of friends, but the adults have one thing in common - they have all been widowed. Way: Widowed and Young,externalis a peer support organisation, introducing people in similarly tragic situations to others who can understand their complex grief. All the members present agree that its regular meetings and internet chatroom have been an essential part of coping in the days and years since their bereavements. ""When my husband first died, suddenly from meningitis, I couldn't be in the house on my own. I had panic attacks,"" says Georgia Elms, who is now chair of Way. Georgia Elms was pregnant when her husband died She was widowed 10 years ago and discovered she was pregnant with her second daughter the following day. ""It really does affect your mental health. You become a different person and your self-confidence goes,"" she adds. ""You think you're going mad when you're grieving. For me - and everybody grieves differently - I wanted to check that what I was feeling was normal. It made me feel a lot calmer, that everybody else felt the same way."" Mental health concerns are a common theme in the group. ""It's normal to feel a little bit crazy. You feel these hugely strong emotions and the kids do too,"" says Sarah Philips, another member of the group. ""If that's not handled well, you can end up being a bit crazy."" Kevin Moore lost his wife to breast cancer eight years ago and joined Way in order to meet other fathers in the same position. ""It's a very traumatic experience. It turns your whole world upside down. It certainly does affect your mental health overall,"" he says. ""There are some very dark times and it's very despairing at times when you don't know what happens next. Being able to share your concerns helps you move through those times together. ""It's not a medical condition you can go to the doctor's with."" Angela Sumata's husband took his own life Being widowed at all is highly traumatic, but for Angela Sumata, whose husband Mark took his own life 13 years ago, her grief was almost impossible to process. ""Bereavement and grief is something that we all have to deal with in life. The thing that compounds it when somebody takes their life, is that it brings with it a whole different level of complexity, the emotions you feel, how they can change from day to day, hour to hour, minute to minute."" Angela joinedSurvivors of Bereavement by Suicide,,externalanother peer support organisation, in the wake of her experience. ""When Mark took his life we were very well treated on the night, but after that you're really reliant on your friends and family. What we didn't have was the offer of support from any professional. ""All of my help has come from the charity sector, from people realising that the specialist services aren't there and forming charities themselves."" It is especially important for people affected by suicide, says Angela, who is now a campaigner and fronted the BBC documentary Life After Suicide. ""There's people who consider suicide because they've been bereaved by suicide. If you don't receive the help you need to navigate through the issues, then absolutely it can lead to mental health issues."" Yvonne Tulloch said society was not geared up to help people who were suddenly bereaved One of the biggest issues, according to former cathedral minister Yvonne Tulloch, is finding the support when you need it. Her husband died suddenly nine years ago while on a business trip. She found her grief hard to contain and says she had suicidal thoughts herself. ""It's this massive sadness that comes over you and you just can't get out of that, and you feel like life just isn't worth living,"" she says. ""These days it feels like people just don't understand what you're going through, and society's not geared up to help. ""I spiralled down very rapidly and got to the point of beginning to think there's no point to my life any more. The thought of ending it began crossing my mind."" She has set up the websiteAt A Loss,,externalwhere users can search for the most suitable support, be it for the loss of a parent or partner, tailored to the individual's age. ""We are providing a one-stop shop website to help signpost the bereaved to support,"" she says. ""If you find somebody who's been through what you're going through, and has come out the other side, it gives you hope.""

"We're as confused as these guys... A British woman's revealed she fell pregnant with twins, then conceived while carrying them and gave birth to triplets. It's called superfoetation - when someone conceives then conceives again between two weeks and a month later. It's extremely rare in humans. This is only the sixth time it's happened in 100 years. Fertility expert Professor Simon Fishel says: ""It ought not to happen, but it does."" ""The first case was reported in 1865 and there have been odd ones every now and again over the decade."" Most of us assume that once a woman becomes pregnant then that's it, but not according to the man who delivered the first IVF baby in 1978. ""Evolution is designed, especially in women, that they don't release another egg,"" he says. ""If they ever did then it shouldn't be fertilised because the sperm shouldn't be able to get through. ""Even if that happens the lining of the womb would be unable to accept another embryo as changes have taken place while the foetus is growing in there."" It is remarkable for superfoetation to occur, but there's not always a happy ending. ""There have been cases where the other foetus has died in the womb as one could stop growing and have to be delivered early,"" says the professor. One of the questions raised is how the foetuses will cope in the womb and whether they will end up competing at feeding time. ""It depends on the quality of the placenta, that is the most important thing for nutrition and development of the growing baby,"" Prof Fishel adds. ""If the placenta develops normally then it's fine but if the placenta fuses then that can cause problem. In the superfoetation situation we've seen here, it's worked fine."" It's claimed it's more prevalent in animals such as rodents, rabbits, horses and sheep. Although rare in humans these miracle births do happen and sometimes can be even more extreme. ""There was a case in Rome some time ago where they estimated it was about three to four months difference,"" says Prof Fishel.

"French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron is the favourite to win the next round Emmanuel Macron has been installed as the overwhelming favourite to be the next French President - but what does that mean for business and Brexit? For the bigger economic picture, a Macron win removes the chance of a political and economic shock to Europe's core. Marine le Pen's calls for France to leave the eurozone have been seen as an existential threat to the entire European project. Macron's likely win has seen the French stock market and the euro surge as that threat is seen as  receding. A Macron win will be cheered by business who see him as untested and inexperienced but pragmatic and pro-business. Some argue that his business-friendly policies - such as cutting corporation tax from 33% to 25% and making it easier to fire (and therefore hire) workers - make France look more attractive to businesses scouring Europe for a potential EU base. Most bankers, for example, had put France near the bottom of the list when mulling any potential moves for those very reasons. A Macron presidency could see that change. But there are two good reasons a Macron win could still be good for the UK in its Brexit negotiations. First, Macron may want to cut taxes and water down workers' rights - but he has to form a government to do it, and may need the support of French socialists who were excited by Benoit Hamon's ideas of a universal basic income and 32-hour working week. His attempts to make France more attractive to business will have to navigate the rocks of coalition building. There have been many attempts to reform the French labour market. I can't think of a single success. The second is a wider point about the security of the European project. Fears that the UK's vote to leave the EU would inspire anti-EU sentiment right across Europe now seem to be fading. Geert Wilders' far right party in the Netherlands failed to live up to pre-election hype while its counterpart in Germany, Alternative fur Deutschland, is in disarray. The UK's antipathy to the EU has, so far, failed to catch on elsewhere. With that in mind, there is less reason to punish the UK in upcoming negotiations as a deterrent to other would-be leavers.

"Plans by the Conservative Party for a cap on household energy bills will lead to fewer benefits for consumers, says one of the UK's biggest providers. A cabinet minister said the Tories planned to intervene in the energy sector ""to make markets work better"". But Scottish Power, one of the ""Big Six"" energy firms, told the BBC that the move would ""stop competition"" and ""damage customers in the long run"". Shares in energy firms were hit by the proposed price cap. British Gas owner Centrica closed down 3.5% and SSE fell 1.9%, although both stocks had been lower earlier in the day. The energy industry has reacted with scepticism to the plan, saying it could lead to higher prices. Labour said the proposal should be taken with ""a pinch of salt"", adding that energy bills had ""soared"" under a Conservative government. Simon Jack: 'Dangerous' energy idea finds its time Tories to promise cap on energy bills Speaking to the BBC, Scottish Power's chief corporate officer, Keith Anderson, said: ""If you put a cap on prices, you actually stop competition. That's the danger of price intervention."" When companies do not compete as much, that tends to lead to fewer benefits for customers, he said. He added that if the Conservatives did intervene, it would be better if they abolished standard variable tariffs. About 800,000 of the poorest pensioners and 1.5 million low-income families with children are on standard variable tariffs, according to Citizens Advice. These households are paying an average of Â£141 more a year for a dual fuel gas and electricity bill than if they were on the cheapest deal, it said. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon defended the Conservative's intention to impose a cap on energy prices. ""We wanted to see more competition, we wanted to see more people able to switch between energy users,"" Sir Michael told the BBC. ""That over the last three or four years has not happened. This is a market that is not working perfectly and therefore we are intervening to make markets work better,"" he added. Co-leader of the Green Party Jonathan Bartley said the policy did not go far enough and he wanted more local choices of supplier for consumers. But trade association body Energy UK said a cap could risk ""billions in investment and jobs"". British Gas parent firm Centrica and fellow supplier E.On have both said market competition is essential. Price comparison site uSwitch.com said that previous interventions in the energy sector had led to lower switching rates and higher prices. If the Conservatives win the election, how might energy regulator Ofgem go about introducing a cap? One model is already in place. Earlier this month, Ofgem put a limit on prices that households with pre-payment meters are charged. Under this system, the Competition and Markets Authority has come up with an initial maximum figure for prices in each region of the UK, usually in line with the cheapest existing pre-payment meter tariff. A second model - known as the relative price cap - would tell suppliers to have a maximum differential between their expensive standard variable tariffs and their cheaper fixed price deals. For example, they might be told that their top tariff could only be a maximum of 10% more expensive than their cheapest deal. Both price cap models are fundamentally different to the controls advocated by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run-up to the 2015 election. He had proposed a price freeze for up to 19 months, although it would have allowed price reductions too. Under these two models, suppliers would also be free to reduce prices if they wanted to. However any cap could last for a much longer period. Read more here.

"Ever since he glided down a golden escalator to announce hiscandidacy, I've been talking to voters about Donald Trump. Around dinner tables in Arkansas and Alabama, at rallies in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and on plane journeys to New Hampshire and Nevada, I've been gauging views in more than 20 states. So how do people rate the Trump presidency so far? We contacted 100 people who had spoken to the BBC during the primaries, campaign and beyond. Our #Trump100 focus group consisted of 50 who had voted for Mr Trump, and 50 who didn't. Judging by the responses, there is still a huge divide in the way Americans view issues like immigration, abortion and the role of government - and those views remain deeply entrenched. The strike on Syria was one of the few areas which didn't elicit a partisan response, with some Trump voters disagreeing with it and some Clinton voters supporting the action. This video can not be played The divided newlyweds split over Trump's performance Healthcare and tax reform were two policy areas mentioned the most frequently. Both issues are priorities for President Trump and are among the most challenging in his in-tray. Overall, those who voted for Mr Trump think he's doing a fantastic job. For those who didn't, the needle has barely changed - some even want him impeached. Here is what some of them told us about his first 100 days. When I met Jan Berry at her home in Arkansas back in October, she had nothing good to say about Donald Trump. A lifelong Republican and a committed Christian, she felt her party's nominee was boorish and brash. But despite her reservations, she cast a ballot for Mr Trump. ""I did a lot of soul searching, and the thing that helped me make the decision had to do with Hillary Clinton's views on abortion,"" she says. ""I haven't really regretted my vote, even though there are lots of things Mr Trump has done that are ridiculous and embarrassing,"" she says. His decision to nominate conservative justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a reason Berry, along with many other reluctant Trump voters we spoke to, still backs him. Highs: Appointing Gorsuch and picking non-politicians for his cabinet. ""At first I wasn't sure about Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, as he was from Exxon, but I've been so impressed with him,"" she says. Lows: His refusal to shake Angela Merkel's hand in the Oval Office. ""I thought that was about the lowest thing he's done, in front of the whole world. It just embarrassed me."" Voters talk to the BBC: Talking Trump at 30,000ft 50 Trump fans explain why they love him What Trump supporters want from their president A first-time voter and student at Florida International University, Ally Bross was one of the youngest supporters of Mr Trump I met, and one of the most emphatic. As a native of Orlando, Ally saw the Pulse nightclub shooting harden her political views. ""When Trump said we're going to fix terrorism, we are going to put an end to Isis, I was all for it,"" she says. But the elation she felt in November evaporated after the president's strike against a Syrian airbase. ""I feel like he's putting us in the middle of a war,"" she says. She is concerned that there will be more action to come against North Korea. Ally broadly supported the travel ban, but is unhappy with the way it was rolled out. As a student at a diverse university, she saw friends struggle to get back into the country with their green cards. ""It shouldn't have been so strict. You can't just block everybody out,"" she says. ""I don't want America to become that"". Highs:""I love that he helped Flint, Michigan after they had a crisis with their water,"" she said, referring to a $10m grant for Flint awarded by Trump's Environmental Protection Agency, which had been approved by President Obama. Lows: Aside from the Syria strike, Ally is disappointed that the president failed to repeal and replace Obamacare. ""I think the government needs to get their butts out of our health care"". Lori Hack couldn't bring herself to vote for Donald Trump, even though she is an active member of the Republican party. ""My issue back then was that [Trump] had no record to back up what he was saying,"" she says. Lori initially expressed concerns about the president's lack of experience in governing, but is coming around. ""Being a president is different to running a company,"" she says. ""I think he's realised this is not a joke."" Lori is also impressed by his ""phenomenal"" choice of Neil Gorsuch and his unrelenting stance on immigration. ""He talked about sending people back across the border if they were here illegally, and he's doing that too"". Highs: President Trump's action on immigration. ""It's about securing the border,"" Lori, who supports the border wall, says. ""If you want to come in you'll have to go through the front door, the back door needs to be sealed."" Lows: ""I'm disappointed he's got his daughter and son-in-law in the White House - they're Democrats and their positions are more liberal."" More from the BBC: The scandal Trump can't shake What has Trump done so far as president? Trump's cabinet: The people around the president Sean Kehren's tears for Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic convention made him an instant social media star as theCrying Peter Pan Man. When I met Sean then, he was sad to see Mr Sanders miss out on becoming the Democratic nominee, but ready to shift his support to Hillary Clinton. ""I didn't think we had the most charismatic candidate but her policies were things I cared about,""  he says. Sean accepts that Donald Trump won the electoral college, but wonders whether it was with the help of ""outside forces,"" namely Russia. This video can not be played Crying Bernie Sanders fan explains why Sean is now working full time as a political organiser, and has his eyes on the 2018 mid-term elections. ""Democrats need to keep up the pressure at town halls and have our voices heard."" Highs: Sean struggles to list any accomplishments, but does feel that son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka are ""steadier hands"" in the White House, even if they lack experience. Lows: Hiring right-wing advisers like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka. ""They've all studied how, when populations get into a reactionary mood, how you can really change a country."" I met James while he was volunteering for the Trump campaign in Virginia. Despite pollsters saying otherwise, he never doubted Mr Trump would win. ""I have never been so elated in my entire life,"" he says. ""I thank God, the saviour."" James, a former banker, is pleased with President Trump's first few months in the White House. He believes his meetings with everyone from the President of China to the Congressional Black Caucus show a willingness to be open and transparent. James is less concerned about how transparent the president's taxes are. ""The IRS already scrutinised his tax returns. If there was anything bad in them they would have caught them,"" he says. Highs: James supports the president's regular trips to Florida. ""I think Mar-A-Lago is a beautiful and wonderful place to bring foreign dignitaries."" Lows: The roll out of the travel ban - a common complaint from Trump supporters. ""It had hiccups,"" he says. ""I blame his advisers."" Beth Howard lives in rural Iowa, and bakes pies so delicious, she's made them her living. I got to sample her pastry prowess in January 2016, ahead of the Iowa caucus. She hosted a discussion around her kitchen table with both Republicans and Democrats. Beth was a passionate Hillary Clinton supporter, and like many Democrats in our #Trump100 panel, she struggles to find any positives in the Trump presidency. ""I'm a lot more pessimistic than I was before."" This video can not be played Can Iowa voters talk about their differences over pie? Along with tens of thousands of other women, Beth travelled to Washington DC to take part in the Women's March in January. It was the first time she participated in a political protest. Since the election she has also started baking what she describes as ""protest pies,external"" and volunteering with refugee and immigration assistance groups in Iowa, to help those she believes have been adversely affected by the president's policies. Those who support Mr Trump's agenda so far ""care more about money than people,"" she says. Beth was also unhappy that the president has brought his family members to work in the White House, ""These people aren't qualified to run our country,"" she says. Highs: She was unable to think of anything. Lows: She feels Mr Trump has destroyed America's reputation in the world. ""It's just this American cowboy mentality and arrogance that upsets me the most."" Five Trump changes you may have missed Grassroots movement trying to topple Republicans in 2018 As the founder of Latinos for Trump, Marco Gutierrez faced criticism from friends and family, but he remains a firm supporter of Donald Trump. While many #Trump100 voters we've spoken to have concerns about the president's Tweets, Marco believes some of his more controversial online tirades, like unfounded accusations President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, were borne out of vigilance. ""I think he was seeing all these leaks being reported, and wanted to see how far it went,"" he says. ""He was testing the market, like a businessman,"" This video can not be played Many Trump voters are happy with his progress Marco supports the president's immigration policies, but believes there is room for improvement when it comes to the way deportations are handled. ""You have innocent people who are caught in the crossfire - [Mr Trump] needs to be compassionate because I think eventually some supporters will break."" Marco says he will stay loyal to the president, but is concerned by a small hardcore element of the president's supporters he describes as ""borderline racist"".

Lows:  ""I'm not very happy with his son-in-law, I think that there it is not an arms-length relationship, and that could be a conflict of interest."" Jim Mather is a pastor who works with international students at the University of Southern Alabama. It was around Jim's kitchen table in March 2016 that I discussed immigration policy with Mohammed, a Syrian refugee, and Steve Weller, a Trump supporter. A Republican, Jim felt let down by a party ""overtaken by populism and nationalism,"" and voted instead for independent candidate Evan McMullin.

"Law enforcement officers have been warningBBC Trending radioabout a growing number of social media accounts wrongly purporting to be teen idols like Harry Styles and Justin Bieber, speaking inappropriately to young children. The growing world of social media apps with big teenage audiences has made the situation even more difficult to police, they say. ""Identity assumption by child sex offenders is increasing quite steadily,"" Detective Inspector Jon Rouse, who runs task force Argos, a specialist branch responsible for tackling online child exploitation in Queensland, Australia, told us. Detective Inspector Rouse led a recent investigation that led to a 42-year-old man, who allegedly posed as Canadian singer Justin Bieber on a number of social media platforms in order to gain indecent images of children,being charged with more than 900 child sex offences. ""The fact that so many children across the world could believe that they were talking to Justin Bieber, and that Justin Bieber would make them do the things that they did, is really quite concerning,"" he says, ""I think a re-evaluation of the way we educate children about safe online behaviour is really needed."" One mother of an 8-year-old girl, who has asked to remain anonymous, told BBC Trending that her daughter had downloaded a popular social media app for just two days before she was approached by an account impersonating a celebrity. ""The first message was inviting you to enter a competition and to win it you get a five minute chat (with the celebrity),"" she says. ""And then the second message that came up was along the lines of 'all you need to do is send me a photo of you naked or of your vagina.' And then all these messages flew across the screen. ""Then the third message said 'don't worry about it. All the girls are sending me these photos. Just do it. It'll be our secret'. And then the last message was 'do it now'."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external The problem is found across the internet, from big platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to newer platforms which have large teenage audiences. Detective Inspector Rouse of task force Argos raised concerns aboutMusical.ly,external, a social platform which launched in 2014. ""Lots of child sex offenders are utilising Musical.ly to groom children. That's a very well-known international fact, believe it or not,"" he says. The issue is not that safeguards on Musical.ly are particularly different when compared to other social platforms, but rather that there are a lot of young people using the app. It's been downloaded by more than 50 million people under the age of 21, with a sizeable number of them being under the age of 16. Musical.ly told BBC Trending: ""We take the safety of our users very seriously and we have zero tolerance for inappropriate, illegal, or predatory behaviour on our apps. We urge our users to report any inappropriate activity to us."" â¢ There are more resources on theBBC Stay Safe site â¢ The NSPCC also has aseries of guidelines about protecting children,external Chatter about this issue has been trending in the UK since February, when Gemma Styles, the sister of One Direction singer Harry Styles, alerted her followers to a fake Twitter account in her brother's name. She said the account was ""preying on vulnerable girls"". The account @PrvtHarryStyles claimed to be a private page belonging to the One Direction star in which he could give advice to girls with mental health issues. It had over 10,000 followers. A One Direction fan named Amy told BBC Trending that she had been the one to notify Gemma Styles to the account. Amy adds adds that she's seen dozens of fake accounts pretending to be various members of One Direction. ""They work as kind of a network a lot of times, where a person will make a fake account and then they'll make a fake Louis account and a fake Liam account and a fake Zayn account and all these fake accounts will talk to each other which kind of props up all of them,"" Amy says. This fake Harry Styles Instagram account has now been shut down. A number of people have posted about alleged inappropriate behaviour towards underage girls by the fake Harry Styles account. We were unable to verify any of these allegations but we were contacted by someone saying they were a 19-year-old from the United States claiming that she sent naked pictures to this account, believing it was Harry Styles that she was talking to. She said she engaged with the account for about a month. BBC Trending contacted Twitter who said they don't comment on individual accounts, but they do have strict rules around impersonation. That account has now been closed down. There have also been allegations made by Amy, and others on Twitter, that the person who ran the @PrvtHarryStyles account also ran a fake Harry Styles Instagram account under the name vharrystyles. That account had been active up until this week had 138,000 followers. Amy told BBC Trending that she tried to report the account to Instagram, but had difficulty doing so. According to Instagram's impersonation policies, only the person who is being impersonated can file a report. BBC Trending raised concerns about the account to Instagram. The photo-sharing site has now shut the account down, saying that they removed it because it violated their impersonation policies. An Instagram account purporting to be Harry Styles has been shut down since BBC Trending spoke to Instagram about concerns from fans. A number of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have verification for public figures - a little blue tick logo that is supposed to allow famous people to signal that social media account is theirs. But Sharon Girling, a safeguarding consultant who was the co-founder of the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, says underage children may not be savvy if they have not been properly educated about the internet. ""When you're nine or 10 or 12 looking at these accounts, they seem to be genuine and so as a consequence it's the younger element that is getting fooled into believing that they are legitimate,"" she says. ""We don't let people drive a car until they're 17 because it's illegal to drive a car and we understand people have got to have an understanding of their responsibilities. ""Yet we give mobile phones and apps to children as young as five and six without parents having any understanding of what they're doing on them.""

"Lancashire beat Somerset by 164 runs at Old Trafford Bad light denies Middlesex in draw with Essex at Lord's Yorkshire's Gary Ballance hits double century in draw with Hants Ian Bell out for 99 in Warwickshire draw with Surrey Both Division Two games end in draws Paul Grunill and Kalika Mehta There's been a lot of excellent cricket played over the past four days, but ultimatelyLancashireare the only winners in Division One, 'coming from behind' after being bowled out for 109 on the opening day to defeat Somerset by 164 runs at Old Trafford. Surreywere unable to force a victory over Warwickshire, but they head the table by four points from Lancashire after the opening three rounds of matches. Perhaps the individual performance of the final day came from Yorkshire'sÂGary Ballance, who defied Hampshire for an unbeaten 203 as he became the first White Rose captain to score two centuries in a first-class match, having made 108 in the first innings.Â In Division Two,Nottsare four points clear of Kent - with a 17-point gap to Northants in third place.Â TheOne-Day Cuptakes over for the next few weeks, and although we will be providing our usual BBC radio coverage from Thursday onwards, our next text commentary will appear for the start of the next round of Championship games on Friday 19 May. Thank you for your company, and all your tweets, over the past four days. Division One Lancashire (19 pts) beat Somerset (5 pts) by 164 runs Hampshire (11 pts) drew with Yorkshire (8 pts) Warwickshire (10 pts) drew with Surrey (13 pts) Middlesex (12 pts) draw with Essex (8 pts) Division Two Gloucestershire (9 pts) drew with Durham (12 pts) Leicestershire (12 pts) drew with Glamorgan (13 pts) Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 160-8 (74 overs) - target 452 Finally we get the announcement we have been waiting almost 50 minutes for, with the draw called at Lord's. Division One champions Middlesex may well rue their decision to bat for so long on day three as Essex scrape through for a draw. Alastair Cook made a handy 37 and Ravi Bopara batted for over two hours for a hard-fought 32 but the visitors lost regular wickets before the weather intervened to save them. Toby Roland-Jones (3-42) and Steven Finn (2-39) bowled well, but the hosts ran out of time as bad light brought a premature end to the match. Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 160-8 (74 overs) - target 452 There is yet to be an official call made at Lord's, so we're still waiting on that result. Leciestershire 420 & 360-6 dec v Glamorgan 426 & 144-4 And there it is...the players shake hands and each side takes five points for the draw. Mark Pettini hit a century for Leicestershire to help them reach 360-6 before declaring. The hosts may well be disappointed in the end with the draw after having reduced Glamorgan to 57-4 within 19 overs with a further 31 overs still to play, but Aneurin Donald's half-century ensured Glamorgan did not lose a third successive match this season. Leicestershire's 12 points mean they are back in the 'black' after starting the match on -8 and that at least is something to smile about for the Foxes. Leciestershire 420 & 360-6 dec v Glamorgan 426 & 139-4 (45 overs) On we go at Grace Road. Aneurin Donald (65 not out) and Chris Cooke (20 not out) are unmovable objects out in the middle at the moment. It's rather chilly but sunny in Leicestershire, sure the players will wanting to get to early dinner some time soon? Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 160-8 (74 overs) - target 452 We are yet to get any update from Lord's. The final hour of play begun at 17:18 BST so you would imagine if they don't get back out there very soon the match will be drawn. Leicestershire 420 & 360-6 dec v Glamorgan 426 & 126-4 Two of Leicestershire's best bowlers, Charlie Shreck and Ben Raine, are both off the pitch currently and it seems that the home side are going to have to settle for a draw at Grace Road. Aneurin Donald (59 not out) and Chris Cooke (15 not out) are not looking particularly troubled at the moment. There are 13 overs left in the day but you would have to imagine is match is very near it's end. Hampshire 455 drew with Yorkshire 233 & 399-6 dec Hampshire director of cricket Giles White is a happy man despite his side being unable to force a victory on the final day against Yorkshire. Gary Ballance's unbeaten 203 saw the 2014-2015 champions to a draw, and prevented Hampshire from completing a seasonal double following their win at Headingley. ""We knew it would be hard work, it remained a good wicket all the way through and Gary Ballance played outstandingly, really resilient and very strong mentally,"" White told BBC Radio Solent. ""When you lose a strike bowler - we've had that in the last two games - it makes it very difficult. I felt (Gareth) Berg and (Kyle) Abbott were outstanding, they did a lot of hard work and showed an awful lot of skill.Â ""They say good teams are in the field a lot and that's encouraging for us. It's a progression from last year and we are making good sides battle hard for draws."" Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 160-8 (74 overs) - target 452 Gloucestershire 303 & 360-6 dec v Durham 419 & 85-4 Phil Mustard calls time on proceedings at Bristol and the players shake hands. Durham felt they were in with a chance to win the match earlier in the day but a final-wicket stand of 45 between David Payne (36 not out) and Chris Liddle (21) set the visitors 245 to win off 35 overs. It proved too much of an ask after the away side lost four wickets cheaply as they looked to go after the target in the final session of play - with Keaton Jennings (30 not out) forced to drop anchor to prevent a Durham collapse. One draw and one defeat is not the start to life in Division Two Paul Collingwood or his men would have wanted to make. Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 160-8 (74 overs) Doesn't look like umpire Paul Baldwin expects play to re-start any time soon at Lord's. There are a minimum of 13 overs left for Middlesex to try and collect the final two Essex wickets. Gloucestershire 303 & 360-6 dec v Durham 419 & 80-4 (21 overs) Keaton Jennings (25 not out) and Cameron Steel (17 not out) have shared a 27-run sixth-wicket partnership as they look to save Durham from an embarrassing loss at Bristol. Ten overs remain for the Gloucestershire to pick up the remaining six wickets needed for victory. Leicestershire 420 & 360-6 dec v Glamorgan 426 & 109-4 (36 overs) Aneurin Donald is batting Glamorgan towards a draw at Grace Road as he reaches his half-century with a four off Cameron Delport. Leicestershire still have 19 overs to use to try and bowl out the visitors. Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 160-8 (74 overs) - target 452 The light meters were being pulled out ball after ball at Lord's and finally the umpires take the players off the pitch. It may not yet be game over just yet. The last hour of play begun at 17:18 BST and there does seem to be lighter skyline coming. We shall see. Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 160-8 (72.1 overs) - target 452 How's your luck, Essex? Dawid Malan is brought back into the attack with the light so poor that only the spinners are allowed to be used by Middlesex. And,Simon Harmerhaving batted so well up until now, misses the ball and is trapped plumb in front. The light is really poor in London but we play on. Lancashire's players are not wasting any words following their victory over Somerset. Gloucestershire 303 & 360-6 dec v Durham 419 & 53-4 (14.3 overs) Another one bites the dust for Durham asMichael Richardson'sÂ attempts to drive spinner Graeme van Buuren and Jack Taylor takes a simple catch at mid-off. Gloucestershire will believe they can win this game now, 16.3 overs left to take the remaining six wickets. Durham's hopes are all on opener Keaton Jennings, who is unbeaten on 15 currently. Middlesex 507-7 dec & 239-3 dec v Essex 295 & 156-7 (69 overs) - target 452 The weather is looking threatening overhead at Lord's as Simon Harmer and Neil Wagner continue to defy Middlesex's bowlers. The pair need to survive a further 18 overs to secure the draw but it seems unlikely that we'll get through all of them. How are the nerves of both sides?

"Two graduate students stood silently beside a lectern, listening as their professor presented their work to a conference. Usually, the students would want the glory. And they had, just a couple of days previously. But their families talked them out of it. A few weeks earlier, the Stanford researchers had received an unsettling letter from a shadowy US government agency. If they publicly discussed their findings, the letter said, it would be deemed legally equivalent to exporting nuclear arms to a hostile foreign power. Stanford's lawyer said he thought they could defend any case by citing the First Amendment's protection of free speech. But the university could cover legal costs only for professors. So the students were persuaded to keep schtum. What was this information that US spooks considered so dangerous? Were the students proposing to read out the genetic code of smallpox or lift the lid on some shocking presidential conspiracy? No: they were planning to give the International Symposium on Information Theory an update on their work on public key cryptography. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. The year was 1977. If the government agency had managed to silence academic cryptographers, they might have prevented the internet as we know it. To be fair, that wasn't their plan. The World Wide Web was years away. And the agency's head, Adm Bobby Ray Inman, was genuinely puzzled about the academics' motives. He felt cryptography - the study of sending secret messages - was of practical use only to spies and criminals. Three decades earlier, other brilliant academics had helped win the war by breaking the Enigma code, enabling the Allies to read secret Nazi communications. Now Stanford researchers were freely disseminating information that might help adversaries in future wars to encode their messages in ways the US couldn't crack. His concern was reasonable. Throughout history, the development of cryptography has been driven by conflict. Two thousand years ago, Julius Caesar sent encrypted messages to far-flung outposts of the Roman empire - he'd arrange in advance that recipients would simply shift the alphabet by some predetermined number. For example, ""jowbef Csjubjo"" - if you substitute each letter with the preceding one - reads ""invade Britain"". Deciphering the Enigma code gave a significant strategic boost to the Allied campaign in WW2 That kind of thing wouldn't have taken the Enigma codebreakers long to crack. Today, encryption is typically numerical: first, convert the letters into numbers and then perform some complicated mathematics on them. The recipient needs to know how to unscramble the message by performing the same mathematics in reverse. That's known as symmetrical encryption. It's like securing a message with a padlock, having already provided a key. The Stanford researchers wondered whether encryption could be asymmetrical. Could you send an encrypted message to a stranger you'd never met before which only they could decode? Before 1976 most experts would have said it was impossible. Then Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a breakthrough paper. It was Hellman who, a year later, would defy the threat of prosecution by presenting his students' work. That same year, three researchers at MIT - Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman - turned the Diffie-Hellman theory into a practical technique, called RSA encryption, after their surnames. These academics had realised that some mathematics are a lot easier to perform in one direction than another. Take a very large prime number - one that's not divisible by anything other than itself. Then take another. Multiply them together. That gives you an extremely large ""semi-prime"" number, one divisible only by two prime numbers. It turns out it's exceptionally hard for someone else to take that semi-prime number and figure out which two prime numbers were multiplied together to produce it. Whitfield Diffie's work marked a paradigmatic shift in cryptography Public key cryptography works by exploiting this difference. In effect, an individual publishes his semi-prime number - his public key - for anyone to see. And the RSA algorithm allows others to encrypt messages with that number, in such a way that they can be decrypted only by someone who knows the two prime numbers that produced it. It's as if you're distributing open padlocks for the use of anyone who wants to send you a message which only you can unlock. They don't need to have your private key to protect the message and send it to you. They just need to snap shut one of your padlocks around it. In theory, it's possible for someone else to pick your padlock by figuring out the right combination of prime numbers. But it takes unfeasible amounts of computing power. In the early 2000s, RSA Laboratories published some semi-primes and offered cash prizes to anyone who could figure out the primes that produced them. Someone did scoop a $20,000 (Â£16,000) reward - but only after 80 computers worked on the number non-stop for five months. Larger prizes for longer numbers went unclaimed. No wonder Adm Inman fretted about this knowledge reaching America's enemies. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart Grace Hopper's compiler: Computing's hidden hero Just Google it: The student project that changed the world Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers But Prof Hellman had understood something the spy chief had not. The world was changing and electronic communication was becoming more important. Many private sector transactions would be impossible without secure communication. You take advantage of this every time you send a confidential work email, or buy something online, or use a banking app, or visit any website that starts with ""https"". Without public key cryptography, anyone would be able to read your messages, see your passwords and copy your credit card details. Public key cryptography also enables websites to prove their authenticity - without it, there'd be many more phishing scams. The internet would be a very different place and far less economically useful. To his credit, the spy chief soon accepted that the professor had a point and no prosecutions followed. Indeed, the two developed an unlikely friendship. But Adm Inman was right that public key cryptography would complicate his job. Encryption is just as useful to drug dealers, child pornographers and terrorists as it is to you and me paying for something on eBay. From a government perspective, perhaps the ideal situation would be if encryption can't be easily cracked by ordinary folk or criminals - thereby securing the internet's economic advantages - but government can still see everything that's going on. Edward Snowden leaked tens of thousands of documents revealing mass surveillance by the US and UK governments The agency Adm Inman headed was called the National Security Agency (NSA). In 2013, Edward Snowden released secret documents showing just how the NSA was pursuing that goal. The debate Snowden started rumbles on. If we can't restrict encryption only to the good guys, what powers should the state have to snoop - and with what safeguards? Meanwhile, another technology threatens to make public key cryptography altogether useless: quantum computing. By exploiting the strange ways in which matter behaves at a quantum level, quantum computers could potentially perform some calculations significantly more quickly than regular computers. One of those calculations is taking a large semi-prime number and figuring out which two prime numbers you'd have to multiply to get it. If that becomes easy, the internet becomes an open book. Quantum computing is still in its early days. But 40 years after Diffie and Hellman laid the groundwork for internet security, academic cryptographers are now racing to maintain it.

"From unattainable house prices to disappointing pay rises, the financial challenges faced by young adults can seem daunting. How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why. It used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier. This is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows. Then we had the financial crisis of 2008. The upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them. For example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of Â£27,000 at the age of 28, compared with Â£28,000 for those born in the 1970s. The figure was Â£21,000 for those born in the 1960s and Â£15,000 for those born in the 1950s. Despite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age. By their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about Â£27,000 each, on average. By the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - Â£53,000 each. A large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither. At the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s. Home ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30. Similarly,the Local Government Association reportedin December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago. The lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices. How to own a home by the age of 25 The country where 70% of millennials are homeowners Vent your rent: The campaign laying bare the insides of London homes Give up avocado toast and buy a house? In their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs. At the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing. For today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage. Lower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income. Of course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices. The vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues. This is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire. The schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous. In their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme. This compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s. In 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes. With stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially. But those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future. Of those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance. This figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance. Our data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued. Within each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off. Among the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance. This compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%. Data is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s. So, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations. But most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation. It looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.

"Law enforcement officers have been warningBBC Trending radioabout a growing number of social media accounts wrongly purporting to be teen idols like Harry Styles and Justin Bieber, speaking inappropriately to young children. The growing world of social media apps with big teenage audiences has made the situation even more difficult to police, they say. ""Identity assumption by child sex offenders is increasing quite steadily,"" Detective Inspector Jon Rouse, who runs task force Argos, a specialist branch responsible for tackling online child exploitation in Queensland, Australia, told us. Detective Inspector Rouse led a recent investigation that led to a 42-year-old man, who allegedly posed as Canadian singer Justin Bieber on a number of social media platforms in order to gain indecent images of children,being charged with more than 900 child sex offences. ""The fact that so many children across the world could believe that they were talking to Justin Bieber, and that Justin Bieber would make them do the things that they did, is really quite concerning,"" he says, ""I think a re-evaluation of the way we educate children about safe online behaviour is really needed."" One mother of an 8-year-old girl, who has asked to remain anonymous, told BBC Trending that her daughter had downloaded a popular social media app for just two days before she was approached by an account impersonating a celebrity. ""The first message was inviting you to enter a competition and to win it you get a five minute chat (with the celebrity),"" she says. ""And then the second message that came up was along the lines of 'all you need to do is send me a photo of you naked or of your vagina.' And then all these messages flew across the screen. ""Then the third message said 'don't worry about it. All the girls are sending me these photos. Just do it. It'll be our secret'. And then the last message was 'do it now'."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external The problem is found across the internet, from big platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to newer platforms which have large teenage audiences. Detective Inspector Rouse of task force Argos raised concerns aboutMusical.ly,external, a social platform which launched in 2014. ""Lots of child sex offenders are utilising Musical.ly to groom children. That's a very well-known international fact, believe it or not,"" he says. The issue is not that safeguards on Musical.ly are particularly different when compared to other social platforms, but rather that there are a lot of young people using the app. It's been downloaded by more than 50 million people under the age of 21, with a sizeable number of them being under the age of 16. Musical.ly told BBC Trending: ""We take the safety of our users very seriously and we have zero tolerance for inappropriate, illegal, or predatory behaviour on our apps. We urge our users to report any inappropriate activity to us."" â¢ There are more resources on theBBC Stay Safe site â¢ The NSPCC also has aseries of guidelines about protecting children,external Chatter about this issue has been trending in the UK since February, when Gemma Styles, the sister of One Direction singer Harry Styles, alerted her followers to a fake Twitter account in her brother's name. She said the account was ""preying on vulnerable girls"". The account @PrvtHarryStyles claimed to be a private page belonging to the One Direction star in which he could give advice to girls with mental health issues. It had over 10,000 followers. A One Direction fan named Amy told BBC Trending that she had been the one to notify Gemma Styles to the account. Amy adds adds that she's seen dozens of fake accounts pretending to be various members of One Direction. ""They work as kind of a network a lot of times, where a person will make a fake account and then they'll make a fake Louis account and a fake Liam account and a fake Zayn account and all these fake accounts will talk to each other which kind of props up all of them,"" Amy says. This fake Harry Styles Instagram account has now been shut down. A number of people have posted about alleged inappropriate behaviour towards underage girls by the fake Harry Styles account. We were unable to verify any of these allegations but we were contacted by someone saying they were a 19-year-old from the United States claiming that she sent naked pictures to this account, believing it was Harry Styles that she was talking to. She said she engaged with the account for about a month. BBC Trending contacted Twitter who said they don't comment on individual accounts, but they do have strict rules around impersonation. That account has now been closed down. There have also been allegations made by Amy, and others on Twitter, that the person who ran the @PrvtHarryStyles account also ran a fake Harry Styles Instagram account under the name vharrystyles. That account had been active up until this week had 138,000 followers. Amy told BBC Trending that she tried to report the account to Instagram, but had difficulty doing so. According to Instagram's impersonation policies, only the person who is being impersonated can file a report. BBC Trending raised concerns about the account to Instagram. The photo-sharing site has now shut the account down, saying that they removed it because it violated their impersonation policies. An Instagram account purporting to be Harry Styles has been shut down since BBC Trending spoke to Instagram about concerns from fans. A number of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have verification for public figures - a little blue tick logo that is supposed to allow famous people to signal that social media account is theirs. But Sharon Girling, a safeguarding consultant who was the co-founder of the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, says underage children may not be savvy if they have not been properly educated about the internet. ""When you're nine or 10 or 12 looking at these accounts, they seem to be genuine and so as a consequence it's the younger element that is getting fooled into believing that they are legitimate,"" she says. ""We don't let people drive a car until they're 17 because it's illegal to drive a car and we understand people have got to have an understanding of their responsibilities. ""Yet we give mobile phones and apps to children as young as five and six without parents having any understanding of what they're doing on them.""
