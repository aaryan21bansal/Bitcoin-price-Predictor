"Both President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden's campaigns have been targeted, Microsoft says Hackers with ties to Russia, China and Iran are attempting to snoop on people and groups involved with the US 2020 presidential election, Microsoft says. The Russian hackers who breached the 2016 Democratic campaign are again involved, said the US tech firm. Microsoft said it was ""clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts"" targeting the election. Both President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden's campaigns are in the cyber-raiders' sights. Russian hackers from the Strontium group have targeted more than 200 organisations,external, many of which are linked to US political parties - both Republicans and Democrats, Microsoft said in a statement. The same attackers also targeted British political parties, said Microsoft, without specifying which ones. Strontium is also known as Fancy Bear, a cyber-attack unit allegedly affiliated with Russia's GRU military intelligence service. Russia and China have denied the reports. On Friday Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, said the Kremlin had never tried to interfere in other countries' elections. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Microsoft ""should not make accusations against China out of nothing"". ""Similar to what we observed in 2016, Strontium is launching campaigns to harvest people's log-in credentials or compromise their accounts, presumably to aid in intelligence gathering or disruption operations,"" said Tom Burt, a Microsoft vice-president in charge of customer security and trust. The spying game: China's global network Voter systems at risk ahead of 2020 election Hacking the US mid-terms? It's child's play Most of the cyber-attacks had not been successful, according to Microsoft. ""What we've seen is consistent with previous attack patterns that not only target candidates and campaign staffers but also those they consult on key issues,"" Mr Burt said. ""These activities highlight the need for people and organisations involved in the political process to take advantage of free and low-cost security tools to protect themselves."" Microsoft also reported that Chinese groups had launched attacks on the personal email accounts of people affiliated with the Biden campaign, as well as ""at least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump Administration"". China, Russia and Iran 'undermining' US election ""Prominent individuals"" in the international affairs community, academic institutions and policy organisations were also said to have been targeted by a Chinese hacking group known as Zirconium. An Iranian group known as Phosphorus had unsuccessfully sought to access accounts of White House officials and Mr Trump's campaign staff between May and June of this year, Microsoft added. The firm was unable to determine the aims of the Russian, Chinese and Iranian hackers. In June Google also said it had detected cyber-hack attempts by China and Iran. Trump campaign deputy press secretary Thea McDonald said: ""We are a large target, so it is not surprising to see malicious activity directed at the campaign or our staff."" A Biden campaign official said: ""We have known from the beginning of our campaign that we would be subject to such attacks and we are prepared for them."" The report comes a day aftera whistleblower at the US Department of Homeland Security alleged he was put under pressureto downplay the threat of Russian interference in the US as it ""made the president look bad"". Analysis by Nada Tawfik, BBC North America reporter In 2016, Russia's attempts to influence the election quickly became politicised and labelled a hoax by some of the president's supporters. Microsoft's findings highlight the fact that election interference is a bipartisan issue, with both Republicans and Democrats at risk. Going into the 2020 vote, it is not just intelligence agencies, but also the private sector that is concerned and taking action to prevent threats to the democratic process. But they can only do so much without government action. Tom Burt made a point in his post to encourage Congress to pass additional state funding to protect election infrastructure. He then went further, encouraging countries to ensure peace and security in cyberspace through global initiatives, including one underway at the United Nations. The Department of Homeland Security's top cyber-official, Christopher Krebs, said Microsoft's warning confirmed what the US intelligence community had already stated. ""It is important to highlight that none [of the targets] are involved in maintaining or operating voting infrastructure and there was no identified impact on election systems,"" Mr Krebs said. Earlier on Thursday, the Trump administration charged a Russian national with plotting to interfere in the US political process. The treasure department also imposed sanctions against a Moscow-linked Ukrainian lawmaker, Andrii Derkach, who is accused of similar meddling. Mr Derkach allegedly released edited audio that was intended to smear Democrat Joe Biden. The recordings have been touted by President Donald Trump. The Ukrainian met the US president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, last December. This video can not be played Frank Luntz: ""You cannot look at this election and feel good about it"" The US intelligence community said in August that China, Russia and Iran were actively trying to meddle in the forthcoming presidential election. The assessment found that Russia was seeking to ""denigrate"" Mr Biden. It also found that China and Iran wanted Mr Trump to lose the vote. Iran, US intelligence warned, could try to ""undermine"" US democratic institutions and the president through online content. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential run, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Russians charged with US election hack All you need to know about Trump Russia story Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found Russian hackers gained access to Democratic National Committee systems as well as Clinton campaign chair John Podesta's personal email. They leaked tens of thousands of emails from the campaign. Facebook later testified that Russian-backed content sent out around the election reached up to 126 million Americans on the platform. Mr Mueller did not determine that the Trump campaign had colluded with the alleged Russian election meddling. Hacking the US mid-terms?

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Harry Dunn's alleged killer Anne Sacoolas drove on the ""wrong side of the road for 20 seconds"" before the fatal crash, her lawyers said. But she was ""otherwise driving cautiously and below the speed limit"", her legal representatives added. They have issued a statement detailing the 43-year-old's side of the story. The American was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a crash in August 2019 which resulted in 19-year-old Mr Dunn's death. Mrs Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity following the collision outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. She was able to return to her home country, sparking controversy. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after a crash involving her car and Mr Dunn's motorbike outside RAF Croughton According to her lawyers, Ms Sacoolas ""instinctively"" began driving on the right-hand side, and could not see Mr Dunn due to ""the crest of a small hill"". In a public statement, they said: ""Anne did everything she could to assist Harry. After the accident, she ran from her car and tried to help him. ""Anne then saw another motorist approach and flagged her down for more support. ""The other motorist immediately called for the emergency services and Anne made calls to alert the police from the nearby air force base. ""The base police arrived quickly and assisted Harry. ""Tragically, it took over 40 minutes for the ambulance to arrive and nearly two hours passed before Harry was admitted to the hospital. ""Anne did not leave the scene until she was instructed to do so by the UK authorities."" Mrs Sacoolas's legal representatives also made an on-the-record statement regarding her position on the prospect of a virtual trial. They said: ""We have been and remain willing to discuss a resolution, including the possibility of virtual proceedings, with the UK authorities."" Reacting to the suspect's statement and speaking on behalf of Mr Dunn's family, their spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""The parents have noted the statement issued this evening on behalf of Mrs Sacoolas. ""Their position is that these issues should not be aired in any form other than a court of law. ""Once again, they invite her to do the right thing and return to the UK to answer to the charges laid against her."" Mr Dunn's alleged killer returned to the US on a commercial flight after the US Embassy ""informed the Foreign Office of this decision and instructed Anne to return home"". Mrs Sacoolas was charged in December but an extradition request submitted by the Home Office was refused in January. The US State Department has since said the decision to reject the request was ""final"".

"Concerns were raised over social distancing at the Department for Work and Pensions office in Leeds A government office failed to do enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus, a health and safety inspection found. Workers were pictured gathered around a desk at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in Leeds where there have been two confirmed Covid-19 cases. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found management had failed to ensure social distancing was maintained. The DWP said it had taken ""urgent action to rectify all issues identified"" at the Quarry House office. During the pandemic, the majority of DWP employees in Leeds have been working from home but there have still been hundreds of people in the office, located inside a landmark building on the eastern edge of the city centre. There has been a recruitment drive at the DWP amida rise in Universal Credit claimants due to coronavirus, a whistleblower told the BBC. Quarry House in Leeds is known locally as ""The Kremlin"" because of its imposing architecture The whistleblower has been working at home for the DWP but said he was concerned for his health when returning to the building, which is also home to parts of the NHS. He said: ""I hear stories about people congregating, not following outlaid guidance. In an office so big it is difficult to monitor 24/7. ""People I have spoken to are nervous about a return, they and I feel it is not yet safe enough to go back. ""The office was busy pre-Covid, I don't know where everyone would operate from in normal times let alone in a virus outbreak."" So how many friends can I meet now? 'We must act' to prevent second lockdown - PM Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors What's the latest with the furlough scheme? The HSE inspected the office on 27 August after receiving a report of a ""workplace concern"". During the visit photographs were taken, including one of workers standing close together. The report compiled following the inspection said: ""You are failing to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of your employees/agency staff at work because you have not implemented necessary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19."" The DWP had risk assessed for the office being about 50% full, which the HSE said ""may be ambitious and unrealistic"", leading to a risk of ""congestion"" and making it more difficult to maintain social distancing. A line manager gave instruction to a group of staff around a desk, with staff not following social distancing Walkways had been designated as two-way travel despite only being about a metre wide Walkways passed closely to desks designated as usable Stairwells were designated as two-way travel but did not appear to be sufficiently wide for 2m distancing - even at designated passing points Small tables, ""breakout pods"" and benches lacked ""do not use"" signage. The BBC has seen leaked messages showing the office has had at least two positive coronavirus cases among staff. Two emails have recently been sent to workers saying people had been sent home from the affected floors and deep cleans carried out. Charles Law, industrial officer with the PCS union, said: ""It's extremely worrying for our members who work for the department, especially if they're expected to stop being at home and come into the workplace. ""It's shocking that the HSE would do such a damning report on a flagship DWP office and we're extremely concerned for the safety of our members."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? The HSE confirmed that following the visit an official letter, known as a Notification of Contravention, was sent to the DWP. In this letter, the DWP was warned a fee would need to be paid because of ""material breaches"" of health and safety law. It was given a deadline of Tuesday 15 September to confirm action had been taken to remedy the issues highlighted in the report. In a statement, a DWP spokesperson said: ""We take the health and safety of staff extremely seriously and have implemented Covid-secure measures across our sites to ensure they comply with government guidelines.

"The events had been expected to attract about 20,000 people to Southampton Public health officials have cancelled two boat shows hours before they were due to start over coronavirus fears. BOATS2020, and the smaller sailing show MDL Ocean Village, were due to start in Southampton on Friday, with an expected 20,000 visitors over the next 10 days. The organisers of BOATS2020 said they were told at about 18:30 BST that the event could not go ahead. Southampton City Council said the decision was ""regrettable"" but made with public safety in mind. Lesley Robinson, chief executive of British Marine, which organised BOATS2020, said she was ""desperately disappointed"" by the cancellation, ""especially receiving the news at the eleventh hour before opening"". She added: ""Alongside our exhibitors, we were ready to open a show that exceeded all safety requirements. We are truly perplexed as to why we are unable to run the show at least until Monday in line with the government restrictions imposed yesterday. ""Public health and safety come first and naturally, as the show organiser, British Marine must comply with all guidance."" British Marine's chief executive Lesley Robinson said she was ""desperately disappointed"" by the late cancellation So how many friends can I meet now? What are the rules on weddings? The quarantine lists have changed - what's new? About 230 boats had been brought to the city for the show. Southampton City Council's director of public health, Debbie Chase, said: ""In Southampton and the South East, we have seen a lower rate of COVID-19 transmissions since lockdown ended. ""However, the national picture shows a concerning rise in cases, and with these events set to attract around 20,000 people from different parts of the UK over a 10-day period, it's important we act now to reduce the risk of infection."" She added: ""The decision, while regrettable, has been made after detailed analysis of the public health risks and discussions with our colleagues and partner agencies within the city.

"Peloton, which won an early celebrity fanbase for its exercise bikes and remote workout classes, has seen demand surge during the pandemic. The firm's global membership base hit 3.1 million at the end of June, more than double a year earlier, as gym closures due to Covid-19 increased demand for at-home workouts. The jump in sign-ups lifted revenue to $607m (Â£474m), up 172% year-on-year. But it has also strained supply, prompting lengthy waits for equipment. The firm had said it was slashing prices for its existing treadmill and bike, cutting the cost of the bike from $2,245 to $1,895 in an effort to make their products more accessible. The move coincided with the launch of new, more expensive, versions of the same pieces of equipment. But the firm, which relies on purchases of its machines fitted with touchscreens for most of its sales, said it did not expect delivery delays to improve much before the end of the year. ""Demand... remains strong and member engagementÂ remains elevated, despite improving weather and the gradual reopening,"" chief executive John Foley said on an analyst call after the firm shared its quarterly results on Thursday. Peloton: 'It's borderline addiction' Peloton bike ad labelled 'sexist' and 'dystopian' Peloton said the number of ""connected fitness"" subscribers, who access its remote classes via one of the firm's machines, jumped to more than 1.09 million at the end of June, up 113% in comparison with the same period last year. Those members are also working out more - averaging more than 24 workouts per month, compared to 12 one year ago. The growth propelled the firm to its first quarterly profit of $89m, versus a loss of $47.4m last year. Mr Foley told analysts he was not worried about demand subsiding after the pandemic, given the opportunities for global expansion. Peloton said it expected the number of subscribers to exceed 2 million over the next 12 months and forecast revenue for its next financial year of at least $3.5bn. The results shared by the firm exceeded analyst expectations, prompting shares to rise 7% in after-hours trade.

""These powers will enable local authorities to move quickly to respond to outbreaks of the virus in their areas, for example where a number of cases are linked to a particular premise or as a preventative measure, where there is a high risk of outbreak,"" Mr Drakeford said. Charlotte Harding lives in Ferndale in the Rhondda with husband Richard and sons Ethan, 8, and Harrison, 6 Charlotte Harding, a mother of two, has had to cancel her son's birthday meal because of Wales' new rules. ""We are due to go the Sunday after next to have a family meal for my son's birthday. That won't go ahead now,"" she said. ""With three families coming together, that's not going to be a possibility. The boys are going to be upset as we won't be able to see our niece, we won't be able to see their nans. ""I have a lot of friends whose households are made up of six people so it is going to be a struggle for lots of families. ""All those little anxieties I had before the lockdown are back. I am a bit worried about not being able to see my family, the children not being able to see their grandparents. That's going to be hard again"". The first minister said there was ""a short window to get ahead of the gathering storm"" of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said that following the rules would help avoid ""more draconian measures"". Public Health Wales data shows there have been no deaths with coronavirus in Wales in September Mr Drakeford said the ""hotspot areas"" of Caerphilly county, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were being monitored closely to see if further action was needed to prevent the ongoing spread of coronavirus. The first minister said it was important people carried on working from home if they could. Mr Drakeford told the BBC the rate of 20 people in 100,000 was the ""threshold we use for people to have to quarantine coming back into the UK"". He said if that figure fell, the advice on face masks could be looked at again. The new mask rule would come in from Monday to give people time to buy one, he said. Masks were not ""some sort of magic wand"" but ""a sensible addition to the precautionary measures we are taking"" to avert a crisis. This video can not be played Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory in workplaces and said wearing them in school did ""not seem proportionate."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement ""was very welcome"" though the evidence on them was ""never going to be 100%."" Conservative Member of the Senedd, Darren Millar, said on Twitter his party had been calling for mandatory masks in shops since early July: ""On Wednesday we tabled a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Today, the Welsh Labour-led Government finally act."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it hoped the new mask rules would ""provide reassurance"" to shoppers. But it joined the shop workers union USDAW in urging customers to continue treating staff with respect. ""The move to make wearing face coverings mandatory is further proof there will be no immediate return to normal shopping,"" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium. Those working in towns and city centres have broadly welcomed the move to avoid another full lockdown. ""Businesses just need to know what they have to do to be able to open up and trade,"" said Kevin Ward, manager of the Newport Now business improvement district. ""Certain regulations have changed through the pandemic but what nobody wants is to have to go into a full lockdown again. For a lot of independent businesses and [chain stores], they would not survive another lockdown,"" he said. Kevin Ward said retailers needed to know what to do in order to trade Neil Butler, of teachers' union NASUWT, said he was worried about schools: ""The Welsh Government is positively saying no, we do not want face coverings in those particular environments."" Ministers said the restrictions on people meeting followed an increase in cases linked to people socialising indoors. Up to four households have been able to form an extended household and meet since late August. Until now, there has been no legal limit on how many people could gather. Mr Drakeford said the rule of up to 30 people being allowed to meet outdoors would include peoples' gardens. Bubble trouble? What can you now do in lockdown? New rules 'no longer than we have to' - Hancock Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Children aged under 11 are not included in the six. The new rules on meeting indoors will not apply in Caerphilly county borough, whichwas put under local lockdown on Tuesday, where all extended household meetings are currently banned inside. Shoppers wearing face masks in Caerphilly, the first place in Wales to have a local lockdown The move comes after other parts of the UK also restricted meetings to six - but did so both indoors and outdoors. The UK government is restricting gatherings in England to just six peoplefrom Monday, with some exceptions. The number of people that can meet in Scotlandhas also been cut to six. Wales' coronavirus rules mean people can only be part of a single extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Despite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal. The recent rise in cases seen in Caerphilly county was blamed on people socialising in other people's homes in large numbers. The area has seen one of the highest rates of cases in the whole of the UK, with 91.1 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. On Thursday, residents of Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil were asked to follow a range of measures to avoid a local lockdown.

"Trials for 43,000 defendants are being listed for next year and some for 2022 A judge has claimed he was put under ""improper and undue influence"" to keep a defendant in custody. Judge Keith Raynor refused to extend the time a teenager charged with drugs offences could be held in custody before his trial. Woolwich Crown Court heard Tesfa Young-Williams was charged with serious drug offences last October and had been in custody for 321 days because of delays. That is 139 days beyond the custody time limit (CTL), the judge said. Refusing the further extension on Tuesday, Judge Raynor ruled government measures which include the creation of 10 Nightingale courts - temporary courts to help tackle the number of outstanding cases - were slow, not proportionate, lacked funding and that alternative, adequately-funded measures which would have worked were not adopted. In a highly unusual move, Judge Raynor has made public communications with a senior judge in the lead-up to Mr Young-Williams' CTL hearing. Judge Raynor said he felt ""pressurised into granting the CTL extension application"" and ""was subjected to improper and undue influence to make a ruling extending the CTL in the case of R v Tesfa Young-Williams"". The judge has now been told he will not be hearing a CTL application in another case but has said he wants to issue a formal complaint. What powers do the police have during the pandemic? Locations of the 'Nightingale courts' in England and Wales revealed Minister warns over court case backlog from virus Custody limits are in the spotlight because the Covid pandemic has led to an increased backlog of cases causing more defendants on remand awaiting trial to have their custody limits extended. Since lockdown began in March, the backlog of crown court cases has risen by 6,000 to 43,000. The government has announced it will extend CTLs from six to eight months from the end of September. It also expects to have 250 usable jury trial rooms by November,as part of a so-called ""criminal courts recovery plan"".,external The Ministry of Justice has pledged an extra 1,600 court staff and Â£80m towards a range of measures, including more Nightingale courts. Concerns have been raised that the distance between the senior judiciary and ministers is becoming too close. Criminal barrister Kirsty Brimelow QC said: ""The judiciary and the government are separate and distinct, so where there is a closeness between senior judiciary and government on policy, as there is here on custody time limits, there is real constitutional concern that this may compromise the independence of the judiciary."" Judge Raynor's actions are exceptional and the senior judge he has criticised has said it would not be appropriate to comment. However, the allegations put the relationship between senior judges and the government firmly under scrutiny.

"Rieli Franciscato spent most of his career trying to protect indigenous tribes in the Amazon A top Brazilian expert on isolated Amazon tribes has been killed by an arrow that struck him in the chest as he approached an indigenous site. Rieli Franciscato, 56, died on Wednesday in a remote region of RondÃ´nia state in north-western Brazil. He was in the area to monitor a tribe as part of his work for the government's indigenous agency, Funai. An NGO founded by Mr Franciscato described him as an ""excellent, serious and dedicated professional"". The Kaninde Ethno-Environmental Defence Association, which he helped create in the 1980s, said the indigenous group had no ability to distinguish between a friend or a foe from the outside world. Witnesses said Mr Franciscato and his party came under fire as they approached an indigenous group. Mr Franciscato, who was accompanied by police, attempted to take shelter behind a vehicle, but was struck in the chest by an arrow, witnesses said. A policeman who witnessed the incident said Mr Franciscato managed to remove the arrow, which hit him above the heart. ""He cried out, pulled the arrow from his chest, ran 50m (164ft) and collapsed, lifeless,"" the officer said in an audio recording posted to social media. Indigenous tribesmen shoot arrows at aircraft,external Images of remote Brazilian tribe from 2011 A photojournalist in the region, Gabriel Uchida, told AFP news agency that Mr Franciscato had been trying to observe a tribe known as the ""Cautario River isolated group"". Mr Uchida, who also witnessed the incident, said the tribe was usually ""a peaceful group"", but ""this time, there were just five armed men - a war party"". Amazon: In the cross-hairs of coronavirus and forest fires Are Amazon fires worse than last year? In 2018, US missionaryJohn Allen Chau was killed by a tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, who shot him with arrows and left his body on the beach. This video can not be played The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau are among groups under threat in the Amazon Survival International, an indigenous rights group, said Mr Franciscato was called to area after a number of uncontacted peoples appeared in recent months. Ranchers and loggers have destroyed much of the nearby forest in recent years and have threatened to destroy more of the region. The group said in a release thathis death was ""almost certainly a response to the immense pressure"" the forest and its peoples are under,external. Indigenous groups in the Amazon and elsewhere in the world have been known to react violently to outsiders on their lands. Indigenous leaders say incidents with illegal miners, farmers and loggers on their ancestral lands have become much more common since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019, promising to develop the Amazon region. President Bolsonaro has been criticised for the scale of deforestation that has happened on his watch Conservationists blame Mr Bolsonaro and his government for defunding agencies including Funai and the environmental enforcement agency Ibama and turning a blind eye to farmers and loggers clearing land in the Amazon, hastening deforestation. Mr Bolsonaro has long questioned the need for large indigenous reservations in the rainforest, and has defended opening up protected areas for farming and mining. The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, is home to about 100 isolated tribes,according to Survival International,external. At Funai, Mr Franciscato headed a programme to protect isolated indigenous groups. ""Rieli dedicated his life to the indigenous cause.

"New designs are being trialled that still ""pop"" when they open The distinctive Pringles tube is being re-designed after criticism that itâs almost impossible to recycle. The current container for the potato-based snack was condemned asa recyclerâs nightmare. It's a complex construction with a metal base, plastic cap, metal tear-off lid, and foil-lined cardboard sleeve. The Recycling Association dubbed it the number one recycling villain â along with the Lucozade Sports bottle. Now Pringles' maker Kellogg's is trialling a simpler can â although experts say itâs not a full solution. The existing version is particularly troublesome because it combines so many different materials This video can not be played Roger Harrabin considers the Pringles recycling challenge Some 90% of the new can is paper. Around 10% is a polyal (plastic) barrier that seals the interior to protect the food against oxygen and moisture which would damage the taste. But how about the lid? Well, two options are on trial in some Tesco stores â a recyclable plastic lid and a recyclable paper lid. Kellogg's says these lids will still produce the distinctive ""pop"" associated with the product. Simon Ellin from the Recycling Association told BBC News: ""The Pringles tube has been a bastion of bad design from the recyclers' point of view. ""This new version is an improvement, and we broadly welcome it. ""But, frankly, if they are going to stick to a plastic lid thatâll just add to problems with plastic pollution - people on picnics leave them behind and they find their way into streams and the sea. That plastic lid has got to go."" The Recycling Association said many manufacturers needed to rethink their packaging Kellogg's says its packaging must be airtight, or the food inside will be wasted. The new designs have been 12 months in the making. Pringles have a shelf life of 15 months - and three million cans are made across Europe every day. Mr Ellin said the polyal-coated card might be recyclable but the product would need to be tested in recycling mills. And what of the much-criticised Lucozade Sports bottle? Mr Ellin said its unchanged basic design was still a big problem, as machines found it hard to differentiate the plastic in the bottle and the plastic that makes up its outer sleeve. He called on the makers, Suntory, to reduce the size of the external sleeve, as it has with the new Ribena bottle. The firm said it was planning to do this for the new year. Suntory said it was working on a new material made entirely from seaweed extract that was 100% edible, biodegradable and compostable. Environmentalists say that trivial changes like these won't solve the world's ecological crises - but on a large scale they'll make a contribution.

"Cases in Portugal have been rising since the country was made exempt from UK quarantine on 22 August Travellers from mainland Portugal to Englandwill have to quarantine,externalfrom 04:00 BST on Saturday, just weeks after the country was put on the safe list. Wales and Scotland had already imposed the mandatory two weeks of self-isolation earlier this month. Quarantine-free travel is still allowed from the Portuguese islands, the Azores and Madeira. Meanwhile, Sweden has been madeexempt from quarantine for Wales, England and Scotland. People travelling to England, Wales and Scotland from Hungary and Reunion will also be required to self-isolate, while England is additionally requiring arrivals from French Polynesia to quarantine. Hungary has a seven-day rate of 31.6 infections per 100,000 people and French Polynesia's rate is 71.3. Portugal, one of the UK's most popular holiday destinations, was given an exemption from UK quarantine rules as recently as 22 August. But since then the infection level has been rising. It now has 28.3 infections per 100,000 people, above the threshold of 20 per 100,000 people which the UK generally uses for adding countries to the quarantine list. Portugal expressed ""regret"" over the quarantine decision for the mainland, but said it valued the continued inclusion of the Azores and Madeira on the safe ""travel corridor"" list. It comes as the UK's confirmed coronavirus cases rose by another 2,919, the fifth consecutive day that the figure has been more than 2,000. Another 14 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that because of ""enhanced data"" the government was able to assess the infection rates of islands separate to their mainland countries. On Wednesday,quarantine requirements were also imposed on seven Greek islands, the first time that different self-isolation rules had been applied to the mainland of a country and its islands. Mr Shapps also stressed that travellers must fill out the Passenger Locator Form on arrival to the UK, a day after the prime minister said enforcement of this part of the quarantine rules would be stepped up. Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Can I be fined if I break quarantine rules? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? ""It is a criminal offence not to complete the form and spot checks will be taking place,"" Mr Shapps said. Figures show that nearly 2m spot checks have been carried out to ensure travellers have filled out the form, and calls and text messages were made to 136,500 people to check they were quarantining. Successful contact, where the traveller has been spoken to or responded to a text, was made 66,773 times with 64,800 people confirming they were self-isolating. Just 34 fines have been issued. HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? TRAVEL:What are the UK's rules? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? TRAVEL RIGHTS:Can I get a holiday refund? Travel industry body Abta, along with the chief executives of airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways, is calling on the government to introduce testing on arrival at airports and to change quarantine policy so mainland regions can be treated differently. ""Every country, mainland or island that is taken off the government's travel list lessens the ability of travel businesses to operate and increases the necessity for the government to provide tailored industry support,"" said an Abta spokesman. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said holidaymakers were now ""more acutely aware"" of the risks of travel abroad, but said the ""last-minute"" decisions meant many missed out on refunds or were ""extorted"" with additional airfares if they tried to rush home. ""It's obvious that the current travel corridor system is not working for passengers, and becoming completely detrimental to the already dwindling trust in the sector,"" he said. Sweden adopted a lighter-touch strategy for dealing with the pandemic compared with most other European countries, deciding not to institute a widespread lockdown, and putting in place relatively few restrictions. This was based partly on the idea of letting Covid-19 sweep through the population creating so-called herd immunity. Such an approach was considered but then abandoned in the UK. Research published in August suggestedexposure to coronavirus was similar in Stockholm and London, based on antibody tests, despite the different lockdown strategies.

"The UK government should consider a targeted extension of its furlough scheme, MPs have said. The coronavirus crisis risks mass long-term unemployment and viable firms could go under without support, the Treasury Select Committee has warned. However, a blanket retention of the scheme would not be good value for money, it added. The Treasury said it would ""continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment."" The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is due to end on 31 October. Under it, workers placed on leave have received 80% of their pay up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. At first, this was all paid for by the government. Butfirms had to start making a contribution to wagesin September as the scheme began to wind down. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said that extending furlough past October would only keep people ""in suspended animation"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak also ruled out an extension, instead saying thatfirms will be given Â£1,000 for every furloughed workerstill in employment at the end of January. Coronavirus: What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' But the committee's chairman, Mel Stride, said the chancellor ""should carefully consider targeted extensions"" to the scheme. ""The key will be assisting those businesses who, with additional support, can come through the crisis as sustainable enterprises, rather than focusing on those that will unfortunately just not be viable in the changed post-crisis economy."" In the second report of its inquiry into the economic impact of Covid-19, the committee also warned that the pandemic risked widening the gender pay gap due to the differences in hours of paid work in lockdown - especially if work patterns are changed permanently. The MPs also said people should be able to reskill, and that small businesses should be able to fully participate in the government's Kickstart Scheme, which aims to create work placements for young people on universal credit. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) trade body said with the furlough scheme winding down, ""policymakers will need to look closely at measures to stem mass unemployment, including a successor scheme."" FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""The priority should be protecting viable small businesses - and all the jobs they provide - that have been disproportionately [hit] by the coronavirus crisis, including those caught by local lockdowns, subject to continued national restrictions, or with staff that have directly suffered because of Covid."" This video can not be played Julie changed jobs before lockdown - then became unemployed and ineligible for the furlough scheme The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns on living standards, said that ""extending support for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy will be essential to limit the rise in unemployment Britain faces in the months ahead."" Torsten Bell, the think tank's chief executive, said: ""This authoritative account of the economic impact of coronavirus should be required reading for Treasury officials planning the Autumn Budget against the highly uncertain backdrop of rising coronavirus case numbers. ""The chancellor will need to reconsider his plans to swiftly phase out support given the painful reality that the economic crisis is here to stay."" This week leading business groups warned that the UKrisks a second wave of job cutsand a slower economic recovery if it does not extend its furlough scheme. Germany, Belgium, Australia and France have all decided to extend or launch new wage support schemes into next year. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown told the BBC that the UK should emulate other countries' short-term working schemes. Mr Brown said the end of the furlough scheme on 31 October was a ""cliff-edge"" that could trigger ""a tsunami of unemployment"". ""The government's got to change course here,"" he told the Today programme. Short-term working schemes would allow firms to reduce employees' working hours while keeping them in jobs, with the state topping up their salaries. ""You have got to send a signal that unemployment matters,"" he said. ""We don't want to destroy any more capacity and skills in the economy."" A Treasury spokesperson said that by the time the UK scheme closes it will have helped to pay for 9.6 million jobs. ""We will continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment,"" the spokesperson said. ""We're helping employees get back to work, where they want to be, through a Â£1,000 retention bonus. ""And we are creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart Scheme, creating incentives for training and apprenticeships, and supporting and protecting jobs in the tourism and hospitality sectors through our VAT cut and last month's Eat Out to Help Out scheme."" The UK's unemployment rate has been at 3.9% since the lockdown was introduced. But the Bank of England expects that rate to double to 7.5% by the end of the year when the government-funded support schemes come to an end. Thousands of job cuts have already been announced by firm such as Rolls-Royce, Costa Coffee, Pret A Manger, Pizza Express, British Airways and BP.

"This video can not be played Smoke could be seen billowing out over the city's skyline Lebanon has launched an investigation into a huge fire at a warehouse storing aid that erupted in the port of Beirut - one month after a massive explosion there killed more than 190 people. The blaze broke out where an aid agency had been storing food and cooking oil. Firefighters and military officials spent hours battling the fire, using helicopters to drop water on it, before getting it under control on Thursday. No injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is not yet known. Footage shared on social media showed port workers running away as the fire broke out at the duty-free zone in the port on Thursday. The blaze sent a plume of dark smoke over the Lebanese capital. The head of Lebanon's Red Cross, George Kettaneh, said some people were suffering from shortness of breath, but there were no reports of injuries. Red Cross Regional Director Fabrizio Carboni said the warehouse stocked thousands of food parcels. He added that the humanitarian operation is atrisk of serious disruption,external. The area around the fire was cordoned off to prevent it from spreading. Civil defence director general Raymond Khattar told the state-run National News Agency that those working to extinguish the fire would not leave ""until the flames are fully quenched."" By the evening, officials said most flames had been extinguished. The fire sent a plume of dark smoke over the Lebanese capital The fire broke out just over a month after a huge explosion in the Lebanese capital, which was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonating at a warehouse in the port. In addition to the fatalities, thousands were injured and as many as 300,000 left homeless by the 4 August explosion. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how last month's explosion ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt Despite assurances from officials on Thursday that the situation was under control, some residents, still traumatised by last month's explosion, drove out of the city. ""I am forced to get them out of Beirut from the smoke and the fire that is happening at the port again,"" Majed Hassanein, who was leaving with his wife and children, told Reuters news agency. Others described how the fire brought back memories of the explosion. ""For sure we were scared... it's only been a month since the explosion that destroyed Beirut. We saw the same thing happening again,"" said 53-year-old Andre Muarbes. The Lebanese army announced in a tweet on Thursday that military police had begun an investigation into the blaze. Port director Bassem al-Qaisi earlier told the Voice of Lebanon radio station that the fire started in a warehouse where barrels of cooking oil were being stored, and then spread to tyres nearby. ""It is too early to know if it is the result of heat or some other mistake,"" he said. Michel Najjar, the public works minister with the outgoing government, told local media outlets that initial indications suggested the blaze was started by repair work at the port. Firefighters spent hours battling the blaze But he said full details on what happened would not be clear until a ""comprehensive study"" had been completed. In a meeting with top officials on Thursday, President Michel Aoun said the fire could have been the result of sabotage, a technical error or negligence. ""In all cases, the cause must be known as soon as possible and the perpetrators held to account,"" Mr Aoun was quoted as saying by the presidential Twitter account.

"The government has announced a ""truce"" on enforcement action for tenants facing eviction in England and Wales this Christmas. It also said that evictions will not be enforced in areas subject to local lockdowns as the pandemic continues. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick added that it has increased notice periods to six months in an ""unprecedented measure"". Campaign group Generation Rent said the government ""must offer [renters] more."" The government confirmed that court proceedings for evictions in England and Wales would restart on 21 September after being suspended for six months due to the coronavirus crisis. But under new measures announced on Thursday, evictions will not be enforced by bailiffs if a local area is in lockdown that includes restrictions on gathering in homes. Bailiffs will also be told that they should not enforce possession orders over Christmas, other than in ""the most serious circumstances"", such as cases involving domestic abuse or antisocial behaviour. The government has not yet confirmed which dates the ""winter truce"" will cover for tenants in England and Wales. What are the rules around evictions? Charities welcome extended eviction ban in Scotland ""We have protected renters during the pandemic by banning evictions for six months - the longest eviction ban in the UK,"" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said. ""To further support renters we have increased notice periods to six months, an unprecedented measure to help keep people in their homes over the winter months. ""It's right that we strike a balance between protecting vulnerable renters and ensuring landlords whose tenants have behaved in illegal or anti-social ways have access to justice."" The new measures are aimed at ensuring potentially vulnerable tenants are not forced out of their homes ""at a time when public and local authorities may be dealing with an increased demand for services"", a statement said. Ministers extended the ban on evictions for four weeks in August, but campaign groups and housing charities had hoped that more would be done for renters who have seen a loss in income during the pandemic. This video can not be played David Batchelder: ""I don't know what the future holds"" Alicia Kennedy, director at Generation Rent, said: ""It is welcome that renters will not face eviction by bailiffs around Christmas or where there are lockdown measures. ""But outside that, thousands of renters who have had eviction notices during the pandemic still have no assurance from the government whether they can stay in their home. ""Those who have lost income will find it difficult to find a new home so face many months of uncertainty, getting deeper into debt."" One survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started. However, landlord groups have previously said that their members have been left ""powerless"" in dealing with the non-payment of rent. Some have called for more help in England to reduce the financial pressures on landlords, in addition to mortgage holidays. Chris Norris, policy director for the National Residential Landlords Association, welcomed news that the courts would begin to hear possession cases again from 21 September. ""It is vital that this happens so that landlords can begin to take action against anti-social tenants, those committing acts of domestic violence and those with rent arrears that have nothing to do with Covid-19,"" he said. Anyone under threat of eviction should start gathering evidence such as receipts for rent paid or any communications with your landlord Landlords have to give you notice before they can apply to court for a possession order. For most tenancy types this notice must now be at least three months in England or six in Wales, but lodgers may get less notice If a possession order had already been made against you before 27 March 2020, then your landlord may apply for this to be enforced when the ban comes to an end. You should receive 14 days' notice of the eviction date Anyone now struggling to pay rent should speak to their landlord, and organise a repayment plan to pay off arrears Those receiving housing benefit or Universal Credit and unable to pay rent might be able to get a discretionary housing payment from the local council Source: Citizens Advice Call to extend eviction ban due to coronavirus Eviction ban to be extended by four weeks How are eviction rules for renters changing?

"Officials are mulling new coronavirus measures in France amid a rise in infections France has recorded almost 10,000 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, marking its highest single-day count since the start of the outbreak. Health authorities reported 9,843 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Thursday, surpassing the previous daily record by almost 900. The figures were released on the eve of a key meeting of ministers and health experts about toughening measures. France has the seventh-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world. More than 30,800 people in the country have died of coronavirus. The number of patients in intensive care units in the country has also been rising in recent days. While hospital figures are still far from the peaks reached in April, there are concerns over the strain that rising infection rates could put on the health system. Tracking the global outbreak The UK rise in Covid cases in five charts How to fly during a global pandemic In the meeting on Friday, officials will discuss introducing new measures to curb the spread of the virus. The head of the scientific council advising the government on the pandemic, Jean-Francois Delfraissy, has warned that ""tough"" decisions may be required. President Emmanuel Macron said the meeting would give the public a clear idea of what can be expected in the coming weeks. ""We need to be as transparent and clear as possible,"" he said on Thursday, according to AFP news agency. ""We need to be demanding and realistic without giving in to any kind of panic."" The country earlier this monthunveiled a major economic stimulus package, aimed at helping to repair the economic damage caused by coronavirus. Dubbed the ""France re-launch"", it is aimed at reversing rising unemployment, and includes tax cuts for business. Other countries in Europe are also seeing increases in coronavirus cases. The UK's confirmed coronavirus cases rose by more than 2,000 for the fifth consecutive day on Thursday, as Englandput mainland Portugal back on its quarantine list.England is also preparing to implement new restrictions, banning social gatherings of more than six people. Spain this week became the first country in the European Union to record more than half a million Covid-19 cases, after adding some 100,000 new cases in the past month. The World Health Organization has warned of a possible resurgence of the disease in Europe in October and November. A number of countries have re-imposed local lockdowns in their worst-affected regions, and there have been renewed appeals for people to wear face masks and follow social distancing rules. Students in many countries have been returning to school in recent days, after months out of the classroom because of the pandemic. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"No more than six people from two households in the affected areas will be allowed to gather in a private garden Restrictions on visiting other households are to be reintroduced in parts of Northern Ireland after a rise in cases of coronavirus. The new rules affect people in Ballymena town, those who live in the Belfast council area and addresses with postcodes BT43, BT28 and BT29. Those postcodes take in areas north east of Ballymena, and parts of Glenavy, Lisburn and Crumlin. People cannot visit other people's homes, but there are some exemptions. The exemptions include: Those in a social bubble with one other household Those with caring responsibilities including childcare Essential maintenance Supported living arrangements Visits required for legal or medical purposes Marriage or civil partnerships where a person is terminally ill No more than six people from two households in the affected areas will be allowed to gather in a private garden. And people living in them are being advised not to travel outside the zones unless it is necessary. The measures, which mark the first series of localised restrictions to be imposed in Northern Ireland since the lockdown in March, will take effect next week and be in place for at least a fortnight. Northern Ireland currently has the UK's highest rate of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people. First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill outlined the restrictions as theyled their first joint press conference together at Stormontfor 73 days. Mrs Foster urged people living in the affected areas to ""please take action now and stop the spread of the virus"". Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill gave their first press conference together in more than two months ""There is a creeping of the virus across Northern Ireland and we need people to work with us to stop that,"" she stressed. The executive said it was asking medically vulnerable and older people living in the areas affected by the new restrictions to be ""particularly careful"" and follow all public health advice. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said hospitals and care homes in those areas would also be advised to limit visitors, with one family member being allowed to visit once a week. More frequent visits may be allowed only in ""exceptional circumstances"", but that will be reviewed, she added. ""We may also have to add postcodes to this as the situation develops,"" she said. Mrs Foster said the executive needed to limit social interactions between households in order to ""push down the rising curve of infection"" in the areas with the highest rates of the virus. The deputy first minister urged people outside of the affected areas ""not to think they are invincible or immune"". Ministers also agreed to provide about 600 pubs in Northern Ireland which do not serve food with a new indicative date to reopen. The executive agreed that drink-only pubs can provisionally reopen on 21 September, but this will have to be ratified closer to the time. Arlene Foster said at present the ""villain"" was in our homes, not in businesses where customer numbers were regulated Non-food pubs in the Republic of Ireland are also aiming to reopen on the same date but it is being kept under review. Prof Ian Young, NI's chief scientific adviser, told the press briefing he was satisfied the mitigations being taken by the hospitality industry would ensure it was safe to reopen. Mrs Foster said at present, the ""villain is not in businesses where numbers of customers are regulated"". ""It's in our homes - it is the house party, it is the dinner party - it is the few people coming around for drinks or coffee,"" she added. Hospitality Ulster said the decision to give pubs a new reopening date would ""help secure hundreds of businesses and thousands of jobs that have been hanging in the balance"". Bar the police turning up outside on a doorstep in a residential area, we are seeing that they are really clamping down on those large social gatherings that according to the data are happening in those BT areas and also in Belfast. They say that they can manage to enforce what is going on in bars and restaurants, that they are very happy with the behaviour, but really they can't manage what is going on inside houses and outside in gardens. It is similar to what happened in Glasgow a number of weeks ago. Obviously, Belfast is the most affected by this and people are being asked to really curtail going out; restricting how many people we can have in our back gardens and mixing between houses really is forbidden - but there are exemptions. Asked how the measures would be enforced, Mrs Foster said she ""hoped people will comply"". She said she did not want it to reach the stage that measures had to be strictly enforced, but the law would be in place. ""We're always very aware we're asking people to do things they would not ordinarily do,"" the first minister added. The executive has also agreed to set up a minister-led group to consider compliance and enforcement of the regulations, to ensure ""everyone follows the spirit and the letter of the law"". The executive also agreed to give the green light to soft play areas in Northern Ireland reopening from Monday. Q&A: What has and has not changed in NI lockdown? Q&A: What is yet to open in NI? The Department of Health says the current R number - or reproduction rate - of coronavirus in Northern Ireland is between 0.3 and 1.4. The R valueis the number of people that one infected person will pass a virus on to, on average, and if the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases very fast Chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young said although NI's R number estimate appeared lower than it has been in recent weeks, there had been a ""general increase in cases"". It was also announced that from 04:00 BST on Saturday, anyone arriving in NI from Portugal, Hungary, French Polynesia and RÃ©union will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Quarantine-free travel is still allowed from the Portuguese islands, the Azores and Madeira. Sweden will also be removed from the list of countries where quarantine measures are required. The Department of Health said it would continue to monitor the situation in all countries. All the announcements came as one more coronavirus-related death was recorded in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, with 79 new cases throughout NI also reported. That brings the total to 568 deaths and 8,035 cases. In the past seven days, there have been 177 new cases in the Belfast council area. In the Republic of Ireland, no further deaths were reported on Thursday, with the total remaining at 1,781. The Irish department of health revealed there had been 30,360 confirmed cases of the virus, after 196 more were recorded. What is yet to open in NI under Covid regulations?

"The UK government should consider a targeted extension of its furlough scheme, MPs have said. The coronavirus crisis risks mass long-term unemployment and viable firms could go under without support, the Treasury Select Committee has warned. However, a blanket retention of the scheme would not be good value for money, it added. The Treasury said it would ""continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment."" The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is due to end on 31 October. Under it, workers placed on leave have received 80% of their pay up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. At first, this was all paid for by the government. Butfirms had to start making a contribution to wagesin September as the scheme began to wind down. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said that extending furlough past October would only keep people ""in suspended animation"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak also ruled out an extension, instead saying thatfirms will be given Â£1,000 for every furloughed workerstill in employment at the end of January. Coronavirus: What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' But the committee's chairman, Mel Stride, said the chancellor ""should carefully consider targeted extensions"" to the scheme. ""The key will be assisting those businesses who, with additional support, can come through the crisis as sustainable enterprises, rather than focusing on those that will unfortunately just not be viable in the changed post-crisis economy."" In the second report of its inquiry into the economic impact of Covid-19, the committee also warned that the pandemic risked widening the gender pay gap due to the differences in hours of paid work in lockdown - especially if work patterns are changed permanently. The MPs also said people should be able to reskill, and that small businesses should be able to fully participate in the government's Kickstart Scheme, which aims to create work placements for young people on universal credit. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) trade body said with the furlough scheme winding down, ""policymakers will need to look closely at measures to stem mass unemployment, including a successor scheme."" FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""The priority should be protecting viable small businesses - and all the jobs they provide - that have been disproportionately [hit] by the coronavirus crisis, including those caught by local lockdowns, subject to continued national restrictions, or with staff that have directly suffered because of Covid."" This video can not be played Julie changed jobs before lockdown - then became unemployed and ineligible for the furlough scheme The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns on living standards, said that ""extending support for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy will be essential to limit the rise in unemployment Britain faces in the months ahead."" Torsten Bell, the think tank's chief executive, said: ""This authoritative account of the economic impact of coronavirus should be required reading for Treasury officials planning the Autumn Budget against the highly uncertain backdrop of rising coronavirus case numbers. ""The chancellor will need to reconsider his plans to swiftly phase out support given the painful reality that the economic crisis is here to stay."" This week leading business groups warned that the UKrisks a second wave of job cutsand a slower economic recovery if it does not extend its furlough scheme. Germany, Belgium, Australia and France have all decided to extend or launch new wage support schemes into next year. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown told the BBC that the UK should emulate other countries' short-term working schemes. Mr Brown said the end of the furlough scheme on 31 October was a ""cliff-edge"" that could trigger ""a tsunami of unemployment"". ""The government's got to change course here,"" he told the Today programme. Short-term working schemes would allow firms to reduce employees' working hours while keeping them in jobs, with the state topping up their salaries. ""You have got to send a signal that unemployment matters,"" he said. ""We don't want to destroy any more capacity and skills in the economy."" A Treasury spokesperson said that by the time the UK scheme closes it will have helped to pay for 9.6 million jobs. ""We will continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment,"" the spokesperson said. ""We're helping employees get back to work, where they want to be, through a Â£1,000 retention bonus. ""And we are creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart Scheme, creating incentives for training and apprenticeships, and supporting and protecting jobs in the tourism and hospitality sectors through our VAT cut and last month's Eat Out to Help Out scheme."" The UK's unemployment rate has been at 3.9% since the lockdown was introduced. But the Bank of England expects that rate to double to 7.5% by the end of the year when the government-funded support schemes come to an end. Thousands of job cuts have already been announced by firm such as Rolls-Royce, Costa Coffee, Pret A Manger, Pizza Express, British Airways and BP.

"The new coronavirus rules in England banning social gatherings of more than six people will not be kept in place ""any longer than we have to"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. ""This sacrifice is vital to control the virus for the long term,"" he told MPs. The law comes into force on Monday and will be enforced through a Â£100 fine. Mr Hancock was also heckled by some MPs as he spoke about the government's plans for mass coronavirus testing,after concerns it was unrealistic. Scientists and health professionals have said the technology for the government's plan for more rapid tests ""does not, as yet, exist"", and there are already issues with laboratory capacity. On Thursday, the UK recorded another 2,919 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the fifth consecutive day that the figure has been more than 2,000. Another 14 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out the new ""rule of six"" on Wednesday as part of measures intended to halt the rise in cases. It applies both indoors and outdoors and to all ages - although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work. On Thursday,Scotland changed its rules on socialisingto a maximum of six people inside and outside - but unlike England they must be from two households, and children under 12 are exempt. What are the new rules? The new rules in Scotland ""As the chief medical officer said yesterday, we must learn from the recent experience of countries like Belgium who successfully put in place these measures to combat a similar rise in infections,"" said Mr Hancock in Parliament on Thursday. ""These are not measures that we take lightly. I understand that for many they'll mean changing long-awaited plans or missing out on precious moments with loved ones, but this sacrifice is vital to control the virus for the long term and save lives. ""And I vow that we will not keep these rules in place for any longer than we have to."" Earlier, Mr Hancock's colleague, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, said if everybody followed the rules ""we may well be by Christmas in a position to look at it again"". Former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson said it will take about ""two to three weeks"" to see what effect the social distancing measures have. ""So we need to wait at this point and see how much we flatten the curve and then if that's not sufficient to bring the reproduction number below one, so the epidemic starts shrinking again, then yes, we may need to clamp down on other areas,"" he added. Prof Ferguson - whose advice to the prime minister led to the UK lockdown - said it was unavoidable that the virus would resurge in all age groups. And asked about the government's push to get people to return to work, Prof Ferguson added: ""Certainly I think we should hesitate and maybe pause at the headlong rush to get everybody back into offices. ""But some people have to work and I completely understand the concerns in many quarters that everybody working at home has an economic impact, particularly on city centres."" This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Social gatherings of more than six people in England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors,and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces,to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includes protests and political activities subject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance People who ignore the policecould be fined Â£100- doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 Mr Hancock was also asked about the government's testing plan. The next immediate goal for the government is to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. Currently, testing capacity is being reported as 350,000 a day - which includes swab tests (which check if you have the virus currently) and antibody tests (which check if someone has already had the virus). But the government is also planning ""Operation Moonshot"" - which aims to see millions of tests processed every day. This would involve using a new type of test, which is not yet rolled out, involving swabs or saliva and can give results in 90 or even 20 minutes. In many ways the focus is on how long the new rules may last and the ""Operation Moonshot"" plans for mass rapid testing are a distraction from the difficult decisions the country faces. Despite the recent rises, infection rates remain low. But they will continue to go up. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and fact people are indoors more. That will soon translate into more hospitalisations and, sadly, more deaths. This happens every year with flu. The worst winter of recent years, 2017-18, saw close to an extra 50,000 deaths. When the first signs of that happens, ministers will then have to decide what to do next. They could choose more restrictions to try to curb the spread of the virus in the knowledge these will damage people's health in other ways as well as harming education and the economy. Or they let the virus spread, while focusing efforts on protecting the vulnerable - more than 90% of deaths have been among the over 65s with half among the over 85s. Clearly that will mean putting more protections in place around care homes, perhaps by banning visitors, as well as considering reintroducing shielding. Lockdown bought us time, but simply deferred the problem. Progress has been made in the past six months - there are better treatments, more testing and a network of contact tracers - but maybe not as much as hoped. The UK, like all nations, faces a tricky act of balancing harms. Mr Hancock was heckled by some opposition MPs as he outlined ""Moonshot"", responding: ""I'm absolutely determined that we will get there. ""And if everything comes together, and if the technology comes off, it'll be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to get closer to normal before Christmas."" He said the approach was being piloted and steps are being taken to verify the new technology ahead of a desired nationwide roll-out. This video can not be played Jonathan Ashworth asked Matt Hancock for more clarity over mass testing Earlier, the chairman of the British Medical Association Dr Chaand Nagpaulsaid it was unclearhow Operation Moonshot would work - given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. And other scientists warned of the dangers of false negatives and false positives. On Thursday, Scotlandlaunched its new contact tracing app,with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urging as many people as possible to download it. The contact tracing app being developed in England ran into technical problems and is currently being tested following a revamp. Meanwhile, the latest figures for England's Test and Trace programme showed mixed performance. There has been a slight improvement in turnaround times for testing - results for people who go to testing centres and mobile units are being done in 23 and 20 hours respectively on average - two weeks ago both had crept over 24 hours. But for the second week in a row contact tracers were only able to reach under 70% of the close contacts of people who are infected - well below the 80% target. Dr Layla McCay of the NHS Confederation said the figures were a ""cause for serious alarm"".

"This video can not be played Three children were seriously injured in the crash Three children were seriously injured when their school bus hit a railway bridge. The double-decker's roof was torn off in the crash in Wellhouse Lane, Winchester, shortly after 08:10 BST. Pupils from Henry Beaufort School ""started screaming"" when the roof fell on top of them, leaving a further 12 needing treatment for minor injuries. Bus operator Stagecoach South said an investigation was under way. No arrests have been made. The three badly hurt children were taken to hospital. Twelve other youngsters, two of whom were also taken to hospital, suffered minor injuries, Hampshire Constabulary said. All pupils on board were aged between 11 and 16, the force said. Poppy, 11, who was sitting on the top deck of the bus, said the children had noticed the driver was ""going on a completely different route"" in the moments before the crash. She said a metal pole struck her on the head and others were hurt by breaking glass. ""There was blood everywhere - everyone was in a rush to get down, but we were all trying to help each other,"" she added. Zoe was on the top deck of the bus when the crash happened Zoe, 14, who was also on the top deck, said the roof fell in on top of everyone ""and everyone started screaming"". ""It felt like 'am I going to live or am I going to die' - everyone was crying and shaking, it was a huge shock,"" she said. Fifteen-year-old Robert, who was on the lower deck of the bus, said: ""I heard crashing upstairs. I thought we'd hit the side of the tunnel, then I saw the top of the bus falling down. ""Most of the people hurt just had cuts and were bleeding. But there were some people with bad injuries."" The children on board were all aged between 11 and 16 Insp Andy Tester, of Hampshire Constabulary, said it was ""very lucky"" nobody was killed. ""That bus doesn't fit through the bridge - I can't think that a bus route would have been drawn [up] to take it through a bridge that is too low for the bus,"" he said. The bridge has a warning sign above it that states vehicles with a height of more than 12ft (3.6m) should not enter. The bus involved in the crash was believed to be about 14ft (4.3m) in height. The bus had been on its way to Henry Beaufort School Sue Hearle, head teacher of the Henry Beaufort School, said: ""This is a distressing incident and we are extremely relieved that it wasn't more serious."" She added she did not want to speculate on the circumstances of the crash and would be focusing on supporting the children affected. A spokesperson for Stagecoach South said: ""Our thoughts are with the children and their families. ""We are carrying out an internal investigation into the circumstances involved in the incident and we will continue to provide the emergency services with our full support."" The road remains closed between the junction with Andover Road North to School Lane. Hampshire County Council said staff were providing support to the school ""including our education psychology team to help students and staff to deal with any trauma they may experience"".

"This video can not be played Scotland sets 'rule of six' for people meeting up The number of people allowed to meet up in Scotland has been cut to six amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic ""accelerating"". It came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a ""tightening and extension"" of lockdown rules. Changes planned for next week have been put back until at least 5 October. It means that theatres, live music venues, indoor soft play facilities and indoor contact sports will not now open next Monday. Until now, eight people from three households had been allowed to meet indoors in Scotland, and up to 15 from five households outdoors. This will change to six people from two households, and will apply both indoors and outdoors - including in homes, gardens, pubs and restaurants. Children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, however. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland What are the latest lockdown rules in Scotland? New Scottish contact tracing app goes live The changes also mean spectators will not be able to return to sports stadia and other venues over the next three weeks - although two pilot events due take place at the weekend will still happen. Scotland is currently recording three times more positive cases of the virus on average each day than it was three weeks ago - with a further 161 cases being logged on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon said the spread of the virus was accelerating - albeit from a low base and not as rapidly as it was back in March and April. She said this was ""not entirely unexpected"" given the recent steps to reopen the economy - but that further planned moves to lift lockdown had to be put on pause for now. The first minister said: ""Right now, given the rise in cases, it's the only responsible decision we can reach."" Ms Sturgeon also said the reopening of offices and call centres will ""definitely not take place"" before October, saying that ""for now, working from home will remain the default position"". The move to cut the number of people who can meet followsa similar move announced for Englandon Wednesday. There will be ""limited exceptions"" to the rules for organised sports, places of worship and wedding and funeral services - which will be capped at 20 guests. The new limits will officially come into force on Monday, although Ms Sturgeon said that she was asking people to immediately abide by the stricter new limits on gatherings. Scotland's music industry has warned many venues may not survive the coronavirus lockdown It will also become mandatory for staff working in hospitality premises such as pubs and restaurants to wear face coverings, and for customers to wear them while moving around. Ms Sturgeon admitted the new announcements would be ""hard for people to hear"", but said they were necessary. She said the rise in new cases was ""not as rapid as it was earlier in the year"" and that prevalence of the virus was lower ""thanks to the individual sacrifices that so any of you have made for the greater good"". She said: ""We have grounds for cautious hope, but we have no grounds for complacency. It is vital to do everything we can to stop cases rising further before winter. ""These steps are necessary to help curb a virus that we know spreads rapidly whenever it gets the chance."" She insisted that the Test and Protect contact tracing system was ""working well"", adding that without this ""the virus would be spreading further and faster, and we would require to apply much stricter lockdown measures again"". The Scottish Conservatives asked the government to consider moving more towards a strategy of mass community testing to complement Test and Protect. The party's Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, said: ""Experts have said that mass community testing must also be part of the solution, if we are going to succeed in keeping the virus supressed through the winter. ""I would also urge the government to continue their work with Scotland's airports on a testing regime. ""The aviation sector needs all the help it can get, and stopping the virus will only be possible if we reach everyone coming into the country who may need to quarantine.""

"The app can be downloaded free onto a mobile phone More than 600,000 people have downloaded Scotland's new contact tracing app since it went live. It became available to download free on to a smart phone from Apple's App Store or Google Play on Thursday. The Protect Scotland app lets people know if they have been in close contact with someone who later tests positive. The Scottish government has said the software will support the Test and Protect system and is ""another tool in the fight against Covid-19"". Up until now, contact tracing has been done manually using a method followed for years to help control the spread of infectious diseases. How does Scotland's new contact tracing app work? How to download Scotland's contact tracing app,external Coronavirus in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged as many people as possible to get involved in the new tracing scheme. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber on Thursday afternoon, she said: ""The more people that sign up the better. Everybody who signs up is making a contribution."" She told MSPs that the number of people who had downloaded the app had stood at 150,000 before she left her office to speak in parliament. During First Minister's Questions, she said the number had climbed to 200,000 since she had taken to her feet, which she described as ""very positive"". By 12:15 on Friday, that had risen above 600,000. Scotland has followed Northern Ireland in choosing to use the toolkit provided by Apple and Google to build a contact tracing app which has privacy built in. Both have moved quickly by using the software developed for Ireland's app. Scotland did at first seem inclined to work with the NHSX England app team, which for months pursued a centralised app collecting more data, without the co-operation of the tech giants. But seeing some knotty technical issues with the English app they then decided to follow many other countries going down the Apple/Google route. One person close to the Scottish project said ""using something that the tech giants had created was easier than trying to create stuff ourselves"". England also eventually changed tack and hasbeen testing an app based on the Apple Google toolkit for the last monthon the Isle of Wight and the London borough of Newham. But there's still no word on a national rollout - and it seems England, which once saw a contact tracing app as a vital weapon in the battle against the virus, is now happy to be a follower rather than a leader in this technology. With 64,000 downloads by 09:00 on launch day, the Test and Protect team feel their app has got away to a good start - but the real question is whether it will help speed up warnings to people who may have been close to someone infected with the virus. It will be weeks before we know whether the app is an effective tool. Some iPhone users have reported not being able to download the app because they are not running iOS 13. The iPhone 6 and older models launched before 2015 cannot run Apple's latest operating system. Android phone users will also need to be running at least the Android 6.0 operating system, which was launched in 2015,the Protect.scot website says,external. Asked at First Minister's Questions about people who did not use smartphones, Ms Sturgeon said the more people who used the app, the more effective it would be. But the first minister told MSPs that the Scottish government had not based its entire test and protect system on a proximity tracing app. ""We've built it from the bottom up using tried and tested approaches in our public health teams and the app is an enhancement to that,"" she said. ""So if you don't have a phone, if you don't use the app, you will not be missed from our test and protect system."" Research by Ofcom from 2017,externalsuggested that about 3.2m adults in Scotland owned a smartphone. The new app uses Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in prolonged close contact with someone who subsequently tests positive for Covid-19. When an individual initially tests positive for the virus, they are contacted by phone in the usual way. The contact tracer will ask them if they are an app user and if they are willing to use the app's upload function to anonymously alert close contacts. If they agree, they will be sent a unique code to their mobile which unlocks this function on the app. By sharing their positive test result in this way, the information will form part of an anonymous database. The app on other users' phones regularly checks this database to see if they have been in contact with an infected person. A warning is automatically issued when a match is found and users are then urged to get tested or self-isolate for 14 days. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"There have been 302 deaths in Rhondda Cynon Taff involving coronavirus since March - including two in care homes in the last six weeks People in two counties are being asked to wear face masks in work, shops and crowded public spaces in a bid to avoid another local Covid-19 lockdown. Residents of Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil have been asked by councils only to use public transport if ""essential"". They have already been warned they face lockdown after an increase in cases. Merthyr Tydfil has the second highest coronavirus case rate in Wales - behind Caerphilly,already in lockdown. In a joint statement, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff councils, the local health board and police called for local residents to ""take action now"". UK coronavirus cases up by almost 3,000 on Thursday Hospital admissions rise in hotspot areas Rhondda keen to avoid long-term virus impact To take affect immediately, they want people to: Only use public transport for essential purposes, like travel to education, work, essential medical appointments and shopping Work from home for the next few weeks if you can Wear a three-layer face mask, in work, supermarkets and other indoor or crowded public spaces for everyone aged 12 and over Not to visit care homes, unless it is an end-of-life visit where full personal protective equipment will be required Both councils said schools would remain open and home-to-school transport would continue ""in accordance with the latest Public Health Wales guidance"". Public health chiefs said people ""ignoring or disregarding"" social distancing was ""why transmission has increased"" in those areas. ""Our message for the public is that coronavirus has not gone away - and it can be a very serious illness - especially for older and vulnerable people,"" said Kelechi Nnoaham, public health director of Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. ""We must all play our part to protect our vulnerable or older friends, family members and loved ones.

"Council leaders in Rhondda Cynon Taff have warned about potential local lockdowns here Hospital admissions of patients with coronavirus in a health board covering the south Wales valleys have doubled in the last week. There were 72 admissions in Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board in the week to Tuesday, according to figures from NHS Wales. It is the highest figure since the start of August. There has been concern about rising infections in Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil. Welsh Government ministers and officials had been meeting on Thursday to discuss potentially introducing tighter restrictions within the Rhondda Cynon Taff area, but no announcement was made by the evening. Instead,local councils issued voluntary adviceto wear masks in work and shops in an effort to avoid local lockdowns. Earlier on Thursday, the Cwm Taf Morgannwg executive director of public health Kelechi Nnoaham said local lockdowns for Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil were ""not very far"", but were ""not inevitable"" if people abided by the rules. ""There is more we can do to limit these infections within our communities and not go straight into lockdown territory."" Kelechi Nnoaham says he is worried by rising cases but the problem can be tackled by working together Mr Nnoaham said some people who had come home from holidays who should be isolating were not, and that people needed to stop attending parties. ""I know how hard lockdown has been for people, and that they want to let go a little bit, that is perfectly human, but coronavirus has not gone away,"" he said. ""I am worried, but it is not hopeless. It is not an insurmountable problem, it feels like something we can tackle if we are working together with our communities."" Numbers have also risen in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, which covers Caerphilly county,the area put into local lockdown earlier this week. There were 76 hospital admissions in the week to 8 September - the highest total for 10 weeks. Caerphilly has the second highest rate for coronavirus infections in the UK in the last seven days, after Bolton, Greater Manchester. But there are concerns if those infections start translating down the line into hospital admissions. Rhondda keen to avoid long-term impact Merthyr Tydfil braced for lockdown What do the stats tell us in Wales? The seven-day average in total daily admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases in Wales is currently 54, about the same as last week. Overall, numbers of patients in hospital with coronavirus in Wales have continued to fall. These include those in critical care. The figures show: There were 249 coronavirus-related patients in hospital beds - 42 fewer than last week Of those - 13 were confirmed Covid-19 patients, 150 were suspected and 86 were recovering from the virus A total of nine people were being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus - five fewer than the week before Aneurin Bevan, Betsi Cadwaladr, Cardiff and Vale and Swansea Bay health boards each had two patients in critical or ventilated care and one in Cwm Taf Morgannwg - all suspected Covid-19 patients apart from one of the Cardiff patients, who is a confirmed case Hywel Dda had no Covid-19 patients in critical care. Meanwhile, separate weekly figures for the""test, trace, protect"" system,externalfor contacting people with coronavirus and tracing contacts, shows 98% of the 1,860 positive cases since 21 June were reached and were able to provide details of their recent contacts. In the most recent week, 96% of the 424 positive cases were reached. Of the 5,834 close contacts that were eligible for follow-up, 94% were successfully contacted and advised, according to NHS Wales. The Welsh Government said this shows it was reaching more contacts than the system in England.

"Citigroup has named a woman to be its new chief executive in a first for a Wall Street bank. Briton Jane Fraser, its current president and head of global consumer division, is to become its new boss when current chief Michael Corbat retires in February. He is stepping down after 37 years at the bank, including eight as leader. It comes as the male-dominated world of US finance faces pressure to diversify its ranks. Scotland-born Ms Fraser has worked at Citi for 16 years, serving in her current role since 2019. She oversees business in 19 countries and previously led its Latin America division. Seen as a rising star, she was recently considered for the role of chief executive at Wells Fargo, another top US bank. The chair of Citi's board of directors, John Dugan, said Ms Fraser would take the bank ""to the next level"". ""She has deep experience across our lines of business and regions and we are highly confident in her,"" he said. Firms with more female executives 'perform better' Last year, Royal Bank of Scotland named Alison Rose as its first female chief executive, making her the first woman to run any of the big four banks in the UK. But just 31 women held the top spots at major American companies listed on the S&P 500 index at the end of 2019, none of which were banks. At a congressional hearing last year, the heads of seven of America's biggest banks, including current Citi boss Mr Corbat, were questioned about the lack of diversity and asked if they believed they would be succeeded by a woman or person of colour. None said yes. At Citi, Ms Fraser has frequently been charged with turning around troubled parts of the bank, the fourth largest in the US. She worked in its mortgage division following the financial crisis and was put in charge in Latin America after a scandal in its bank in Mexico. She is poised to take charge as the bank grapples with the economic fallout of the pandemic. In the most recent quarter, Citi's profits plunged 73% as it set aside more than $7bn to cover potential losses. Ms Fraser, whose compensation was $12.5m (Â£9.7m) last year, has said being a good leader means setting a vision, having the courage to make ""tough calls"", and asking questions. Born in St Andrews, Scotland, she has degrees from Harvard Business School and Cambridge University. The 53-year-old started her career at Goldman Sachs in London, joining Citi after rising to be a partner at consulting giant McKinsey. Shehas said,externalshe moved to the US because of the opportunities she saw for women there and spoken aboutconfronting machismo,externalas a female executive in Latin America A married mum of two, she has also addressed work-life balance,telling broadcaster CNN,externalin 2014: ""You cannot have it all at the same time. You can have it all, spread over decades. I think of my life in different chunks. When the kids were little, I needed to be around more, but it's different now."" However, in a 2018 interview she denied aspiring to the top spot. ""I look forward to seeing a woman being the first CEO of a Wall Street firm whoever that may be,""she said,external. ""I've never had the ambition to be the CEO of Citi or any other organization."" But she added: ""Things can change over time.""

"Officials are mulling new coronavirus measures in France amid a rise in infections France has recorded almost 10,000 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, marking its highest single-day count since the start of the outbreak. Health authorities reported 9,843 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Thursday, surpassing the previous daily record by almost 900. The figures were released on the eve of a key meeting of ministers and health experts about toughening measures. France has the seventh-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world. More than 30,800 people in the country have died of coronavirus. The number of patients in intensive care units in the country has also been rising in recent days. While hospital figures are still far from the peaks reached in April, there are concerns over the strain that rising infection rates could put on the health system. Tracking the global outbreak The UK rise in Covid cases in five charts How to fly during a global pandemic In the meeting on Friday, officials will discuss introducing new measures to curb the spread of the virus. The head of the scientific council advising the government on the pandemic, Jean-Francois Delfraissy, has warned that ""tough"" decisions may be required. President Emmanuel Macron said the meeting would give the public a clear idea of what can be expected in the coming weeks. ""We need to be as transparent and clear as possible,"" he said on Thursday, according to AFP news agency. ""We need to be demanding and realistic without giving in to any kind of panic."" The country earlier this monthunveiled a major economic stimulus package, aimed at helping to repair the economic damage caused by coronavirus. Dubbed the ""France re-launch"", it is aimed at reversing rising unemployment, and includes tax cuts for business. Other countries in Europe are also seeing increases in coronavirus cases. The UK's confirmed coronavirus cases rose by more than 2,000 for the fifth consecutive day on Thursday, as Englandput mainland Portugal back on its quarantine list.England is also preparing to implement new restrictions, banning social gatherings of more than six people. Spain this week became the first country in the European Union to record more than half a million Covid-19 cases, after adding some 100,000 new cases in the past month. The World Health Organization has warned of a possible resurgence of the disease in Europe in October and November. A number of countries have re-imposed local lockdowns in their worst-affected regions, and there have been renewed appeals for people to wear face masks and follow social distancing rules. Students in many countries have been returning to school in recent days, after months out of the classroom because of the pandemic. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open Greece is sending three ships to help house thousands of migrants sleeping rough on the island of Lesbos after fire destroyed their overcrowded camp. For a second night families slept on roads, and in fields and car parks after fleeing Moria camp, where about 13,000 had been living in squalor. A blaze engulfed Moria on Tuesday night before another wiped out any remaining tents on Wednesday. About 400 teenagers and children have been flown to mainland Greece. How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed on a plan for the EU to take in about 400 unaccompanied minors from Lesbos, AFP news agency reports. It is not yet clear if they will be the ones already flown to mainland Greece. The EU has tried previously to resettle migrants among different member states but only a minority have been transferred from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. A quota system was rejected by a group of member states. The Greek ferry Blue Star Chios has now docked at Sigri, a Lesbos port about 100km (60 miles) from the main town Mytilene. It has capacity to house 1,000 migrants, and Greece is also sending two naval vessels to provide emergency accommodation. Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said about 2,000 people would be temporarily sheltered on the ships. He also said efforts were under way to provide shelter near the devastated Moria camp site. Mr Mitarachi said tensions had been running high in the camp because a 15-day quarantine had been imposed after a migrant tested positive for coronavirus last week. By Wednesday, 35 people linked to the camp had tested positive for coronavirus, and there is concern on Lesbos now that most of them need to be urgently located. Caroline Willeman, the Moria co-ordinator for medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF), told the BBC that ""they had initially been isolated, but of course in the chaos of the last two days they have once again been dispersed within the wider community"". ""We had been told last night that eight out of the 35 cases had again been located and isolated."" Aid workers fear many migrants are now scattered across the island Bethany Bell, BBC News, Lesbos Along the road from the burnt-out Moria camp groups of migrants sit at the kerbside and under olive trees. Some are carrying small bags, others are pushing shopping trolleys filled with blankets. One woman from Afghanistan held her baby girl, born 25 days ago. She said she and her family had spent the night out in the open, as the police had not let them return to Moria. She said no one had brought them either food or water. A few steps away in the blazing sun, a Syrian woman fed her baby from a bottle. Police have set up roadblocks preventing refugees from leaving the area to go towards the main town, Mytilene, and the port. When one migrant approached them, the police shouted ""Go back, Covid, Covid!"" A young Afghan boy hunched his shoulders and frowned. ""Lesbos no good,"" he said. An eight-year-old barefoot Congolese girl told Reuters news agency she was hungry and ""our home burned, my shoes burned, we don't have food, no water"". She had slept at the roadside with her mother Natzy Malala, who has a newborn infant. ""There is no food, no milk for the baby,"" Natzy Malala said. This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie spoke to people at the Moria camp months before it was destroyed and reflects on her experiences there Witnesses have told the BBC that three people died in the fire but the Greek migration minister said there had been ""no casualties, no loss of life"". He said that some people were returning to ""safe areas"" near the Moria camp, which was only designed to hold 3,000 people. Fires broke out in more than three places in a short space of time, local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos told state television channel ERT. Some protesting migrants hindered firefighters who tried to tackle the flames, he said. The main blaze, which was initially fanned by high winds, was put out by Wednesday morning. Some 20 firefighters, 10 fire engines and a helicopter were sent to the scene. Migrants fleeing the camp attempted to save some of their belongings The incident occurred just hours after reports that 35 people had tested positive for Covid-19 at the camp. Authorities placed the facility under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant was confirmed to have contracted coronavirus. Mr Mitarachi said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of those infected with the virus had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. He did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. But some migrants told BBC Persian that the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp. Several blamed ""far-right Greeks"" for the blaze after the announcement of coronavirus cases, and tookphotos of what they said were canisters used to ignite the flames,external. Containers and tents used to shelter migrants at the Moria camp were completely destroyed Many migrants then attempted to carry their belongings to the port town of Mytilene but police had blocked roads. Others were reportedly attacked by locals as they tried to pass through a nearby village. A state of emergency has been declared and several ministers have been sent to Lesbos to assess the situation. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said ""the situation in Moria cannot go on, because it is simultaneously a public health and national security issue"". In Germany, the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, offered to ""take in 1,000 refugees"". It lies north-east of Mytilene and has been overwhelmed by huge numbers of refugees for years. According to InfoMigrants,about 70% of people in the camp are from Afghanistan,externalbut migrants from more than 70 different countries live there. An overflow site - the Kara Tepe Refugee Camp - has since been built but there is still not enough space to accommodate all arrivals. For years, thousands of people who arrived on Lesbos were placed in the camp and could not leave until their asylum application was processed on the mainland - a slow, bureaucratic process. In April,Human Rights Watch said the Greek authorities had not done enough to tackle ""acute overcrowding"",externalat the site.

"The disruption to hospitals in England during the pandemic has meant the number of patients facing long waits for routine operations has soared. More than two million people on the waiting list - half the total - have been waiting more than 18 weeks, the highest since records began in 2007. Some 83,000 have waited over a year, up from 2,000 before the pandemic. But there are some encouraging signs, with treatments happening in hospitals on the increase. More than 140,000 operations such as knee and hip replacements were carried out in July, up from 41,000 in April when routine treatments were cancelled en masse. But that is less than half the level seen in the same month last year. The numbers coming to Accident and Emergency topped 1.7m in August, up from a low of 916,000 in April at the peak of the pandemic. Before the pandemic, more than two million patients a month were regularly coming to A&E. Nearly 21,600 cancer patients started their treatment in July, down from 28,000 in the same month last year. But that is up from 16,600 in May. NHS medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the increase in activity was ""pleasing"", calling the rebound ""substantial"". But he added: ""The success of these service expansions depends on keeping Covid under control."" A&E visits in England down to record low Coronavirus 'wreaks havoc' on cancer services Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts In March, NHS bosses announced virtually all routine work was to stop to create space for the expected surge in coronavirus patients. Cancer services were meant to be protected, but some services were cut back on, while the drop in A&E visits was attributed to fear of the virus. Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, said frontline staff were ""working hard"" to restore services. She said the need for extra cleaning and constantly changing in and out of protective equipment meant it took longer than it did in the past to see and treat patients. But she added: ""The recovery from the peak of the pandemic was always going to require step by step increases in activity and the NHS is well on the way to restoring services. We are in a much better place than many would have predicted a few months ago."" But Prof Neil Mortensen, of the Royal College of Surgeons, said the speed at which patients were being seen was ""disappointing"", adding he feared many would have to wait until the spring for treatment. ""For those unable to return to work due to their condition, this is not only a health issue, but an economic one too."" Sara Bainbridge, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said unless more could be done backlogs would continue to grow. ""Behind each statistic is a real person whose prognosis and treatment options could be severely impacted by disruption during Covid-19.""

"This video can not be played Three children were seriously injured in the crash Three children were seriously injured when their school bus hit a railway bridge. The double-decker's roof was torn off in the crash in Wellhouse Lane, Winchester, shortly after 08:10 BST. Pupils from Henry Beaufort School ""started screaming"" when the roof fell on top of them, leaving a further 12 needing treatment for minor injuries. Bus operator Stagecoach South said an investigation was under way. No arrests have been made. The three badly hurt children were taken to hospital. Twelve other youngsters, two of whom were also taken to hospital, suffered minor injuries, Hampshire Constabulary said. All pupils on board were aged between 11 and 16, the force said. Poppy, 11, who was sitting on the top deck of the bus, said the children had noticed the driver was ""going on a completely different route"" in the moments before the crash. She said a metal pole struck her on the head and others were hurt by breaking glass. ""There was blood everywhere - everyone was in a rush to get down, but we were all trying to help each other,"" she added. Zoe was on the top deck of the bus when the crash happened Zoe, 14, who was also on the top deck, said the roof fell in on top of everyone ""and everyone started screaming"". ""It felt like 'am I going to live or am I going to die' - everyone was crying and shaking, it was a huge shock,"" she said. Fifteen-year-old Robert, who was on the lower deck of the bus, said: ""I heard crashing upstairs. I thought we'd hit the side of the tunnel, then I saw the top of the bus falling down. ""Most of the people hurt just had cuts and were bleeding. But there were some people with bad injuries."" The children on board were all aged between 11 and 16 Insp Andy Tester, of Hampshire Constabulary, said it was ""very lucky"" nobody was killed. ""That bus doesn't fit through the bridge - I can't think that a bus route would have been drawn [up] to take it through a bridge that is too low for the bus,"" he said. The bridge has a warning sign above it that states vehicles with a height of more than 12ft (3.6m) should not enter. The bus involved in the crash was believed to be about 14ft (4.3m) in height. The bus had been on its way to Henry Beaufort School Sue Hearle, head teacher of the Henry Beaufort School, said: ""This is a distressing incident and we are extremely relieved that it wasn't more serious."" She added she did not want to speculate on the circumstances of the crash and would be focusing on supporting the children affected. A spokesperson for Stagecoach South said: ""Our thoughts are with the children and their families. ""We are carrying out an internal investigation into the circumstances involved in the incident and we will continue to provide the emergency services with our full support.""

"Sister Bliss from dance act Faithless has said UK nightclubs have been ""left to rot in a corner"" amid the pandemic. The government says clubs must stay shut ""in line with current scientific advice to control the virus"". The musician and DJ told BBC Radio 6 Music club culture should be better protected. ""There's a lack of leadership at the top which means certain industries have been given support and then others have been completely ignored,"" she said. ""The electronic music scene and clubbing is definitely an incredible part of our cultural and economic force, and it travels all over the world globally. ""We really, I think, have been left to rot in a corner, so it's good to see that venues and artists are trying to galvanise it - with the Let the Music Play movement - trying to bring the plight of venues and freelancers, like myself, to the fore."" Indie stars discuss music careers in the time of Covid Stars back plea to support UK live music industry The Let the Music Play campaign saw 1,500 artists signan open letter,externalin July calling for support for the UK's music scene. ""All we can do is keep waving a flag and saying, 'We want support as well,'"" she told 6 Music's Georgie Rogers. Faithless performed at the BBC Music Awards in 2015 The government has announced a Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, but there is uncertainty over how far this money will stretch and where it will go. Sister Bliss's comments come on6 Music's State of the Independents Day on Thursday, looking into the effects of the pandemic on the independent music sector. In response, a government spokesman said: ""We know this is an incredibly difficult time for nightclubs, but they will need to remain closed for now in line with current scientific advice to control the virus. ""We continue to engage with industry representative and listen to their concerns. ""Throughout the pandemic, nightclubs have access to the government's unprecedented package of support to help businesses, which includes business rates relief, tax deferrals, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and billions paid in loans and grants."" While clubbing as we know it remains off the cards, some venues have been able to diversify in a bid to stay open and survive. Venues like Brixton Jamm and Escape to Freight Island in Manchester have been able to move things outside and host seated, socially distanced events with strict rules. Meanwhile, virtual clubbing has boomed, with DJs moving their sets online via social media or platforms like Boiler Room and United We Stream. Last week, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA,external) lent its support to The Global Nighttime Recovery Plan, which is looking at the ""the future of dancefloor"" by proposing flexible and open clubbing experiences. NTIA boss Michael Kill told BBC News the night time economy was ""on a cliff edge"", with furlough coming to an end soon. A government scheme meaning no business can be evicted for missing rent payments is also ending this month. At the end of July, a survey of the association's members suggested that 58% fear they will not survive longer than two months without further government support. And 71% were already set to make more than half of their workforces redundant in a matter of weeks. ""We need the government to recognise the critical position the sector is in across the UK and work expediently to release a roadmap,"" Mr Kill said.

"This video can not be played Smoke could be seen billowing out over the city's skyline Lebanon has launched an investigation into a huge fire at a warehouse storing aid that erupted in the port of Beirut - one month after a massive explosion there killed more than 190 people. The blaze broke out where an aid agency had been storing food and cooking oil. Firefighters and military officials spent hours battling the fire, using helicopters to drop water on it, before getting it under control on Thursday. No injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is not yet known. Footage shared on social media showed port workers running away as the fire broke out at the duty-free zone in the port on Thursday. The blaze sent a plume of dark smoke over the Lebanese capital. The head of Lebanon's Red Cross, George Kettaneh, said some people were suffering from shortness of breath, but there were no reports of injuries. Red Cross Regional Director Fabrizio Carboni said the warehouse stocked thousands of food parcels. He added that the humanitarian operation is atrisk of serious disruption,external. The area around the fire was cordoned off to prevent it from spreading. Civil defence director general Raymond Khattar told the state-run National News Agency that those working to extinguish the fire would not leave ""until the flames are fully quenched."" By the evening, officials said most flames had been extinguished. The fire sent a plume of dark smoke over the Lebanese capital The fire broke out just over a month after a huge explosion in the Lebanese capital, which was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonating at a warehouse in the port. In addition to the fatalities, thousands were injured and as many as 300,000 left homeless by the 4 August explosion. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how last month's explosion ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt Despite assurances from officials on Thursday that the situation was under control, some residents, still traumatised by last month's explosion, drove out of the city. ""I am forced to get them out of Beirut from the smoke and the fire that is happening at the port again,"" Majed Hassanein, who was leaving with his wife and children, told Reuters news agency. Others described how the fire brought back memories of the explosion. ""For sure we were scared... it's only been a month since the explosion that destroyed Beirut. We saw the same thing happening again,"" said 53-year-old Andre Muarbes. The Lebanese army announced in a tweet on Thursday that military police had begun an investigation into the blaze. Port director Bassem al-Qaisi earlier told the Voice of Lebanon radio station that the fire started in a warehouse where barrels of cooking oil were being stored, and then spread to tyres nearby. ""It is too early to know if it is the result of heat or some other mistake,"" he said. Michel Najjar, the public works minister with the outgoing government, told local media outlets that initial indications suggested the blaze was started by repair work at the port. Firefighters spent hours battling the blaze But he said full details on what happened would not be clear until a ""comprehensive study"" had been completed. In a meeting with top officials on Thursday, President Michel Aoun said the fire could have been the result of sabotage, a technical error or negligence. ""In all cases, the cause must be known as soon as possible and the perpetrators held to account,"" Mr Aoun was quoted as saying by the presidential Twitter account.

"WTO tariffs on dairy products average more than 35% Coronavirus permitting, there'll be fireworks and parties to mark the arrival of 2021. But as the clock strikes midnight, it'll also mark the end of the Brexit transition period. Trading relationships that have been in place for years will go up in smoke. Civil servants are racing against the clock to replace these relationships with something even more dazzling and befitting of modern ""Global Britain"". This week trade negotiators will pursue simultaneous talks with three key UK partners - the United States, Japan and European Union (EU). If they fail, businesses and households could pay a high - and very unwelcome - price. It's been called ""cherry-picking"" by Brussels. But the UK government would see its negotiations there as trying to replace its existing relationship with the EU with one that suits its needs better, while trying to avoid the imposition of tariffs where there are currently none. With the US, it's designing an arrangement from scratch. And in the case of Japan, it's simply replicating a deal that that country already has with the EU - with a few added extras, such as agreements on digital trade. Trade talks with Japan stumbled over cheese exports Trade deals aim to increase the choice of what's available from other countries - and lower prices. But that has to be balanced by protecting the needs of businesses at home. And this is the tricky bit. While the UK has managed to largely replicate the EU's deal with Japan, the issue of cheese, such as Stilton, has caused a stink. Britain wants better access for its cheese farmers; Japan isn't keen. Is this really worth the strife, given that Japan only buys about Â£2m worth of British cheese? Well, it's not about the current picture, but the potential for growth. Ditto the US and its chickens. America has made no secret of the fact that it wants its farmers to have a bigger presence on British plates. That's currently up for discussion, and may cause ructions. But what isn't being negotiated is a lowering of standards to American levels - such as the conditions in which chicken can be raised, the reason they're rinsed in chlorine. That responsibility falls to the UK Food Standards Agency. And hard to swallow in Brussels has been the UK's demand for the right to catch more fish in surrounding waters. Fishing makes up less than 0.2% of the UK economy - but, again, it's about the potential gains. And it's about keeping voters happy: trade deals are as political as they are economic. So even talks over small-fry matters mean trade deals take years to hammer out. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Ambitions that a deal with Japan, Britain's first major trophy in the Brexit era, could be sewn up by the end of July were dashed. And that's with a partner that accounts for just 2% of British exports. We're edging closer to the finish line, but it doesn't bode well for talks elsewhere. Meanwhile, hopes for a deal with the US, which buys almost a fifth of British exports, ahead of the November election have faded. Officials are now quietly pinning their hopes on an agreement by next spring. As for the EU, the continued impasse where there was once an aim of a deal by October has seen the chances of a no (trade) deal rise sharply. If there is no agreement by the end of the year, those countries' imports will face the same charges and rules as those from any other nation with which the UK doesn't have a deal. They'll have the new UK Global Tariff imposed on them. Crucially, that would mean that over half of good imports, by value, from the EU would face extra charges, compared with none at present. The biggest rises would be in the price of cars, and foods such as lamb and beef, where tariffs are being retained to protect British producers. The British Retail Consortium has warned of price hikes on staples from olive oil to cucumbers. Under a previous no-deal plan, the Office for Budget Responsibility reckoned the total cost of tariffs could mount into the billions - and that's with fewer tariffs than now envisaged. Those costs would be borne by businesses and households, squeezing budgets and the ability to create jobs, when the economy least needs it. And that's before taking into account the cost of planning for businesses and potential for delays at the border. PM defends planned Brexit deal changes What does Australia have to do with Brexit?

"A bust-up with Brussels was always a possible feature of this autumn. But when EU top brass and their officials arrived in London this morning, it was not inevitable that it would come today. There were whispers yesterday that one or other of the sides might flounce out - but ""wait and see"" seemed the order of the day. Late last night, chatter from sources in Brussels suggested they were unwilling to rise to what they see as the UK's provocation, to ""take the bait"", as it was expressed to me. EU ultimatum to UK over Brexit talks Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill But after two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. The chances therefore of talks, that matter so much to our economy, moving very far are almost zilch - and therefore the chances of a deal are falling away. Remember last autumn, day-after-day-after-day the language between the two sides became more heated, brinkmanship more risky, the government's moves more audacious, and then, suddenly, a deal was done. And despite the EU's extraordinary statement, and serious stumbling blocks in the talks, the UK chief negotiator, Lord Frost, has now announced that the trade talks will still go ahead next week. The added complication here is that the government can't be sure at all that their plans to change the Northern Irish parts of the existing treaty will pass through Parliament. Resistance in the Lords is inevitable and while it's hard to gauge the final number, there is likely to be a rebellion from Tory MPs too. But Downing Street right now is confident that MPs will back the plans in the end. Willing to forgo a trade deal - if that's what their changes mean - rather than back down on their plans, having chosen to take what insiders admit is a nuclear option, for now, they are willing to stand back and watch the explosion.

"The government has said it is willing to drop parts of a controversial piece of legislation - the Internal Market Bill - which had the potential to further complicate the already tense trade talks between the UK and the EU. It contains measures relating to the way trade will be done between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the future. They would only come into force if the UK and the EU failed to reach a trade deal. But they would overrule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement the UK signed with the EU last year. The House of Lordsvoted to remove the offending clausesfrom the bill in November but the House of Commons then voted to reinstate them. The government now says it is willing to withdraw them because of an ""agreement in principle"" on a range of issues affecting Northern Ireland. So, what is the controversy about? The withdrawal agreement (also known as the Brexit ""divorce deal"") includes a section - or protocol - on Northern Ireland, and it is now an international treaty. Article 4 of the agreement says the provisions of the treaty take legal precedence over anything in the UK's domestic law. So if any of the proposals in theInternal Market Bill,externalthat contradict the withdrawal agreement actually became law, it would breach the government's international obligations. That is what the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis referred to in September when he spoke about breaking international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". Breaking the law, though, is still breaking the law. The overall aim of the Northern Ireland protocol was to avoid the return of a ""hard"" land border between Northern Ireland, in the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, in the EU. All sides agreed they did not want the return of border checks - or other physical infrastructure - that could become a target. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? One of the solutions in the treaty was to keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 It promised to maintain unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK but also introduced new bureaucracy for trade across the Irish Sea. The way these measures will be implemented on the ground have been negotiated by UK and EU officials, who have been meeting in a joint committee for the past few months. If there was no agreement by the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020, and there was no free-trade deal, that is when parts of this new proposed legislation would have come into play. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. For example, the protocol states that companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) would have to fill out export declaration forms. But the government's Internal Market Bill would give ministers the right to overrule or ignore this part of EU customs law. Another part of the protocol says the UK has to follow EU rules on state aid - the financial support governments give to businesses - for goods related to Northern Ireland. But the Internal Market Bill would give ministers power to interpret what that means and says this should not be done in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice. The EU said this was trying to change parts of a recently-agreed international treaty unilaterally. And when the legislation was first published, US President-elect Joe Biden warned that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". But on 8 December, the UK and EU announced an""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts, the supply of food and medicines and clarification around state aid in Northern Ireland. As a result, the government said it would drop the controversial clauses in the bill. The Internal Market Bill only deals with trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, but the debate about goods moving in the opposite direction is equally sensitive. The protocol says the joint committee is supposed to determine which goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are ""at risk"" of being exported over the Irish border to the EU and should therefore have tariffs - taxes on imports - imposed on them. If there was no agreement between the two sides, then the default position would be tariffs paid on all goods. The UK had plans, due to be introduced in a Taxation Bill, to allow UK ministers to make unilateral decisions on which goods could be deemed as ""at risk"" - after 1 January. But, as a result of the ""agreement in principle"" - the government says these measures won't now be introduced. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The government has published proposals which could override parts of the Brexit withdrawal deal and breach international law. A major part of that deal concerned NI and preventing a hardening of the land border with the Republic of Ireland. At the end of the Brexit transition, NI will stay in the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK leaves. That means new checks and controls on the trading of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Both the UK and EU are committed to no new border checks on the island of Ireland However the details of those new controls are still being negotiated by the EU and UK through a body called the Joint Committee. The government says it is acting unilaterally to create a safety net in case thosenegotiations don't reach agreement. It is giving Northern Ireland businesses a guarantee they will have ""unfettered access"" to the rest of the UK. The EU has previously insisted that paperwork, known as an exit summary declaration, would be needed on NI to GB trade. It is also intending to narrow the scope of EU state aid rules in Northern Ireland. Brexit is back - and likely to get louder The 310-mile border at the heart of Brexit What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? State aid concerns the type and amount of government support that can be given to businesses. As they would still be in the EU single market, Northern Ireland firms would still be covered by EU rules. But GB-based businesses which trade in Northern Ireland could also be covered by these rules, something the UK government wants to prevent. Because the government would be unilaterally changing an international treaty. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted it would break the law in a ""very specific and limited way"". This video can not be played Brandon Lewis says Northern Ireland customs rules legislation do âbreak international law in a very specific and limited wayâ Previously, Canada deliberately broke obligations of United Nations anti-narcotics treaties so it could legalise cannabis. If it goes ahead, the UK could face proceedings at the European Court of Justice. They could also risk the trade talks, although EU sources have said they will not seek a suspension of the discussions. The government is insisting it wants to continue negotiating the Northern Ireland issues through the Joint Committee. So, in theory, if it gets what it wants in those talks, then it wouldn't have to act unilaterally. This will be regarded sceptically by the EU which sees the move as undermining the Joint Committee process. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen is ""very concerned"" by the UK government's intentions Anger, bemusement and concern. Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said, that in contrast to previous Brexit developments, he had received no warning of what the UK was planning. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen tweeted: ""Very concerned about announcements from the British government on its intentions to breach the Withdrawal Agreement. ""This would break international law and undermines trust"". Maros Sefcovic, the senior EU official on the Joint Committee, has called for an emergency meeting to discuss ""this very pressing, very urgent and very serious matter"".

"No more than six people from two households in the affected areas will be allowed to gather in a private garden Restrictions on visiting other households are to be reintroduced in parts of Northern Ireland after a rise in cases of coronavirus. The new rules affect people in Ballymena town, those who live in the Belfast council area and addresses with postcodes BT43, BT28 and BT29. Those postcodes take in areas north east of Ballymena, and parts of Glenavy, Lisburn and Crumlin. People cannot visit other people's homes, but there are some exemptions. The exemptions include: Those in a social bubble with one other household Those with caring responsibilities including childcare Essential maintenance Supported living arrangements Visits required for legal or medical purposes Marriage or civil partnerships where a person is terminally ill No more than six people from two households in the affected areas will be allowed to gather in a private garden. And people living in them are being advised not to travel outside the zones unless it is necessary. The measures, which mark the first series of localised restrictions to be imposed in Northern Ireland since the lockdown in March, will take effect next week and be in place for at least a fortnight. Northern Ireland currently has the UK's highest rate of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people. First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill outlined the restrictions as theyled their first joint press conference together at Stormontfor 73 days. Mrs Foster urged people living in the affected areas to ""please take action now and stop the spread of the virus"". Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill gave their first press conference together in more than two months ""There is a creeping of the virus across Northern Ireland and we need people to work with us to stop that,"" she stressed. The executive said it was asking medically vulnerable and older people living in the areas affected by the new restrictions to be ""particularly careful"" and follow all public health advice. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said hospitals and care homes in those areas would also be advised to limit visitors, with one family member being allowed to visit once a week. More frequent visits may be allowed only in ""exceptional circumstances"", but that will be reviewed, she added. ""We may also have to add postcodes to this as the situation develops,"" she said. Mrs Foster said the executive needed to limit social interactions between households in order to ""push down the rising curve of infection"" in the areas with the highest rates of the virus. The deputy first minister urged people outside of the affected areas ""not to think they are invincible or immune"". Ministers also agreed to provide about 600 pubs in Northern Ireland which do not serve food with a new indicative date to reopen. The executive agreed that drink-only pubs can provisionally reopen on 21 September, but this will have to be ratified closer to the time. Arlene Foster said at present the ""villain"" was in our homes, not in businesses where customer numbers were regulated Non-food pubs in the Republic of Ireland are also aiming to reopen on the same date but it is being kept under review. Prof Ian Young, NI's chief scientific adviser, told the press briefing he was satisfied the mitigations being taken by the hospitality industry would ensure it was safe to reopen. Mrs Foster said at present, the ""villain is not in businesses where numbers of customers are regulated"". ""It's in our homes - it is the house party, it is the dinner party - it is the few people coming around for drinks or coffee,"" she added. Hospitality Ulster said the decision to give pubs a new reopening date would ""help secure hundreds of businesses and thousands of jobs that have been hanging in the balance"". Bar the police turning up outside on a doorstep in a residential area, we are seeing that they are really clamping down on those large social gatherings that according to the data are happening in those BT areas and also in Belfast. They say that they can manage to enforce what is going on in bars and restaurants, that they are very happy with the behaviour, but really they can't manage what is going on inside houses and outside in gardens. It is similar to what happened in Glasgow a number of weeks ago. Obviously, Belfast is the most affected by this and people are being asked to really curtail going out; restricting how many people we can have in our back gardens and mixing between houses really is forbidden - but there are exemptions. Asked how the measures would be enforced, Mrs Foster said she ""hoped people will comply"". She said she did not want it to reach the stage that measures had to be strictly enforced, but the law would be in place. ""We're always very aware we're asking people to do things they would not ordinarily do,"" the first minister added. The executive has also agreed to set up a minister-led group to consider compliance and enforcement of the regulations, to ensure ""everyone follows the spirit and the letter of the law"". The executive also agreed to give the green light to soft play areas in Northern Ireland reopening from Monday. Q&A: What has and has not changed in NI lockdown? Q&A: What is yet to open in NI? The Department of Health says the current R number - or reproduction rate - of coronavirus in Northern Ireland is between 0.3 and 1.4. The R valueis the number of people that one infected person will pass a virus on to, on average, and if the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases very fast Chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young said although NI's R number estimate appeared lower than it has been in recent weeks, there had been a ""general increase in cases"". It was also announced that from 04:00 BST on Saturday, anyone arriving in NI from Portugal, Hungary, French Polynesia and RÃ©union will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Quarantine-free travel is still allowed from the Portuguese islands, the Azores and Madeira. Sweden will also be removed from the list of countries where quarantine measures are required. The Department of Health said it would continue to monitor the situation in all countries. All the announcements came as one more coronavirus-related death was recorded in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, with 79 new cases throughout NI also reported. That brings the total to 568 deaths and 8,035 cases. In the past seven days, there have been 177 new cases in the Belfast council area. In the Republic of Ireland, no further deaths were reported on Thursday, with the total remaining at 1,781. The Irish department of health revealed there had been 30,360 confirmed cases of the virus, after 196 more were recorded. What is yet to open in NI under Covid regulations?

"This video can not be played Smoke could be seen billowing out over the city's skyline Lebanon has launched an investigation into a huge fire at a warehouse storing aid that erupted in the port of Beirut - one month after a massive explosion there killed more than 190 people. The blaze broke out where an aid agency had been storing food and cooking oil. Firefighters and military officials spent hours battling the fire, using helicopters to drop water on it, before getting it under control on Thursday. No injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is not yet known. Footage shared on social media showed port workers running away as the fire broke out at the duty-free zone in the port on Thursday. The blaze sent a plume of dark smoke over the Lebanese capital. The head of Lebanon's Red Cross, George Kettaneh, said some people were suffering from shortness of breath, but there were no reports of injuries. Red Cross Regional Director Fabrizio Carboni said the warehouse stocked thousands of food parcels. He added that the humanitarian operation is atrisk of serious disruption,external. The area around the fire was cordoned off to prevent it from spreading. Civil defence director general Raymond Khattar told the state-run National News Agency that those working to extinguish the fire would not leave ""until the flames are fully quenched."" By the evening, officials said most flames had been extinguished. The fire sent a plume of dark smoke over the Lebanese capital The fire broke out just over a month after a huge explosion in the Lebanese capital, which was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonating at a warehouse in the port. In addition to the fatalities, thousands were injured and as many as 300,000 left homeless by the 4 August explosion. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how last month's explosion ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt Despite assurances from officials on Thursday that the situation was under control, some residents, still traumatised by last month's explosion, drove out of the city. ""I am forced to get them out of Beirut from the smoke and the fire that is happening at the port again,"" Majed Hassanein, who was leaving with his wife and children, told Reuters news agency. Others described how the fire brought back memories of the explosion. ""For sure we were scared... it's only been a month since the explosion that destroyed Beirut. We saw the same thing happening again,"" said 53-year-old Andre Muarbes. The Lebanese army announced in a tweet on Thursday that military police had begun an investigation into the blaze. Port director Bassem al-Qaisi earlier told the Voice of Lebanon radio station that the fire started in a warehouse where barrels of cooking oil were being stored, and then spread to tyres nearby. ""It is too early to know if it is the result of heat or some other mistake,"" he said. Michel Najjar, the public works minister with the outgoing government, told local media outlets that initial indications suggested the blaze was started by repair work at the port. Firefighters spent hours battling the blaze But he said full details on what happened would not be clear until a ""comprehensive study"" had been completed. In a meeting with top officials on Thursday, President Michel Aoun said the fire could have been the result of sabotage, a technical error or negligence. ""In all cases, the cause must be known as soon as possible and the perpetrators held to account,"" Mr Aoun was quoted as saying by the presidential Twitter account.

"Sister Bliss from dance act Faithless has said UK nightclubs have been ""left to rot in a corner"" amid the pandemic. The government says clubs must stay shut ""in line with current scientific advice to control the virus"". The musician and DJ told BBC Radio 6 Music club culture should be better protected. ""There's a lack of leadership at the top which means certain industries have been given support and then others have been completely ignored,"" she said. ""The electronic music scene and clubbing is definitely an incredible part of our cultural and economic force, and it travels all over the world globally. ""We really, I think, have been left to rot in a corner, so it's good to see that venues and artists are trying to galvanise it - with the Let the Music Play movement - trying to bring the plight of venues and freelancers, like myself, to the fore."" Indie stars discuss music careers in the time of Covid Stars back plea to support UK live music industry The Let the Music Play campaign saw 1,500 artists signan open letter,externalin July calling for support for the UK's music scene. ""All we can do is keep waving a flag and saying, 'We want support as well,'"" she told 6 Music's Georgie Rogers. Faithless performed at the BBC Music Awards in 2015 The government has announced a Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, but there is uncertainty over how far this money will stretch and where it will go. Sister Bliss's comments come on6 Music's State of the Independents Day on Thursday, looking into the effects of the pandemic on the independent music sector. In response, a government spokesman said: ""We know this is an incredibly difficult time for nightclubs, but they will need to remain closed for now in line with current scientific advice to control the virus. ""We continue to engage with industry representative and listen to their concerns. ""Throughout the pandemic, nightclubs have access to the government's unprecedented package of support to help businesses, which includes business rates relief, tax deferrals, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and billions paid in loans and grants."" While clubbing as we know it remains off the cards, some venues have been able to diversify in a bid to stay open and survive. Venues like Brixton Jamm and Escape to Freight Island in Manchester have been able to move things outside and host seated, socially distanced events with strict rules. Meanwhile, virtual clubbing has boomed, with DJs moving their sets online via social media or platforms like Boiler Room and United We Stream. Last week, the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA,external) lent its support to The Global Nighttime Recovery Plan, which is looking at the ""the future of dancefloor"" by proposing flexible and open clubbing experiences. NTIA boss Michael Kill told BBC News the night time economy was ""on a cliff edge"", with furlough coming to an end soon. A government scheme meaning no business can be evicted for missing rent payments is also ending this month. At the end of July, a survey of the association's members suggested that 58% fear they will not survive longer than two months without further government support. And 71% were already set to make more than half of their workforces redundant in a matter of weeks. ""We need the government to recognise the critical position the sector is in across the UK and work expediently to release a roadmap,"" Mr Kill said. ""But also act quickly to put a sector specific financial package together which will allow these businesses to survive and save jobs.""

"The new coronavirus rules in England banning social gatherings of more than six people will not be kept in place ""any longer than we have to"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. ""This sacrifice is vital to control the virus for the long term,"" he told MPs. The law comes into force on Monday and will be enforced through a Â£100 fine. Mr Hancock was also heckled by some MPs as he spoke about the government's plans for mass coronavirus testing,after concerns it was unrealistic. Scientists and health professionals have said the technology for the government's plan for more rapid tests ""does not, as yet, exist"", and there are already issues with laboratory capacity. On Thursday, the UK recorded another 2,919 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the fifth consecutive day that the figure has been more than 2,000. Another 14 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out the new ""rule of six"" on Wednesday as part of measures intended to halt the rise in cases. It applies both indoors and outdoors and to all ages - although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work. On Thursday,Scotland changed its rules on socialisingto a maximum of six people inside and outside - but unlike England they must be from two households, and children under 12 are exempt. What are the new rules? The new rules in Scotland ""As the chief medical officer said yesterday, we must learn from the recent experience of countries like Belgium who successfully put in place these measures to combat a similar rise in infections,"" said Mr Hancock in Parliament on Thursday. ""These are not measures that we take lightly. I understand that for many they'll mean changing long-awaited plans or missing out on precious moments with loved ones, but this sacrifice is vital to control the virus for the long term and save lives. ""And I vow that we will not keep these rules in place for any longer than we have to."" Earlier, Mr Hancock's colleague, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, said if everybody followed the rules ""we may well be by Christmas in a position to look at it again"". Former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson said it will take about ""two to three weeks"" to see what effect the social distancing measures have. ""So we need to wait at this point and see how much we flatten the curve and then if that's not sufficient to bring the reproduction number below one, so the epidemic starts shrinking again, then yes, we may need to clamp down on other areas,"" he added. Prof Ferguson - whose advice to the prime minister led to the UK lockdown - said it was unavoidable that the virus would resurge in all age groups. And asked about the government's push to get people to return to work, Prof Ferguson added: ""Certainly I think we should hesitate and maybe pause at the headlong rush to get everybody back into offices. ""But some people have to work and I completely understand the concerns in many quarters that everybody working at home has an economic impact, particularly on city centres."" This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Social gatherings of more than six people in England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors,and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces,to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includes protests and political activities subject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance People who ignore the policecould be fined Â£100- doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 Mr Hancock was also asked about the government's testing plan. The next immediate goal for the government is to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. Currently, testing capacity is being reported as 350,000 a day - which includes swab tests (which check if you have the virus currently) and antibody tests (which check if someone has already had the virus). But the government is also planning ""Operation Moonshot"" - which aims to see millions of tests processed every day. This would involve using a new type of test, which is not yet rolled out, involving swabs or saliva and can give results in 90 or even 20 minutes. In many ways the focus is on how long the new rules may last and the ""Operation Moonshot"" plans for mass rapid testing are a distraction from the difficult decisions the country faces. Despite the recent rises, infection rates remain low. But they will continue to go up. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and fact people are indoors more. That will soon translate into more hospitalisations and, sadly, more deaths. This happens every year with flu. The worst winter of recent years, 2017-18, saw close to an extra 50,000 deaths. When the first signs of that happens, ministers will then have to decide what to do next. They could choose more restrictions to try to curb the spread of the virus in the knowledge these will damage people's health in other ways as well as harming education and the economy. Or they let the virus spread, while focusing efforts on protecting the vulnerable - more than 90% of deaths have been among the over 65s with half among the over 85s. Clearly that will mean putting more protections in place around care homes, perhaps by banning visitors, as well as considering reintroducing shielding. Lockdown bought us time, but simply deferred the problem. Progress has been made in the past six months - there are better treatments, more testing and a network of contact tracers - but maybe not as much as hoped. The UK, like all nations, faces a tricky act of balancing harms. Mr Hancock was heckled by some opposition MPs as he outlined ""Moonshot"", responding: ""I'm absolutely determined that we will get there. ""And if everything comes together, and if the technology comes off, it'll be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to get closer to normal before Christmas."" He said the approach was being piloted and steps are being taken to verify the new technology ahead of a desired nationwide roll-out. This video can not be played Jonathan Ashworth asked Matt Hancock for more clarity over mass testing Earlier, the chairman of the British Medical Association Dr Chaand Nagpaulsaid it was unclearhow Operation Moonshot would work - given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. And other scientists warned of the dangers of false negatives and false positives. On Thursday, Scotlandlaunched its new contact tracing app,with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urging as many people as possible to download it. The contact tracing app being developed in England ran into technical problems and is currently being tested following a revamp. Meanwhile, the latest figures for England's Test and Trace programme showed mixed performance. There has been a slight improvement in turnaround times for testing - results for people who go to testing centres and mobile units are being done in 23 and 20 hours respectively on average - two weeks ago both had crept over 24 hours. But for the second week in a row contact tracers were only able to reach under 70% of the close contacts of people who are infected - well below the 80% target. Dr Layla McCay of the NHS Confederation said the figures were a ""cause for serious alarm"". In other developments: The number of peoplewho have died with the virus globallyreaches 900,000 A new law will also require businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas to record customers' contact details and keep them for 21 days The governmenthas published its coronavirus guidancefor universities ahead of students returning later this month, with full online learning only as a last resort The disruption to hospitals in England during the pandemic has meant the number of patients facing long waits for routine operations has soared,new figures show Conservative minister Jacob Rees-Moggis self-isolating at homeafter one of his children showed symptoms of coronavirus SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

"Thousands of students are preparing to return to university after the coronavirus lockdown Universities should switch to full online learning only as a last resort in the event of a local coronavirus outbreak, new guidance says. The hundreds of thousands of students due to arrive at England's universities in the coming weeks also face a ban on house parties under the ""rule of six"". Students must limit socialising, staying within separate ""households"", and be taught in managed groups. The mass return of students raises the risk of outbreaks, the guidance says. The academics' union said it would be safer to switch most teaching online this term and allow students to return only when virus levels were lower. Manchester students warned off club nights 'I paid for my student house, now lectures are online' 'Critical moment' as students return to university UCU general secretary Jo Grady added: ""Any country with a infection rate anywhere near that of our young people would be removed from the safe travel list. ""We cannot see why the government is insisting young people move around the country and engage in unnecessary face-to-face interactions. ""Moving learning online would remove the need for universities to consider teaching outside or opening doors and windows in the winter months as the guidance suggests."" But the Department for Education guidance reiterates the current position that courses will be provided using a blend of face-to-face and online learning, unless an outbreak occurs locally. Where social distancing cannot be maintained, teaching sessions will be via technology or moved to more spacious premises. The DfE also stressed there was no evidence face-to-face teaching was unsafe, as long as Covid precautions were maintained. And it highlighted government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advice online-only teaching ""would have an impact on students' mental health."" ""Universities have been making a mammoth effort to safely reopen campuses and buildings to students this autumn,"" Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said. ""And the government has worked closely with them."" Campuses have been closed since March and Sage suggests the university return ""could amplify local and national transmission"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:What tests are available? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""Many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently. ""My message to students is simple, 'Please, for the sake of your education and your parents' and your grandparents' health, wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don't socially gather in groups of more than six, now and when term starts."" He added the updated guidance for universities on ""how they can operate in a Covid-secure way"" included a ""clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country"". The guidance also asks universities to identify ""safer social activities"" for students and create Covid-secure campus bars and students' unions where they can socialise. And the government expects the universities to use incentives to encourage students to comply with social-distancing measures and disciplinary measures for serious breaches. Vice-chancellors' group Universities UK said they had been working very hard to put Covid-secure safety measures in place. Chief executive Alistair Jarvis said: ""Life across society will be different this autumn, with university life no exception, with differences to previous years. ""However, students can look forward to a high-quality, rewarding and enjoyable experience."" All universities are also required to plan for a tiered response, depending on the level of risk in the area. a mix of face-to-face tuition and online lessons masks worn in crowded corridors and communal areas increased online learning face-to-face tuition only where possible and necessary - for example, clinical or practical learning or research face-to-face tuition for priority courses such as medicine only students advised not to return to family homes university buildings closed to everyone except key workers those conducting essential research The guidance comes as Exeter University signed a contract for tens of thousands of potential saliva tests this academic year. The results will be provided within 24 hours and fed into the NHS Test and Trace system. Some other universities, including Leicester, Cambridge and East Anglia, are offering voluntary swab tests to staff and students.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you on Friday morning. Travellers arriving in England from mainland Portugalwill have to self-isolate for two weeks from Saturday,just three weeks after the country was removed from the list of those requiring quarantine. However, holidaymakers returning from the Portuguese islands - the Azores and Madeira - will not have to self-isolate. Sweden has also now been added to England, Scotland andWales' safe lists.Here's a reminder ofwhich countries are on the UK's various quarantine lists. In a normal year, more than a million UK tourists visit Portugal's Algarve coast Scotland has followed England inlimiting the number of people who can meet togetherto six people. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the six can be from no more than two households, but children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total. Meanwhile in England, the new rules will not be kept in place""any longer than we have to"",Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. There has been a significant rise in the number of patients in Englandfacing long waits to have routine operationsbecause of the disruption in hospitals caused by Covid-19. More than two million people due to have procedures have been waiting more than 18 weeks -  the highest since records began in 2007. Sister Bliss from dance act Faithless says the dormant dance music scene needs more protection during the pandemic. The musician and DJ told the BBC that UK nightclubshave been ""left to rot in a corner""but added that ""all we can do is keep waving a flag and saying 'we want support as well'"".

"Citigroup has named a woman to be its new chief executive in a first for a Wall Street bank. Briton Jane Fraser, its current president and head of global consumer division, is to become its new boss when current chief Michael Corbat retires in February. He is stepping down after 37 years at the bank, including eight as leader. It comes as the male-dominated world of US finance faces pressure to diversify its ranks. Scotland-born Ms Fraser has worked at Citi for 16 years, serving in her current role since 2019. She oversees business in 19 countries and previously led its Latin America division. Seen as a rising star, she was recently considered for the role of chief executive at Wells Fargo, another top US bank. The chair of Citi's board of directors, John Dugan, said Ms Fraser would take the bank ""to the next level"". ""She has deep experience across our lines of business and regions and we are highly confident in her,"" he said. Firms with more female executives 'perform better' Last year, Royal Bank of Scotland named Alison Rose as its first female chief executive, making her the first woman to run any of the big four banks in the UK. But just 31 women held the top spots at major American companies listed on the S&P 500 index at the end of 2019, none of which were banks. At a congressional hearing last year, the heads of seven of America's biggest banks, including current Citi boss Mr Corbat, were questioned about the lack of diversity and asked if they believed they would be succeeded by a woman or person of colour. None said yes. At Citi, Ms Fraser has frequently been charged with turning around troubled parts of the bank, the fourth largest in the US. She worked in its mortgage division following the financial crisis and was put in charge in Latin America after a scandal in its bank in Mexico. She is poised to take charge as the bank grapples with the economic fallout of the pandemic. In the most recent quarter, Citi's profits plunged 73% as it set aside more than $7bn to cover potential losses. Ms Fraser, whose compensation was $12.5m (Â£9.7m) last year, has said being a good leader means setting a vision, having the courage to make ""tough calls"", and asking questions. Born in St Andrews, Scotland, she has degrees from Harvard Business School and Cambridge University. The 53-year-old started her career at Goldman Sachs in London, joining Citi after rising to be a partner at consulting giant McKinsey.

"Thousands of students are preparing to return to university after the coronavirus lockdown Universities should switch to full online learning only as a last resort in the event of a local coronavirus outbreak, new guidance says. The hundreds of thousands of students due to arrive at England's universities in the coming weeks also face a ban on house parties under the ""rule of six"". Students must limit socialising, staying within separate ""households"", and be taught in managed groups. The mass return of students raises the risk of outbreaks, the guidance says. The academics' union said it would be safer to switch most teaching online this term and allow students to return only when virus levels were lower. Manchester students warned off club nights 'I paid for my student house, now lectures are online' 'Critical moment' as students return to university UCU general secretary Jo Grady added: ""Any country with a infection rate anywhere near that of our young people would be removed from the safe travel list. ""We cannot see why the government is insisting young people move around the country and engage in unnecessary face-to-face interactions. ""Moving learning online would remove the need for universities to consider teaching outside or opening doors and windows in the winter months as the guidance suggests."" But the Department for Education guidance reiterates the current position that courses will be provided using a blend of face-to-face and online learning, unless an outbreak occurs locally. Where social distancing cannot be maintained, teaching sessions will be via technology or moved to more spacious premises. The DfE also stressed there was no evidence face-to-face teaching was unsafe, as long as Covid precautions were maintained. And it highlighted government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advice online-only teaching ""would have an impact on students' mental health."" ""Universities have been making a mammoth effort to safely reopen campuses and buildings to students this autumn,"" Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said. ""And the government has worked closely with them."" Campuses have been closed since March and Sage suggests the university return ""could amplify local and national transmission"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:What tests are available? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""Many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently. ""My message to students is simple, 'Please, for the sake of your education and your parents' and your grandparents' health, wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don't socially gather in groups of more than six, now and when term starts."" He added the updated guidance for universities on ""how they can operate in a Covid-secure way"" included a ""clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country"". The guidance also asks universities to identify ""safer social activities"" for students and create Covid-secure campus bars and students' unions where they can socialise. And the government expects the universities to use incentives to encourage students to comply with social-distancing measures and disciplinary measures for serious breaches. Vice-chancellors' group Universities UK said they had been working very hard to put Covid-secure safety measures in place. Chief executive Alistair Jarvis said: ""Life across society will be different this autumn, with university life no exception, with differences to previous years. ""However, students can look forward to a high-quality, rewarding and enjoyable experience."" All universities are also required to plan for a tiered response, depending on the level of risk in the area. a mix of face-to-face tuition and online lessons masks worn in crowded corridors and communal areas increased online learning face-to-face tuition only where possible and necessary - for example, clinical or practical learning or research face-to-face tuition for priority courses such as medicine only students advised not to return to family homes university buildings closed to everyone except key workers those conducting essential research The guidance comes as Exeter University signed a contract for tens of thousands of potential saliva tests this academic year. The results will be provided within 24 hours and fed into the NHS Test and Trace system. Some other universities, including Leicester, Cambridge and East Anglia, are offering voluntary swab tests to staff and students.

"Cases in Portugal have been rising since the country was made exempt from UK quarantine on 22 August Travellers from mainland Portugal to Englandwill have to quarantine,externalfrom 04:00 BST on Saturday, just weeks after the country was put on the safe list. Wales and Scotland had already imposed the mandatory two weeks of self-isolation earlier this month. Quarantine-free travel is still allowed from the Portuguese islands, the Azores and Madeira. Meanwhile, Sweden has been madeexempt from quarantine for Wales, England and Scotland. People travelling to England, Wales and Scotland from Hungary and Reunion will also be required to self-isolate, while England is additionally requiring arrivals from French Polynesia to quarantine. Hungary has a seven-day rate of 31.6 infections per 100,000 people and French Polynesia's rate is 71.3. Portugal, one of the UK's most popular holiday destinations, was given an exemption from UK quarantine rules as recently as 22 August. But since then the infection level has been rising. It now has 28.3 infections per 100,000 people, above the threshold of 20 per 100,000 people which the UK generally uses for adding countries to the quarantine list. Portugal expressed ""regret"" over the quarantine decision for the mainland, but said it valued the continued inclusion of the Azores and Madeira on the safe ""travel corridor"" list. It comes as the UK's confirmed coronavirus cases rose by another 2,919, the fifth consecutive day that the figure has been more than 2,000. Another 14 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that because of ""enhanced data"" the government was able to assess the infection rates of islands separate to their mainland countries. On Wednesday,quarantine requirements were also imposed on seven Greek islands, the first time that different self-isolation rules had been applied to the mainland of a country and its islands. Mr Shapps also stressed that travellers must fill out the Passenger Locator Form on arrival to the UK, a day after the prime minister said enforcement of this part of the quarantine rules would be stepped up. Differences in UK quarantine rules 'confusing' Can I be fined if I break quarantine rules? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? ""It is a criminal offence not to complete the form and spot checks will be taking place,"" Mr Shapps said. Figures show that nearly 2m spot checks have been carried out to ensure travellers have filled out the form, and calls and text messages were made to 136,500 people to check they were quarantining. Successful contact, where the traveller has been spoken to or responded to a text, was made 66,773 times with 64,800 people confirming they were self-isolating. Just 34 fines have been issued. HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? TRAVEL:What are the UK's rules? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? TRAVEL RIGHTS:Can I get a holiday refund? Travel industry body Abta, along with the chief executives of airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways, is calling on the government to introduce testing on arrival at airports and to change quarantine policy so mainland regions can be treated differently. ""Every country, mainland or island that is taken off the government's travel list lessens the ability of travel businesses to operate and increases the necessity for the government to provide tailored industry support,"" said an Abta spokesman. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said holidaymakers were now ""more acutely aware"" of the risks of travel abroad, but said the ""last-minute"" decisions meant many missed out on refunds or were ""extorted"" with additional airfares if they tried to rush home. ""It's obvious that the current travel corridor system is not working for passengers, and becoming completely detrimental to the already dwindling trust in the sector,"" he said. Sweden adopted a lighter-touch strategy for dealing with the pandemic compared with most other European countries, deciding not to institute a widespread lockdown, and putting in place relatively few restrictions. This was based partly on the idea of letting Covid-19 sweep through the population creating so-called herd immunity. Such an approach was considered but then abandoned in the UK. Research published in August suggestedexposure to coronavirus was similar in Stockholm and London, based on antibody tests, despite the different lockdown strategies.

"This video can not be played Scotland sets 'rule of six' for people meeting up The number of people allowed to meet up in Scotland has been cut to six amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic ""accelerating"". It came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a ""tightening and extension"" of lockdown rules. Changes planned for next week have been put back until at least 5 October. It means that theatres, live music venues, indoor soft play facilities and indoor contact sports will not now open next Monday. Until now, eight people from three households had been allowed to meet indoors in Scotland, and up to 15 from five households outdoors. This will change to six people from two households, and will apply both indoors and outdoors - including in homes, gardens, pubs and restaurants. Children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, however. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland What are the latest lockdown rules in Scotland? New Scottish contact tracing app goes live The changes also mean spectators will not be able to return to sports stadia and other venues over the next three weeks - although two pilot events due take place at the weekend will still happen. Scotland is currently recording three times more positive cases of the virus on average each day than it was three weeks ago - with a further 161 cases being logged on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon said the spread of the virus was accelerating - albeit from a low base and not as rapidly as it was back in March and April. She said this was ""not entirely unexpected"" given the recent steps to reopen the economy - but that further planned moves to lift lockdown had to be put on pause for now. The first minister said: ""Right now, given the rise in cases, it's the only responsible decision we can reach."" Ms Sturgeon also said the reopening of offices and call centres will ""definitely not take place"" before October, saying that ""for now, working from home will remain the default position"". The move to cut the number of people who can meet followsa similar move announced for Englandon Wednesday. There will be ""limited exceptions"" to the rules for organised sports, places of worship and wedding and funeral services - which will be capped at 20 guests. The new limits will officially come into force on Monday, although Ms Sturgeon said that she was asking people to immediately abide by the stricter new limits on gatherings. Scotland's music industry has warned many venues may not survive the coronavirus lockdown It will also become mandatory for staff working in hospitality premises such as pubs and restaurants to wear face coverings, and for customers to wear them while moving around. Ms Sturgeon admitted the new announcements would be ""hard for people to hear"", but said they were necessary. She said the rise in new cases was ""not as rapid as it was earlier in the year"" and that prevalence of the virus was lower ""thanks to the individual sacrifices that so any of you have made for the greater good"". She said: ""We have grounds for cautious hope, but we have no grounds for complacency. It is vital to do everything we can to stop cases rising further before winter. ""These steps are necessary to help curb a virus that we know spreads rapidly whenever it gets the chance."" She insisted that the Test and Protect contact tracing system was ""working well"", adding that without this ""the virus would be spreading further and faster, and we would require to apply much stricter lockdown measures again"". The Scottish Conservatives asked the government to consider moving more towards a strategy of mass community testing to complement Test and Protect. The party's Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, said: ""Experts have said that mass community testing must also be part of the solution, if we are going to succeed in keeping the virus supressed through the winter. ""I would also urge the government to continue their work with Scotland's airports on a testing regime. ""The aviation sector needs all the help it can get, and stopping the virus will only be possible if we reach everyone coming into the country who may need to quarantine.""

"Greenpeace says some destination countries don't use sufficient protective equipment The UK approved the export of more than 32,000 tonnes of banned pesticides in 2018, according to environmental campaign group Greenpeace. The shipments were among 81,615 tonnes of banned ""crop protection products"" planned by British and other European companies that year. Under EU law, firms are still permitted to make and export chemicals whose use is restricted within the bloc itself. Greenpeace used freedom of information requests to unearth the data. This was contained in hundreds of documents. The group said almost 40% of planned exports by weight came from the UK. The next-highest exporter was Italy, with 11% of planned exports, or 9,350 tonnes. Greenpeace described the trade as ""exploitative hypocrisy"" and demanded the UK government put an end to it. The campaign group's chief scientist, Doug Parr, said the UK should stop the manufacture and export of all banned pesticides and ""pressure the EU to do the same and close this loophole for good"". Some critics in importing nations claimed the practice was a ""double standard"" that placed a lower value on lives and ecosystems in poorer countries. ""Even though the climate is different, our bodies are made from the same matter,"" said Alan Tygel, spokesperson for the Permanent Campaign Against Pesticides and for Life, a Brazilian umbrella group of social movements and NGOs. ""Substances that are dangerous for Europeans, are also dangerous for Brazilians, Indians, Argentinians, and so on."" The majority of the exports notified from the UK (28,185 tonnes) were mixtures containing paraquat, a weedkiller that has been banned in the EU since 2007. Paraquat is manufactured in Huddersfield by the biotech company Syngenta. It is a very effective weedkiller that is widely used around the world but in concentrated doses can be very toxic. It is often used in suicides, and scientists are investigating evidence of links between repeated exposure to the chemical and Parkinson's disease. Syngenta told the BBC it followed the law in every country in which it operates. It said different parts of the world grew different crops in different climates with different weeds and other pests, and therefore needed different chemicals. ""It is very common that crop protection chemicals produced in countries where we have manufacturing plants are not necessarily registered or sold there,"" it said. Almost half of the UK's 2018 paraquat shipments (14,000 tonnes) were destined for the United States, where Syngenta faces lawsuits from farmers who allege the weedkiller gave them Parkinson's disease. But exports were also planned to low- and middle-income nations including Brazil, Mexico, India, Colombia, Ecuador, and South Africa, where protective equipment is less commonly used and government regulation on the use of dangerous chemicals is not so rigorous. The other significant exports of banned pesticides notified from the UK in 2018 included up to 4,000 tonnes of the soil fumigant 1,3-Dichloropropene, produced by a subsidiary of the chemicals giant Ineos, which is majority owned by billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, one of the richest individuals in the UK. 1,3-Dichloropropene is classified as a probable carcinogen. It remains banned in the EU because of concerns related to consumer exposure, as well as risks of ""groundwater contamination"" and risks for ""birds, mammals, aquatic organisms and other non-target organisms"". Ineos told the BBC the only exports of 1,3 Dicholoropropene from the UK were to Japan. It said that all shipments of the product followed strict European rules on the export of dangerous chemicals. In addition, the company said 1,3 Dicholoropropene helped to protect important food crops from disease and was ""still used in European Union countries but only under emergency procedures which are subject to national approvals"".

"The EU is demanding the UK ditches plans to change Boris Johnson's Brexit deal ""by the end of the month"" or risk jeopardising trade talks. The UK has published a bill to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement it signed in January. The EU said this had ""seriously damaged trust"" and it would not be ""shy"" of taking legal action against the UK. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK had made it ""perfectly clear"" it would not withdraw the bill. The government says Parliament is sovereign and can pass laws which breach the UK's international treaty obligations. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""trust and confidence are and will be key"", after the latest round of UK-EU trade talks wrapped up in London on Thursday. His UK counterpart David Frost said ""significant"" differences remained over a free trade deal, but added discussions would continue in Brussels next week. Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans Chicken, cheese, cod: The tricky trade talk menu The source of the EU's concern is Mr Johnson's proposed Internal Market Bill,which was published on Wednesday,external. It addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The bill proposes no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. It gives UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The publication of the bill prompted emergency talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and Maros Å efÄoviÄ, the European Commission Vice-President. After two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage, however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. Read more from Laura here. Following the discussions, the EU issued a strongly-worded statement warning that the withdrawal agreement was a legal obligation, adding that ""neither the EU nor the UK can unilaterally change, clarify, amend, interpret, disregard or disapply the agreement"". The EU rejected the UK's arguments that the bill is designed to protect peace in Northern Ireland arguing that ""it does the opposite"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that if the bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an ""extremely serious violation"" of the withdrawal agreement and of international law. He urged the government to withdraw the bill ""by the end of the month"", adding that the withdrawal agreement ""contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text - which the European Union will not be shy in using"". Germany's UK ambassador said he had not experienced ""such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation"" in his diplomatic career. ""If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don't accept it,"" hetweeted,external. Michael Gove arrives at the Cabinet Office ahead of talks with EU officials In its response, the UK government said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""in the difficult and highly exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations. Parliament would not be acting unconstitutionally in enacting such legislation. ""Treaty obligations only become binding to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation. Whether to enact or repeal legislation, and the content of that legislation, is for Parliament and Parliament alone."" Mr Gove ""said that, during the talks, he had ""made it perfectly clear that we would not be withdrawing this legislation"", adding that the government was ""absolutely serious"". The Internal Market Bill will be formally debated by MPs in Parliament for the first time on Monday, 14 September. It has come under increasing criticism from Conservative parliamentarians. Former party leader Lord Howard said it would damage the UK's ""reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law"", while former Chancellor Lord Lamont asked ministers to ""think again"". But Mr Gove said: ""I'm looking forward to the second reading of the bill next week. It's an opportunity for the government to set out in detail why we have this legislation."" He promised to fight for ""unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson has defended the bill, saying it would ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales, while protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. But critics say the move will damage the UK's international reputation aftera minister admitted the plans break international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". Meanwhile, the latest round of formal talks over a post-Brexit trade deal concluded in London on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, Mr Barnier said the EU had ""shown flexibility"" in an effort to ""find solutions"", but the UK had not ""not engaged"" on some ""major issues"". For the UK side, Lord Frost said ""challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant"". He said the UK negotiators ""remain committed"" to reaching a deal by the middle of October and officials would ""continue discussions"" next week.

Covid rule-breakers are now ""increasingly likely"" to be finedby officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said. The police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live If you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. Since March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. In England and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200. Fines start at Â£60in Wales,external, andin Scotland,external, although this is reduced to Â£30 if paid within 28 days. Large parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. In extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. Hundreds of people were caught on a drone camera at an illegal party by West Midlands Police Yes. All of England is now in a ""tier four"" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. Under the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. The government's lockdown guidance sets outexamples of reasonable excuses,external. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. There are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. If you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action. Exercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising. But there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough. There are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has beencriticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Streetto go cycling during lockdown. There are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? If you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. The police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records.

"The EU is demanding the UK ditches plans to change Boris Johnson's Brexit deal ""by the end of the month"" or risk jeopardising trade talks. The UK has published a bill to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement it signed in January. The EU said this had ""seriously damaged trust"" and it would not be ""shy"" of taking legal action against the UK. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK had made it ""perfectly clear"" it would not withdraw the bill. The government says Parliament is sovereign and can pass laws which breach the UK's international treaty obligations. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""trust and confidence are and will be key"", after the latest round of UK-EU trade talks wrapped up in London on Thursday. His UK counterpart David Frost said ""significant"" differences remained over a free trade deal, but added discussions would continue in Brussels next week. Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans Chicken, cheese, cod: The tricky trade talk menu The source of the EU's concern is Mr Johnson's proposed Internal Market Bill,which was published on Wednesday,external. It addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The bill proposes no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. It gives UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The publication of the bill prompted emergency talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and Maros Å efÄoviÄ, the European Commission Vice-President. After two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage, however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. Read more from Laura here. Following the discussions, the EU issued a strongly-worded statement warning that the withdrawal agreement was a legal obligation, adding that ""neither the EU nor the UK can unilaterally change, clarify, amend, interpret, disregard or disapply the agreement"". The EU rejected the UK's arguments that the bill is designed to protect peace in Northern Ireland arguing that ""it does the opposite"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that if the bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an ""extremely serious violation"" of the withdrawal agreement and of international law. He urged the government to withdraw the bill ""by the end of the month"", adding that the withdrawal agreement ""contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text - which the European Union will not be shy in using"". Germany's UK ambassador said he had not experienced ""such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation"" in his diplomatic career. ""If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don't accept it,"" hetweeted,external. Michael Gove arrives at the Cabinet Office ahead of talks with EU officials In its response, the UK government said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""in the difficult and highly exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations. Parliament would not be acting unconstitutionally in enacting such legislation. ""Treaty obligations only become binding to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation. Whether to enact or repeal legislation, and the content of that legislation, is for Parliament and Parliament alone."" Mr Gove ""said that, during the talks, he had ""made it perfectly clear that we would not be withdrawing this legislation"", adding that the government was ""absolutely serious"". The Internal Market Bill will be formally debated by MPs in Parliament for the first time on Monday, 14 September. It has come under increasing criticism from Conservative parliamentarians. Former party leader Lord Howard said it would damage the UK's ""reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law"", while former Chancellor Lord Lamont asked ministers to ""think again"". But Mr Gove said: ""I'm looking forward to the second reading of the bill next week. It's an opportunity for the government to set out in detail why we have this legislation."" He promised to fight for ""unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson has defended the bill, saying it would ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales, while protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. But critics say the move will damage the UK's international reputation aftera minister admitted the plans break international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". Meanwhile, the latest round of formal talks over a post-Brexit trade deal concluded in London on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, Mr Barnier said the EU had ""shown flexibility"" in an effort to ""find solutions"", but the UK had not ""not engaged"" on some ""major issues"". For the UK side, Lord Frost said ""challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant"". He said the UK negotiators ""remain committed"" to reaching a deal by the middle of October and officials would ""continue discussions"" next week.

"British Airways owner IAG is cutting more flights over the next three months as it adjusts to the continuing collapse in demand for air travel. IAG, which also runs Aer Lingus and Iberia, said quarantine restrictions meant capacity this autumn would be 60% below 2019 levels. The group said it had seen a ""delayed recovery"", and did not expect business to return to 2019 levels until 2023. IAG also said BA had reached the outline of a jobs agreement with Unite. The union has been in a bitter dispute with BA over redundancies and pay cuts for cabin crew. BA has already reached a separate deal with pilots. The airline, which is aiming to shed up to 13,000 jobs, said that by the end of August some 8,236 employees had left the business, ""mostly as a result of voluntary redundancy"". Unite stressed its cabin crew members still needed to approve the plan through a ballot and that negotiations remained ongoing. ""Unless and until Unite members agree to all and any proposals, no settlement has been reached and it is unhelpful and misleading for British Airways to suggest otherwise,"" said assistant general secretary Howard Beckett. IAG's decision to cut more flights than planned follows its previous forecast of a 46% reduction for the October-to-December period compared with the same quarter last year. Virgin Atlantic to cut 1,150 more jobs Gatwick Airport plans 600 jobs cuts It said it had seen an ""almost complete cessation of new booking activity"" in April and May due to the pandemic, but the easing of country lockdowns boosted ticket sales in June. However, since July there had been an ""overall levelling off in bookings"" as the UK and other European countries re-imposed quarantine requirements for travellers returning from countries such as Spain. On Tuesday, EasyJet revealed it will have flown ""slightly less"" than the 40% of pre-coronavirus pandemic capacity it previously said it would operate between July and September following the government's decision to impose quarantine restrictions for seven Greek islands. Airlines are among the firms hardest hit by the impact of the pandemic. British Airways plans to cut up to 13,000 jobs due to the crisis, while EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic are slashing 4,500 roles each. Operators say the UK's travel quarantine policy - which requires visitors to high risk countries to isolate on their return - is crushing demand and want the government to back testing at airports instead. UK government sources have indicated that they are looking at system where the two tests would be eight days apart to further minimise the risk of ""false negative"" results. They are yet to approve the idea, however, while the prime minister last week warned testing at airports could give a ""false sense of security"". In a joint letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday, Airlines UK, whose members include BA, Virgin, Ryanair and EasyJet, called for an extensions of the jobs furlough scheme and air passenger duty waiver. ""Our industry is in crisis,"" the letter said. ""In sum, we ask you to act urgently to implement a programme of recovery for our sector."" IAG also announced on Thursday that it was tapping shareholders for â¬2.7bn (Â£2.5bn) to help shore up its finances. The company said the money would be used to reduce debt and help it withstand a prolonged downturn in travel. Under the fundraising, existing investors will buy new shares at a deeply discounted price - 36% below the closing price on Wednesday. The group's largest shareholder, Qatar Airways, which has a 25.1% holding, has said it will buy its full entitlement. Details of the rights issue, which was announced in July, come two days after new chief executive Luis Gallego took over from long-time boss Willie Walsh.

"Citigroup has named a woman to be its new chief executive in a first for a Wall Street bank. Briton Jane Fraser, its current president and head of global consumer division, is to become its new boss when current chief Michael Corbat retires in February. He is stepping down after 37 years at the bank, including eight as leader. It comes as the male-dominated world of US finance faces pressure to diversify its ranks. Scotland-born Ms Fraser has worked at Citi for 16 years, serving in her current role since 2019. She oversees business in 19 countries and previously led its Latin America division. Seen as a rising star, she was recently considered for the role of chief executive at Wells Fargo, another top US bank. The chair of Citi's board of directors, John Dugan, said Ms Fraser would take the bank ""to the next level"". ""She has deep experience across our lines of business and regions and we are highly confident in her,"" he said. Firms with more female executives 'perform better' Last year, Royal Bank of Scotland named Alison Rose as its first female chief executive, making her the first woman to run any of the big four banks in the UK. But just 31 women held the top spots at major American companies listed on the S&P 500 index at the end of 2019, none of which were banks. At a congressional hearing last year, the heads of seven of America's biggest banks, including current Citi boss Mr Corbat, were questioned about the lack of diversity and asked if they believed they would be succeeded by a woman or person of colour. None said yes. At Citi, Ms Fraser has frequently been charged with turning around troubled parts of the bank, the fourth largest in the US. She worked in its mortgage division following the financial crisis and was put in charge in Latin America after a scandal in its bank in Mexico. She is poised to take charge as the bank grapples with the economic fallout of the pandemic. In the most recent quarter, Citi's profits plunged 73% as it set aside more than $7bn to cover potential losses. Ms Fraser, whose compensation was $12.5m (Â£9.7m) last year, has said being a good leader means setting a vision, having the courage to make ""tough calls"", and asking questions. Born in St Andrews, Scotland, she has degrees from Harvard Business School and Cambridge University. The 53-year-old started her career at Goldman Sachs in London, joining Citi after rising to be a partner at consulting giant McKinsey. Shehas said,externalshe moved to the US because of the opportunities she saw for women there and spoken aboutconfronting machismo,externalas a female executive in Latin America A married mum of two, she has also addressed work-life balance,telling broadcaster CNN,externalin 2014: ""You cannot have it all at the same time. You can have it all, spread over decades. I think of my life in different chunks. When the kids were little, I needed to be around more, but it's different now."" However, in a 2018 interview she denied aspiring to the top spot. ""I look forward to seeing a woman being the first CEO of a Wall Street firm whoever that may be,""she said,external. ""I've never had the ambition to be the CEO of Citi or any other organization."" But she added: ""Things can change over time.""

"The EU is demanding the UK ditches plans to change Boris Johnson's Brexit deal ""by the end of the month"" or risk jeopardising trade talks. The UK has published a bill to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement it signed in January. The EU said this had ""seriously damaged trust"" and it would not be ""shy"" of taking legal action against the UK. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK had made it ""perfectly clear"" it would not withdraw the bill. The government says Parliament is sovereign and can pass laws which breach the UK's international treaty obligations. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""trust and confidence are and will be key"", after the latest round of UK-EU trade talks wrapped up in London on Thursday. His UK counterpart David Frost said ""significant"" differences remained over a free trade deal, but added discussions would continue in Brussels next week. Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans Chicken, cheese, cod: The tricky trade talk menu The source of the EU's concern is Mr Johnson's proposed Internal Market Bill,which was published on Wednesday,external. It addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The bill proposes no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. It gives UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The publication of the bill prompted emergency talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and Maros Å efÄoviÄ, the European Commission Vice-President. After two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage, however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. Read more from Laura here. Following the discussions, the EU issued a strongly-worded statement warning that the withdrawal agreement was a legal obligation, adding that ""neither the EU nor the UK can unilaterally change, clarify, amend, interpret, disregard or disapply the agreement"". The EU rejected the UK's arguments that the bill is designed to protect peace in Northern Ireland arguing that ""it does the opposite"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that if the bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an ""extremely serious violation"" of the withdrawal agreement and of international law. He urged the government to withdraw the bill ""by the end of the month"", adding that the withdrawal agreement ""contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text - which the European Union will not be shy in using"". Germany's UK ambassador said he had not experienced ""such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation"" in his diplomatic career. ""If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don't accept it,"" hetweeted,external. Michael Gove arrives at the Cabinet Office ahead of talks with EU officials In its response, the UK government said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""in the difficult and highly exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations. Parliament would not be acting unconstitutionally in enacting such legislation. ""Treaty obligations only become binding to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation. Whether to enact or repeal legislation, and the content of that legislation, is for Parliament and Parliament alone."" Mr Gove ""said that, during the talks, he had ""made it perfectly clear that we would not be withdrawing this legislation"", adding that the government was ""absolutely serious"". The Internal Market Bill will be formally debated by MPs in Parliament for the first time on Monday, 14 September. It has come under increasing criticism from Conservative parliamentarians. Former party leader Lord Howard said it would damage the UK's ""reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law"", while former Chancellor Lord Lamont asked ministers to ""think again"". But Mr Gove said: ""I'm looking forward to the second reading of the bill next week. It's an opportunity for the government to set out in detail why we have this legislation."" He promised to fight for ""unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson has defended the bill, saying it would ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales, while protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. But critics say the move will damage the UK's international reputation aftera minister admitted the plans break international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". Meanwhile, the latest round of formal talks over a post-Brexit trade deal concluded in London on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, Mr Barnier said the EU had ""shown flexibility"" in an effort to ""find solutions"", but the UK had not ""not engaged"" on some ""major issues"". For the UK side, Lord Frost said ""challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant"". He said the UK negotiators ""remain committed"" to reaching a deal by the middle of October and officials would ""continue discussions"" next week.

"Conservative minister Jacob Rees-Mogg is self-isolating at home after one of his children showed symptoms of coronavirus. He said the child had been tested for the virus and the family was isolating while they waited for the test result. Mr Rees-Mogg missed his weekly Thursday morning appearance at business questions, where he normally briefs MPs on the following week's Commons agenda. He was replaced by the deputy chief whip, Stuart Andrew. Mr Rees-Mogg, who has six children and is the MP for North East Somerset,tweeted,externalhis thanks to Mr Andrew. Concerns over PM's mass virus testing plans At business questions, his Labour counterpart Valerie Vaz wished Mr Rees-Mogg and his family well, saying: ""We know it had to be something very, very serious for him not to be here.""

"This video can not be played Stonehaven derailment: Work to remove train carriages begins Network Rail has admitted that the impact of climate change on its network ""is an area that is accelerating faster than our assumptions"". It said a fatal derailment near Stonehaven on 12 August showed that the industry must improve its response to extreme weather. The driver, conductor and a passenger died when the Aberdeen to Glasgow service crashed after heavy rain. An interim report said the train hit washed-out rocks and gravel. The report by Network Rail assessed the current controls and management of thousands of miles of earthworks - the sloped ground beside railway tracks. Work to remove derailed train carriages to begin Crash investigators confirm train struck landslip It saw hundreds of sites across the country being inspected by engineers, specialist contractors and helicopters over the past three weeks to identify any issues requiring emergency intervention. The report highlighted the need to deploy more technology across the network to predict failures. And it said investment in better weather forecasting was needed to enable local decisions to be made in advance. Thereport,externalalso suggested that industry rules for reporting and responding to heavy rainfall is improved. It said that this would help signallers to better manage services during bad weather. The report notes: ""Climate change considerations are being embedded in our standards and planning. ""But it is clear from the impact of severe weather events experienced in recent years that this is an area that is accelerating faster than our assumptions, and as a result it has become even more important to implement these plans."" Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury died after the train left the tracks Other plans include having discussions with meteorologists to understand how real-time information can be used to inform train information during unpredictable extreme weather. The report was commissioned by the UK Department for Transport following the deaths of driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62. It was published as work involving a 600-tonne lifting crane got under way to remove the carriages. A previous report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch said the train had turned back towards Aberdeen after reports of a landslip further down the track. The six-vehicle train had travelled more than a mile when it was derailed at Carmont after hitting a separate landslip. The track curved to the right, but investigators said the train continued in a straight line for about 100 yards before hitting the parapet of a bridge. The locomotive at the front of the train continued over the bridge and fell down an embankment, as did the third passenger carriage. The first passenger carriage came to rest on its roof, at right angles to the track, with the second passenger carriage on top of it. The fourth passenger carriage remained upright and also came to rest on top of the first carriage. It was still attached to the rear locomotive. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said they owed it to those who died or were injured in the incident to ""learn and act on every possible lesson to ensure this is never repeated"". And he pledged that the independent investigation would ""enable us to understand exactly what went wrong, and make sure it does not happen again"". The train came off the tracks as it attempted to return to Stonehaven He added: ""We will use the findings of this interim report to improve, shape and accelerate our work to build a more robust and resilient rail network, so that our railway continues to be one of the safest in the world."" Mr Shapps also said he would be writing to Scotland's chief constable to recommend that PC Liam Mercer, who was one of the first on the scene, be commended for his bravery. PC Liam Mercer (middle police officer) met Prince Charles after the derailment Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines said the UK's railway was one of the safest in Europe, and that tragic accidents are ""incredibly rare"". But he said something had gone wrong near Stonehaven on the day of the derailment, which was a ""stark reminder that we must never take safety for granted"". Mr Haines added: ""We are improving and accelerating our resilience work and will do everything we can to minimise the impact of weather on the safety and reliability of the railway as our climate continues to change."" The RMT union's senior assistant general secretary Steve Hedley said: ""RMT will be studying this interim report closely and consulting with our members and reps before we produce a detailed response in due course."" It looks like the Stonehaven train crash will bring more delays to our railways, even after the Aberdeen to Dundee line has reopened. Today's report rightly points out that the infrastructure is 150 years old and rebuilding it to modern standards that are 'climate resilient' would be prohibitively expensive. So the solution to making sure a derailment of this sort never happens again is down to control measures. Alarmingly it says cutting failures from torrential downpours, like the one at Carmont, rarely come with early warning signs. Technology is being developed, like more detailed rainfall forecasting and movement sensors for the most 'at risk' sites.  But until then it hints that more speed restrictions will be introduced during the heaviest rain along with line closures to allow for inspections. So you can add climate change to the list of potential reasons for your train being delayed.

"The app can be downloaded free onto a mobile phone More than 600,000 people have downloaded Scotland's new contact tracing app since it went live. It became available to download free on to a smart phone from Apple's App Store or Google Play on Thursday. The Protect Scotland app lets people know if they have been in close contact with someone who later tests positive. The Scottish government has said the software will support the Test and Protect system and is ""another tool in the fight against Covid-19"". Up until now, contact tracing has been done manually using a method followed for years to help control the spread of infectious diseases. How does Scotland's new contact tracing app work? How to download Scotland's contact tracing app,external Coronavirus in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged as many people as possible to get involved in the new tracing scheme. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber on Thursday afternoon, she said: ""The more people that sign up the better. Everybody who signs up is making a contribution."" She told MSPs that the number of people who had downloaded the app had stood at 150,000 before she left her office to speak in parliament. During First Minister's Questions, she said the number had climbed to 200,000 since she had taken to her feet, which she described as ""very positive"". By 12:15 on Friday, that had risen above 600,000. Scotland has followed Northern Ireland in choosing to use the toolkit provided by Apple and Google to build a contact tracing app which has privacy built in. Both have moved quickly by using the software developed for Ireland's app. Scotland did at first seem inclined to work with the NHSX England app team, which for months pursued a centralised app collecting more data, without the co-operation of the tech giants. But seeing some knotty technical issues with the English app they then decided to follow many other countries going down the Apple/Google route. One person close to the Scottish project said ""using something that the tech giants had created was easier than trying to create stuff ourselves"". England also eventually changed tack and hasbeen testing an app based on the Apple Google toolkit for the last monthon the Isle of Wight and the London borough of Newham. But there's still no word on a national rollout - and it seems England, which once saw a contact tracing app as a vital weapon in the battle against the virus, is now happy to be a follower rather than a leader in this technology. With 64,000 downloads by 09:00 on launch day, the Test and Protect team feel their app has got away to a good start - but the real question is whether it will help speed up warnings to people who may have been close to someone infected with the virus. It will be weeks before we know whether the app is an effective tool. Some iPhone users have reported not being able to download the app because they are not running iOS 13. The iPhone 6 and older models launched before 2015 cannot run Apple's latest operating system. Android phone users will also need to be running at least the Android 6.0 operating system, which was launched in 2015,the Protect.scot website says,external. Asked at First Minister's Questions about people who did not use smartphones, Ms Sturgeon said the more people who used the app, the more effective it would be. But the first minister told MSPs that the Scottish government had not based its entire test and protect system on a proximity tracing app. ""We've built it from the bottom up using tried and tested approaches in our public health teams and the app is an enhancement to that,"" she said. ""So if you don't have a phone, if you don't use the app, you will not be missed from our test and protect system."" Research by Ofcom from 2017,externalsuggested that about 3.2m adults in Scotland owned a smartphone. The new app uses Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in prolonged close contact with someone who subsequently tests positive for Covid-19. When an individual initially tests positive for the virus, they are contacted by phone in the usual way. The contact tracer will ask them if they are an app user and if they are willing to use the app's upload function to anonymously alert close contacts. If they agree, they will be sent a unique code to their mobile which unlocks this function on the app. By sharing their positive test result in this way, the information will form part of an anonymous database. The app on other users' phones regularly checks this database to see if they have been in contact with an infected person. A warning is automatically issued when a match is found and users are then urged to get tested or self-isolate for 14 days. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"The EU is demanding the UK ditches plans to change Boris Johnson's Brexit deal ""by the end of the month"" or risk jeopardising trade talks. The UK has published a bill to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement it signed in January. The EU said this had ""seriously damaged trust"" and it would not be ""shy"" of taking legal action against the UK. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK had made it ""perfectly clear"" it would not withdraw the bill. The government says Parliament is sovereign and can pass laws which breach the UK's international treaty obligations. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""trust and confidence are and will be key"", after the latest round of UK-EU trade talks wrapped up in London on Thursday. His UK counterpart David Frost said ""significant"" differences remained over a free trade deal, but added discussions would continue in Brussels next week. Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans Chicken, cheese, cod: The tricky trade talk menu The source of the EU's concern is Mr Johnson's proposed Internal Market Bill,which was published on Wednesday,external. It addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The bill proposes no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. It gives UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The publication of the bill prompted emergency talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and Maros Å efÄoviÄ, the European Commission Vice-President. After two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage, however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. Read more from Laura here. Following the discussions, the EU issued a strongly-worded statement warning that the withdrawal agreement was a legal obligation, adding that ""neither the EU nor the UK can unilaterally change, clarify, amend, interpret, disregard or disapply the agreement"". The EU rejected the UK's arguments that the bill is designed to protect peace in Northern Ireland arguing that ""it does the opposite"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that if the bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an ""extremely serious violation"" of the withdrawal agreement and of international law. He urged the government to withdraw the bill ""by the end of the month"", adding that the withdrawal agreement ""contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text - which the European Union will not be shy in using"". Germany's UK ambassador said he had not experienced ""such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation"" in his diplomatic career. ""If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don't accept it,"" hetweeted,external. Michael Gove arrives at the Cabinet Office ahead of talks with EU officials In its response, the UK government said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""in the difficult and highly exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations. Parliament would not be acting unconstitutionally in enacting such legislation. ""Treaty obligations only become binding to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation. Whether to enact or repeal legislation, and the content of that legislation, is for Parliament and Parliament alone."" Mr Gove ""said that, during the talks, he had ""made it perfectly clear that we would not be withdrawing this legislation"", adding that the government was ""absolutely serious"". The Internal Market Bill will be formally debated by MPs in Parliament for the first time on Monday, 14 September. It has come under increasing criticism from Conservative parliamentarians. Former party leader Lord Howard said it would damage the UK's ""reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law"", while former Chancellor Lord Lamont asked ministers to ""think again"". But Mr Gove said: ""I'm looking forward to the second reading of the bill next week. It's an opportunity for the government to set out in detail why we have this legislation."" He promised to fight for ""unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson has defended the bill, saying it would ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales, while protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. But critics say the move will damage the UK's international reputation aftera minister admitted the plans break international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". Meanwhile, the latest round of formal talks over a post-Brexit trade deal concluded in London on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, Mr Barnier said the EU had ""shown flexibility"" in an effort to ""find solutions"", but the UK had not ""not engaged"" on some ""major issues"". For the UK side, Lord Frost said ""challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant"". He said the UK negotiators ""remain committed"" to reaching a deal by the middle of October and officials would ""continue discussions"" next week.

"This video can not be played Three children were seriously injured in the crash Three children were seriously injured when their school bus hit a railway bridge. The double-decker's roof was torn off in the crash in Wellhouse Lane, Winchester, shortly after 08:10 BST. Pupils from Henry Beaufort School ""started screaming"" when the roof fell on top of them, leaving a further 12 needing treatment for minor injuries. Bus operator Stagecoach South said an investigation was under way. No arrests have been made. The three badly hurt children were taken to hospital. Twelve other youngsters, two of whom were also taken to hospital, suffered minor injuries, Hampshire Constabulary said. All pupils on board were aged between 11 and 16, the force said. Poppy, 11, who was sitting on the top deck of the bus, said the children had noticed the driver was ""going on a completely different route"" in the moments before the crash. She said a metal pole struck her on the head and others were hurt by breaking glass. ""There was blood everywhere - everyone was in a rush to get down, but we were all trying to help each other,"" she added. Zoe was on the top deck of the bus when the crash happened Zoe, 14, who was also on the top deck, said the roof fell in on top of everyone ""and everyone started screaming"". ""It felt like 'am I going to live or am I going to die' - everyone was crying and shaking, it was a huge shock,"" she said. Fifteen-year-old Robert, who was on the lower deck of the bus, said: ""I heard crashing upstairs. I thought we'd hit the side of the tunnel, then I saw the top of the bus falling down. ""Most of the people hurt just had cuts and were bleeding. But there were some people with bad injuries."" The children on board were all aged between 11 and 16 Insp Andy Tester, of Hampshire Constabulary, said it was ""very lucky"" nobody was killed. ""That bus doesn't fit through the bridge - I can't think that a bus route would have been drawn [up] to take it through a bridge that is too low for the bus,"" he said. The bridge has a warning sign above it that states vehicles with a height of more than 12ft (3.6m) should not enter. The bus involved in the crash was believed to be about 14ft (4.3m) in height. The bus had been on its way to Henry Beaufort School Sue Hearle, head teacher of the Henry Beaufort School, said: ""This is a distressing incident and we are extremely relieved that it wasn't more serious."" She added she did not want to speculate on the circumstances of the crash and would be focusing on supporting the children affected. A spokesperson for Stagecoach South said: ""Our thoughts are with the children and their families. ""We are carrying out an internal investigation into the circumstances involved in the incident and we will continue to provide the emergency services with our full support."" The road remains closed between the junction with Andover Road North to School Lane.

"Scientists and health professionals have raised doubts about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""Operation Moonshot"" plan for mass coronavirus testing. The PM hopes millions of Covid-19 tests - including some giving results within minutes - could be processed daily. But experts say there are issues with laboratory capacity for current tests, while the technology for more rapid tests ""does not, as yet, exist"". The British Medical Journal says leaked memos show the plan could cost Â£100bn. Speaking after his announcement thatgatherings in England are to be restricted to six people from Monday, Mr Johnson said the government was ""working hard"" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. And he said that ""in the near future"" he wanted to start using testing ""to identify people who are negative - who don't have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else"". What are the new rules? UK coronavirus cases up by 2,659 on Wednesday Mr Johnson added: ""We believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. ""Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved - literally millions of tests processed every single day."" Mr Johnson said a mass-testing programme could be ready by the spring and could help the UK to avoid a second national lockdown. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said it was unclear how the so-called Operation Moonshot would work - given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. Dr Nagpaul added the idea of opening up society based on people testing negative for the virus should be ""approached with caution"" because of the high rate of ""false negatives"" and the potential to miss those who are incubating the virus. Many experts believe plans to roll out mass rapid testing this winter is unrealistic. Piloting is still taking place to see if the technologies work - millions of tests would then need to be manufactured and distributed. The focus on this ""moonshot"" plan is perhaps a distraction from the difficult decisions the country faces. The level of infection is still low - despite the recent rises. But do not expect them to stay this way. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and fact people are indoors more. Ministers will then face the choice of more restrictions to try to curb the virus in the knowledge these will damage people's health in other ways as well as harming education and the economy. Or let the virus spread, while focusing efforts on protecting the vulnerable - that means protecting care homes and perhaps reintroducing shielding. Lockdown bought us time, but simply deferred the problem. Progress has been made in the past six months - there are better treatments, more testing and a network of contact tracers - but perhaps not as much as hoped. The UK - like all nations - faces a tricky act of balancing harms. Dr David Strain, clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and chairman of the BMA's medical academic staff committee, said the mass-testing strategy is ""fundamentally flawed"" and is ""based on technology that does not, as yet, exist"". ""The prime minister's suggestion that this will be as simple as 'getting a pregnancy test' that will give results within 15 minutes is unlikely, if not impossible, in the timescale he was suggesting to get the country back on track."" While Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, warned it could also lead to false positives - with hundreds of thousands of people being wrongly told they have coronavirus. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries acknowledged that the ""the tricky thing with this is not so much the technology, which I'm sure we will have in the very short while in weeks to months, the issue actually is how it gets used in practice"". ""So that, if you have, for example, a false negative test, but you feel assured that you don't have the disease, you don't end up going back into the workplace."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check looks at why testing matters Currently,between 150,000 and 200,000 tests are processed each day. Testing capacity is reported as being 350,000 a day - and this includes 250,000 swab tests (which check if you have the virus currently) as well as 100,000 antibody tests (which check if someone has already had the virus). Earlier this week a director of the government's test and trace programme in Englandissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the testing system, explaining that laboratories, not the testing sites themselves, were the ""critical pinch-point"". One in five with Covid could test negative Covid tests 'could be picking up dead virus' Government apologises over Covid tests shortage The UK has drawn up plans to eventually carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year - at a cost of more than Â£100bn, which is approaching the entire annual budget for NHS England,according to a report in the BMJ.,external The new rapid tests will be piloted in Salford from next month. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the technology needed to be ""tested carefully"" and it would be ""completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk"". The plans for mass testing come as Scotland launched itsnew contact tracing app, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urging as many people as possible to download it. The contact tracing app being developed in England ran into technical problems and iscurrently being testedfollowing a revamp. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson set out a new ""rule of six"" in England,restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people,external, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests, after the UK reported more than 2,000 new coronavirus cases for the fourth consecutive day. ""If everyone does it [the rule of six], we may well be by Christmas in a position to look at it again,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson said the new measures will take about ""two to three weeks"" to see an effect on the number of cases. ""So we need to wait at this point and see how much we flatten the curve and then if that's not sufficient to bring the reproduction number below one, so the epidemic starts shrinking again, then yes, we may need to clamp down on other areas,"" he added. Whileyoung people are testing positive at higher rates,Prof Ferguson said it was unavoidable that the virus would resurge in all age groups. Asked about the return to work, he said: ""Certainly I think we should hesitate and maybe pause at the headlong rush to get everybody back into offices. But some people have to work and I completely understand the concerns in many quarters that everybody working at home has an economic impact, particularly on city centres."" Meanwhile, a new law will also require businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas to record customers' contact details. The government has also publishedits coronavirus guidance for universitiesahead of students returning later this month, with full online learning only as a last resort.

"There is more than one ""rule of six"". Who knew? It's what a legendary Hollywood film editor used to describe the best of way making a must-watch movie, mixing six different elements like emotion and space (his name is Walter Murch, if you are on the hunt for trivia). The other rule of six is part of the code that rules corporate takeovers, more familiar to City lawyers. You may indeed have your own obscure examples. But ministers hope now the government's new rule of six will very quickly become familiar to the country and will immediately change people's behaviour too. 'We must act' to prevent second lockdown, says PM What are the new rules for meeting my friends? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? From Monday, it will be illegal in England, apart from at school or work or under other few exceptions, to meet more than five other people at a time. The police will have the power to stop that happening - you can read exactly how the new restrictions will workhere. After weeks when the government has been trying to cheerlead the country back to the office, urging pupils back to school and taking steps to roll back coronavirus restrictions it is quite the change of tone, change of pace, and change of heart. The prime minister also acknowledged publicly, after many weeks of questions about the layers of anomalies and different rules and regulations, that complicated messages had made the rules hard for people to follow. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Boris Johnson can hope that the public in England will be willing to follow a new, clearer instruction. But it is not obvious that the public will all comply. The reason for the change however, aswe discussed yesterday, is crystal clear. The number of cases has started to rise, and rise quickly, and ministers want to slam on the brakes. The new rule is a significant move, and it's plain it could mean limits on our lives for many months. The prime minister today acknowledged that even Christmas may not be much like normal. The changes are designed to prevent the disease taking off again, and to stop the need for another full national lockdown, something the government is desperate to avoid. But other measures are waiting in the wings too. At the bottom of the government'sguidance,externalissued today, there is a rather bland, technical sounding paragraph: ""The government will restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in local lockdown areas, with the option of national action in the future. This has been introduced in Bolton, following a steep rise in cases, and will seek to restrict activities that may lead to a spread in the virus."" In other words, if the rise in cases doesn't slow, the government could bring in a national curfew on opening hours, a more radical step. Government sources emphasise this is not about to happen. But by laying out the option, it's clear the rule of six could be followed by more radical steps. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

"Safwan Choudhry's flight was cancelled due to a mask dispute A Canadian flight was cancelled and police were called because a child was not wearing a mask. Safwan Choudhry says WestJet wanted his 19-month-old to wear a mask, but the baby girl would not stop crying. The airline says the issue was not with the infant, who is below the age required to wear a mask, but with Mr Choudhry's three-year-old. Tuesday morning's Flight 652 from Calgary to Toronto was stopped, and all passengers were ordered to disembark. ""It's unlike anything I have ever witnessed, let alone experienced,"" Mr Choudhry told the BBC. Mr Choudhry told the BBC his oldest daughter, who is three, was eating a snack before take-off when flight attendants approached them asking that both their children wear a mask. He said he and his wife were masked. He said he asked if his daughter could finish her snack, but that they said they had a ""zero tolerance policy"" and would not close the plane door without her wearing a mask. Mr Choudhry said he agreed to put one on immediately. ""Most children you have to kind of ease them into it, which is a code word for let me get the iPad out,"" he told the BBC. He says the three-year-old did put on a mask, after some fussing. ""But my younger one had a very difficult time, she was basically hysterical."" Mr Choudhry says she was so upset she vomited. He says WestJet was aggressive, and told them that because his youngest daughter was not wearing a mask, and was too upset to wear a mask, the whole family would have to leave. He says they told them that if they did not leave, they could be arrested, charged and receive prison time. Mr Choudhry says he and his wife were respectful. They ultimately agreed to leave. He later learned that according to Canadian transportation policy, only children over two are required to wear a mask, and thus his 19-month-old did not have to put one on. WestJet disputes that the three-year-old put a mask on. The airline said in a statement: ""Due to non-compliance of the parents to place a mask on their older child who is over the age of two, our crew informed the adults of the regulations we are required to follow. ""Our crew requested the presence of the authorities after the guests refused to comply with Transport Canada's interim order and subsequently refused to deplane the aircraft."" A video taken with Mr Choudhry's phone shows his older daughter wearing a mask on the plane, after police arrived on board. He says while some passengers were very irritated with his family, ""overwhelmingly"" people on the plane supported them. Many spoke up in defence of the family, as their youngest cried, he says. That was when flight staff called police, he says. They got off the plane, and the flight was eventually cancelled and rebooked for the next day. ""Due to the rapid escalation of the situation on board, our crew felt uncomfortable to operate and the flight was subsequently cancelled,"" WestJet said. In a video, a police officer explains to them that while the mask issue with the eldest was ""resolved"", ""the behaviour of the other passengers left the rest of the crew feeling unsafe"". Some passengers can be heard in video of the incident heckling the police and air crew. The officer later confirms that when he arrived, the oldest child was wearing a mask. Police did not file any charges. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

A fellow passenger, Marian Nur, also recorded some of the interactions with flight staff, because she was worried the family was being targeted because of their race and religion - Mr Choudhry's wife wears a hijab. ""I was so shocked, the parents never raised their voices, they never got angry with the attendants, they were just trying to reason with them,""she told CBC.,external Mr Choudhry says he and his family are still in Calgary, and have not been offered another flight to Toronto. He says he hopes this does not happen to anyone else. ""So many people were put through so much grief because of a lack-of-understanding on part of the policy,"" he says.

"Thousands of students are preparing to return to university after the coronavirus lockdown Universities should switch to full online learning only as a last resort in the event of a local coronavirus outbreak, new guidance says. The hundreds of thousands of students due to arrive at England's universities in the coming weeks also face a ban on house parties under the ""rule of six"". Students must limit socialising, staying within separate ""households"", and be taught in managed groups. The mass return of students raises the risk of outbreaks, the guidance says. The academics' union said it would be safer to switch most teaching online this term and allow students to return only when virus levels were lower. Manchester students warned off club nights 'I paid for my student house, now lectures are online' 'Critical moment' as students return to university UCU general secretary Jo Grady added: ""Any country with a infection rate anywhere near that of our young people would be removed from the safe travel list. ""We cannot see why the government is insisting young people move around the country and engage in unnecessary face-to-face interactions. ""Moving learning online would remove the need for universities to consider teaching outside or opening doors and windows in the winter months as the guidance suggests."" But the Department for Education guidance reiterates the current position that courses will be provided using a blend of face-to-face and online learning, unless an outbreak occurs locally. Where social distancing cannot be maintained, teaching sessions will be via technology or moved to more spacious premises. The DfE also stressed there was no evidence face-to-face teaching was unsafe, as long as Covid precautions were maintained. And it highlighted government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advice online-only teaching ""would have an impact on students' mental health."" ""Universities have been making a mammoth effort to safely reopen campuses and buildings to students this autumn,"" Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said. ""And the government has worked closely with them."" Campuses have been closed since March and Sage suggests the university return ""could amplify local and national transmission"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:What tests are available? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:  ""Many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently. ""My message to students is simple, 'Please, for the sake of your education and your parents' and your grandparents' health, wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don't socially gather in groups of more than six, now and when term starts."" He added the updated guidance for universities on ""how they can operate in a Covid-secure way"" included a ""clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country"". The guidance also asks universities to identify ""safer social activities"" for students and create Covid-secure campus bars and students' unions where they can socialise. And the government expects the universities to use incentives to encourage students to comply with social-distancing measures and disciplinary measures for serious breaches. Vice-chancellors' group Universities UK said they had been working very hard to put Covid-secure safety measures in place. Chief executive Alistair Jarvis said: ""Life across society will be different this autumn, with university life no exception, with differences to previous years. ""However, students can look forward to a high-quality, rewarding and enjoyable experience."" All universities are also required to plan for a tiered response, depending on the level of risk in the area. a mix of face-to-face tuition and online lessons masks worn in crowded corridors and communal areas increased online learning face-to-face tuition only where possible and necessary - for example, clinical or practical learning or research face-to-face tuition for priority courses such as medicine only students advised not to return to family homes university buildings closed to everyone except key workers those conducting essential research The guidance comes as Exeter University signed a contract for tens of thousands of potential saliva tests this academic year. The results will be provided within 24 hours and fed into the NHS Test and Trace system. Some other universities, including Leicester, Cambridge and East Anglia, are offering voluntary swab tests to staff and students.

"This video can not be played Earlier this year, the BBC's Rebecca Morelle heard the views of four citizens' assembly members A frequent flyer tax, phasing out polluting SUVs and restricting cars in city centres are among climate change solutions suggested by members of the public. A citizens' assembly of 108 people from all walks of life published its report after weeks of debate. They proposed curbing road building and using the pandemic to cut emissions. MPs said the report offered a ""unique insight"", but activists Extinction Rebellion said it didn't go far enough. The report says the government must show leadership on climate change and insists climate policies must be fair to all â especially the poorest in society. Its radical conclusions may offer political cover to ministers whoâre typically nervous of a public backlash against policies that affect lifestyles. The group, orcitizens' assembly,was set up by six government select committees - groups of MPs who look at what the government is doing and scrutinise policy. Members of the assembly were chosen to represent a spectrum of views from all over the UK and committed 60 hours of their time to studying and debating climate change. They met over six weekends and were asked how to come up with ideas to help the UK achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Their conclusions have been published in a report that is more than 550 pages. What is the Climate Assembly? Climate assembly considers flying bananas The members said it was ""imperative that there is strong and clear leadership from governmentâ to tackle climate change. One member, Sue, from Bath, said: âEven with the country still reeling from coronavirus, itâs clear the majority of us feel prioritising net zero policy is not only important, but achievable.â Hamish, a software engineer from rural Aberdeenshire, told BBC News the government needed ""to develop a long-term strategy to help usâ. A key theme of the report is education. Ibrahim, a GP from Surrey, said: âThe media has to take a role - schools as well. We perhaps need to look at the curriculum. âYou canât go to someone and say âyou need to switch to the hydrogen boiler because itâs low CO2â but they have no idea [about it]. Youâre more likely to get a buy-in from people when they know about the issues.â This video can not be played Leia and Ibrahim are two of the 108 members of the public who worked on the report Members said the government should start phasing out the sale of polluting new vehicles such as SUVs, and clamp down on adverts for highly-polluting goods. Another central message is the need for policies to be fair. Amanda, from Kent, said: âElectric cars have to be more affordable to everybody - not just people who earn enough money.â They also supported higher taxes on frequent fliers, and investment in clean aviation technology. What is climate change? A really simple guide Climate change: What do all the terms mean? Covid crisis does little to slow climate change Tracey, a mother from Northern Ireland, said: âI would be a frequent flier myself â so I would say there needs to be something there to stop us from taking so many flights â to reduce our emissions.â On the subject of what we eat and how we use the land, the assembly urged a voluntary cut of 20-40% in eating red meat. âThe government can't legislate against eating red meat,"" Amanda told us, ""but with education, advertising and labelling I think we can change their attitudes towards eating red meat - as we did with smoking."" They also said: Businesses should make products using less energy and materials People should repair goods and share more, instead of owning all their appliances The UK should get more power from offshore and onshore wind, and solar power New housing developments must have good access to facilities through walking and cycling Most members were not very keen on nuclear - or on burning wood in power stations - and most werenât confident in carbon capture and storage. They think the government should be harnessing the Covid crisis to limit support for high-carbon industries. The MPs behind the assembly said the report ""provides a unique insight into the thinking of an informed public to the trade-offs and changes required to help deliver on the objective that parliament has agreed"". They said: ""Their work merits action.â Crispin Truman, from the countryside charity CPRE, said it shows ""public appetite to end the UKâs contribution to the climate emergency has far outstripped government action.â And Tom Burke, from the climate change think tank, e3g, added: âThis is a striking tribute to the common sense of the British public. There is a clear lesson for politicians and editors across the political spectrum about the role our citizens are capable of playing in shaping public policy.â However, radical green group Extinction Rebellion (XR) condemned the proposals as too timid to meet internationally-agreed proposals limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C. They warned that the report could get buried in government bureaucracy. The committees behind the report have asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson to respond before the end of the year. This may be challenging as, according to a recent report by the Institute for Government, Covid and Brexit have forced climate change down the governmentâs priority list - a claim the government denies. A government spokesperson said it would study the report. The organisers of the assembly have requested that only first names of members are used in the media.

"Ronald Bell (right) with brother and fellow band member Robert in 2014 Ronald Bell, one of the founder members of 1970s and 1980s pop group Kool & the Gang, has died at the age of 68. He started the band with his brother Robert ""Kool"" Bell in 1964. They became one of the era's most popular and influential soul and funk bands, with hits including Celebration, Ladies' Night and Get Down On It. Their music also featured in several films including Saturday Night Fever, for which they received a Grammy in 1978, and Pulp Fiction. Bell died at his home in the US Virgin Islands with his wife by his side, his publicist said. The cause of death was not given. A self-taught saxophonist and singer, he founded the group in New Jersey with Robert and five schoolfriends - Dennis Thomas, Robert Mickens, Charles Smith, George Brown and Ricky Westfield. The band released 23 albums across their career Their career was split into two distinct halves. In the early 70s, they scored US hits with the foot-stomping funk of songs like Jungle Boogie and Hollywood Swinging. Then, with the addition of vocalist  James ""JT"" Taylor in 1979, they morphed into a hit-making R&B band, scoring the biggest commercial success of their career as they reached their 20th anniversary. As musical director, Bell co-wrote all of their biggest hits, including the wedding disco classic Celebration. BBC Music: Kool & The Gang It was his ""favourite song"" from the band's extensive back catalogue, he told the Reuters news agency in 2008. ""I had no clue, you know,"" he said. ""I was clueless, thinking that that was going to be a hit. I had no idea. ""But after all these years, there are times at the end of the show when I see all of these people singing a song, and after all of an hour and a half, you ask them to jump up and down and they still jump up and down. That's kind of overwhelming for me."" The group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015 for their contribution to the world of entertainment, and were inducted into the Songwriters' Hall Of Fame in 2018. Bell was born and raised in Ohio, and picked up the music bug from his father, a professional boxer who was a close friend of jazz musicians Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. Unable to afford drums, he and his brother taught themselves to play on makeshift instruments. ""I used to beat paint cans like bongos, and depending on how much paint was inside, this would determine the tone of the sounds we made,"" he later recalled. After the family moved to New Jersey in his teens, Bell's mother bought him a real set of bongos and he began to teach himself bass guitar, borrowing an instrument from the brother of his future bandmate Robert ""Spike"" Mickens. The first incarnation of Kool & The Gang formed in 1964, but they cycled through several names - including Jazziacs, The New Dimensions, The Soul Town Band, the Jazz Birds and Kool & the Flames before settling on their final moniker in 1969. Along the way, they combined their love of jazz with the gritty rhythms of street funk, creating a sound that would lead to their success in the 1970s. ""We used to play a lot of percussion in the streets in the 60s, go to the park and start beating on drums and stuff in the street,""Bell told Rolling Stone,external. ""You had a hard time trying to get us to play R&B,"" he added. ""We were die-hard jazz musicians. We're not stooping to that."" Robert (left) and Ronald Bell in the studio in the 1970s As the Jazz Birds, they won the Apollo Theater's famed Amateur Night and landed a record deal with a small label called De-Lite Records. Three singles from their self-titled debut album hit the pop charts, with the instrumental track Kool & The Gang showcasing their raucous, horn-driven sound. Their mainstream breakthrough came with 1973's Wild and Peaceful album. Lead singleFunky Stuff,externalbecame their first top 40 hit in the US, followed byJungle Boogie,externalandHollywood Swinging,external, which both reached the top 10. Jungle Boogie went on to become one of their signature songs - used in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and sampled in Madonna's Erotica. It was only written after the band's record label, in search of a top 10 single, pressured Kool & The Gang to record a cover of Soul Makossa by Manu Dibango. ""It would have been a hit,""Bell later recalled,external. ""But we decided we were not going to record Soul Makossa - we'll come up with our own 'jungle music', not to be derogatory. ""We made the song up in the rehearsal, went in and recorded it that night. Jungle Boogie is one take."" As disco rose to prominence, the band struggled to replicate their early success - although they did win a Grammy forOpen Sesame,external, their contribution to the multi-million-selling Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Things changed with the addition of Taylor, a former nightclub singer, and producer Eumir Deodato, which led to a cleaner, pop-driven sound and the crossover single Ladies' Night. The decision was prompted when the band found themselves on tour with the Jacksons and were told by the promoter that they needed a frontman. Taylor, chosen for his deep baritone ""like Nat King Cole"", was the only singer they auditioned. Unlike many of the funk bands of the 70s, Kool & The Gang thrived in the 1980s, scoring huge hits with sentimental ballads likeJoanna,externalandCherish,external, as well as the party anthemsSteppin' Out,externalandGet Down On It,external, which is now their most-streamed song on Spotify. The band won an outstanding contribution prize at the 2003 Mobo Awards Possibly their most enduring hit is Celebration, which was inspired by Bell's Islamic faith. ""I was reading the scripture about where God called the angels together, and made an announcement that he was going to create this being,""he told Songwriter Universe,external. ""He gathered the angels together and they said, 'We don't know nothin', but we just celebrate you, God - we celebrate and praise you.'"" ""And I thought, I'm going to write a song about that, [with the line] 'Everyone around the worldâ¦Come on!' ""That's the intent... it was actually written for mankind."" Allow YouTube content?

The group found a new generation of fans in the 80s and 90s as their music was sampled in a raft of pop and hip-hop songs. Jungle Boogie,external's horn riff appears in Luniz'sI Got 5 On It,external;Summer Madness,externalformed the basis ofSummertime,externalby DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince; and the syncopated rhythms ofJungle Jazz,externalappear on dozens of tracks, from MARRS'sPump Up The Volume,externalto Jade'sDon't Walk Away,external. When Public Enemy sampled three separate Kool & The Gang songs for Fear of a Black Planet, Bell voiced his approval. ""After Public Enemy, I was all in [with hip-hop],"" he told Rolling Stone in 2015. ""The music was all new to me. I sat and listened to Fear of a Black Planet and was thrilled. I thought that was amazing. ""You can practically hear [drummer] George [Brown] playing that break beat. You can hear our music in the background. You know it was compound and compact, but you can hear Kool & the Gang music in all that hip-hop."" The rise of hip-hop and the departure of Taylor in 1989 effectively ended Kool & The Gang's presence on the charts, but Bell continued to record and tour with the group as a legacy act in the 1990s and 2000s. At the time of his death, he was working on a solo album called Kool Baby Brotha Band, as well as a series of animations about the band's childhood and career. In an interview with Billboard last year, he said he felt grateful to have had a career in music. ""And for it to be this long,""he added,external. ""For me, I'm most grateful for that, to still be relevant since [we were] 19."" The musician is survived by his wife Tia Sinclair Bell and 10 children; as well as his brother Robert and three other siblings. The family will hold a private funeral service, and have asked that fans donate to the children's charity the Boys and Girls Club of America.

"This video can not be played Scotland sets 'rule of six' for people meeting up The number of people allowed to meet up in Scotland has been cut to six amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic ""accelerating"". It came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a ""tightening and extension"" of lockdown rules. Changes planned for next week have been put back until at least 5 October. It means that theatres, live music venues, indoor soft play facilities and indoor contact sports will not now open next Monday. Until now, eight people from three households had been allowed to meet indoors in Scotland, and up to 15 from five households outdoors. This will change to six people from two households, and will apply both indoors and outdoors - including in homes, gardens, pubs and restaurants. Children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, however. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland What are the latest lockdown rules in Scotland? New Scottish contact tracing app goes live The changes also mean spectators will not be able to return to sports stadia and other venues over the next three weeks - although two pilot events due take place at the weekend will still happen. Scotland is currently recording three times more positive cases of the virus on average each day than it was three weeks ago - with a further 161 cases being logged on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon said the spread of the virus was accelerating - albeit from a low base and not as rapidly as it was back in March and April. She said this was ""not entirely unexpected"" given the recent steps to reopen the economy - but that further planned moves to lift lockdown had to be put on pause for now. The first minister said: ""Right now, given the rise in cases, it's the only responsible decision we can reach."" Ms Sturgeon also said the reopening of offices and call centres will ""definitely not take place"" before October, saying that ""for now, working from home will remain the default position"". The move to cut the number of people who can meet followsa similar move announced for Englandon Wednesday. There will be ""limited exceptions"" to the rules for organised sports, places of worship and wedding and funeral services - which will be capped at 20 guests. The new limits will officially come into force on Monday, although Ms Sturgeon said that she was asking people to immediately abide by the stricter new limits on gatherings. Scotland's music industry has warned many venues may not survive the coronavirus lockdown It will also become mandatory for staff working in hospitality premises such as pubs and restaurants to wear face coverings, and for customers to wear them while moving around. Ms Sturgeon admitted the new announcements would be ""hard for people to hear"", but said they were necessary. She said the rise in new cases was ""not as rapid as it was earlier in the year"" and that prevalence of the virus was lower ""thanks to the individual sacrifices that so any of you have made for the greater good"". She said: ""We have grounds for cautious hope, but we have no grounds for complacency. It is vital to do everything we can to stop cases rising further before winter. ""These steps are necessary to help curb a virus that we know spreads rapidly whenever it gets the chance."" She insisted that the Test and Protect contact tracing system was ""working well"", adding that without this ""the virus would be spreading further and faster, and we would require to apply much stricter lockdown measures again"". The Scottish Conservatives asked the government to consider moving more towards a strategy of mass community testing to complement Test and Protect. The party's Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, said: ""Experts have said that mass community testing must also be part of the solution, if we are going to succeed in keeping the virus supressed through the winter. ""I would also urge the government to continue their work with Scotland's airports on a testing regime. ""The aviation sector needs all the help it can get, and stopping the virus will only be possible if we reach everyone coming into the country who may need to quarantine.""

"Shipping a coronavirus vaccine around the world will be the ""largest transport challenge ever"" according to the airline industry. The equivalent of 8,000 Boeing 747s will be needed,the International Air Transport Association (IATA),externalhas said. There is no Covid-19 vaccine yet, but IATA is already working with airlines, airports, global health bodies and drug firms on a global airlift plan. The distribution programme assumes only one dose per person is needed. ""Safely delivering Covid-19 vaccines will be the mission of the century for the global air cargo industry. But it won't happen without careful advance planning. And the time for that is now,"" said IATA's chief executive Alexandre de Juniac. How close to developing a vaccine are we? Ryanair boss calls UK travel quarantine 'defective' Virus drives airlines to 'worst' year on record While airlines have been shifting their focus onto delivering cargo during the severe downturn in passenger flights, shipping vaccines is far more complex. Not all planes are suitable for delivering vaccines as they need a typical temperature range of between 2 and 8C for transporting drugs. Some vaccines may require freezing temperatures which would exclude more aircraft. ""We know the procedures well. What we need to do is scale them up to the magnitude that will be required,"" added Glyn Hughes, the industry body's head of cargo. Flights to certain parts of the world, including some areas of South East Asia, will be critical as they lack vaccine-production capabilities, he added. Distributing a vaccine across Africa would be ""impossible"" right now IATA says given the lack of cargo capacity, size of the region and the complexities of border crossings. Transportation will need ""almost military precision"" and will require cool facilities across a network of locations where the vaccine will be stored. About 140 vaccines are in early development, and around two dozen are now being tested on people in clinical trials. One is being developed by the University of Oxfordthat is already in an advanced stage of testing. IATA has urged governments to begin careful planning now to ensure they are fully prepared once vaccines are approved and available for distribution. Along with making sure they are handled and transported at controlled temperatures, security is another issue. ""Vaccines will be highly valuable commodities. Arrangements must be in place to keep ensure that shipments remain secure from tampering and theft,"" added IATA.

"Wildlife is under pressure from habitat loss, including deforestation Wildlife populations have fallen by more than two-thirds in less than 50 years, according to a major report by the conservation group WWF. The report says this ""catastrophic decline"" shows no sign of slowing. And it warns that nature is being destroyed by humans at a rate never seen before. Wildlife is ""in freefall"" as we burn forests, over-fish our seas and destroy wild areas, says Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF. ""We are wrecking our world - the one place we call home - risking our health, security and survival here on Earth. Now nature is sending us a desperate SOS and time is running out."" The report looked at thousands of different wildlife species monitored by conservation scientists in habitats across the world. They recorded an average 68% fall in more than 20,000 populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish since 1970. The decline was clear evidence of the damage human activity is doing to the natural world, said Dr Andrew Terry, director of conservation at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which provides the data. ""If nothing changes, populations will undoubtedly continue to fall, driving wildlife to extinction and threatening the integrity of the ecosystems on which we depend,"" he added. The report says the Covid-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of how nature and humans are intertwined. Factors believed to lead to the emergence of pandemics - including habitat loss and the use and trade of wildlife - are also some of the drivers behind the decline in wildlife. New modelling evidence suggests we can halt and even reverse habitat loss and deforestation if we take urgent conservation action and change the way we produce and consume food. The British TV presenter and naturalist Sir David Attenborough said the Anthropocene, the geological age during which human activity has come to the fore, could be the moment we achieve a balance with the natural world and become stewards of our planet. ""Doing so will require systemic shifts in how we produce food, create energy, manage our oceans and use materials,"" he said. ""But above all it will require a change in perspective. A change from viewing nature as something that's optional or 'nice to have' to the single greatest ally we have in restoring balance to our world."" Sir David presents a new documentary on extinction to be aired on BBC One in the UK on Sunday 13 September at 20:00 BST. Gorillas in the mountains of DRC face threats from illegal hunting Measuring the variety of all life on Earth is complex, with a number of different measures. Taken together, they provide evidence that biodiversity is being destroyed at a rate unprecedented in human history. This particular report uses an index of whether populations of wildlife are going up or down. It does not tell us the number of species lost, or extinctions. The largest declines are in tropical areas. The drop of 94% for Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest anywhere in the world, driven by a cocktail of threats to reptiles, amphibians and birds. ""This report is looking at the global picture and the need to act soon in order to start reversing these trends,"" said Louise McRae of ZSL. The data has been used for modelling work to look at what might be needed to reverse the decline. Research published in the journal Nature suggests that to turn the tide we must transform the way we produce and consume food, including reducing food waste and eating food with a lower environmental impact. The African grey parrot is endangered due to habitat loss and wildlife trade Prof Dame Georgina Mace of UCL said conservation actions alone wouldn't be sufficient to ""bend the curve on biodiversity loss"". ""It will require actions from other sectors, and here we show that the food system will be particularly important, both from the agricultural sector on the supply side, and consumers on the demand side,"" she said. Extinction data is compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has evaluated more than 100,000 species of plants and animals, with more than 32,000 species threatened with extinction. Elephants are under threat from poaching and habitat loss In 2019, an intergovernmental panel of scientists concluded that one million species (500,000 animals and plants, and 500,000 insects) are threatened with extinction, some within decades. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' The WWF report is one of many assessments of the state of nature being published in the coming weeks and months in the build-up to a major summit next year. The UN will reveal next Tuesday its latest assessment of the state of nature worldwide. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Three children were seriously injured in the crash Three children were seriously injured when their school bus hit a railway bridge. The double-decker's roof was torn off in the crash in Wellhouse Lane, Winchester, shortly after 08:10 BST. Pupils from Henry Beaufort School ""started screaming"" when the roof fell on top of them, leaving a further 12 needing treatment for minor injuries. Bus operator Stagecoach South said an investigation was under way. No arrests have been made. The three badly hurt children were taken to hospital. Twelve other youngsters, two of whom were also taken to hospital, suffered minor injuries, Hampshire Constabulary said. All pupils on board were aged between 11 and 16, the force said. Poppy, 11, who was sitting on the top deck of the bus, said the children had noticed the driver was ""going on a completely different route"" in the moments before the crash. She said a metal pole struck her on the head and others were hurt by breaking glass. ""There was blood everywhere - everyone was in a rush to get down, but we were all trying to help each other,"" she added. Zoe was on the top deck of the bus when the crash happened Zoe, 14, who was also on the top deck, said the roof fell in on top of everyone ""and everyone started screaming"". ""It felt like 'am I going to live or am I going to die' - everyone was crying and shaking, it was a huge shock,"" she said. Fifteen-year-old Robert, who was on the lower deck of the bus, said: ""I heard crashing upstairs. I thought we'd hit the side of the tunnel, then I saw the top of the bus falling down. ""Most of the people hurt just had cuts and were bleeding. But there were some people with bad injuries."" The children on board were all aged between 11 and 16 Insp Andy Tester, of Hampshire Constabulary, said it was ""very lucky"" nobody was killed. ""That bus doesn't fit through the bridge - I can't think that a bus route would have been drawn [up] to take it through a bridge that is too low for the bus,"" he said. The bridge has a warning sign above it that states vehicles with a height of more than 12ft (3.6m) should not enter. The bus involved in the crash was believed to be about 14ft (4.3m) in height. The bus had been on its way to Henry Beaufort School Sue Hearle, head teacher of the Henry Beaufort School, said: ""This is a distressing incident and we are extremely relieved that it wasn't more serious."" She added she did not want to speculate on the circumstances of the crash and would be focusing on supporting the children affected. A spokesperson for Stagecoach South said: ""Our thoughts are with the children and their families. ""We are carrying out an internal investigation into the circumstances involved in the incident and we will continue to provide the emergency services with our full support."" The road remains closed between the junction with Andover Road North to School Lane. Hampshire County Council said staff were providing support to the school ""including our education psychology team to help students and staff to deal with any trauma they may experience"".

"The EU is demanding the UK ditches plans to change Boris Johnson's Brexit deal ""by the end of the month"" or risk jeopardising trade talks. The UK has published a bill to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement it signed in January. The EU said this had ""seriously damaged trust"" and it would not be ""shy"" of taking legal action against the UK. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK had made it ""perfectly clear"" it would not withdraw the bill. The government says Parliament is sovereign and can pass laws which breach the UK's international treaty obligations. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""trust and confidence are and will be key"", after the latest round of UK-EU trade talks wrapped up in London on Thursday. His UK counterpart David Frost said ""significant"" differences remained over a free trade deal, but added discussions would continue in Brussels next week. Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans Chicken, cheese, cod: The tricky trade talk menu The source of the EU's concern is Mr Johnson's proposed Internal Market Bill,which was published on Wednesday,external. It addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The bill proposes no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. It gives UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The publication of the bill prompted emergency talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and Maros Å efÄoviÄ, the European Commission Vice-President. After two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage, however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. Read more from Laura here. Following the discussions, the EU issued a strongly-worded statement warning that the withdrawal agreement was a legal obligation, adding that ""neither the EU nor the UK can unilaterally change, clarify, amend, interpret, disregard or disapply the agreement"". The EU rejected the UK's arguments that the bill is designed to protect peace in Northern Ireland arguing that ""it does the opposite"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that if the bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an ""extremely serious violation"" of the withdrawal agreement and of international law. He urged the government to withdraw the bill ""by the end of the month"", adding that the withdrawal agreement ""contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text - which the European Union will not be shy in using"". Germany's UK ambassador said he had not experienced ""such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation"" in his diplomatic career. ""If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don't accept it,"" hetweeted,external. Michael Gove arrives at the Cabinet Office ahead of talks with EU officials In its response, the UK government said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""in the difficult and highly exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations. Parliament would not be acting unconstitutionally in enacting such legislation. ""Treaty obligations only become binding to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation. Whether to enact or repeal legislation, and the content of that legislation, is for Parliament and Parliament alone."" Mr Gove ""said that, during the talks, he had ""made it perfectly clear that we would not be withdrawing this legislation"", adding that the government was ""absolutely serious"". The Internal Market Bill will be formally debated by MPs in Parliament for the first time on Monday, 14 September. It has come under increasing criticism from Conservative parliamentarians. Former party leader Lord Howard said it would damage the UK's ""reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law"", while former Chancellor Lord Lamont asked ministers to ""think again"". But Mr Gove said: ""I'm looking forward to the second reading of the bill next week. It's an opportunity for the government to set out in detail why we have this legislation."" He promised to fight for ""unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson has defended the bill, saying it would ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales, while protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. But critics say the move will damage the UK's international reputation aftera minister admitted the plans break international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". Meanwhile, the latest round of formal talks over a post-Brexit trade deal concluded in London on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, Mr Barnier said the EU had ""shown flexibility"" in an effort to ""find solutions"", but the UK had not ""not engaged"" on some ""major issues"". For the UK side, Lord Frost said ""challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant"". He said the UK negotiators ""remain committed"" to reaching a deal by the middle of October and officials would ""continue discussions"" next week.

"British Airways owner IAG is cutting more flights over the next three months as it adjusts to the continuing collapse in demand for air travel. IAG, which also runs Aer Lingus and Iberia, said quarantine restrictions meant capacity this autumn would be 60% below 2019 levels. The group said it had seen a ""delayed recovery"", and did not expect business to return to 2019 levels until 2023. IAG also said BA had reached the outline of a jobs agreement with Unite. The union has been in a bitter dispute with BA over redundancies and pay cuts for cabin crew. BA has already reached a separate deal with pilots. The airline, which is aiming to shed up to 13,000 jobs, said that by the end of August some 8,236 employees had left the business, ""mostly as a result of voluntary redundancy"". Unite stressed its cabin crew members still needed to approve the plan through a ballot and that negotiations remained ongoing. ""Unless and until Unite members agree to all and any proposals, no settlement has been reached and it is unhelpful and misleading for British Airways to suggest otherwise,"" said assistant general secretary Howard Beckett. IAG's decision to cut more flights than planned follows its previous forecast of a 46% reduction for the October-to-December period compared with the same quarter last year. Virgin Atlantic to cut 1,150 more jobs Gatwick Airport plans 600 jobs cuts It said it had seen an ""almost complete cessation of new booking activity"" in April and May due to the pandemic, but the easing of country lockdowns boosted ticket sales in June. However, since July there had been an ""overall levelling off in bookings"" as the UK and other European countries re-imposed quarantine requirements for travellers returning from countries such as Spain. On Tuesday, EasyJet revealed it will have flown ""slightly less"" than the 40% of pre-coronavirus pandemic capacity it previously said it would operate between July and September following the government's decision to impose quarantine restrictions for seven Greek islands. Airlines are among the firms hardest hit by the impact of the pandemic. British Airways plans to cut up to 13,000 jobs due to the crisis, while EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic are slashing 4,500 roles each. Operators say the UK's travel quarantine policy - which requires visitors to high risk countries to isolate on their return - is crushing demand and want the government to back testing at airports instead. UK government sources have indicated that they are looking at system where the two tests would be eight days apart to further minimise the risk of ""false negative"" results. They are yet to approve the idea, however, while the prime minister last week warned testing at airports could give a ""false sense of security"". In a joint letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday, Airlines UK, whose members include BA, Virgin, Ryanair and EasyJet, called for an extensions of the jobs furlough scheme and air passenger duty waiver. ""Our industry is in crisis,"" the letter said. ""In sum, we ask you to act urgently to implement a programme of recovery for our sector."" IAG also announced on Thursday that it was tapping shareholders for â¬2.7bn (Â£2.5bn) to help shore up its finances. The company said the money would be used to reduce debt and help it withstand a prolonged downturn in travel. Under the fundraising, existing investors will buy new shares at a deeply discounted price - 36% below the closing price on Wednesday. The group's largest shareholder, Qatar Airways, which has a 25.1% holding, has said it will buy its full entitlement. Details of the rights issue, which was announced in July, come two days after new chief executive Luis Gallego took over from long-time boss Willie Walsh.

"The whistleblower says Chad Wolf (left) told him to stop giving analysis on Russian interference An intelligence analyst at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said he was put under pressure to downplay the threat of Russian interference in the 3 November election as it ""made the president look bad"". In a whistleblower complaint, Brian Murphy said he had been demoted for refusing to alter reports on this and other issues such as white supremacy. The directives were illegal, he said. The White House and DHS have both denied the allegations. US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election but President Donald Trump has rejected allegations that his election victory was influenced by Russia, at times questioning findings from his own agencies. An inquiry led by former FBI director Robert Mueller found no evidence of a criminal conspiracybetween Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. Mr Murphy's complaint was released by the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee, which has asked Mr Murphy to testify to Congress later in the month. The whistleblower reprisal complaint, filed on Tuesday, sets out a number of allegations,externalagainst former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, current Acting Secretary Chad Wolf and his deputy, Ken Cuccinelli. Mr Murphy says that, between March 2018 and August 2020, there was a ""repeated pattern of abuse of authority, attempted censorship of intelligence analysis and improper administration of an intelligence program related to Russian efforts to influence and undermine US interests"". He says he was instructed by Mr Wolf in mid-May to ""cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference... and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran"". These instructions came directly from White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, the complaint says. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Mr Murphy refused to comply ""as doing so would put the country in substantial and specific danger"" but, in July, he was told the intelligence report should be ""held"" because it ""made the president look bad"". The complaint says Mr Murphy was then removed from future meetings and effectively demoted. He is seeking to be reinstated as principal deputy undersecretary in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. Mr Murphy says he was under pressure from the White House to exaggerate the number of migrants with links to terrorism at a time when the administration was implementing tougher measures to halt the flow of undocumented migrants reaching the US-Mexico border, and making the case for a wall. ""[Mr Murphy] declined to censor or manipulate the intelligence information,"" the complaint says. The whistleblower accused Kirstjen Nielsen of giving false testimony to two House committees The complaint also alleges that former Secretary Nielsen knowingly provided ""false material information"" about known or suspected terrorists apprehended at the border during testimony before two House committees, in December 2018 and March 2019. He said Ms Nielsen's testimony in March 2019 had included an inflated number and ""constituted a knowing and deliberate submission of false material information"".Ms Nielsen resigned from the post a month later,following complaints from Mr Trump that she was not tough enough on immigration. The complaint also details a clash with Mr Cuccinelli over a report in May into the threat posed by white supremacist groups, alleging that Mr Cuccinelli had ordered changes ""in a manner that made the threat appear less severe"". Mr Murphy was also allegedly directed by both Mr Wolf and Mr Cuccinelli to ""modify intelligence assessments"" on left-wing groups such as antifa ""to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump"". Mr Trump has frequently blamed antifa - short for ""anti-fascist"", a loosely affiliated network of mainly far-left activists - for much of the violence that broke out across the US during protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody in May. White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said: ""Ambassador O'Brien has never sought to dictate the Intelligence Community's focus on threats to the integrity of our elections or on any other topic; any contrary suggestion by a disgruntled former employee, who he has never met or heard of, is false and defamatory."" The Department of Homeland Security also rejected the allegations, with spokesperson Alexei Woltornist saying: ""We flatly deny that there is any truth to the merits of Mr Murphy's claim."" But Adam Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said: ""We will get to the bottom of this, expose any and all misconduct or corruption to the American people, and put a stop to the politicization of intelligence.""

"This video can not be played Stonehaven derailment: Work to remove train carriages begins Network Rail has admitted that the impact of climate change on its network ""is an area that is accelerating faster than our assumptions"". It said a fatal derailment near Stonehaven on 12 August showed that the industry must improve its response to extreme weather. The driver, conductor and a passenger died when the Aberdeen to Glasgow service crashed after heavy rain. An interim report said the train hit washed-out rocks and gravel. The report by Network Rail assessed the current controls and management of thousands of miles of earthworks - the sloped ground beside railway tracks. Work to remove derailed train carriages to begin Crash investigators confirm train struck landslip It saw hundreds of sites across the country being inspected by engineers, specialist contractors and helicopters over the past three weeks to identify any issues requiring emergency intervention. The report highlighted the need to deploy more technology across the network to predict failures. And it said investment in better weather forecasting was needed to enable local decisions to be made in advance. Thereport,externalalso suggested that industry rules for reporting and responding to heavy rainfall is improved. It said that this would help signallers to better manage services during bad weather. The report notes: ""Climate change considerations are being embedded in our standards and planning. ""But it is clear from the impact of severe weather events experienced in recent years that this is an area that is accelerating faster than our assumptions, and as a result it has become even more important to implement these plans."" Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury died after the train left the tracks Other plans include having discussions with meteorologists to understand how real-time information can be used to inform train information during unpredictable extreme weather. The report was commissioned by the UK Department for Transport following the deaths of driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62. It was published as work involving a 600-tonne lifting crane got under way to remove the carriages. A previous report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch said the train had turned back towards Aberdeen after reports of a landslip further down the track. The six-vehicle train had travelled more than a mile when it was derailed at Carmont after hitting a separate landslip. The track curved to the right, but investigators said the train continued in a straight line for about 100 yards before hitting the parapet of a bridge. The locomotive at the front of the train continued over the bridge and fell down an embankment, as did the third passenger carriage. The first passenger carriage came to rest on its roof, at right angles to the track, with the second passenger carriage on top of it. The fourth passenger carriage remained upright and also came to rest on top of the first carriage. It was still attached to the rear locomotive. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said they owed it to those who died or were injured in the incident to ""learn and act on every possible lesson to ensure this is never repeated"". And he pledged that the independent investigation would ""enable us to understand exactly what went wrong, and make sure it does not happen again"". The train came off the tracks as it attempted to return to Stonehaven He added: ""We will use the findings of this interim report to improve, shape and accelerate our work to build a more robust and resilient rail network, so that our railway continues to be one of the safest in the world."" Mr Shapps also said he would be writing to Scotland's chief constable to recommend that PC Liam Mercer, who was one of the first on the scene, be commended for his bravery.

"Cosmetics giant L'Oreal is introducing make-up recycling bins across 1,000 UK stores in an environmental push. Its Maybelline brand and recycling firm TerraCycle will install the recycling points in branches of Tesco, Boots, Sainsbury's and Superdrug. L'Oreal's UK boss said the firm wants to ""lead the way"" in creating beauty recycling habits. But Greenpeace said without reducing single-use plastic production, firms ""cannot claim they are doing enough"". From Thursday, consumers can drop off empty make-up products from any brand at the recycling bins in participating Tesco and Superdrug stores,which can be found online,external. Boots and Sainsbury's will follow at the end of September. Selfridges to offer clothing rental in environmental push Morrisons considers ditching all 'bags for life' for paper Compacts, eyeshadow palettes, foundation or concealer tubes, mascara, eyeliner and lip products will be accepted, although make-up brushes, nail polish and aerosols will not. The used items will be collected from the shops, sorted, cleaned and recycled into plastic pellets, which can be used to make other products, such as outdoor furniture. Chains such as The Body Shop and skincare specialist Kiehl's, which is also owned by L'Oreal, already offer customers rewards for returning empty products to stores to be recycled. Vismay Sharma, country manager of L'Oreal UK and Ireland, told the BBC that the firm had the ""ability to make impact at real scale"". The recycling bins will be introduced across 1,000 UK shops Nearly half of make-up wearers did not know that recycling beauty products was possible, according to a recent survey of more than 1,000 consumers by Maybelline. Asked what differentiates Maybelline and TerraCycle's new ""Make-up Not Make Waste"" scheme from other similar ones, Stephen Clarke, head of communications at TerraCycle, said that the number of stores participating meant it would be easier for consumers to recycle their beauty buys. He also said the firm can recycle mixed materials, such as compacts with mirrors, as well as beauty items with pumps and triggers, which local councils won't necessarily do. However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace said that ""recycling will only ever get us so far"". Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Given the almost daily torrent of research revealing the extent to which plastic pollution is damaging our planet, it's frustrating to see a major plastic producer like the make-up industry fail to commit to reduce its overall plastic footprint. ""Without action plans to move towards reusable packaging and reduce single-use plastic production, companies cannot claim they are doing enough."" More than 120 billion units of packaging are produced globally every year by the cosmetics industry alone, according to the Zero Waste Week campaign. L'Oreal told the BBC that its global consumption of plastic totalled 137,000 tonnes in 2019. The cosmetics firm has pledged that 100% of its plastic packaging will be refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Mr Sharma also said that the firm was dedicating â¬50m (Â£45.4m) to investing in recycling or plastic waste-related projects.

"Ronald Bell (right) with brother and fellow band member Robert in 2014 Ronald Bell, one of the founder members of 1970s and 1980s pop group Kool & the Gang, has died at the age of 68. He started the band with his brother Robert ""Kool"" Bell in 1964. They became one of the era's most popular and influential soul and funk bands, with hits including Celebration, Ladies' Night and Get Down On It. Their music also featured in several films including Saturday Night Fever, for which they received a Grammy in 1978, and Pulp Fiction. Bell died at his home in the US Virgin Islands with his wife by his side, his publicist said. The cause of death was not given. A self-taught saxophonist and singer, he founded the group in New Jersey with Robert and five schoolfriends - Dennis Thomas, Robert Mickens, Charles Smith, George Brown and Ricky Westfield. The band released 23 albums across their career Their career was split into two distinct halves. In the early 70s, they scored US hits with the foot-stomping funk of songs like Jungle Boogie and Hollywood Swinging. Then, with the addition of vocalist  James ""JT"" Taylor in 1979, they morphed into a hit-making R&B band, scoring the biggest commercial success of their career as they reached their 20th anniversary. As musical director, Bell co-wrote all of their biggest hits, including the wedding disco classic Celebration. BBC Music: Kool & The Gang It was his ""favourite song"" from the band's extensive back catalogue, he told the Reuters news agency in 2008. ""I had no clue, you know,"" he said. ""I was clueless, thinking that that was going to be a hit. I had no idea. ""But after all these years, there are times at the end of the show when I see all of these people singing a song, and after all of an hour and a half, you ask them to jump up and down and they still jump up and down. That's kind of overwhelming for me."" The group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015 for their contribution to the world of entertainment, and were inducted into the Songwriters' Hall Of Fame in 2018. Bell was born and raised in Ohio, and picked up the music bug from his father, a professional boxer who was a close friend of jazz musicians Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. Unable to afford drums, he and his brother taught themselves to play on makeshift instruments. ""I used to beat paint cans like bongos, and depending on how much paint was inside, this would determine the tone of the sounds we made,"" he later recalled. After the family moved to New Jersey in his teens, Bell's mother bought him a real set of bongos and he began to teach himself bass guitar, borrowing an instrument from the brother of his future bandmate Robert ""Spike"" Mickens. The first incarnation of Kool & The Gang formed in 1964, but they cycled through several names - including Jazziacs, The New Dimensions, The Soul Town Band, the Jazz Birds and Kool & the Flames before settling on their final moniker in 1969. Along the way, they combined their love of jazz with the gritty rhythms of street funk, creating a sound that would lead to their success in the 1970s. ""We used to play a lot of percussion in the streets in the 60s, go to the park and start beating on drums and stuff in the street,""Bell told Rolling Stone,external. ""You had a hard time trying to get us to play R&B,"" he added. ""We were die-hard jazz musicians. We're not stooping to that."" Robert (left) and Ronald Bell in the studio in the 1970s As the Jazz Birds, they won the Apollo Theater's famed Amateur Night and landed a record deal with a small label called De-Lite Records. Three singles from their self-titled debut album hit the pop charts, with the instrumental track Kool & The Gang showcasing their raucous, horn-driven sound. Their mainstream breakthrough came with 1973's Wild and Peaceful album. Lead singleFunky Stuff,externalbecame their first top 40 hit in the US, followed byJungle Boogie,externalandHollywood Swinging,external, which both reached the top 10. Jungle Boogie went on to become one of their signature songs - used in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and sampled in Madonna's Erotica. It was only written after the band's record label, in search of a top 10 single, pressured Kool & The Gang to record a cover of Soul Makossa by Manu Dibango. ""It would have been a hit,""Bell later recalled,external. ""But we decided we were not going to record Soul Makossa - we'll come up with our own 'jungle music', not to be derogatory. ""We made the song up in the rehearsal, went in and recorded it that night. Jungle Boogie is one take."" As disco rose to prominence, the band struggled to replicate their early success - although they did win a Grammy forOpen Sesame,external, their contribution to the multi-million-selling Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Things changed with the addition of Taylor, a former nightclub singer, and producer Eumir Deodato, which led to a cleaner, pop-driven sound and the crossover single Ladies' Night. The decision was prompted when the band found themselves on tour with the Jacksons and were told by the promoter that they needed a frontman. Taylor, chosen for his deep baritone ""like Nat King Cole"", was the only singer they auditioned. Unlike many of the funk bands of the 70s, Kool & The Gang thrived in the 1980s, scoring huge hits with sentimental ballads likeJoanna,externalandCherish,external, as well as the party anthemsSteppin' Out,externalandGet Down On It,external, which is now their most-streamed song on Spotify. The band won an outstanding contribution prize at the 2003 Mobo Awards Possibly their most enduring hit is Celebration, which was inspired by Bell's Islamic faith. ""I was reading the scripture about where God called the angels together, and made an announcement that he was going to create this being,""he told Songwriter Universe,external. ""He gathered the angels together and they said, 'We don't know nothin', but we just celebrate you, God - we celebrate and praise you.'"" ""And I thought, I'm going to write a song about that, [with the line] 'Everyone around the worldâ¦Come on!' ""That's the intent... it was actually written for mankind."" Allow YouTube content?

The group found a new generation of fans in the 80s and 90s as their music was sampled in a raft of pop and hip-hop songs. Jungle Boogie,external's horn riff appears in Luniz'sI Got 5 On It,external;Summer Madness,externalformed the basis ofSummertime,externalby DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince; and the syncopated rhythms ofJungle Jazz,externalappear on dozens of tracks, from MARRS'sPump Up The Volume,externalto Jade'sDon't Walk Away,external. When Public Enemy sampled three separate Kool & The Gang songs for Fear of a Black Planet, Bell voiced his approval. ""After Public Enemy, I was all in [with hip-hop],"" he told Rolling Stone in 2015. ""The music was all new to me. I sat and listened to Fear of a Black Planet and was thrilled. I thought that was amazing. ""You can practically hear [drummer] George [Brown] playing that break beat. You can hear our music in the background. You know it was compound and compact, but you can hear Kool & the Gang music in all that hip-hop."" The rise of hip-hop and the departure of Taylor in 1989 effectively ended Kool & The Gang's presence on the charts, but Bell continued to record and tour with the group as a legacy act in the 1990s and 2000s. At the time of his death, he was working on a solo album called Kool Baby Brotha Band, as well as a series of animations about the band's childhood and career. In an interview with Billboard last year, he said he felt grateful to have had a career in music. ""And for it to be this long,""he added,external. ""For me, I'm most grateful for that, to still be relevant since [we were] 19."" The musician is survived by his wife Tia Sinclair Bell and 10 children; as well as his brother Robert and three other siblings. The family will hold a private funeral service, and have asked that fans donate to the children's charity the Boys and Girls Club of America.

"The government should ban placing under-18s in care in unregulated homes amid concerns over sexual and criminal exploitation, the children's commissioner for England has said. Some vulnerable teenagers are ""at risk every day of the week"", Anne Longfield told BBC Newsnight. She called them ""inappropriate"" places for any child. The government is consulting on proposals to introduce new minimum standards to the sector. Ithas already told local authorities to stop placing under 16s in these homes. But Ms Longfield said the plans do not address ""the real problem"" of allowing older teenagers aged 16 and over in care to be placed in such accommodation. One in eight children in care - around 12,000 - spent time in an unregulated home in 2018-19, her report reveals. It comes following a year long investigation by BBC Newsnight into the care sector. Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Children 'to be banned' from unregulated homes Sent-away children are 'easy victims' It also highlights evidence that providers linked to organised crime are exploiting the lack of regulation to gain access to children. Police have told her that criminality in the sector is ""rife"" and children are being groomed to sell drugs and for sexual exploitation. Unlike children's homes registered with Ofsted, unregulated homes - often known as semi-independent or supported accommodation - are not inspected by a regulator in England or Wales. The hostels, flats, bedsits and even caravans come with differing levels of staff support to help 16 to 18-year olds gain independence. Three-quarters (73%) of the sector is privately run and ""allows for high profit-making without the checks and balances that are seen in other care settings"", Ms Longfield said. Children's Minister Vicky Ford said the government was taking steps to drive up the quality of care provided to vulnerable children.

"This video can not be played Scotland sets 'rule of six' for people meeting up The number of people allowed to meet up in Scotland has been cut to six amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic ""accelerating"". It came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a ""tightening and extension"" of lockdown rules. Changes planned for next week have been put back until at least 5 October. It means that theatres, live music venues, indoor soft play facilities and indoor contact sports will not now open next Monday. Until now, eight people from three households had been allowed to meet indoors in Scotland, and up to 15 from five households outdoors. This will change to six people from two households, and will apply both indoors and outdoors - including in homes, gardens, pubs and restaurants. Children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, however. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland What are the latest lockdown rules in Scotland? New Scottish contact tracing app goes live The changes also mean spectators will not be able to return to sports stadia and other venues over the next three weeks - although two pilot events due take place at the weekend will still happen. Scotland is currently recording three times more positive cases of the virus on average each day than it was three weeks ago - with a further 161 cases being logged on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon said the spread of the virus was accelerating - albeit from a low base and not as rapidly as it was back in March and April. She said this was ""not entirely unexpected"" given the recent steps to reopen the economy - but that further planned moves to lift lockdown had to be put on pause for now. The first minister said: ""Right now, given the rise in cases, it's the only responsible decision we can reach."" Ms Sturgeon also said the reopening of offices and call centres will ""definitely not take place"" before October, saying that ""for now, working from home will remain the default position"". The move to cut the number of people who can meet followsa similar move announced for Englandon Wednesday. There will be ""limited exceptions"" to the rules for organised sports, places of worship and wedding and funeral services - which will be capped at 20 guests. The new limits will officially come into force on Monday, although Ms Sturgeon said that she was asking people to immediately abide by the stricter new limits on gatherings. Scotland's music industry has warned many venues may not survive the coronavirus lockdown It will also become mandatory for staff working in hospitality premises such as pubs and restaurants to wear face coverings, and for customers to wear them while moving around. Ms Sturgeon admitted the new announcements would be ""hard for people to hear"", but said they were necessary. She said the rise in new cases was ""not as rapid as it was earlier in the year"" and that prevalence of the virus was lower ""thanks to the individual sacrifices that so any of you have made for the greater good"". She said: ""We have grounds for cautious hope, but we have no grounds for complacency. It is vital to do everything we can to stop cases rising further before winter. ""These steps are necessary to help curb a virus that we know spreads rapidly whenever it gets the chance."" She insisted that the Test and Protect contact tracing system was ""working well"", adding that without this ""the virus would be spreading further and faster, and we would require to apply much stricter lockdown measures again"". The Scottish Conservatives asked the government to consider moving more towards a strategy of mass community testing to complement Test and Protect. The party's Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, said: ""Experts have said that mass community testing must also be part of the solution, if we are going to succeed in keeping the virus supressed through the winter. ""I would also urge the government to continue their work with Scotland's airports on a testing regime. ""The aviation sector needs all the help it can get, and stopping the virus will only be possible if we reach everyone coming into the country who may need to quarantine.""

"The app can be downloaded free onto a mobile phone More than 600,000 people have downloaded Scotland's new contact tracing app since it went live. It became available to download free on to a smart phone from Apple's App Store or Google Play on Thursday. The Protect Scotland app lets people know if they have been in close contact with someone who later tests positive. The Scottish government has said the software will support the Test and Protect system and is ""another tool in the fight against Covid-19"". Up until now, contact tracing has been done manually using a method followed for years to help control the spread of infectious diseases. How does Scotland's new contact tracing app work? How to download Scotland's contact tracing app,external Coronavirus in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged as many people as possible to get involved in the new tracing scheme. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber on Thursday afternoon, she said: ""The more people that sign up the better. Everybody who signs up is making a contribution."" She told MSPs that the number of people who had downloaded the app had stood at 150,000 before she left her office to speak in parliament. During First Minister's Questions, she said the number had climbed to 200,000 since she had taken to her feet, which she described as ""very positive"". By 12:15 on Friday, that had risen above 600,000. Scotland has followed Northern Ireland in choosing to use the toolkit provided by Apple and Google to build a contact tracing app which has privacy built in. Both have moved quickly by using the software developed for Ireland's app. Scotland did at first seem inclined to work with the NHSX England app team, which for months pursued a centralised app collecting more data, without the co-operation of the tech giants. But seeing some knotty technical issues with the English app they then decided to follow many other countries going down the Apple/Google route. One person close to the Scottish project said ""using something that the tech giants had created was easier than trying to create stuff ourselves"". England also eventually changed tack and hasbeen testing an app based on the Apple Google toolkit for the last monthon the Isle of Wight and the London borough of Newham. But there's still no word on a national rollout - and it seems England, which once saw a contact tracing app as a vital weapon in the battle against the virus, is now happy to be a follower rather than a leader in this technology. With 64,000 downloads by 09:00 on launch day, the Test and Protect team feel their app has got away to a good start - but the real question is whether it will help speed up warnings to people who may have been close to someone infected with the virus. It will be weeks before we know whether the app is an effective tool. Some iPhone users have reported not being able to download the app because they are not running iOS 13. The iPhone 6 and older models launched before 2015 cannot run Apple's latest operating system. Android phone users will also need to be running at least the Android 6.0 operating system, which was launched in 2015,the Protect.scot website says,external. Asked at First Minister's Questions about people who did not use smartphones, Ms Sturgeon said the more people who used the app, the more effective it would be. But the first minister told MSPs that the Scottish government had not based its entire test and protect system on a proximity tracing app. ""We've built it from the bottom up using tried and tested approaches in our public health teams and the app is an enhancement to that,"" she said. ""So if you don't have a phone, if you don't use the app, you will not be missed from our test and protect system."" Research by Ofcom from 2017,externalsuggested that about 3.2m adults in Scotland owned a smartphone. The new app uses Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in prolonged close contact with someone who subsequently tests positive for Covid-19. When an individual initially tests positive for the virus, they are contacted by phone in the usual way. The contact tracer will ask them if they are an app user and if they are willing to use the app's upload function to anonymously alert close contacts. If they agree, they will be sent a unique code to their mobile which unlocks this function on the app. By sharing their positive test result in this way, the information will form part of an anonymous database. The app on other users' phones regularly checks this database to see if they have been in contact with an infected person. A warning is automatically issued when a match is found and users are then urged to get tested or self-isolate for 14 days. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"Cosmetics giant L'Oreal is introducing make-up recycling bins across 1,000 UK stores in an environmental push. Its Maybelline brand and recycling firm TerraCycle will install the recycling points in branches of Tesco, Boots, Sainsbury's and Superdrug. L'Oreal's UK boss said the firm wants to ""lead the way"" in creating beauty recycling habits. But Greenpeace said without reducing single-use plastic production, firms ""cannot claim they are doing enough"". From Thursday, consumers can drop off empty make-up products from any brand at the recycling bins in participating Tesco and Superdrug stores,which can be found online,external. Boots and Sainsbury's will follow at the end of September. Selfridges to offer clothing rental in environmental push Morrisons considers ditching all 'bags for life' for paper Compacts, eyeshadow palettes, foundation or concealer tubes, mascara, eyeliner and lip products will be accepted, although make-up brushes, nail polish and aerosols will not. The used items will be collected from the shops, sorted, cleaned and recycled into plastic pellets, which can be used to make other products, such as outdoor furniture. Chains such as The Body Shop and skincare specialist Kiehl's, which is also owned by L'Oreal, already offer customers rewards for returning empty products to stores to be recycled. Vismay Sharma, country manager of L'Oreal UK and Ireland, told the BBC that the firm had the ""ability to make impact at real scale"". The recycling bins will be introduced across 1,000 UK shops Nearly half of make-up wearers did not know that recycling beauty products was possible, according to a recent survey of more than 1,000 consumers by Maybelline. Asked what differentiates Maybelline and TerraCycle's new ""Make-up Not Make Waste"" scheme from other similar ones, Stephen Clarke, head of communications at TerraCycle, said that the number of stores participating meant it would be easier for consumers to recycle their beauty buys. He also said the firm can recycle mixed materials, such as compacts with mirrors, as well as beauty items with pumps and triggers, which local councils won't necessarily do. However, environmental campaign group Greenpeace said that ""recycling will only ever get us so far"". Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ""Given the almost daily torrent of research revealing the extent to which plastic pollution is damaging our planet, it's frustrating to see a major plastic producer like the make-up industry fail to commit to reduce its overall plastic footprint. ""Without action plans to move towards reusable packaging and reduce single-use plastic production, companies cannot claim they are doing enough."" More than 120 billion units of packaging are produced globally every year by the cosmetics industry alone, according to the Zero Waste Week campaign. L'Oreal told the BBC that its global consumption of plastic totalled 137,000 tonnes in 2019. The cosmetics firm has pledged that 100% of its plastic packaging will be refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Mr Sharma also said that the firm was dedicating â¬50m (Â£45.4m) to investing in recycling or plastic waste-related projects.

"This video can not be played Ayaan, Mikaeel and their community have raised thousands for the Yemen crisis Two best friends who set up a lemonade stand to raise money for the people of Yemen received a donation from a very unexpected source - Angelina Jolie. Six-year-olds Ayaan Moosa and Mikaeel Ishaaq, from east London, created the stand after learning aboutthe crisis.

"This video can not be played Earlier this year, the BBC's Rebecca Morelle heard the views of four citizens' assembly members A frequent flyer tax, phasing out polluting SUVs and restricting cars in city centres are among climate change solutions suggested by members of the public. A citizens' assembly of 108 people from all walks of life published its report after weeks of debate. They proposed curbing road building and using the pandemic to cut emissions. MPs said the report offered a ""unique insight"", but activists Extinction Rebellion said it didn't go far enough. The report says the government must show leadership on climate change and insists climate policies must be fair to all â especially the poorest in society. Its radical conclusions may offer political cover to ministers whoâre typically nervous of a public backlash against policies that affect lifestyles. The group, orcitizens' assembly,was set up by six government select committees - groups of MPs who look at what the government is doing and scrutinise policy. Members of the assembly were chosen to represent a spectrum of views from all over the UK and committed 60 hours of their time to studying and debating climate change. They met over six weekends and were asked how to come up with ideas to help the UK achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Their conclusions have been published in a report that is more than 550 pages. What is the Climate Assembly? Climate assembly considers flying bananas The members said it was ""imperative that there is strong and clear leadership from governmentâ to tackle climate change. One member, Sue, from Bath, said: âEven with the country still reeling from coronavirus, itâs clear the majority of us feel prioritising net zero policy is not only important, but achievable.â Hamish, a software engineer from rural Aberdeenshire, told BBC News the government needed ""to develop a long-term strategy to help usâ. A key theme of the report is education. Ibrahim, a GP from Surrey, said: âThe media has to take a role - schools as well. We perhaps need to look at the curriculum. âYou canât go to someone and say âyou need to switch to the hydrogen boiler because itâs low CO2â but they have no idea [about it]. Youâre more likely to get a buy-in from people when they know about the issues.â This video can not be played Leia and Ibrahim are two of the 108 members of the public who worked on the report Members said the government should start phasing out the sale of polluting new vehicles such as SUVs, and clamp down on adverts for highly-polluting goods. Another central message is the need for policies to be fair. Amanda, from Kent, said: âElectric cars have to be more affordable to everybody - not just people who earn enough money.â They also supported higher taxes on frequent fliers, and investment in clean aviation technology. What is climate change? A really simple guide Climate change: What do all the terms mean? Covid crisis does little to slow climate change Tracey, a mother from Northern Ireland, said: âI would be a frequent flier myself â so I would say there needs to be something there to stop us from taking so many flights â to reduce our emissions.â On the subject of what we eat and how we use the land, the assembly urged a voluntary cut of 20-40% in eating red meat. âThe government can't legislate against eating red meat,"" Amanda told us, ""but with education, advertising and labelling I think we can change their attitudes towards eating red meat - as we did with smoking."" They also said: Businesses should make products using less energy and materials People should repair goods and share more, instead of owning all their appliances The UK should get more power from offshore and onshore wind, and solar power New housing developments must have good access to facilities through walking and cycling Most members were not very keen on nuclear - or on burning wood in power stations - and most werenât confident in carbon capture and storage. They think the government should be harnessing the Covid crisis to limit support for high-carbon industries. The MPs behind the assembly said the report ""provides a unique insight into the thinking of an informed public to the trade-offs and changes required to help deliver on the objective that parliament has agreed"". They said: ""Their work merits action.â Crispin Truman, from the countryside charity CPRE, said it shows ""public appetite to end the UKâs contribution to the climate emergency has far outstripped government action.â And Tom Burke, from the climate change think tank, e3g, added: âThis is a striking tribute to the common sense of the British public. There is a clear lesson for politicians and editors across the political spectrum about the role our citizens are capable of playing in shaping public policy.â However, radical green group Extinction Rebellion (XR) condemned the proposals as too timid to meet internationally-agreed proposals limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C. They warned that the report could get buried in government bureaucracy. The committees behind the report have asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson to respond before the end of the year. This may be challenging as, according to a recent report by the Institute for Government, Covid and Brexit have forced climate change down the governmentâs priority list - a claim the government denies. A government spokesperson said it would study the report. The organisers of the assembly have requested that only first names of members are used in the media.

"US President Donald Trump knew Covid-19 was deadlier than the flu before it hit the country but wanted to play down the crisis, according to a new book. Bob Woodward, who broke the Watergate scandal and is one of the nation's most respected journalists, interviewed Mr Trump 18 times from December to July. Mr Trump is quoted as telling him the virus was ""deadly stuff"" before the first US death was confirmed. Responding, the president said he had wanted to avoid causing public panic. Some 190,000 Americans have been recorded as dying with Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. On Wednesday, some US media released parts of the interviews between the president and the journalist, revealing his reported remarks on the outbreak as well as on race and other issues. Here are some of the key quotes so far from Rage, which will be released on 15 September. Mr Trump indicated that he knew more about the severity of the illness than he had said publicly. According to a tape of the call, Mr Trump told Woodward in February that the coronavirus was deadlier than the flu. This video can not be played How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus shifted between March and April ""It goes through the air,"" Mr Trump told the author on 7 February. ""That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. ""And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.""Â Later that month, Mr Trump promised the virus was ""very much under control"", and that the case count would soon be close to zero. He also publicly implied the flu was more dangerous than Covid-19. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus Speaking on Capitol Hill on 10 March, Mr Trump said: ""Just stay calm. It will go away."" From 2018: Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus has shifted Nine days later, after the White House declared the pandemic a national emergency, the president told Woodward: ""I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic."" In a tweet on Thursday, Mr Trump asked why Bob Woodward had not reported his quotes on Covid-19 earlier if he thought they were ""bad and dangerous"". ""He knew they were good and proper answers,"" Mr Trump said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking from the White House earlier on Wednesday, he told reporters: ""I don't want people to be frightened, I don't want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. ""We want to show confidence, we want to show strength."" The president - who is running for re-election in November - said the Woodward book was ""a political hit job"". Responding to reporters' questions on the book, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: ""The president never downplayed the virus, once again. The president expressed calm. The president was serious about this.""

Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent Leaders are responsible for keeping people calm but there is a fine line between avoiding panic and making a crisis worse. President Trump told Woodward Covid-19 was deadlier than the flu but in public he downplayed the danger. Other leaders took a different approach. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said bluntly that people would die: ""Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time."" Mr Trump often downplayed the virus from the beginning. In recent weeks, his advisers began speaking of the coronavirus in the past tense - as if the problem were gone. Scientists disagree, saying there is likely to be a surge in the autumn, following the pattern of other respiratory diseases. One fact is irrefutable, however. Mr Trump wants people to see him as a strong leader. He also wants them to go to the polls and vote - and not to worry about the virus. Mr Woodward writes that he brought up the Black Lives Matter protests in a conversation with the president on 19 June, suggesting that ""white, privileged"" people like themselves ought to work to understand how black Americans feel. ""You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you?"" Mr Trump said. ""Just listen to you."" The nationwide protests against police brutality and racism were sparked by George Floyd's death in Minnesota in May. Mr Trump also repeated the suggestion that he had done more for African Americans than any president aside from Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery. Later, on 8 July, Mr Trump again reiterated that he had ""done a tremendous amount for the black community"" but was ""not feeling any love"". The Washington Post also cited an interview where Woodward asked the president about whether America has systemic racism. Mr Trump said while these problems exist everywhere, ""I think probably less here than most places, or less here than many places"". The president also acknowledged racism affected the lives of people in the US, saying it was ""unfortunate"". Mr Woodward's book also cites dozens of letters between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. In the letters, filled with flowery language, Mr Kim reportedly referred to Mr Trump as ""Your Excellency"" and noted their ""deep and special friendship will work as a magical force"". According to US media, Mr Trump told Mr Woodward of his connection with Mr Kim: ""You meet a woman. In one second, you know whether or not it's going to happen. It doesn't take you 10 minutes and it doesn't take you six weeks. It's like, whoa. OK. You know? It takes somewhat less than a second."" In a tweet on Thursday, Mr Trump wrote: ""Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!"" There have been sporadic reports about Mr Kim's health,including one in April that he was seriously ill or even dead. Mr Trump also reportedly told Woodward that he felt his predecessor, Barack Obama, was ""highly overrated"". ""I don't think Obama's smart,"" Mr Trump reportedly said. ""And I don't think he's a great speaker."" According to CNN, Mr Trump told Mr Woodward he made President George W Bush ""look like a stupid moron, which he was"".

"Oregon Governor Kate Brown says the state could see the greatest loss of life and property from wildfires in its history Western US states are battling nearly 100 wildfires that have caused at least seven deaths, displaced thousands and destroyed whole towns. California, Washington state and Oregon have been the hardest hit by the blazes, fuelled by heat waves and windy conditions. Oregon's governor said this ""could be the greatest loss of human life and property"" to fires in state history. Nine other states in the region are also seeing wildfires raging. Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange Three deaths have been blamed on the wildfires in Oregon, with another three in California and one in Washington. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, there are 96 large fires in the western US. More than 3.4m acres have burned so far, with tens of thousands of acres burned in the last day in California, Oregon and Washington. Oregon officials said several towns have burned down in the fires, as winds gusted to 45mph (72km/h). A colour infrared satellite image shows destroyed homes after the Alameda Fire in Phoenix, Oregon: burned vegetation and property appear grey, surviving vegetation is in red The fires are blazing across Oregon's valleys and along the coast, causing mass evacuations. One Oregon evacuee, Jody Evans,told NewsChannel 21,externalabout her ordeal. ""Fire on both sides, winds blowing, ash flying - it was like driving through hell,"" she said. Red sky and thick smoke in Salem City, Oregon In neighbouring Washington, Governor Jay Inslee said on Tuesday that more than double the acreage had been torched in the previous 24 hours than had been burned during all of last year in his state. Sam Elm and her partner, Micah, lived in Phoenix, Oregon. Sam shared her experience fleeing from the wildfire - and saying goodbye to their home - with BBC OS. A fire started in a nearby town and began encroaching. ""It took our home,"" she says. ""It was an intense experience."" ""We were listening to the scanners...we were hearing it get closer and closer. ""At a certain point we got a call saying 'you need to leave right now.' It was raining ash on - everything."" As they were about to leave, Sam says her wife called her upstairs to a wall in their home decorated with the signatures of friends, and members of their community - which Sam says was a ""point of pride"" for them. ""She slams her hand on the wall - because we've never signed our own wall, because it was our house we lived in - she traced her hand, she slammed my hand on the wall, she traced my hand, she kissed me and said: 'Don't forget this was our first home. And we left."" Sam Elm (left) and her wife Micah Elm had their first home burn down in a fire Sam adds that she and her wife were the lucky ones. ""Not everybody got to say goodbye to their homes - we did. Our pets are with us. We know people whose pets got stuck in their houses...we know people that are missing."" Sam and Micah are currently staying with a friend, hoping to get a hotel room through insurance. But she doesn't know what six months down the line looks like now that they've lost their home. She says she has no clue ""how to traverse any of this"". California - in the middle of a 20-year mega-drought- is experiencing more than two dozen wildfires, including three of its five largest ever. This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires The sheriff of Butte County, north-east of San Francisco, said two people had been found dead at one location and a third elsewhere. One of the three was a motorist who was apparently trying to escape the Bear Fire, police told local media. The Bear Fire has scorched more than 200,000 acres since it began in mid-August. This video can not be played Wildfires rage across thousands of acres in California The latest deaths mean that fires in the state have now killed at least 11 people since last month. More than 2.3m acres have been burned this year in the state. California Highway Patrol Officer Ben Drapertold the East Bay Times,externalthat one of the fatalities discovered on Wednesday was someone who seemed to have been trying to flee the wildfire. This video can not be played Why has the San Francisco sky turned orange? He said investigators believe the unidentified driver had fled his or her car after driving towards a ditch before being overcome by the smoke and flames. ""Somebody was just attempting to flee and it just didn't work out,"" he said. The slew of blazes across the region were sparked by a number of causes, from downed power lines to a gender reveal party gone wrong. But why have the wildfires become so bad? There has been a rise in the number of extreme weather events, which experts say is part of a trend caused by bigger climate changes. While climate change itself is not the cause of the blazes, it helps set the conditions for massive wildfires. This video can not be played ""It's like night-time in the daytime"": San Francisco's skies turn orange from wildfire smoke The Western US has recently seen serious heat waves, including a day which led to what may be the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on the planet - 130F (54.4C) - in California. The last week brought another heat wave, and southern California saw record-high temperatures. These hot, dry conditions have made the region ideal for large wildfires. Record cold temperatures and even snow in neighbouring states, like Colorado, this month have also brought damaging winds. In addition to climate change, other factors like more people living in wildfire-prone areas and brush overgrowth have also contributed.

"US President Donald Trump knew Covid-19 was deadlier than the flu before it hit the country but wanted to play down the crisis, according to a new book. Bob Woodward, who broke the Watergate scandal and is one of the nation's most respected journalists, interviewed Mr Trump 18 times from December to July. Mr Trump is quoted as telling him the virus was ""deadly stuff"" before the first US death was confirmed. Responding, the president said he had wanted to avoid causing public panic. Some 190,000 Americans have been recorded as dying with Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. On Wednesday, some US media released parts of the interviews between the president and the journalist, revealing his reported remarks on the outbreak as well as on race and other issues. Here are some of the key quotes so far from Rage, which will be released on 15 September. Mr Trump indicated that he knew more about the severity of the illness than he had said publicly. According to a tape of the call, Mr Trump told Woodward in February that the coronavirus was deadlier than the flu. This video can not be played How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus shifted between March and April ""It goes through the air,"" Mr Trump told the author on 7 February. ""That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. ""And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.""Â Later that month, Mr Trump promised the virus was ""very much under control"", and that the case count would soon be close to zero. He also publicly implied the flu was more dangerous than Covid-19. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus Speaking on Capitol Hill on 10 March, Mr Trump said: ""Just stay calm. It will go away."" From 2018: Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus has shifted Nine days later, after the White House declared the pandemic a national emergency, the president told Woodward: ""I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic."" In a tweet on Thursday, Mr Trump asked why Bob Woodward had not reported his quotes on Covid-19 earlier if he thought they were ""bad and dangerous"". ""He knew they were good and proper answers,"" Mr Trump said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking from the White House earlier on Wednesday, he told reporters: ""I don't want people to be frightened, I don't want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. ""We want to show confidence, we want to show strength."" The president - who is running for re-election in November - said the Woodward book was ""a political hit job"". Responding to reporters' questions on the book, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: ""The president never downplayed the virus, once again. The president expressed calm. The president was serious about this."" Things US has got wrong - and got right In a tweet, Mr Trump's Democratic White House challenger Joe Biden said that ""while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, [the president] failed to do his job"".

Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent Leaders are responsible for keeping people calm but there is a fine line between avoiding panic and making a crisis worse. President Trump told Woodward Covid-19 was deadlier than the flu but in public he downplayed the danger. Other leaders took a different approach. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said bluntly that people would die: ""Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time."" Mr Trump often downplayed the virus from the beginning. In recent weeks, his advisers began speaking of the coronavirus in the past tense - as if the problem were gone. Scientists disagree, saying there is likely to be a surge in the autumn, following the pattern of other respiratory diseases. One fact is irrefutable, however.

"The data measures the time between a sample is collected to the time the result is ""authorised"" in the lab The speed at which coronavirus home tests have been processed in Wales has fallen dramatically. In the final week of August, 8% of home tests were processed within a day and only 24% were processed within two days. At the end of July, 50% of home tests were processed within a day and 88% within two. Welsh Government statisticians said the fall was due to demand exceeding Lighthouse laboratory capacity. The delays have also meant that less than half of home tests had been processed within three days - this figure was 99% in July.

"Several trees on Llanrhystud beach were found after Storm Francis, which hit Wales in August A forest which was buried in sand more than 4,500 years ago may stretch further than thought after Storm Francis uncovered more hidden trees. The petrified forest can often be seen in Borth, Ceredigion, after storms, but new trees have been seen 13 miles (21km) south in Llanrhystud. Tests are being carried out at the Llanrhystud site to determine its age. Dr Hywel Griffiths, from Aberystwyth University, said the find was ""both exciting and worrying"". Dr Griffiths is part of a joint research project between groups in Wales and Ireland looking at coastal environmental change. Curious discoveries in Wales Penarth 'dinosaur footprints' investigated by museum 'We need a name for the Welsh dinosaur coast He said: ""It's exciting because it's additional evidence of these climate change processes that have been going on for so long. ""But also worrying because we are seeing these landscape changes occur more often. It's due to the impact and influence of the storms that feel like they are happening more."" The exposed petrified forest in Borth The forest has become associated with a 17th Century myth of a sunken civilization known as Cantre'r Gwaelod, or the Sunken Hundred. According to the legend, the kingdom was lost at sea when Seithenyn, the guardian of sea defences, forgot to close the gates. In one version of the myth, the forest stretched 20 miles to the west of Cardigan Bay.

"Mike Pompeo said the attack on Mr Navalny could ""prove costly for the Russians"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says there is a ""substantial chance"" that the suspected poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny was ordered by senior officials in Moscow. Mr Pompeo said the US was evaluating how it would respond. Nato and Germany say there is ""proof beyond doubt"" that Mr Navalny was attacked with a Novichok nerve agent. Mr Pompeo's comments contrast with President Donald Trump who has refused to condemn Moscow. Mr Navalny was airlifted to Berlin from Russia after falling ill on a flight from Siberia to Moscow last month. The 44-year-old was brought out of an induced coma earlier this week withdoctors at Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital saying he was responding to verbal stimulibut it was ""too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning"". Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life What are Novichok nerve agents? Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Mr Pompeo gave his comments in an interview with the conservative US commentator Ben Shapiro, who asked if there would be any ramifications for the Russian government over apparent attacks on its political opponents. The secretary of state said the US, along with the EU, had made clear to Russia ""our expectations that they will hold those responsible for this accountable. We'll do our best to come to a conclusion about who was responsible too"". ""I think people all around the world will see this kind of activity for what it is,"" he added. ""And when they see the effort to poison a dissident, they recognise that there is a substantial chance that this actually came from Russia"". This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works He added that ""the world has matured and come to an understanding that this is not how normal countries operate, and this will prove costly for the Russians."" Mr Pompeo declined to say how the US would respond as ""I don't want to get in front of the president"", but said Washington would play its part to ""reduce the risk that things like this happen again"". President Trump has given no indication of how the US will respond to the poisoning, saying on Saturday: ""I don't know exactly what happened. I think it's tragic, it's terrible, it shouldn't happen. We haven't had any proof yet but I will take a look."" Nato has called for Russia to disclose its Novichok nerve agent programme to international monitors. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said members were united in condemning the ""horrific"" attack on Mr Navalny. On Wednesday, Russia's foreign ministry summoned the German ambassador to protest at what it called ""unfounded accusations and ultimatums against Russia"" and accused Berlin of using the Navalny case ""as a pretext to discredit our country"". The German ambassador was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry over the Navalny case Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has long been the most prominent face of opposition to President Vladimir Putin in Russia. His supporters believe his tea was spiked at Tomsk airport on 20 August. He became ill during the flight, and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk so he could be taken to hospital. Russian officials were persuaded to allow him to be airlifted to Germany two days later. A nerve agent from the Novichok group identified by Germany in the Navalny case was also used to poison ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, in England. They both survived but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the poison. Britain accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack in Salisbury. As part of a co-ordinated response, 20 countries expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats and spies. Russia denied any involvement.

"This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open Greece is sending three ships to help house thousands of migrants sleeping rough on the island of Lesbos after fire destroyed their overcrowded camp. For a second night families slept on roads, and in fields and car parks after fleeing Moria camp, where about 13,000 had been living in squalor. A blaze engulfed Moria on Tuesday night before another wiped out any remaining tents on Wednesday. About 400 teenagers and children have been flown to mainland Greece. How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed on a plan for the EU to take in about 400 unaccompanied minors from Lesbos, AFP news agency reports. It is not yet clear if they will be the ones already flown to mainland Greece. The EU has tried previously to resettle migrants among different member states but only a minority have been transferred from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. A quota system was rejected by a group of member states. The Greek ferry Blue Star Chios has now docked at Sigri, a Lesbos port about 100km (60 miles) from the main town Mytilene. It has capacity to house 1,000 migrants, and Greece is also sending two naval vessels to provide emergency accommodation. Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said about 2,000 people would be temporarily sheltered on the ships. He also said efforts were under way to provide shelter near the devastated Moria camp site. Mr Mitarachi said tensions had been running high in the camp because a 15-day quarantine had been imposed after a migrant tested positive for coronavirus last week. By Wednesday, 35 people linked to the camp had tested positive for coronavirus, and there is concern on Lesbos now that most of them need to be urgently located. Caroline Willeman, the Moria co-ordinator for medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF), told the BBC that ""they had initially been isolated, but of course in the chaos of the last two days they have once again been dispersed within the wider community"". ""We had been told last night that eight out of the 35 cases had again been located and isolated."" Aid workers fear many migrants are now scattered across the island Bethany Bell, BBC News, Lesbos Along the road from the burnt-out Moria camp groups of migrants sit at the kerbside and under olive trees. Some are carrying small bags, others are pushing shopping trolleys filled with blankets. One woman from Afghanistan held her baby girl, born 25 days ago. She said she and her family had spent the night out in the open, as the police had not let them return to Moria. She said no one had brought them either food or water. A few steps away in the blazing sun, a Syrian woman fed her baby from a bottle. Police have set up roadblocks preventing refugees from leaving the area to go towards the main town, Mytilene, and the port. When one migrant approached them, the police shouted ""Go back, Covid, Covid!"" A young Afghan boy hunched his shoulders and frowned. ""Lesbos no good,"" he said. An eight-year-old barefoot Congolese girl told Reuters news agency she was hungry and ""our home burned, my shoes burned, we don't have food, no water"". She had slept at the roadside with her mother Natzy Malala, who has a newborn infant. ""There is no food, no milk for the baby,"" Natzy Malala said. This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie spoke to people at the Moria camp months before it was destroyed and reflects on her experiences there Witnesses have told the BBC that three people died in the fire but the Greek migration minister said there had been ""no casualties, no loss of life"". He said that some people were returning to ""safe areas"" near the Moria camp, which was only designed to hold 3,000 people. Fires broke out in more than three places in a short space of time, local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos told state television channel ERT. Some protesting migrants hindered firefighters who tried to tackle the flames, he said. The main blaze, which was initially fanned by high winds, was put out by Wednesday morning. Some 20 firefighters, 10 fire engines and a helicopter were sent to the scene. Migrants fleeing the camp attempted to save some of their belongings The incident occurred just hours after reports that 35 people had tested positive for Covid-19 at the camp. Authorities placed the facility under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant was confirmed to have contracted coronavirus. Mr Mitarachi said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of those infected with the virus had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. He did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. But some migrants told BBC Persian that the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp. Several blamed ""far-right Greeks"" for the blaze after the announcement of coronavirus cases, and tookphotos of what they said were canisters used to ignite the flames,external. Containers and tents used to shelter migrants at the Moria camp were completely destroyed Many migrants then attempted to carry their belongings to the port town of Mytilene but police had blocked roads. Others were reportedly attacked by locals as they tried to pass through a nearby village. A state of emergency has been declared and several ministers have been sent to Lesbos to assess the situation. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said ""the situation in Moria cannot go on, because it is simultaneously a public health and national security issue"". In Germany, the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, offered to ""take in 1,000 refugees"". It lies north-east of Mytilene and has been overwhelmed by huge numbers of refugees for years. According to InfoMigrants,about 70% of people in the camp are from Afghanistan,externalbut migrants from more than 70 different countries live there. An overflow site - the Kara Tepe Refugee Camp - has since been built but there is still not enough space to accommodate all arrivals. For years, thousands of people who arrived on Lesbos were placed in the camp and could not leave until their asylum application was processed on the mainland - a slow, bureaucratic process. In April,Human Rights Watch said the Greek authorities had not done enough to tackle ""acute overcrowding"",externalat the site.

"There is more than one ""rule of six"". Who knew? It's what a legendary Hollywood film editor used to describe the best of way making a must-watch movie, mixing six different elements like emotion and space (his name is Walter Murch, if you are on the hunt for trivia). The other rule of six is part of the code that rules corporate takeovers, more familiar to City lawyers. You may indeed have your own obscure examples. But ministers hope now the government's new rule of six will very quickly become familiar to the country and will immediately change people's behaviour too. 'We must act' to prevent second lockdown, says PM What are the new rules for meeting my friends? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? From Monday, it will be illegal in England, apart from at school or work or under other few exceptions, to meet more than five other people at a time. The police will have the power to stop that happening - you can read exactly how the new restrictions will workhere. After weeks when the government has been trying to cheerlead the country back to the office, urging pupils back to school and taking steps to roll back coronavirus restrictions it is quite the change of tone, change of pace, and change of heart. The prime minister also acknowledged publicly, after many weeks of questions about the layers of anomalies and different rules and regulations, that complicated messages had made the rules hard for people to follow. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Boris Johnson can hope that the public in England will be willing to follow a new, clearer instruction. But it is not obvious that the public will all comply. The reason for the change however, aswe discussed yesterday, is crystal clear. The number of cases has started to rise, and rise quickly, and ministers want to slam on the brakes. The new rule is a significant move, and it's plain it could mean limits on our lives for many months. The prime minister today acknowledged that even Christmas may not be much like normal. The changes are designed to prevent the disease taking off again, and to stop the need for another full national lockdown, something the government is desperate to avoid. But other measures are waiting in the wings too. At the bottom of the government'sguidance,externalissued today, there is a rather bland, technical sounding paragraph: ""The government will restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in local lockdown areas, with the option of national action in the future. This has been introduced in Bolton, following a steep rise in cases, and will seek to restrict activities that may lead to a spread in the virus."" In other words, if the rise in cases doesn't slow, the government could bring in a national curfew on opening hours, a more radical step. Government sources emphasise this is not about to happen. But by laying out the option, it's clear the rule of six could be followed by more radical steps. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

"Safwan Choudhry's flight was cancelled due to a mask dispute A Canadian flight was cancelled and police were called because a child was not wearing a mask. Safwan Choudhry says WestJet wanted his 19-month-old to wear a mask, but the baby girl would not stop crying. The airline says the issue was not with the infant, who is below the age required to wear a mask, but with Mr Choudhry's three-year-old. Tuesday morning's Flight 652 from Calgary to Toronto was stopped, and all passengers were ordered to disembark. ""It's unlike anything I have ever witnessed, let alone experienced,"" Mr Choudhry told the BBC. Mr Choudhry told the BBC his oldest daughter, who is three, was eating a snack before take-off when flight attendants approached them asking that both their children wear a mask. He said he and his wife were masked. He said he asked if his daughter could finish her snack, but that they said they had a ""zero tolerance policy"" and would not close the plane door without her wearing a mask. Mr Choudhry said he agreed to put one on immediately. ""Most children you have to kind of ease them into it, which is a code word for let me get the iPad out,"" he told the BBC. He says the three-year-old did put on a mask, after some fussing. ""But my younger one had a very difficult time, she was basically hysterical."" Mr Choudhry says she was so upset she vomited. He says WestJet was aggressive, and told them that because his youngest daughter was not wearing a mask, and was too upset to wear a mask, the whole family would have to leave. He says they told them that if they did not leave, they could be arrested, charged and receive prison time. Mr Choudhry says he and his wife were respectful. They ultimately agreed to leave. He later learned that according to Canadian transportation policy, only children over two are required to wear a mask, and thus his 19-month-old did not have to put one on. WestJet disputes that the three-year-old put a mask on. The airline said in a statement: ""Due to non-compliance of the parents to place a mask on their older child who is over the age of two, our crew informed the adults of the regulations we are required to follow. ""Our crew requested the presence of the authorities after the guests refused to comply with Transport Canada's interim order and subsequently refused to deplane the aircraft."" A video taken with Mr Choudhry's phone shows his older daughter wearing a mask on the plane, after police arrived on board. He says while some passengers were very irritated with his family, ""overwhelmingly"" people on the plane supported them. Many spoke up in defence of the family, as their youngest cried, he says. That was when flight staff called police, he says. They got off the plane, and the flight was eventually cancelled and rebooked for the next day. ""Due to the rapid escalation of the situation on board, our crew felt uncomfortable to operate and the flight was subsequently cancelled,"" WestJet said. In a video, a police officer explains to them that while the mask issue with the eldest was ""resolved"", ""the behaviour of the other passengers left the rest of the crew feeling unsafe"". Some passengers can be heard in video of the incident heckling the police and air crew. The officer later confirms that when he arrived, the oldest child was wearing a mask. Police did not file any charges. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTACT TRACING:'He asked me: Am I going to die?â JOBLESS TALES:'I'm just looking for whatever I can get' ELDERLY TOLL:How bad is the Covid crisis in US care homes? TEENAGE RITUALS:Growing up, interrupted SUPERSPREADERS:What makes some events so risky? A fellow passenger, Marian Nur, also recorded some of the interactions with flight staff, because she was worried the family was being targeted because of their race and religion - Mr Choudhry's wife wears a hijab. ""I was so shocked, the parents never raised their voices, they never got angry with the attendants, they were just trying to reason with them,""she told CBC.,external Mr Choudhry says he and his family are still in Calgary, and have not been offered another flight to Toronto. He says he hopes this does not happen to anyone else. ""So many people were put through so much grief because of a lack-of-understanding on part of the policy,"" he says.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says increasing numbers of people in England are seeking tests when they don't have any Covid-19 symptoms. He said this ""inappropriate"" use of the system was making it harder for people who needed tests to get one. It comes after the boss of England's testing system apologised to people who were struggling to get tests. The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for the government to ""accept there is a problem"" and ""get it fixed"". In the Commons, Boris Johnson responded saying ""we are working flat out to address all the issues confronting us today"", adding that demand was ""acute"" and there were too many people requesting tests who did not have symptoms. UK labs have reached capacity, meaningsome people are struggling to book testsor being sent long distances to get one. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? But Mr Hancock gave the example of one school who sent a whole year group for tests, which is ""not appropriate"", he added. He also described how some people who were going on holiday had sought to get tests. Ministers' concern over 'sharp rise' in Covid cases How do I get a coronavirus test? NI minister concerned by UK test booking 'glitch' The free tests are available to people with symptoms of coronavirus - a fever, new and continuous cough or a loss or change in sense of taste or smell. Claire tried to get a test for her son who had a cough and a temperature Claire Peposhi, who lives in north London, spent more than five hours online trying to order a home test kit for her eight-year-old son. He had a cough and a slight temperature and had just returned to school. She was offered testing 40 miles away from her home, but neither she nor her husband could get there, or afford the time off work. ""I have done nothing else this morning other than refresh the page,"" Claire says. ""I can't be alone in this."" Claire says a sudden surge in need for tests ""was always going to happen"". ""It's not a surprise there are more colds around when kids are going back to school."" Mr Hancock denied the testing system was failing, pointing out the UK had the biggest testing system per head of population of all major European countries. ""Right now, we have the highest capacity for testing that we've ever had - increased compared to last week. ""And that testing means that we can find these cases, and therefore help keep the virus under control with the contact-tracing system as well. ""However, in the last couple of weeks we have seen an increase in demand, including an increase in demand for people who are not eligible for tests, and people who don't have symptoms,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We have seen an increase of about 25% of people who are coming forward that don't have symptoms and aren't eligible. They don't have a reason for it. ""I've even heard stories of people saying, 'I'm going on holiday next week, therefore I'm going to get a test'. No - that is not what the testing system is there for. ""We've got to be firmer, I'm afraid, with the rules around eligibility for testing."" The BBC has asked the Department of Health and Social Care how the 25% figure has been calculated, but is still waiting for a response. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""It beggars belief that after weeks of encouraging people to have a test if feeling unwell, ministers are seeking to blame people for simply doing what they were advised. ""With children returning to school and thousands returning to the office, it's obvious extra testing capacity would be needed. ""The fact ministers failed to plan is yet more staggering incompetence."" On Tuesday, the director of testing in England, Sarah-Jane Marsh said she offered her ""heartfelt"" apologies to people who could not get a test. A new lab is due to open in Loughborough in about a fortnight, which will increase testing capacity by about a fifth.

"This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown as virus cases rise in England. He set out a new ""rule of six"",restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people,external, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests. Mr Johnson also outlined a ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring. It comes as the UK reported another 2,659 coronavirus cases, the fourth day running of over 2,000 reported cases. ""I want to be absolutely clear, these measures are not another national lockdown. The whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown,"" Mr Johnson said in the first Downing Street coronavirus briefing since July. He added ""it breaks my heart to have to insist on these restrictions"". How many cases in your area? What are the new rules? Will unis be exempt? And other questions 'It makes children's parties illegal gatherings' In the last week, cases have risen from 12.5 infections per 100,000 people to 19.7 per 100,000 across the UK. Coronavirus was more prevalent among young people, with 54 cases per 100,000 people in the 19 to 21-year-old age group. Mr Johnson also announced that: Venues such as pubs and restaurants will be legally required to request contact details of everyone visiting, hold it for 21 days and provide it to NHS Test and Trace. They face fines of Â£1,000 if they fail to comply Business opening hours could be restricted across the whole nation if cases continue to rise. But initially the measure will be limited to local lockdown areas such as Bolton, where venues must close between 22:00 and 05:00 ""Covid-secure marshals"" will be introduced to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres The passenger locator form, filled out by travellers arriving in the UK to enforce quarantine rules, will be simplified and Border Force will increase enforcement Plans to try out larger audiences in venues later this month will be revised, and the government isreviewing its plan to allow spectators back into sports stadiums from 1 October Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the new rules on gatherings were a reflection that ""poor communications were a large part of the problem"" with the spread of the virus. Sir Keir said the government also needed to improve testing, which was ""all over the place"", following reports that some people have been unable to book tests. The prime minister said the government was ""working hard"" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, but urged people only to book a test if they had coronavirus symptoms. He said they also want to use new types of test ""in the near future"" to identify people who do not have coronavirus and are not infectious so they can live life ""in a more normal way"". He said these swab or saliva tests could be turned around in 90 or even 20 minutes, with millions processed each day. However, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said such tests were still at the piloting stage, and so were unlikely to be manufactured or distributed before the end of the year. Discussing the plans, the prime minister evoked the Apollo space programme, describing the ""giant collaborative effort"" of this testing programme as a ""moonshot"", which could restore a more normal way of life even if a vaccine or treatment is not available. A report in the BMJ,externalsaid the UK has drawn up plans to carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year, at a cost of more than Â£100bn. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said it was unclear how the ""moonshot"" testing would work given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. The Department of Health declined to comment directly on the report, but said it wanted to boost the number of tests with a rapid turnaround time. For all the talk of vaccines and rapid testing, it was clear - certainly listening to UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - that this winter will be hard. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and the fact people mix indoors more. That is why we see flu cases and, sadly, deaths rise every winter. Many experts believe the same will happen in the coming months, despite the latest measures. That means the government faces some very difficult decisions. It has to balance the impact of further restrictions - which can harm health in other ways, as well as damage education and the economy - against the risk of letting the virus spread. The public has a huge role to play. But on its own that may not be enough. Behind the scenes there is lots of focus on how to protect the vulnerable - that could mean locking down care homes and asking people to shield again. But the UK is in a stronger position than it was at the start of the pandemic. The lockdown bought us time. Better treatments are available and, while many problems remain with testing and tracing, the systems in place are an advance on where we were when the virus first hit the UK. These new tests will be piloted with audiences attending indoor and outdoor venues in Salford from next month. But the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the technology needed to be ""tested carefully"" and it would be ""completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk"". The measures that needed to be taken against coronavirus were ""damaging"" socially, economically and to people with other health conditions, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty acknowledged. ""We have to do them because the alternative is worse,"" he said. He added that ""the period between now and spring is going to be difficult"" and people shouldn't see the restrictions ""as a very short term thing"" because they were unlikely to be lifted after just two or three weeks. Mr Johnson said it was ""too early to say"" if big parties could be held over Christmas, but added that he was ""still hopeful"" some aspects of life could return to normal by the festive season. He said the restrictions would be in place only ""as long as necessary"". ""I'm sorry about that. I wish we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and save lives,"" he said. The new ""rule of six"" means: Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includesprotests and political activitiessubject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance Peoplewho ignore the policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 The chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Ken Marsh, said the new rules were "" very flimsy"" and would be difficult to enforce. At present, the guidance says two households of any size are allowed to meet indoors or outdoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. Until now the police have had no powers to stop gatherings unless they exceeded 30. The number of people allowed to meet inside or outside varies in the UK's four nations. If you are meeting indoors:up to eight people,externalfrom three different households can meet inScotland;up to six people,externalfrom two households inNorthern Ireland;up to four households,externalcan form an ""extended household"" inWales.

"Scientists and health professionals have raised doubts about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ""Operation Moonshot"" plan for mass coronavirus testing. The PM hopes millions of Covid-19 tests - including some giving results within minutes - could be processed daily. But experts say there are issues with laboratory capacity for current tests, while the technology for more rapid tests ""does not, as yet, exist"". The British Medical Journal says leaked memos show the plan could cost Â£100bn. Speaking after his announcement thatgatherings in England are to be restricted to six people from Monday, Mr Johnson said the government was ""working hard"" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. And he said that ""in the near future"" he wanted to start using testing ""to identify people who are negative - who don't have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else"". What are the new rules? UK coronavirus cases up by 2,659 on Wednesday Mr Johnson added: ""We believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. ""Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved - literally millions of tests processed every single day."" Mr Johnson said a mass-testing programme could be ready by the spring and could help the UK to avoid a second national lockdown. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said it was unclear how the so-called Operation Moonshot would work - given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. Dr Nagpaul added the idea of opening up society based on people testing negative for the virus should be ""approached with caution"" because of the high rate of ""false negatives"" and the potential to miss those who are incubating the virus. Many experts believe plans to roll out mass rapid testing this winter is unrealistic. Piloting is still taking place to see if the technologies work - millions of tests would then need to be manufactured and distributed. The focus on this ""moonshot"" plan is perhaps a distraction from the difficult decisions the country faces. The level of infection is still low - despite the recent rises. But do not expect them to stay this way. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and fact people are indoors more. Ministers will then face the choice of more restrictions to try to curb the virus in the knowledge these will damage people's health in other ways as well as harming education and the economy. Or let the virus spread, while focusing efforts on protecting the vulnerable - that means protecting care homes and perhaps reintroducing shielding. Lockdown bought us time, but simply deferred the problem. Progress has been made in the past six months - there are better treatments, more testing and a network of contact tracers - but perhaps not as much as hoped. The UK - like all nations - faces a tricky act of balancing harms. Dr David Strain, clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and chairman of the BMA's medical academic staff committee, said the mass-testing strategy is ""fundamentally flawed"" and is ""based on technology that does not, as yet, exist"". ""The prime minister's suggestion that this will be as simple as 'getting a pregnancy test' that will give results within 15 minutes is unlikely, if not impossible, in the timescale he was suggesting to get the country back on track."" While Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, warned it could also lead to false positives - with hundreds of thousands of people being wrongly told they have coronavirus. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries acknowledged that the ""the tricky thing with this is not so much the technology, which I'm sure we will have in the very short while in weeks to months, the issue actually is how it gets used in practice"". ""So that, if you have, for example, a false negative test, but you feel assured that you don't have the disease, you don't end up going back into the workplace."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check looks at why testing matters Currently,between 150,000 and 200,000 tests are processed each day. Testing capacity is reported as being 350,000 a day - and this includes 250,000 swab tests (which check if you have the virus currently) as well as 100,000 antibody tests (which check if someone has already had the virus). Earlier this week a director of the government's test and trace programme in Englandissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the testing system, explaining that laboratories, not the testing sites themselves, were the ""critical pinch-point"". One in five with Covid could test negative Covid tests 'could be picking up dead virus' Government apologises over Covid tests shortage The UK has drawn up plans to eventually carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year - at a cost of more than Â£100bn, which is approaching the entire annual budget for NHS England,according to a report in the BMJ.,external The new rapid tests will be piloted in Salford from next month. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the technology needed to be ""tested carefully"" and it would be ""completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk"". The plans for mass testing come as Scotland launched itsnew contact tracing app, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urging as many people as possible to download it. The contact tracing app being developed in England ran into technical problems and iscurrently being testedfollowing a revamp. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson set out a new ""rule of six"" in England,restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people,external, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests, after the UK reported more than 2,000 new coronavirus cases for the fourth consecutive day. ""If everyone does it [the rule of six], we may well be by Christmas in a position to look at it again,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson said the new measures will take about ""two to three weeks"" to see an effect on the number of cases. ""So we need to wait at this point and see how much we flatten the curve and then if that's not sufficient to bring the reproduction number below one, so the epidemic starts shrinking again, then yes, we may need to clamp down on other areas,"" he added. Whileyoung people are testing positive at higher rates,Prof Ferguson said it was unavoidable that the virus would resurge in all age groups. Asked about the return to work, he said: ""Certainly I think we should hesitate and maybe pause at the headlong rush to get everybody back into offices. But some people have to work and I completely understand the concerns in many quarters that everybody working at home has an economic impact, particularly on city centres."" Meanwhile, a new law will also require businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas to record customers' contact details. The government has also publishedits coronavirus guidance for universitiesahead of students returning later this month, with full online learning only as a last resort.

"Wildlife is under pressure from habitat loss, including deforestation Wildlife populations have fallen by more than two-thirds in less than 50 years, according to a major report by the conservation group WWF. The report says this ""catastrophic decline"" shows no sign of slowing. And it warns that nature is being destroyed by humans at a rate never seen before. Wildlife is ""in freefall"" as we burn forests, over-fish our seas and destroy wild areas, says Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF. ""We are wrecking our world - the one place we call home - risking our health, security and survival here on Earth. Now nature is sending us a desperate SOS and time is running out."" The report looked at thousands of different wildlife species monitored by conservation scientists in habitats across the world. They recorded an average 68% fall in more than 20,000 populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish since 1970. The decline was clear evidence of the damage human activity is doing to the natural world, said Dr Andrew Terry, director of conservation at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which provides the data. ""If nothing changes, populations will undoubtedly continue to fall, driving wildlife to extinction and threatening the integrity of the ecosystems on which we depend,"" he added. The report says the Covid-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of how nature and humans are intertwined. Factors believed to lead to the emergence of pandemics - including habitat loss and the use and trade of wildlife - are also some of the drivers behind the decline in wildlife. New modelling evidence suggests we can halt and even reverse habitat loss and deforestation if we take urgent conservation action and change the way we produce and consume food. The British TV presenter and naturalist Sir David Attenborough said the Anthropocene, the geological age during which human activity has come to the fore, could be the moment we achieve a balance with the natural world and become stewards of our planet. ""Doing so will require systemic shifts in how we produce food, create energy, manage our oceans and use materials,"" he said. ""But above all it will require a change in perspective. A change from viewing nature as something that's optional or 'nice to have' to the single greatest ally we have in restoring balance to our world."" Sir David presents a new documentary on extinction to be aired on BBC One in the UK on Sunday 13 September at 20:00 BST. Gorillas in the mountains of DRC face threats from illegal hunting Measuring the variety of all life on Earth is complex, with a number of different measures. Taken together, they provide evidence that biodiversity is being destroyed at a rate unprecedented in human history. This particular report uses an index of whether populations of wildlife are going up or down. It does not tell us the number of species lost, or extinctions. The largest declines are in tropical areas. The drop of 94% for Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest anywhere in the world, driven by a cocktail of threats to reptiles, amphibians and birds. ""This report is looking at the global picture and the need to act soon in order to start reversing these trends,"" said Louise McRae of ZSL. The data has been used for modelling work to look at what might be needed to reverse the decline. Research published in the journal Nature suggests that to turn the tide we must transform the way we produce and consume food, including reducing food waste and eating food with a lower environmental impact. The African grey parrot is endangered due to habitat loss and wildlife trade Prof Dame Georgina Mace of UCL said conservation actions alone wouldn't be sufficient to ""bend the curve on biodiversity loss"". ""It will require actions from other sectors, and here we show that the food system will be particularly important, both from the agricultural sector on the supply side, and consumers on the demand side,"" she said. Extinction data is compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has evaluated more than 100,000 species of plants and animals, with more than 32,000 species threatened with extinction. Elephants are under threat from poaching and habitat loss In 2019, an intergovernmental panel of scientists concluded that one million species (500,000 animals and plants, and 500,000 insects) are threatened with extinction, some within decades. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' The WWF report is one of many assessments of the state of nature being published in the coming weeks and months in the build-up to a major summit next year. The UN will reveal next Tuesday its latest assessment of the state of nature worldwide. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"The government should ban placing under-18s in care in unregulated homes amid concerns over sexual and criminal exploitation, the children's commissioner for England has said. Some vulnerable teenagers are ""at risk every day of the week"", Anne Longfield told BBC Newsnight. She called them ""inappropriate"" places for any child. The government is consulting on proposals to introduce new minimum standards to the sector. Ithas already told local authorities to stop placing under 16s in these homes. But Ms Longfield said the plans do not address ""the real problem"" of allowing older teenagers aged 16 and over in care to be placed in such accommodation. One in eight children in care - around 12,000 - spent time in an unregulated home in 2018-19, her report reveals. It comes following a year long investigation by BBC Newsnight into the care sector. Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Children 'to be banned' from unregulated homes Sent-away children are 'easy victims' It also highlights evidence that providers linked to organised crime are exploiting the lack of regulation to gain access to children. Police have told her that criminality in the sector is ""rife"" and children are being groomed to sell drugs and for sexual exploitation. Unlike children's homes registered with Ofsted, unregulated homes - often known as semi-independent or supported accommodation - are not inspected by a regulator in England or Wales. The hostels, flats, bedsits and even caravans come with differing levels of staff support to help 16 to 18-year olds gain independence. Three-quarters (73%) of the sector is privately run and ""allows for high profit-making without the checks and balances that are seen in other care settings"", Ms Longfield said. Children's Minister Vicky Ford said the government was taking steps to drive up the quality of care provided to vulnerable children. She added: ""In some circumstances, semi-independent accommodation can be the right choice for 16 and 17 year-olds as they move towards adult life, but only when it is of high quality and meets their needs.""

"This video can not be played Earlier this year, the BBC's Rebecca Morelle heard the views of four citizens' assembly members A frequent flyer tax, phasing out polluting SUVs and restricting cars in city centres are among climate change solutions suggested by members of the public. A citizens' assembly of 108 people from all walks of life published its report after weeks of debate. They proposed curbing road building and using the pandemic to cut emissions. MPs said the report offered a ""unique insight"", but activists Extinction Rebellion said it didn't go far enough. The report says the government must show leadership on climate change and insists climate policies must be fair to all â especially the poorest in society. Its radical conclusions may offer political cover to ministers whoâre typically nervous of a public backlash against policies that affect lifestyles. The group, orcitizens' assembly,was set up by six government select committees - groups of MPs who look at what the government is doing and scrutinise policy. Members of the assembly were chosen to represent a spectrum of views from all over the UK and committed 60 hours of their time to studying and debating climate change. They met over six weekends and were asked how to come up with ideas to help the UK achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Their conclusions have been published in a report that is more than 550 pages. What is the Climate Assembly? Climate assembly considers flying bananas The members said it was ""imperative that there is strong and clear leadership from governmentâ to tackle climate change. One member, Sue, from Bath, said: âEven with the country still reeling from coronavirus, itâs clear the majority of us feel prioritising net zero policy is not only important, but achievable.â Hamish, a software engineer from rural Aberdeenshire, told BBC News the government needed ""to develop a long-term strategy to help usâ. A key theme of the report is education. Ibrahim, a GP from Surrey, said: âThe media has to take a role - schools as well. We perhaps need to look at the curriculum. âYou canât go to someone and say âyou need to switch to the hydrogen boiler because itâs low CO2â but they have no idea [about it]. Youâre more likely to get a buy-in from people when they know about the issues.â This video can not be played Leia and Ibrahim are two of the 108 members of the public who worked on the report Members said the government should start phasing out the sale of polluting new vehicles such as SUVs, and clamp down on adverts for highly-polluting goods. Another central message is the need for policies to be fair. Amanda, from Kent, said: âElectric cars have to be more affordable to everybody - not just people who earn enough money.â They also supported higher taxes on frequent fliers, and investment in clean aviation technology. What is climate change? A really simple guide Climate change: What do all the terms mean? Covid crisis does little to slow climate change Tracey, a mother from Northern Ireland, said: âI would be a frequent flier myself â so I would say there needs to be something there to stop us from taking so many flights â to reduce our emissions.â On the subject of what we eat and how we use the land, the assembly urged a voluntary cut of 20-40% in eating red meat. âThe government can't legislate against eating red meat,"" Amanda told us, ""but with education, advertising and labelling I think we can change their attitudes towards eating red meat - as we did with smoking."" They also said: Businesses should make products using less energy and materials People should repair goods and share more, instead of owning all their appliances The UK should get more power from offshore and onshore wind, and solar power New housing developments must have good access to facilities through walking and cycling Most members were not very keen on nuclear - or on burning wood in power stations - and most werenât confident in carbon capture and storage. They think the government should be harnessing the Covid crisis to limit support for high-carbon industries. The MPs behind the assembly said the report ""provides a unique insight into the thinking of an informed public to the trade-offs and changes required to help deliver on the objective that parliament has agreed"". They said: ""Their work merits action.â Crispin Truman, from the countryside charity CPRE, said it shows ""public appetite to end the UKâs contribution to the climate emergency has far outstripped government action.â And Tom Burke, from the climate change think tank, e3g, added: âThis is a striking tribute to the common sense of the British public. There is a clear lesson for politicians and editors across the political spectrum about the role our citizens are capable of playing in shaping public policy.â However, radical green group Extinction Rebellion (XR) condemned the proposals as too timid to meet internationally-agreed proposals limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C. They warned that the report could get buried in government bureaucracy. The committees behind the report have asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson to respond before the end of the year. This may be challenging as, according to a recent report by the Institute for Government, Covid and Brexit have forced climate change down the governmentâs priority list - a claim the government denies. A government spokesperson said it would study the report. The organisers of the assembly have requested that only first names of members are used in the media.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Harry Dunn's family say they have been told prosecutors do not believe the woman accused of killing the teenager in a crash had diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn, 19, died last August when his motorbike was in collision with a car allegedly driven by Anne Sacoolas outside a US airbase in the UK. His parents said the director of public prosecutions was ""actively considering"" a virtual trial of Mrs Sacoolas. The US government has previously declined a UK extradition request. However, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn said they were ""extremely disappointed"" and felt let down after their meeting with Max Hill QC at the Crown Prosecution Service headquarters. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a US intelligence official, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash in Croughton, Northamptonshire, and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international controversy. She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December but an extradition requestwas rejected by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Radd Seiger, the family's spokesman, told reporters the family felt ""hopeless"" after the meeting and that the US had not changed its position on the immunity claimed by Mrs Sacoolas. Call for 'virtual trial' in Harry Dunn case Timeline: Events after Harry Dunn crash death Mr Dunn's family have also filed a civil claim for damages against Mrs Sacoolas. Mr Seiger said the claim for damages for wrongful death had been made at the courts in the US state of Virginia. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Commenting after the meeting, Greg McGill, the CPS director of legal services, said: ""Today we have met with the family of Harry Dunn to update them on the various steps the CPS has taken over the last 10 months to secure justice in this tragic case. ""The challenges and complexity of this case are well known, but the CPS and other partners have been working tirelessly to do all they can so that Anne Sacoolas faces the charge we have brought - causing death by dangerous driving. ""We know this is a very difficult process for the family, which is why we wanted to assure them personally that we continue to seek justice for them and for the public.""
