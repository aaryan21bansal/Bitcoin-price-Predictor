"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says poor UK relations with Russia a tragedy Boris Johnson says the UK's relations with Russia are ""not on a good footing"" but he wants them to improve, after talks in Moscow. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov accused the UK of making ""insulting"" statements ahead of the meeting. But he said he trusted Mr Johnson and they had agreed on the need to work together on the UN Security Council. Mr Johnson is the first UK foreign secretary to visit Russia in five years. MI5 warnings on Brexit, terror and Russia Facebook: Just three Russian Brexit ads Mr Lavrov said it was no secret that Britain's relations with Russia were at a ""low point"". And he accused Britain of making a series of ""aggressive and insulting"" public statements ahead of their meeting, saying Russia had done nothing to justify being seen as an aggressor in relation to its actions in Ukraine and Syria. ""I cannot recall any of Russia's actions that would be aggressive in relation to the United Kingdom. We did not blame London for anything,"" said Mr Lavrov. ""On the contrary, we have heard accusations, even insultingly formulated - that we support the criminal regime in Syria, that we are aggressors, that we are occupiers, we annex other territories. ""And all this despite the fact that on all the regional issues in question, and on many others, all information about what our position is, what it is based on, is regularly provided."" The pair also clashed over Russia's alleged attempts to interfere in elections in the West, following UK Prime Minister Theresa May's warnings about the risks ofRussia's ""sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption"". By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Despite the differences between London and Moscow, both sides have an interest in improving what is a poor relationship. There are several issues where both Britain and Russia sometimes disagree but want more dialogue. On Syria, the UK wants to help shape any future political settlement while Russia needs western money to help rebuild the country. On North Korea, both Russia and the UK want to find ways of de-escalating the crisis prompted by Pyongyang's ballistic missile programme. And on Iran, both sides want to do what they can to protect the deal they helped negotiate to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions. So Friday's meeting may have allowed both sides to rehearse their differences - and the veteran Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, gave as good as he got from the comparative novice foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. But it also allowed them to crack a few jokes and build a relationship that they could need in the years to come. This was not a reset or a return to business as usual but the opening of a channel of communication that in recent years has been as frozen as the Moscow winter. Ahead of the meeting in Moscow, the UK government said Mr Johnson would warn Russia to stop cyber-attacks which threaten Britain's national security or face retaliation of a similar kind from the UK. But Mr Lavrov accused Mr Johnson of being a ""hostage"" of untrue Western narratives on the issue, insisting Russia had not meddled in elections in other countries. Mr Johnson said there was ""abundant evidence"" of Russian interference in polls in the US, Germany, Denmark and France. Boris Johnson stands in front of Saint Basil's cathedral in Red square in Moscow And takes part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Mr Lavrov hit back by telling Mr Johnson he himself had said Russia had not interfered in Britain's general election and Brexit referendum. Mr Johnson interrupted his Russian counterpart to add: ""Not successfully."" Mr Lavrov said the evidence produced so far of Russian attempts at interference amounted to no more than the spending of ""a few kopecks"" on social media adverts. ""I think you have made all this up in your Western community and unfortunately right now you are hostage to this subject, it is very difficult for you to climb down from the fence you have climbed."" He also criticised Britain for cutting off ties with Russia's FSB security agency over the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London, saying the UK authorities had refused to hand over information in the case. He said government criticism of British politicians who speak to Russian media outlets, such as the RT television channel, damaged the reputation of the UK as ""the cradle of democracy"". Mr Johnson acknowledged the ""difficulties"" in relations with Russia, adding: ""It is a regrettable state of affairs but it should not preclude co-operation."" The UK foreign secretary said they had identified common ground on issues such as North Korea, Syria and trade - and said the UK and Russian security services should co-ordinate ahead of next year's World Cup. As the mood at the press conference relaxed, Mr Lavrov said: ""I trust Boris and I trust him to an extent that I am ready to call him BorIs [Russian-style pronunciation] rather than BOris."" Mr Johnson said he adopted the approach Ronald Reagan had taken with Mikhail Gorbachev: ""Trust, but verify."" And he joked that his trust was so great that he had handed his coat with ""everything in my pockets, secret or otherwise"" to Mr Lavrov when he arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. Mr Lavrov joked back: ""I can say that there was nothing in the pockets of Boris's coat"", to which Mr Johnson responded in surprise: ""So you have searched it already?""

"Theresa May has insisted she is more than ""Madame Brexit,"" having been given the title by Poland's prime minister. She said there were ""other things"" she wanted to achieve apart from delivering a successful exit from the EU - such as improvements to education and training. And she insisted she was ""in it for the long-term"", shrugging off suggestions she had had a bad year. The prime minister was speaking to reporters during a visit to UK troops stationed in Cyprus. May seeks to reassure Polish residents 'No 10 knew' of Green claims in 2016 Mrs May gained her new nickname on Thursday, after holding talks in Warsaw with Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Mr Morawiecki told their joint press conference: ""As Madame Brexit has said, Brexit is Brexit."" Mrs May said she had been amused by the comment. ""You might have noticed I smiled when I heard the translation of Mrs Brexit or Madame Brexit,"" she told reporters. ""Look, I am going to deliver on Brexit. That is undoubtedly the case, but I am doing other things as well. If you look at the changes we are making on skills, education and training for example. ""The industrial strategy which actually was talked about with the Poles as wellâ¦ and global Britain."" She said she had completed a number of foreign trips in the run up to Christmas ""promoting the UK both in trading terms, but also our role in defence and security"". Asked if she would characterise 2017 - a year which saw her lose her Commons majority in a snap election she had called - as one of the most difficult years of her career, Mrs May highlighted her recent breakthrough in Brexit talks. ""If you look at what's happened over the past couple of months we have made sufficient progress on the Brexit negotiations, we have had a good Budget that is building a Britain that is fit for the future. ""What we've put into the Budget in terms of funding for the health service but also housing is really important for the future of this country. ""We have had the industrial strategy, which I see as an absolutely crucial plan and part of actually ensuring that our economy does meet the needs of the future and is providing the jobs of the future for the people in the UK."" She said she was ""optimistic"" about making progress on defence and security, as well as trade, ""as we go into phase two of Brexit negotiations"". ""What we want to achieve is in the interests of the EU27 as well as ours,"" she added.

"This video can not be played Long queues at Bristol Airport after plane error shuts runway. A plane carrying 25 people came off the runway after landing, forcing the suspension of flights in and out of Bristol Airport. The Embraer 145 aircraft, from Frankfurt, left the runway as it taxied to the terminal just after 11:30 GMT. ""No-one was hurt and passengers were disembarked and returned to the terminal by coach,"" a spokesman said. At least 45 arriving flights and 28 departures were cancelled or diverted to other airports. The airport announced that the plane had been moved shortly before midnight, but warned of knock-on delays. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) confirmed it was sending a team to the airport. Latest updates on Bristol Airport delays Passengers on EasyJet flights to Inverness, Prague, Belfast and Geneva were told to collect their bags and make alternative flight arrangements ""from home"". Bristol Airport said more than 190,000 passengers are due to use the airport between 22 December and 1 January Other airlines affected include Ryanair, Aurigny, Aer Lingus, KLM, BMI Regional, Flybe, Thomas Cook, and TUI.

Airline operator BMI tweeted that its flight BM1822 from Frankfurt was the plane affected. ""All 22 passengers and three crew aboard the Embraer 145 jet disembarked safely with no reported injuries. Emergency services attended as a precaution,"" the airline spokesman said. The Civil Aviation Authority says the delays at Bristol Airport would almost certainly fall into the category of""exceptional circumstances"",external- ones which are outside the control of the airlines - so passengers would not be able to claim compensation for the delays or cancellations. But a CAA spokesman said there is a duty on the airlines to provide reasonable ""care and assistance"" to passengers unable to travel. This could include phone calls, meals, food and drink, or overnight hotel accommodation with transport there and back to the airport. The airport said the runway would remain closed while investigations begin, the plane is towed away and debris cleared. ""We're unable to confirm a time that the runway will reopen at this time,"" a spokesman said. ""While it is too early to speculate about the cause of the incident, we are confident that it was not related to the low visibility conditions currently being experienced."" The airport said additional staff were being brought in to assist passengers. It is not yet known when the runway will re-open Passengers were told at 12:30 GMT that all flights inbound and outbound were suspended due to ""an incident"", although they were not initially told the nature of it. Rumours soon started about a plane coming off a runway, which was later confirmed by airport staff - who stressed no-one was hurt. People are staying calm in the terminal, although those who have had flights cancelled at this busy time are now having to decide whether to get alternative flights out today or tomorrow, or give up their plans. Dave Joyce, who was due to fly to Javea in Spain with his family, said his plane was diverted away from the airport. The 53-year-old finance worker said: ""Nothing's moving at the minute and we haven't had any information at all. ""People keep coming but nobody's leaving, so it's all getting pretty crowded just now. ""We've got seats in a restaurant, so we're OK, but my wife's mother is in a wheelchair. ""A great start to the Christmas break... Javea seems a long way away now."" Bristol Airport said more than 190,000 passengers were due to use the airport between 22 December and 1 January - a 5% increase on the same period last year.

"Mr Rajoy (L) avoided naming Mr Puigdemont during a Friday press conference Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has rebuffed calls by Catalonia's ousted leader, Carles Puigdemont, to meet for new talks outside the country. Mr Rajoy said he would negotiate with whoever became the new head of the Catalan government but they would have to take up their post in Catalonia. Mr Puigdemont earlier called for talks to take place in Brussels, where he is living in self-imposed exile. Separatist parties won a majority in a Thursday's snap regional election. Mr Rajoy avoided naming Mr Puigdemont during a press conference on Friday but said he was prepared to hold talks with whoever took control of the Catalan regional government ""in a realistic way and inside the law"". ""I offer Catalonia this because I care about the people,"" he said. As divided as ever The crisis in 300 words Will independence happen? Mr Rajoy said the winner of Thursday's election was InÃ©s Arrimadas, the leader of the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain. The Citizens party is now the region's biggest party, although pro-independence parties are best placed to form a government. ""It is evident that something is broken, and it will take time to repair it,"" Mr Rajoy added. Speaking in Belgium earlier on Friday, Mr Puigdemont said Catalonia wanted to be an independent state. ""This is the wish of the Catalan people,"" he said, adding: ""I think the plan of [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy is not working, so we have to find new ways to tackle this crisis."" This video can not be played The Citizens party held a music event as their victory became clear. Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) recorded its worst ever result in Thursday's vote. The Spanish government imposed direct rule on Catalonia and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal. With nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Mr Puigdemont's Together for Catalonia (JxCat), the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were on course to win a total of 70 seats in total, giving them a majority in the new parliament. Citizens (Cs) had 25.3% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber. Its leader told the BBC her party had been ""victorious"". Ms InÃ©s Arrimadas said forming a coalition would be ""difficult - but we will try"". The PP, meanwhile, won only three seats, down from 11 in the previous assembly. Turnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. By BBC Monitoring Leading Spanish newspapers say the result has strengthened the government's position. ""Nationalism can no longer claim that it exclusively represents Catalonia,"" says Madrid-based La RazÃ³n. ABC newspaper thinks Madrid should now settle the Catalan crisis. ""If Spain wants to win this fight in the long term and prevent Catalonia from leaving one day, it should draft a serious plan for strengthening the state."" The result seems to have split Catalan papers between those who want the independence project to continue, and those who accept the realpolitik of the election result. ""The independence movement has humiliated the Spanish prime minister,"" El Nacional says. ""The decisions that affect Catalonia are not made in Madrid."" But Barcelona's El PeriÃ³dico says the result means a ""divided Catalonia"". ""The election that Mariano Rajoy called has shown that Catalonia is firmly divided in two blocs and there is hardly any space for intermediaries."" La Vanguardia writes: ""Major forces supporting independence should look back, confess to mistakes and avoid making them again,"" Separatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October after a referendum that was declared illegal by Spain. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots. The move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured. The man who wants to break up Spain Could Catalonia make a success of independence? According to referendum organisers, 90% of voters were in favour of independence, but fewer than half the region's electorate took part. InÃ©s Arrimadas said she would try to form a coalition However, Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain. Mr Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election. Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. The European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result. The executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia were an internal issue for Spain. ""Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,"" commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency.

"This video can not be played Nuclear N Korea: What do we know? North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has progressed faster than predicted, threatening the security of nearby nations â and potentially the United States. The US envoy to the United Nations put it simply: ""Despite our efforts over the last 24 years, the North Korean nuclear programme is more advanced and dangerous than ever."" Analysts tend to agree that the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, is seeking a nuclear deterrent rather than an all-out war - but other nations are not taking chances. So how do you defend against a politically isolated state with nuclear ambitions, when diplomacy, it appears, simply does not work? South Korea is the closest potential target. The other half of the Korean peninsula has a long history of preparing to defend itself from its northern neighbour. The two countries are technically still at war, having never signed a peace treaty when the Korean War ended in 1953. The Thaad system - seen here in testing - is one of several anti-missile defences One key part of its defensive line is the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) - a region 250km (155 mile) long and 4km (2.5 mile) wide that separates the two nations,guarded by thousands of soldiers, lined with barbed wire fences, and filled with landmines. But it is believed that North Korea's People's Army - with more than a million regular soldiers and millions more reserve troops - has drilled extensively on how to invade across the border. And the heavy land border fortifications do nothing, of course, to prevent a missile strike. For a while, it was thought that Thaad - the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense - might be South Korea's best counter to a nuclear attack. Thaad, funded by the South's military ally the United States, is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles as they descend in the final phase of a strike. The complex technology was first deployed in May 2017, and has been successfully tested. But the politics of South Korea's relationship with the North means its rollout has not been easy. North Korea and its only ally China both see Thaad as a provocation, and many South Koreans living near the places its was deployed fear it could be seen as a military target. The South's new president, President Moon Jae-in, suspended the rollout of the system in June, saying an environmental impact analysis was needed. But in light of recent nuclear tests, the South's defence ministry has now said it will deploy the four remaining Thaad launchers that had been delivered, in addition to the two already operational. South Korea halts anti-missile Thaad rollout What do we know about North Korea's nuclear site? At its closest point, Japan is just a little over 500km (310 miles) from North Korea - well within striking distance. In August, Pyongyang fired a missile directly over Japan, in what Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called an ""unprecedented"" threat to his country. The close proximity of the two nations means that Japan has only minutes to respond to any launch. During the August missile test, people had aboutthree minutes from receiving the emergency warninguntil the missile flew overhead. Many only learned about the threat later in the day. Reality Check: Three minutes to shelter from a missile North Korea: Does this mean war? In terms of defence options, Japan utilises the Patriot missile system which, like Thaad, is designed to shoot down incoming missiles. But it has a limited operational range, making it effective at defending key locations - and not the entire country. But Japan does not have to worry about land invasion to the same extent North Korea does, and at sea, it has other options at its disposal. Japan, South Korea, the United States are among the countries with the Aegis naval defence system. Aegis is yet another anti-missile system, but unlike Thaad or Patriot defences, it can also be deployed to ships patrolling the seas in the region. A test missile fired by the US on August 29, left, was shot down by the Aegis system similar to the file photo, right Those battleships come equipped with powerful radar which could detect the launch when deployed near the North Korean coast. They are also fitted with guided missiles, and could attempt to shoot down the incoming missile - or share its tracking data with another missile defence system closer to the target. There are a handful of problems with the system, though. Aegis ships need to be deployed in the right place at the right time - and while they have been tested extensively, they have never been used to defend against an actual launch. For years, the best defence for the US was its sheer distance from North Korea - some 5,000km (3,100 miles) to Alaska and almost 9,000km to San Francisco. But rapid advancements mean that distance might no longer be far enough. North Korea's military wants the capability to shrink a high-yield nuclear warhead to fit on an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). In theory, that would allow Pyongyang to strike the United States. This video can not be played See the US anti-missile system in action After its latest test, North Korea claimed it had managed to shrink the warhead, posting photos of what it said was a hydrogen bomb - in keepingwith a Washington Post report from early August,external. That means the US is now reconsidering its missile defences, with President Trump having ordered a review of the entire system. Can the US defend itself against North Korea? North Korea: What are the military options? It already has detection and interception systems. But critics believe that the US system is far from reliable, the BBC's diplomatic correspondentJonathan Marcus wrote in July. In the foreseeable future, only a handful of its interceptor missiles will be available to deal with the potential North Korean threat, he said. And it also has to worry about its overseas territory of Guam - a key military outpost in the Pacific which has been singled out by North Korea as a threat to be ""contained"". That island already has a Thaad system deployed, but state media saysKim Jong-un has already been briefed on strike plans- and is waiting to see the next US actions. North Korea: Does this mean war?

"Despite two summits in 2018 and 2019, and then a historic meeting at the Korean border, the future of the US-North Korea talks look bleak. Here's an overview of a saga that has at times threatened nuclear war. The Korean peninsula was divided after World War Two and the North developed an authoritarian form of government. Isolated globally, it saw nuclear weapons as a deterrent against a world it believed was seeking to destroy it. Probably. Pyongyang has carried out six nuclear tests. It claims, though this remains unverified, to have developed a nuclear bombsmall enough for a long-range missile. It also has a ballistic missile experts believe could reach the US, and in 2019 tested a missile that could carry a nuclear weapon and belaunched from a submarine. At the start of 2020, Kim Jong-un ended the country'smoratorium on nuclear testing. After months of escalating mutual threats, in January 2018Mr Kim said he was ""open to dialogue"". Mr Trump accepted, ignoring past pre-talk conditions that North Korea denuclearise first. On 12 June 2018,Mr Trump became the first sitting president to meet a North Korean leader. The two signed an agreement committing to the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" but with no detail on what that meant. Since then, there has been little progress, despite more talks. The US wants North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons while Pyongyang wants a step-by-step approach to ease the crippling sanctions regime. The most recent talks between officials, though not leaders, took place in Sweden in October 2019. The US said ""good discussions were had"" but North Korea said the US""brought nothing to the negotiation table"". Since then, North Korea hascontinued missile testing., while the US has urgedPyongyang to resume talks.

"Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme, including the Yongbyon nuclear plant shown, have been a stop-start process North Korea's nuclear programme remains a source of deep concern for the international community. Despite multiple efforts to curtail it, Pyongyang says it has conducted five nuclear tests. Pyongyang used a three-stage rocket to put a satellite into space in 2012 Technically yes - North Korea has conducted several tests with nuclear bombs. However, in order to launch a nuclear attack on its neighbours, it needs to be able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on to a missile. While North Korea claims it has successfully ""miniaturised"" nuclear warheads, international experts have long cast doubt on these claims. Yet according toinformation leaked to the Washington Post,externalin August 2017, US intelligence officials now do believe North Korea is capable of miniaturisation. North Korea says it has conducted five successful nuclear tests: in 2006, 2009, 2013 and in January and September 2016. The yield of the bombs appears to have increased. September 2016's test has indicated a device with an explosive yield of between 10 and 30 kilotonnes - which, if confirmed, would make it the North's strongest nuclear test ever. The other big question is whether the devices being tested are atomic bombs, or hydrogen bombs, which are more powerful. H-bombs use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash massive amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. The 2006, 2009 and 2013 tests were all atomic bomb tests. North Korea claimed that its January 2016 test was of a hydrogen bomb. But experts cast doubt on the claim given the size of the explosion registered. Another question is what the starting material for the nuclear tests is. Analysts believe the first two tests used plutonium, but whether the North used plutonium or uranium as the starting material for the 2013 test is unclear. A successful uranium test would mark a significant leap forward in North Korea's nuclear programme. The North's plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile. Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy. There is no consensus on exactly where North Korea is in terms of miniaturising a nuclear device so that it can be delivered via a missile. According tothat information leaked to the Washington Post,external, US intelligence officials now believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. Japan's defence ministry has also recently stated this is a possibility. The new assessment comes only weeks after North Korea tested what it said was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable ofreaching the US mainland. While analysts doubt Pyongyang's claim, most experts agree the missile couldreach Alaska or Hawaii. North Korea's nuclear actions have become a cause of concern among its neighbours, especially South Korea A site in the mountains near Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility, while the January and September 2016 tests were said to have been carried out at the Punggye-ri site. The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Both the US and South Korea have also said that they believe the North has additional sites linked to a uranium-enrichment programme. The country has plentiful reserves of uranium ore. The US and North Korea aimed at restarting denuclearisation talks before Kim Jong-il, right, died The US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea engaged the North in multiple rounds of negotiations known as six-party talks. There were various attempts to agree disarmament deals with North Korea, but none of this has ultimately deterred Pyongyang. In 2005, North Korea agreed to a landmark deal to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for economic aid and political concessions. In 2008, it destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon as part of the disarmament-for-aid deal. But implementing the deal proved difficult and talks stalled in 2009. North Korea carried a nuclear test in 2009, which resulted in seismic waves shown here in Seoul The US never believed Pyongyang was fully disclosing all of its nuclear facilities - a suspicion bolstered when North Korea unveiled a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon, purportedly for electricity generation, toUS scientist Siegfried Hecker,externalin 2010. In 2012, North Korea suddenly announced it would suspend nuclear activities and place a moratorium on missile tests in exchange for US food aid. But this came to nothing when Pyongyang tried to launch a rocket in April that year. The United Nations has tightened sanctions against North Korea following nuclear tests In March 2013, after a war of words with the US and with new UN sanctions over the North's third nuclear test, Pyongyang vowed to restart all facilities at Yongbyon. By 2015, normal operations there appeared to have resumed. The 2016 tests brought international condemnation, including from China - the North's main trading partner, and only ally. In 2017, the UN agreed a new sanctions package in response to the tests. In August, US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury"" should the country not abandon its threats against the US. The rhetoric from Washington failed, though, to rein in Pyongyang which in turn said it was developing a strike plan to hit the US territory of Guam, an island in the Western Pacific.

"The woman has been named in tributes as 30-year-old Jodie Willsher Tributes have been paid to a woman stabbed to death in an Aldi supermarket. Mum-of-one Jodie Willsher, 30, was attacked as she worked in the store in Skipton, North Yorkshire, at 15:30 GMT on Thursday. Customers and colleagues pinned down the attacker before police arrived. A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Friends said she was a ""bubbly, lovely"" girl who would be missed. More on this and other Yorkshire stories A former school friend of Mrs Willsher, Kelly Blagden, 30, said they were both pregnant at the same time when her friend was expecting her daughter, Megan, now four, with husband Mal. She said Mrs Willsher had worked at the shop since it opened two years ago. Mrs Blagden added: ""She's a lovely girl, she was so in love, they were just the perfect relationship, they were so in love with each other and I just can't believe it really. ""We don't even know who did it. Nobody has said who it is."" Flowers have been left outside the Aldi store in Keighley Road Mrs Willsher studied theatrical and media make-up at Craven College in Skipton in 2004/5. A statement from the college said: ""Our thoughts are with Jodie's family and friends at this tragic time."" Forensic investigations are being carried out at the supermarket An Aldi customer said she had seen Mrs Willsher earlier that day wearing a Christmas jumper at work. Flowers have been left in the supermarket car park and two friends of the woman, pushing small children in buggies, described their friend as ""a truly lovely woman and very popular"". People left tributes on a community Facebook page, saying ""she was such a happy, friendly person"". One wrote: ""Horrendous, so tragic for her family and for those who witnessed this barbaric act."" Tributes have been left at the scene by friends The store and its car park remain cordoned off by police. Two officers are guarding the entrance but there isn't much police activity to be seen through the brightly-lit supermarket windows. Trolleys full of shopping can be seen in the aisles and food at the checkouts. Christmas shoppers unaware of what happened here yesterday are still arriving. No-one is saying when the shop will reopen. Among the tributes left in the car park, one says: ""In our thoughts, from all of us at Tesco in Skipton."" Another says: ""To our dear beautiful sweet friend, we are all broken. Sorry we never got our girls' night, here's a glass to you."" Shoppers had described how they were left terrified when the attack happenedat the store in Keighley Road, with witness saying everyone ""screamed and ran up and down"". A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: ""The suspect was initially detained by brave members of staff and public, before he was arrested by officers who were quickly on scene. ""He was taken into custody on suspicion of attempted murder, but it has now turned into a murder investigation despite the efforts of medics to save the victim."" The force said the attack was not terror-related or believed to be a hate crime. The supermarket remains closed and cordoned off Shopping was seen abandoned in the supermarket In a statement released on Friday, Aldi said the store would be closed until further notice to allow police to carry out investigations. A spokesman said: ""We are working with the police following an incident at our Skipton store."" Mayor Andy Rankine said the town was in shock over the death. Mr Rankine said: ""Skipton is a small but close-knit community where most people know each other.

"Berlin has been remembering those hurt and killed in a terror attack on a Christmas market this time last year MI5 has had to reassure its European partners about co-operation since the Brexit referendum, the head of the security service says, but the twin fears of terrorism and Russia has meant that European countries still want the UK's help. With a marked increase in the number of attacks in Europe, the committee said the government should be more forthcoming on any potential risks associated with Britain leaving the EU. The annual report of the Intelligence and Security Committee provides the most detailed overview of the work of Britain's spy agencies. The committee, chaired by Dominic Grieve MP, said that the last two years had seen a rise in attacks in Europe leading to questions over the capability of some countries to deal with the threat. That had led to closer co-operation between different intelligence and security services. European mechanisms played an essential role in the UK's national security, the committee said, and it urged the government to outline its assessment of the risks of the UK's departure from the EU and the measures it is putting in place. One question the committee asked head of MI5 Andrew Parker was whether he was confident that Brexit would not have an impact on counter-terrorist work. ""Yes and no,"" he replied. ""There are two parts to this. ""My life has got more difficult since the referendum because of the need to invest reassurance time with all of our European partners, but the thing that is driving the quality of those relationships currently is the darkness of the threat and the common concern about it. ""Half of Europe is scared of terrorism and the other half is scared of Russia and both halves want us to help them."" Mr Parker said this would not change with Brexit since much of the national security work was outside of the EU anyway. However, he said his ""hesitancy"" was because there were certain issues which were within EU competence and might be affected by the negotiations, in particular those that relate to data-sharing across borders. Head of MI5 Andrew Parker says his life has got harder since the UK voted to leave the EU A witness from GCHQ also said it had concerns as to how European data-sharing would work after Brexit with the likely need for some kind of arrangement to share data in a way which accords with European privacy concerns. ""That's a policy issue way beyond intelligence, actually, but it will have big implications for us, so getting that right is important,"" the individual told the committee. MI5 said the most striking shift in counter-terrorist work in the last five years was the rise in what is called ""high-risk casework"" - referring to individuals who have received terrorist training or are attempting to procure the means to carry out an attack, but who may not yet have a current attack plan. It is also estimated that more than 300 UK individuals who went to join so-called Islamic State remained in the Middle East and might pose a threat if they returned to the UK. Overall, it is thought 6,000 European fighters travelled out to fight with IS. The annual report also points to the breadth of concerns for the agencies. MI5 told the committee that Northern Ireland represents the ""most concentrated area of terrorist activity probably anywhere in Europe"", with terrorist activity disrupted on a weekly basis. Dissident republicans conducted 16 attacks on national security targets in 2015/16, they say. Northern Ireland-related terrorism accounted for about 18% of MI5's operational and investigative resources. 64% is devoted to what is called international counter-terrorism (largely Islamist-related activity from groups like IS and al-Qaeda). MI5's work on hostile state activity, including counter-espionage, counterproliferation and protective security, accounts for around 18% of its effort. Russia has risen up the list of priorities in recent years. MI6 described the Russian state as ""formidable adversaries"" to the committee. ""They clearly are operating to risk thresholds which are nothing like those that the West operates,"" MI5 said. Officials described a number of steps taken to protect the UK's political system from the kind of attack allegedly seen in 2016 in the US, including tracking the major known perpetrators and ensuring individuals involved in politics had access to security advice. So far there are few signs of the close working relationship with the US being affected by the Trump administration, the committee says, although the agencies are aware of the potential risks, especially if campaign talk of returning to waterboarding of detainees was to actually become policy. ""Any significant change in US policies relating to detainee treatment would pose very serious questions for the UK-USA intelligence relationship,"" MI6 said. One other revelation came in the report. MI6 - which spent Â£798,000 on external consultants to review its structure - is increasing accommodation through refurbishment of Vauxhall Cross. And for Britain's spies, that means they will have to start hot-desking. Could MI5 have stopped 2017's attacks?

"This video can not be played Russia 'tries to sow discord in the West' Theresa May has launched her strongest attack on Russia yet, accusing Moscow of meddling in elections and carrying out cyber espionage. Addressing leading business figures at a banquet in London, the prime minister said Vladimir Putin's government was trying to ""undermine free societies"". Mrs May said it was ""planting fake stories"" to ""sow discord in the West"". While the UK did not want ""perpetual confrontation"" with Russia, it would protect its interests, she added. Her comments are in stark contrast to those of US President Donald Trump, who last week said he believed his Russian counterpart's denial of intervening in the 2016 presidential election. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to visit Russia next month. Boris Johnson set for Moscow visit Trump and Putin 'agree to defeat IS' Trump backs US agencies after Putin remark In a major foreign policy speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at London's Guildhall, which Mrs May described as a ""very simple message"" for President Putin, she said he must choose a very ""different path"" from the one that in recent years had seen Moscow annex Crimea, foment conflict in Ukraine and launch cyber attacks on governments and Parliaments across Europe. Russia could be a valuable partner of the West but only if it ""plays by the rules"", she argued. ""Russia has repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption. ""This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag among many others."" This video can not be played What Boris Johnson told MPs about Russian meddling in UK elections ""We know what you are doing and you will not succeed. Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us."" She said as the UK left the EU and charted a new course in the world, it remained absolutely committed to Nato and securing a Brexit deal which ""strengthens our liberal values"", adding that a strong economic partnership between the UK and EU would be a bulwark against Russian agitation in Europe. There are some countries in Europe that believe the West should engage more closely with Russia. They argue the European Union and the United States should better understand Russia's point of view, its belief that it is threatened from all sides. And that more should be done to accommodate this sense of vulnerability, by softening Nato's approach and reducing sanctions. Well, not Theresa May. In a speech in the US in February, the prime minister spoke of the need to ""engage but beware"" of Russia. She has now switched the order and the focus is very much on beware. She believes that President Putin should be called out for the threat she believes he poses both internationally and in the UK. The Electoral Commission is investigating claims that Russia used social media to meddle in the Brexit referendum. So Mrs May is willing to engage with Russia - she is sending the foreign secretary to Moscow next month. But she also wants Russia to know that Mr Johnson will come with a clear message that its destabilising activities will no longer be tolerated. Mr Johnson, who will be making his first trip to Russia since becoming foreign secretary in December, has said the UK's policy towards Moscow must be one of ""beware but engage"" following a decade of strained relations. He told MPs earlier this month that he had not seen any evidence of Russia trying to interfere in British elections or the 2016 Brexit vote, in which Moscow has insisted it remained neutral. ""We will take the necessary action to counter Russian activity,"" Mrs May added. ""But this is not where we want to be and not the relationship with Russia we want. ""We do not want to return to the Cold War or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation. ""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability. ""Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path. But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend."" Responding to Mrs May's speech, former Labour cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw - who has been raising the issue of Russian interference in UK elections for nearly a year - tweeted: ""Asking why May suddenly acknowledging Russian interference now having stonewalled for months."" Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator involved in media policy, dismissed the PM's comments. ""The international system of rules must be saved not from Russia but from the advocates of intervention, coups and regime change. Russia will not accept those 'rules',"" he tweeted. ""The world order that suits May, with the seizure of Iraq, war in Libya, the rise of IS and terrorism in Europe, has had its day. You can't save it by attacking Russia."" In Mrs May's speech, she also said the authorities in Myanmar - formerly known as Burma - must take ""full responsibility"" for what ""looked like ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya people in Rakhine province.

"Thousands of travellers have hit the UK's roads and railways at the start of the Christmas getaway on what was billed as ""frantic Friday"". An estimated 1.3 million Christmas drivers were expected to add to the usual end-of-week traffic. Bristol Airport cancelled flights after a plane came off the runway and several train lines reported disruption. However, road delays were less severe than predicted, with the RAC suggesting many may travel on Saturday instead. Christmas getaway: What you need to know Driving home? 10 things to know about roads Virgin rail strikes called off Many of Britain's mainline routes will be partially shut in the coming days as Network Rail carries out its biggest ever Christmas engineering programme. With Paddington station completely closed between Christmas Eve and 27 December, Great Western Railway is urging passengers to get to their Christmas destination by the end of Saturday ""at the latest"". Meanwhile, the Association of British Travel Agents said 4.5 million people were expected to travel abroad in coming days. It said airports, ports and international train stations would be exceptionally busy and advised people to begin their journeys earlier than usual. About 260 rail engineering projects will cause disruption to trains during the Christmas period. Southeastern will not run trains to London Bridge, Charing Cross and Cannon Streetbetween 23 December and 1 January,external The West Coast main line will be halted between Preston and Lancaster from Christmas Eve to 27 December with buses replacing trains Other improvements on the same line will mean a reduced service, with longer travel times, to and from London Eustonbetween 24 December to 2 January,external Thameslink services will not run through Central Londonbetween 23-29 December,external There will be no Greater Anglia trains between London Liverpool Street and Ingatestone or Billericayfrom 23 December to 1 January,external Earlier South Western Railway blamed sickness among train crew for the cancellation of some services on Friday.

ScotRail has been suffering delays and cancellations between Stranraer/Ardrossan Harbour and Kilmarnock/Glasgow Central after a train derailment in a depot. But Virgin trains as running a full timetable on the West Coast mainline after a planned strike was called off. Flights in and out of Bristol Airport were suspendedafter a plane carrying 25 people came off the runway. The runway is now not expected to reopen until 23:00 GMT at the earliest. A post on the airport's Twitter feed apologised for the disruption andthanked customers for their ""continued patience."",external"" This video can not be played Long queues at Bristol Airport after plane error shuts runway. The RAC said: ""Friday has turned out to be slightly less frantic than it first looked although things are hotting up this evening as holiday traffic is competing with commuters and commercial traffic."" It said it had attended 9,000 breakdowns - 15% higher than the seasonal norm. It warned that drivers might have altered their plans, increasing the risk of serious delays on Saturday. Earlier, the M1 was hit by three serious incidents with a vehicle fire closing three northbound lanes. The M40 southbound was closed earlier between junction 10 (Brackley) and junction nine (Bicester), after a lorry caught fire. Witnesses said the vehiclewas carrying bottles of beerwhich exploded due to the heat. However,according to Highways England,external, the disruption has now cleared. Some stretches of the M40 remain slow due to road works. Beer bottles were reported to be exploding on the M40 after the lorry carrying them caught fire A ""roadworks embargo"" is in place on English motorways and major A roads until 00:01 on 2 January in a bid to ease festive congestion. Many lanes are open and temporary speed restrictions are lifted. However, 27 sets of roadworks, covering a total of 122 miles, are staying in place because it would be too dangerous to lift them. In Wales, no roadworks are taking place over Christmas and the New Year, other than essential or emergency work. Coach operator National Express is running extra services over the festive period.

"Bitcoin plunged on Friday, extending a fall that saw the crypto-currency lose almost a third of its value from a record of nearly $20,000 (Â£15,000). The crypto-currency's price dipped below $11,000 on Friday, according to the Coindesk exchange website,,externalbefore recovering to above $13,000. Amid the swings, three Bitcoin-related exchanges suspended certain trades. Bitcoin has had a blistering trip over the past 12 months. Its price at the start of the year was about $1,000. It has skyrocketed since - more than doubling in value since November -  drawing interest from major firms as well as private investors. But since Sunday Bitcoin has been on a losing streak, falling back to where it was at the start of December. Analysts said investors should be prepared for such rapid changes, which have characterised the asset from its start. ""This is exactly how this asset trades and has done since the beginning,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of New York-based DataTrek Research. ""It has a lot of volatility and it will for the foreseeable future."" This week's plunge led to a flood of trades that swamped one of Bitcoin's major exchanges, Coinbase, on Friday. A technical slowdown prompted the firm tohalt buying and selling,externaltwice. Is Asia driving the Bitcoin craze? What is Bitcoin? 'Be ready to lose your money' The CME and CBOE exchanges in the US also temporarily suspended trading of certain Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on where they expect the price of Bitcoin to be at certain points in the future. The exchanges have automatic brakes that apply once a commodity or asset has moved by a certain amount - as happened in this case. The market remains driven by sentiment, according to Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive of industry website Cryptocompare. ""A manic upward swing led by the herd will be followed by a downturn as the emotional sentiment changes,"" he said. Some traders would have been cashing in on the spectacular gains made over the year, he added. Some argue the crypto-currency craze is just a lot of hot air (yes, we know it is probably helium) Concerns about the infrastructure behind crypto-assets may also be spooking investors, said Nick Colas, himself a Bitcoin trader. In recent weeks,markets have been rattled by hacksandallegations of insider trading. He attributes some of this week's slump to the launch of a new crypto-asset that came earlier than planned. The surprise temporary shutdown of Coinbase on Friday was the kind of thing that could erode investor confidence, he argued. ""It is not OK to just take trading offline randomly through the day,"" he said. ""The robustness of that system is just as important to their confidence... as the price of crypto-currencies themselves."" A spokesman for Coinbase said the firm was working around the clock to ensure smooth trading. Friday's suspensions lasted for about two hours in total. ""We're doing everything within our power,"" the spokesman said. A digital asset, Bitcoin is not backed by any governments. It is created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There is a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day, with more than 16.5 million now in circulation. Supply is expected to peak at about 21 million. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undoing transactions. Regulators around the world have stepped up their warnings about its provenance as an investment. One of this week's most striking comments came from Denmark's central bank governor, who called it a ""deadly"" gamble. Earlier this month, the head of one of the UK's leading financial regulators warned people to be ready to ""lose all their money"" if they invested in Bitcoin. Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC that neither central banks nor the government stood behind the ""currency"" and therefore it was not a secure investment. Despite the risk to individuals, US authorities have said they do not think it is a big enough part of financial markets to be a threat to broader economic stability.

"This video can not be played Sheeran said he felt ""very proud and happy"" in a video message Ed Sheeran has beaten off competition from Eminem - and himself - to land his first UK Christmas number one single. Perfect - which he released in three separate versions in a bid to clinch the Christmas crown - had faced a challenge from Eminem's River, on which Sheeran provides guest vocals. But the rapper ended in second place, while Wham's Last Christmas came third. In a video message,external, the British singer said securing the Christmas top spot was ""an actual dream come true"". The video for Perfect riffs on Wham's classic Last Christmas clip ""I'm very proud and happy,"" he said. ""Thank you so much and have a very merry Christmas, happy holidays and a happy new year."" Sheeran's domination of the Christmas chart was all but assured after he released a new version of his doe-eyed ballad with Beyonce. That version drove most of his sales - though chart rules mean Beyonce is denied a credit on the Christmas number one, with Sheeran's original counted as the lead track. Eminem's River took an early lead on streaming services but faltered as the week went on. Fans had hoped to send Last Christmas to number one to mark the first anniversary of George Michael's death. Despite support from ITV's This Morning and Michael's ex-bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, however, the song failed to beat its original chart position of number two. Back in 1984, it was denied the top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? charity single. As has become tradition, yuletide standards by Mariah Carey and The Pogues have returned to the Top 40 off the back of huge streaming figures. There are 16 Christmas songs in the Top 40, among them such classics as Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree by Brenda Lee and Wonderful Christmastime by Sir Paul McCartney.

"The jets also refuelled from the prime minister's plane during the training exercise Two Typhoon jets armed with air-to-air missiles intercepted Theresa May's plane on its return to the UK from Cyprus as part of a training exercise. Theresa May watched pilots carry out the manoeuvre - a rehearsal for a suspected hijacking scenario - from the cockpit of the RAF Voyager. The jets, scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, also hooked up to the PM's plane for air-to-air refuelling. Mrs May was returning from a two-day trip to Poland and Cyprus. The fighter jets pulled up alongside the converted Voyager at 17,000 feet, and tipped their wings as part of the exercise. Watch: What is it like to fly the RAF Typhoon jet? RAF jets intercept flight after 'hoax' RAF heads off Russian jets near Scotland Johnson urges better Russia relations Pilots from 3 Squadron and 11 Squadron performed the manoeuvre. The jets each took on four tonnes of fuel during the exercise, at 600kg-a-minute. The Typhoons are the sort of jets that would be used to intercept foreign planes illegally entering British airspace and the exercise demonstrated how the RAF's Quick Reaction Alert would work. Mrs May was said to have spent the rest of the journey working on papers from her ministerial Red Box and relaxing with a sudoku number puzzle.

"Charles Dutoit amassed 10 Grammy Award nominations between 1982-2008 The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has cancelled conductor Charles Dutoit's appearances ""for the immediate future"" following sexual assault allegations. Three opera singers and a musician say Dutoit forced himself on them, the Associated Press news agency reported. The conductor has not responded to requests for comment from the agency. Dutoit is principal conductor and artistic director at the London-based orchestra. Other orchestras have also distanced themselves from him. In a statement, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) said it and Dutoit had ""jointly agreed"" to release him from his forthcoming concert obligations for the immediate future. ""These accusations are taken very seriously by the orchestra and the RPO believes that the truth of the matter should be determined by the legal process,"" it said. ""The immediate action taken by the RPO and Charles Dutoit allows time for a clear picture to be established. Charles Dutoit needs to be given a fair opportunity to seek legal advice and contest these accusations."" Dutoit has led the orchestra since 2009. Meanwhile, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony have severed ties with the Swiss-born conductor. The New York Philharmonic said he had been withdrawn from conducting five concerts scheduled for January, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Cleveland Orchestra said he had withdrawn from concerts scheduled in the first half of next year. Charles Dutoit conducts Japan's NHK Orchestra in 2001 They took that action after Dutoit was accused of sexual assault by four women. Retired opera singer Paula Rasmussen described an incident she said occurred in Dutoit's dressing room at the LA Opera in September 1991. ""He threw me against the wall, shoved my hand down his pants and shoved his tongue down my throat,"" she told the Associated Press. Ms Rasmussen, 52, now an attorney in the San Francisco area, said she had been summoned by Dutoit to his dressing room. She refused to ever be alone with him again, she added. Another singer, Sylvia McNair, said Dutoit ""tried to have his way"" with her at a hotel after a rehearsal with the Minnesota Orchestra in 1985. ""As soon as it was just the two of us in the elevator, Charles Dutoit pushed me back against the elevator wall and pressed his knee way up between my legs and pressed himself all over me,"" she said. The other two accusers asked to remain anonymous, saying that they feared Dutoit could have them blacklisted from performing. One told the Associated Press the conductor assaulted her three times in 2006 and once in 2010, grabbing her breasts and pinning her wrists against his dressing room wall. Dutoit has conducted in the world's major opera houses and has been nominated for 10 Grammy Awards, winning twice. He was artistic director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra for 25 years, music director of the Orchestre National de France for a decade, and is currently music director emeritus of the NHK Symphony Orchestra in Tokyo.

"The jets also refuelled from the prime minister's plane during the training exercise Two Typhoon jets armed with air-to-air missiles intercepted Theresa May's plane on its return to the UK from Cyprus as part of a training exercise. Theresa May watched pilots carry out the manoeuvre - a rehearsal for a suspected hijacking scenario - from the cockpit of the RAF Voyager. The jets, scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, also hooked up to the PM's plane for air-to-air refuelling. Mrs May was returning from a two-day trip to Poland and Cyprus. The fighter jets pulled up alongside the converted Voyager at 17,000 feet, and tipped their wings as part of the exercise. Watch: What is it like to fly the RAF Typhoon jet? RAF jets intercept flight after 'hoax' RAF heads off Russian jets near Scotland Johnson urges better Russia relations Pilots from 3 Squadron and 11 Squadron performed the manoeuvre. The jets each took on four tonnes of fuel during the exercise, at 600kg-a-minute. The Typhoons are the sort of jets that would be used to intercept foreign planes illegally entering British airspace and the exercise demonstrated how the RAF's Quick Reaction Alert would work. Mrs May was said to have spent the rest of the journey working on papers from her ministerial Red Box and relaxing with a sudoku number puzzle. Theresa May visited RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus on her way back to the UK from Poland She said: ""Witnessing the unique skill of the RAF at first hand is an absolute privilege and demonstrates that the British Armed Forces are the finest in the world.

"This video can not be played Sam Kyme made a plea through her friends to keep her sons out of care A woman with motor neurone disease who raised more than Â£40,000 to enable her sons to live with her sister in Australia has died. Sam Kyme, 34, from Banbury, could no longer talk, but made the plea through her friends on a crowdfunding website. The cash will be used to fund the funeral, plane tickets, and legal and school fees. Sister Pippa Hughes said she passed away on Thursday ""knowing everything is sorted for her kids"". Ms Hughes lives in Australia and it was her sister's ""last wish"" that her sons Joey and Harry could live with her there. ""It's amazing how life can change in a year,"" Ms Hughes said. ""This time last year it was Christmas and we were all together and this year it's completely changed. ""There was no warning, you just never know what's going to happen. ""We've got a few days now to scream and shout and cry, but Christmas, we're going to make it for Sam."" Sam dreamed her boys would have a new life in Australia after her death Friend Susanna Howard said Ms Kyme died ""peacefully with her family around her"". ""The family are deeply saddened but also relieved that she is no longer suffering,"" she said. ""We know that Sam would like everyone to celebrate her life by raising a glass to her and her family at this festive time."" Sam Kyme (left) was diagnosed four months after this picture was taken with her sister Pippa Hughes Ms Kyme was diagnosed in April and told she had months to live.

""My greatest fear is not that I am dying - it is the welfare of my boys,"" Ms Kyme's message had said on her crowdfunding page. ""I fear that Joey and Harry will go into care,"" it continued.

"""Now is the time for dialogue,"" said Carles Puigdemont Catalonia's ousted leader, Carles Puigdemont, has called for new talks with Spain after separatist parties won a slim majority in a regional election. He said he wanted the negotiations in Brussels, where he is living in self-imposed exile, or another EU country. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy later appeared to reject the idea. He said he would hold talks with the head of the new Catalan government but that leader would have to take up their post in Catalonia itself. He avoided naming Mr Puigdemont, adding that the winner of Thursday's election was InÃ©s Arrimadas,  the leader of the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain. The Citizens party is now the region's biggest party. although pro-independence parties are best placed to form a government. ""Catalonia wants to be an independent state,"" said Mr Puigdemont, speaking in Belgium on Friday. ""This is the wish of the Catalan people. I think the plan of [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy is not working, so we have to find new ways to tackle this crisis."" Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) recorded its worst ever result in Thursday's vote. He had hoped that the poll would restore stability and said the Spanish government was ""willing to talk in a realistic way and inside the law"" with a future Catalan government. ""I offer Catalonia this because we care about the people"" he said. Analysis: Catalan political landscape as divided as ever Catalonia crisis in 300 words Will Catalan independence happen? The Spanish government imposed direct rule on Catalonia and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal. Mr Puigdemont has also called on the prime minister to repatriate all the police sent to Catalonia before the referendum. With nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Together for Catalonia (JxCat), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were on course to win a total of 70 seats in total, giving them a majority in the new parliament. Citizens (Cs) had 25.3% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber. Its leader told the BBC her party had been ""victorious"". Ms InÃ©s Arrimadas said forming a coalition would be ""difficult - but we will try"". The PP, meanwhile, won only three seats, down from 11 in the previous assembly. Turnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. By BBC Monitoring Leading Spanish newspapers say that the result has strengthened the government's position. ""Nationalism can no longer claim that it exclusively represents Catalonia,"" says Madrid-based La RazÃ³n. ABC newspaper thinks Madrid should now settle the Catalan crisis. ""If Spain wants to win this fight in the long term and prevent Catalonia from leaving one day, it should draft a serious plan for strengthening the state."" The result seems to have split Catalan papers between those who want the independence project to continue, and those who accept the realpolitik of the election result. ""The independence movement has humiliated the Spanish prime minister,"" El Nacional says. ""The decisions that affect Catalonia are not made in Madrid."" But Barcelona's El PeriÃ³dico says the result means a ""divided Catalonia"". ""The election that Mariano Rajoy called has shown that Catalonia is firmly divided in two blocs and there is hardly any space for intermediaries."" La Vanguardia writes: ""Major forces supporting independence should look back, confess to mistakes and avoid making them again,"" Separatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October after a referendum that was declared illegal by Spain. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots. The move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured. The man who wants to break up Spain Could Catalonia make a success of independence? According to referendum organisers, 90% of voters were in favour of independence, but fewer than half the region's electorate took part. InÃ©s Arrimadas said she would try to form a coalition However, Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain. Mr Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election. Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. The European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result. The executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain. ""Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,"" commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency. Muslim woman seeks seat in Catalonia Catalonia region profile ""In relation to a regional election, we have no comment to make,"" he added. The Spanish government has not yet commented on the results. Analysts say the success of separatist parties means that the ball is now back in the Spanish government's court. Antonio Barroso, of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence, says the problem for Madrid remains ""and the secession movement is not going to go away"". Correspondents say it is not yet clear whether Mr Puigdemont will be renamed president, and if so, if he will return from Belgium.  As things stand, he faces arrest, should he enter Spain. Independence supporters celebrated in Barcelona Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years. Before the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under General Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75. When Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again under the 1978 constitution, and the region prospered along with the rest of the new, democratic Spain. A 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a ""nation"", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010. Recession and cuts in public spending fuelled local resentment, which coalesced in a powerful secessionist movement. Following a trial referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election and went on to win a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also banned and boycotted by unionists.

"Bitcoin plunged on Friday, extending a fall that saw the crypto-currency lose almost a third of its value from a record of nearly $20,000 (Â£15,000). The crypto-currency's price dipped below $11,000 on Friday, according to the Coindesk exchange website,,externalbefore recovering to above $13,000. Amid the swings, three Bitcoin-related exchanges suspended certain trades. Bitcoin has had a blistering trip over the past 12 months. Its price at the start of the year was about $1,000. It has skyrocketed since - more than doubling in value since November -  drawing interest from major firms as well as private investors. But since Sunday Bitcoin has been on a losing streak, falling back to where it was at the start of December. Analysts said investors should be prepared for such rapid changes, which have characterised the asset from its start. ""This is exactly how this asset trades and has done since the beginning,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of New York-based DataTrek Research. ""It has a lot of volatility and it will for the foreseeable future."" This week's plunge led to a flood of trades that swamped one of Bitcoin's major exchanges, Coinbase, on Friday. A technical slowdown prompted the firm tohalt buying and selling,externaltwice. Is Asia driving the Bitcoin craze? What is Bitcoin? 'Be ready to lose your money' The CME and CBOE exchanges in the US also temporarily suspended trading of certain Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on where they expect the price of Bitcoin to be at certain points in the future. The exchanges have automatic brakes that apply once a commodity or asset has moved by a certain amount - as happened in this case. The market remains driven by sentiment, according to Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive of industry website Cryptocompare. ""A manic upward swing led by the herd will be followed by a downturn as the emotional sentiment changes,"" he said. Some traders would have been cashing in on the spectacular gains made over the year, he added. Some argue the crypto-currency craze is just a lot of hot air (yes, we know it is probably helium) Concerns about the infrastructure behind crypto-assets may also be spooking investors, said Nick Colas, himself a Bitcoin trader. In recent weeks,markets have been rattled by hacksandallegations of insider trading. He attributes some of this week's slump to the launch of a new crypto-asset that came earlier than planned. The surprise temporary shutdown of Coinbase on Friday was the kind of thing that could erode investor confidence, he argued. ""It is not OK to just take trading offline randomly through the day,"" he said. ""The robustness of that system is just as important to their confidence... as the price of crypto-currencies themselves."" A spokesman for Coinbase said the firm was working around the clock to ensure smooth trading. Friday's suspensions lasted for about two hours in total. ""We're doing everything within our power,"" the spokesman said. A digital asset, Bitcoin is not backed by any governments. It is created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There is a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day, with more than 16.5 million now in circulation. Supply is expected to peak at about 21 million. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undoing transactions. Regulators around the world have stepped up their warnings about its provenance as an investment. One of this week's most striking comments came from Denmark's central bank governor, who called it a ""deadly"" gamble. Earlier this month, the head of one of the UK's leading financial regulators warned people to be ready to ""lose all their money"" if they invested in Bitcoin. Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC that neither central banks nor the government stood behind the ""currency"" and therefore it was not a secure investment. Despite the risk to individuals, US authorities have said they do not think it is a big enough part of financial markets to be a threat to broader economic stability.

"British passports will change from burgundy to blue after Britain leaves the EU, the Home Office has said. Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis said he was delighted to return to the ""iconic"" blue and gold design which came into use almost 100 years ago. The new passports will be issued to those renewing or applying for a passport from October 2019. Burgundy passports were first issued in 1988. The EU has never compelled the UK to change the colour of its passport. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage responded to the announcement by tweeting ""Happy Brexmas!"" He added: ""In the 2016 referendum, we wanted our passports back. Now we've got them back!"" But Labour MP Mary Creagh tweeted: ""No-one under 45 will have owned a blue passport, and most will think they're not worth Â£50 billion and crashing the economy."" Mr Lewis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he knew many Remain voters who still had an ""attachment"" and ""speak fondly"" of the blue passport. By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent Did Brussels force the UK to change the colour of its passport? No. The European Union has never had the power to force the UK to change the colour of the British passport. Dumping the blue for burgundy was a decision taken by the UK in the 1980s after the then EEC (European Economic Community) member states tried to harmonise designs to make life easier for travellers and border officials. So this wasn't a decision forced on the UK by Brussels Eurocrats. Ministers could have ignored it. Croatia retained its blue passport after it joined the EU in 2013. Some countries in the EU have a burgundy passport like Italy (left), but Croatia retained its blue passport (right) after joining the union in 2013 In a similar vein, the EU has never had the power to order the UK to remove references to Her Majesty The Queen from the passport. It is still a British document, but with added EU wording to guarantee freedom of movement. The only legal requirement to harmonise EU passports related to security standards, part of a global governmental effort to combat forgery. If the EU wanted passports to change in any other way, the plans would need each government to agree. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, who campaigned to bring back the blue passport, tweeted: ""A great Christmas present for those who care about our national identity - the fanatical Remainers hate it, but the restoration of our own British passport is a powerful symbol that Britain is Back!"" However, many other people have mocked the announcement on social media. Simon Blackwell, a comedy writer, said: ""Why do we need any colour passport? We should just be able to shout, ""British! Less of your nonsense!"" and stroll straight through."" According to thePassport Index,external, 76 countries have blue passports, including a number of former colonial and Commonwealth countries, such as Australia, the United States, Canada, India and Hong Kong. Several Caribbean countries also have blue passports, including Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and St Vincent and the Grenadines. In Europe, people from Iceland and Bosnia and Herzegovina both carry blue passports, while it is also a popular colour in central and south America - Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Uruguay and Venezuela are among those that have them. Others include Israel, Iraq, Syria and North Korea. Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, tweeted: ""I've just spent the last 10 minutes screaming 'Take that you burgundy symbol of EU oppression' at my passport. ""It just stares insolently back, as if it is an inanimate and merely functional object and its colour doesn't matter."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The new passports will also have updated security features to protect against fraud, Mr Lewis said. The Home Office said there was no need for British passport holders to do anything ahead of their current passport renewal date, adding that the changes would be introduced in phases. When the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, burgundy passports will continue to be issued but with no reference to the European Union. The blue passports will be issued later the same year, after a new contract for their production is negotiated. ""Leaving the EU gives us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path for ourselves in the world"", Mr Lewis said. 1414: The first version of the passport - 'Safe Conducts' was introduced during the reign of King Henry V (seen here at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415). First introduced during the reign of Henry V in the form of a ""safe conduct"", passports were granted from at least 1540 One of the earliest still in existence was issued on 18 June 1641 and signed by Charles I A passport photograph became a requirement in 1914, upon the outbreak of World War One The blue British passport came into use in 1921, with the last expiring in 2003 The first burgundy, machine-readable, UK passports were issued in Glasgow, in September 1988 Should the British passport be blue?

"Mr Kay was jailed in 2013 for four and half years after a trial at Derby Crown Court A man jailed for rape four years ago has had his conviction overturned after new Facebook evidence emerged. Danny Kay's sentence was quashed by the Court of Appeal after deleted messages were found in an archived folder backing his version of events. The 26-year-old had denied rape at Derby Crown Court in 2013 but was jailed for four-and-a-half years. Judges ruled on Thursday the new evidence supported his claim the sex was consensual. The messages showed that jurors at the trial had been given an ""edited and misleading"" picture of the conversation between the pair, the court heard. More stories from around the East Midlands In his ruling, Mr Justice James Goss said: ""We have come to the conclusion that, in a case of one word against another,  the full Facebook message exchange provides very cogent evidence both in relation to the truthfulness and reliability of (the woman) ... and the reliability of (Mr Kay's) account and his truthfulness."" Judges heard police asked the woman to retrieve Facebook messages that they had exchanged. Three pages of messages had been printed and the woman, who cannot be identified, told jurors she had deleted some to free up storage space. She had said there had been little contact after sex, but defence lawyers argued the new evidence showed otherwise. The ruling comes after aConservative MP's chief of staff was cleared of rapeafter saying sex was consensual. In another high-profile case,charges against 22-year-old student Liam Allan were droppedafter police failed to reveal vital phone evidence.

"This video can not be played Kate Maltby on ""highly sexualised"" Westminster environment Kate Maltby, who claims Damian Green made inappropriate advances to her, says she told a senior Downing Street aide about his behaviour in 2016. The MP, who denies the claims, was sacked from the cabinet on Wednesday. This came after an inquiry found he had broken the ministerial code over ""misleading"" statements after pornography was found on his computer. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was not aware of the claims about Mr Green until last month. Allegations 'completely false' - Green Theresa May 'had to sack Damian Green' Did a police vendetta topple Damian Green? Speaking on a visit to Cyprus, she said she had first read about them inan article by Ms Maltby in the Times newspaper.,external She said: ""I recognise that Kate Maltby was obviously extremely distressed by what happened. Damian Green has recognised that and he has apologised. I think that is absolutely the right thing to do."" She has said it is important that people working in Parliament feel they can bring forward any concerns they have to be ""treated seriously"". The Cabinet Office investigation into Mr Green was prompted by her allegations that Mr Green had ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. The inquiry was later widened to include the claims about legal pornography being discovered on his computer after a police raid on his Commons office in 2008. Speaking after the inquiry, which concluded that her evidence was ""plausible"", Ms Maltby told the BBC she had not told many people about the alleged incident at the time - except her parents - as she ""wondered if it was a one-off"". ""Eventually I spoke to a very senior and long-serving aide of Theresa May,"" she added. When giving evidence to the inquiry, she told its head, Sue Gray, that Downing Street was aware of her allegations ""to the best of my knowledge"". ""I was aware that he was the deputy prime minister and I was aware that No 10 knew about it."" Ms Maltby said she had never called for Mr Green's sacking, but wrote her article because she wanted to change the culture of Downing Street. ""This whole story has been about power,"" she said. ""Damian Green became a very, very powerful person. ""I was aware that there seemed to be improper mixing of mentorship and sexual advance within the Conservative party in his case."" Mr Green was sacked after making ""misleading"" statement about pornography found on his computer Ms Maltby added: ""My actions in this have never been guided by the quest to claim scalps, to force resignations to end people's careers. ""We need an end to the era in which the sexual exploitation of younger people is the sort of peccadillo of a politician. ""That is tolerated by those in power and perhaps exploited to enforce party discipline but not to actually do any good."" A Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The Cabinet Office conducted a thorough investigation into a number of allegations about Damian Green. ""The PM has made it clear that everyone should be able to work in politics without fear or harassment - that is why she has brought forward a new code of conduct for the Conservative Party, and set up a cross-party working group to make recommendations about the Houses of Parliament."" Speaking on Thursday, Mrs May reiterated her personal ""sadness"" at sacking her close ally Mr Green but said it was ""absolutely right"" that he had apologised to Ms Maltby. Although Mr Green was sacked over his statements about the pornography on his computer, he used his resignation letter to also apologise to Ms Maltby, who was a family friend. ""I deeply regret the distress caused to Kate Maltby following her article about me and the reaction to it,"" he wrote. ""I do not recognise the events she described in her article, but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise."" This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC Meanwhile, former senior police officer Bob Quick and retired detective Neil Lewis, who told the BBC he had been ""shocked"" by the contents of Mr Green's office computer, are being investigated for possible breaches of the Data Protection Act. The Metropolitan Police, who referred the case to the data regulator, said the pair were under investigation over the ""apparent disclosure to the media of confidential material gathered during a police investigation in 2008"". Conservative MPs are angry about the alleged actions of the two retired detectives, with Jeremy Hunt claiming they ""did not sit comfortably in a democracy"" - something, he added, Theresa May ""had made clear"" in her letter to Mr Green. Boris Johnson said the actions of the police ""had the slight feeling of a vendetta"", and needed to be investigated further.

"Thousands of travellers have hit the UK's roads and railways at the start of the Christmas getaway on what was billed as ""frantic Friday"". An estimated 1.3 million Christmas drivers were expected to add to the usual end-of-week traffic. Bristol Airport cancelled flights after a plane came off the runway and several train lines reported disruption. However, road delays were less severe than predicted, with the RAC suggesting many may travel on Saturday instead. Christmas getaway: What you need to know Driving home? 10 things to know about roads Virgin rail strikes called off Many of Britain's mainline routes will be partially shut in the coming days as Network Rail carries out its biggest ever Christmas engineering programme.

Earlier, the M1 was hit by three serious incidents with a vehicle fire closing three northbound lanes. The M40 southbound was closed earlier between junction 10 (Brackley) and junction nine (Bicester), after a lorry caught fire. Witnesses said the vehiclewas carrying bottles of beerwhich exploded due to the heat. However,according to Highways England,external, the disruption has now cleared. Some stretches of the M40 remain slow due to road works.

"Berlin has been remembering those hurt and killed in a terror attack on a Christmas market this time last year MI5 has had to reassure its European partners about co-operation since the Brexit referendum, the head of the security service says, but the twin fears of terrorism and Russia has meant that European countries still want the UK's help. With a marked increase in the number of attacks in Europe, the committee said the government should be more forthcoming on any potential risks associated with Britain leaving the EU. The annual report of the Intelligence and Security Committee provides the most detailed overview of the work of Britain's spy agencies. The committee, chaired by Dominic Grieve MP, said that the last two years had seen a rise in attacks in Europe leading to questions over the capability of some countries to deal with the threat. That had led to closer co-operation between different intelligence and security services. European mechanisms played an essential role in the UK's national security, the committee said, and it urged the government to outline its assessment of the risks of the UK's departure from the EU and the measures it is putting in place. One question the committee asked head of MI5 Andrew Parker was whether he was confident that Brexit would not have an impact on counter-terrorist work. ""Yes and no,"" he replied. ""There are two parts to this. ""My life has got more difficult since the referendum because of the need to invest reassurance time with all of our European partners, but the thing that is driving the quality of those relationships currently is the darkness of the threat and the common concern about it. ""Half of Europe is scared of terrorism and the other half is scared of Russia and both halves want us to help them."" Mr Parker said this would not change with Brexit since much of the national security work was outside of the EU anyway. However, he said his ""hesitancy"" was because there were certain issues which were within EU competence and might be affected by the negotiations, in particular those that relate to data-sharing across borders. Head of MI5 Andrew Parker says his life has got harder since the UK voted to leave the EU A witness from GCHQ also said it had concerns as to how European data-sharing would work after Brexit with the likely need for some kind of arrangement to share data in a way which accords with European privacy concerns. ""That's a policy issue way beyond intelligence, actually, but it will have big implications for us, so getting that right is important,"" the individual told the committee. MI5 said the most striking shift in counter-terrorist work in the last five years was the rise in what is called ""high-risk casework"" - referring to individuals who have received terrorist training or are attempting to procure the means to carry out an attack, but who may not yet have a current attack plan. It is also estimated that more than 300 UK individuals who went to join so-called Islamic State remained in the Middle East and might pose a threat if they returned to the UK. Overall, it is thought 6,000 European fighters travelled out to fight with IS. The annual report also points to the breadth of concerns for the agencies. MI5 told the committee that Northern Ireland represents the ""most concentrated area of terrorist activity probably anywhere in Europe"", with terrorist activity disrupted on a weekly basis. Dissident republicans conducted 16 attacks on national security targets in 2015/16, they say. Northern Ireland-related terrorism accounted for about 18% of MI5's operational and investigative resources. 64% is devoted to what is called international counter-terrorism (largely Islamist-related activity from groups like IS and al-Qaeda). MI5's work on hostile state activity, including counter-espionage, counterproliferation and protective security, accounts for around 18% of its effort. Russia has risen up the list of priorities in recent years. MI6 described the Russian state as ""formidable adversaries"" to the committee. ""They clearly are operating to risk thresholds which are nothing like those that the West operates,"" MI5 said. Officials described a number of steps taken to protect the UK's political system from the kind of attack allegedly seen in 2016 in the US, including tracking the major known perpetrators and ensuring individuals involved in politics had access to security advice. So far there are few signs of the close working relationship with the US being affected by the Trump administration, the committee says, although the agencies are aware of the potential risks, especially if campaign talk of returning to waterboarding of detainees was to actually become policy. ""Any significant change in US policies relating to detainee treatment would pose very serious questions for the UK-USA intelligence relationship,"" MI6 said. One other revelation came in the report.

"This video can not be played Russia 'tries to sow discord in the West' Senior Russian politicians have dismissed accusations by Theresa May that Moscow has meddled in elections and carried out cyber-espionage. On Monday night, Mrs May accused Moscow of ""planting fake stories"" to ""sow discord in the West"". She said Vladimir Putin's government was trying to ""undermine free societies"". Russian senators accused the UK PM of ""making a fool of herself"" with a ""counterproductive"" speech. But the top US diplomat in the UK, Woody Johnson, said countries engaging in such behaviour needed to be ""called out"". President Donald Trump's newly appointed ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Mrs May ""probably has evidence"" of Russian meddling and she had ""every right"" to draw attention to it. Boris Johnson set for Moscow visit Trump and Putin 'agree to defeat IS' Trump backs US agencies after Putin remark Mrs May's comments, at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at London's Guildhall, were in contrast to those of US President Donald Trump, who last week said he believed President Putin's denial of intervening in the 2016 presidential election. The Russian Embassy in the UK hit back at her criticism on Twitter and described her remarks as ""fake news"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator involved in media policy, said: ""The world order that suits May, with the seizure of Iraq, war in Libya, the rise of IS and terrorism in Europe, has had its day. You can't save it by attacking Russia."" This video can not be played Wood Johnson on Mrs May's comments: 'She probably has evidence to indicate that that was the case' Leonid Slutsky, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russia's Parliament, said: ""Russia, like the UK, is by no means striving to bring back the Cold War. We are ready to develop a mutual dialogue and partnership relations."" He added: ""In this case, I completely disagree with the statement that Russia is allegedly trying to undermine the international system of rules."" And Frants Klintsevich, deputy chairman of the defence and security committee in the Parliament's upper house, said: ""May has done more damage to herself than to us, making a fool of herself in the eyes of the world community and once again raising Russia's profile."" UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to visit Russia next month. In what Mrs May described as a ""very simple message"" for President Putin, she said he must choose a very ""different path"" from the one that in recent years had seen Moscow annex Crimea, foment conflict in Ukraine and launch cyber-attacks on governments and parliaments across Europe. This video can not be played What Boris Johnson told MPs about Russian meddling in UK elections Russia could be a valuable partner of the West but only if it ""plays by the rules"", she argued. ""Russia has repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption. ""This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag among many others. ""We know what you are doing and you will not succeed. Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us."" She said that as the UK left the EU and charted a new course in the world, it remained absolutely committed to Nato and securing a Brexit deal which ""strengthens our liberal values"", adding that a strong economic partnership between the UK and EU would be a bulwark against Russian agitation in Europe. There are some countries in Europe that believe the West should engage more closely with Russia. They argue the European Union and the United States should better understand Russia's point of view, its belief that it is threatened from all sides. And that more should be done to accommodate this sense of vulnerability, by softening Nato's approach and reducing sanctions. Well, not Theresa May. In a speech in the US in February, the prime minister spoke of the need to ""engage but beware"" of Russia. She has now switched the order and the focus is very much on beware. She believes that President Putin should be called out for the threat that she believes he poses both internationally and in the UK. The Electoral Commission is investigating claims that Russia used social media to meddle in the Brexit referendum. So Mrs May is willing to engage with Russia - she is sending the foreign secretary to Moscow next month. But she also wants Russia to know that Mr Johnson will come with a clear message that its destabilising activities will no longer be tolerated. Mr Johnson, who will be making his first trip to Russia as foreign secretary in December, has said the UK's policy to Russia must be one of ""beware but engage"" following a decade of strained relations. He told MPs earlier this month that he had not seen any evidence of Russia trying to interfere in British elections or the 2016 Brexit vote, in which Moscow has insisted it remained neutral. In her speech, Mrs May said the UK would ""take the necessary action to counter Russian activity"". ""We do not want to return to the Cold War or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation. ""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability. ""Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path. But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend.""

"Gambling giant Ladbrokes Coral has agreed to be bought by online rival GVC in a deal worth up to Â£4bn. Under the deal, shareholders in GVC - which owns the Bwin, Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo brands - will hold 53.5% of the combined group. Ladbrokes Coral became the UK's biggest High Street bookmaker following last year's merger of Ladbrokes and Coral. The company has about 3,500 High Street outlets and employs more than 25,000 staff. GVC - which has 2,800 employees - has grown rapidly in recent years through a number of takeovers,  most notably that of Bwin.party in February last year. The final worth of the deal is dependent on the government's review of gaming machines known as fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has said it will cap the size of stakes gamblers can make on FOBTs, amid concerns they may harm vulnerable people. Bookies brace for possible sales hit Ministers have proposed that bets on the machines should be cut from a maximum of Â£100 a spin to somewhere between Â£2 and Â£50. GVC and Ladbrokes Coral have said that the review could hit the profitability of Ladbrokes Coral's UK business. Ladbrokes, Coral, Gala Casino, Gala Bingo, Eurobet, Betdaq, Sportium Bwin, Sportingbet, Betboo, Gamebookers, Partypoker, Partycasino, CasinoClub, Gioco Digitale, Foxy Bingo, Foxy Casino Under the terms of the deal, for each share that Ladbrokes Coral shareholders own, they will get 32.7p in cash and 0.141 ordinary GVC shares, plus a ""contingent value right"" worth up to 42.8p. The size of this contingent entitlement will be decided by the outcome of the DCMS review. GVC chief executive Kenneth Alexander described the takeover deal as ""a truly exciting prospect"". Ladbrokes Coral chairman John Kelly said the tie-up with GVC would ""improve the customer experience, drive faster online growth and build a more diverse and extensive international portfolio of businesses"".

"The National Cyber Security Centre said the UK's energy sector had been targeted One of the UK's cyber-defence chiefs has accused Russia of having attacked Britain's media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), added that Russia was ""seeking to undermine the international system"". His comments were made at an event organised by the Times newspaper. Ahead of the speech, the paper reported that one of the attacks hadtargeted the UK's power supply,externalon election day. The Russian Embassy in London said it was concerned the assertions were misleading. The NCSC was established about a year ago. Last month, it revealed that it had already classed a total of 590 attacks - from a variety of perpetrators - as being ""significant"", and that more than 30 incidents had been judged serious enough to require a cross-government response. Mr Martin's accusations follow Prime Minister Theresa May's own claim that Russia had ""mounted a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption"". The NCSC chief referenced this in his own speech. ""The prime minister made the point on Monday night - international order as we know it is in danger of being eroded,"" he said. ""This is clearly a cause for concern and the NCSC is actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society to tackle this threat."" However, Russia has suggested the accusations are ""non-transparent and biased"". ""We would be interested in finding out the details and seeing the original findings on which the statements are based,"" the country's London embassy said. ""It would be most unfortunate to see [Britain] informed by wrong intelligence."" The London-based National Cyber Security Centre was launched in October 2016 To coincide with its event, the Times also published details of a new study into how Russia used Twitter to influence 2016's Brexit referendum. The research indicates that more than 156,000 Russia-based accounts - many of them automated bots - mentioned #Brexit in original posts or retweets in the days surrounding the vote. Many were in favour of the UK leaving the European Union, but a minority were pro-Remain. The academics involved believed the posts were seen hundreds of millions of times. One of the researchers told the BBC that social media was providing Russia with a relatively cheap way to spread its propaganda. ""Ukraine experienced [a similar] information war in 2014 - and if it worked in Ukraine it can also work in Western democracies,"" said Prof Sasha Talavera from Swansea University. ""One can use it to split society and marginalise groups. Social media nowadays is a powerful tool."" He added that some form of regulation of the large social media firms might now be required. The Guardian reports details of a separate University of Edinburgh studythat also presents evidence of Russia using Twitter,externalto sway opinion in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. The Kremlin has previously denied trying to meddle in the referendum. But the chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Damian Collins, said he now wanted Twitter to share examples of tweets linked to a Russian ""troll factory"", known as the Internet Research Agency, about British politics.

"""Now is the time for dialogue,"" said Carles Puigdemont Catalonia's ousted leader, Carles Puigdemont, has called for new talks with Spain after separatist parties won a slim majority in a regional election. He said he wanted the negotiations in Brussels, where he is living in self-imposed exile, or another EU country. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy later appeared to reject the idea. He said he would hold talks with the head of the new Catalan government but that leader would have to take up their post in Catalonia itself. He avoided naming Mr Puigdemont, adding that the winner of Thursday's election was InÃ©s Arrimadas,  the leader of the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain. The Citizens party is now the region's biggest party. although pro-independence parties are best placed to form a government. ""Catalonia wants to be an independent state,"" said Mr Puigdemont, speaking in Belgium on Friday. ""This is the wish of the Catalan people. I think the plan of [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy is not working, so we have to find new ways to tackle this crisis."" Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) recorded its worst ever result in Thursday's vote. He had hoped that the poll would restore stability and said the Spanish government was ""willing to talk in a realistic way and inside the law"" with a future Catalan government. ""I offer Catalonia this because we care about the people"" he said. Analysis: Catalan political landscape as divided as ever Catalonia crisis in 300 words Will Catalan independence happen? The Spanish government imposed direct rule on Catalonia and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal. Mr Puigdemont has also called on the prime minister to repatriate all the police sent to Catalonia before the referendum. With nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Together for Catalonia (JxCat), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were on course to win a total of 70 seats in total, giving them a majority in the new parliament. Citizens (Cs) had 25.3% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber. Its leader told the BBC her party had been ""victorious"". Ms InÃ©s Arrimadas said forming a coalition would be ""difficult - but we will try"". The PP, meanwhile, won only three seats, down from 11 in the previous assembly. Turnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. By BBC Monitoring Leading Spanish newspapers say that the result has strengthened the government's position. ""Nationalism can no longer claim that it exclusively represents Catalonia,"" says Madrid-based La RazÃ³n. ABC newspaper thinks Madrid should now settle the Catalan crisis. ""If Spain wants to win this fight in the long term and prevent Catalonia from leaving one day, it should draft a serious plan for strengthening the state."" The result seems to have split Catalan papers between those who want the independence project to continue, and those who accept the realpolitik of the election result. ""The independence movement has humiliated the Spanish prime minister,"" El Nacional says. ""The decisions that affect Catalonia are not made in Madrid."" But Barcelona's El PeriÃ³dico says the result means a ""divided Catalonia"". ""The election that Mariano Rajoy called has shown that Catalonia is firmly divided in two blocs and there is hardly any space for intermediaries."" La Vanguardia writes: ""Major forces supporting independence should look back, confess to mistakes and avoid making them again,"" Separatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October after a referendum that was declared illegal by Spain. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots. The move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured. The man who wants to break up Spain Could Catalonia make a success of independence? According to referendum organisers, 90% of voters were in favour of independence, but fewer than half the region's electorate took part. InÃ©s Arrimadas said she would try to form a coalition However, Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain. Mr Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election. Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. The European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result. The executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain. ""Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,"" commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency. Muslim woman seeks seat in Catalonia Catalonia region profile ""In relation to a regional election, we have no comment to make,"" he added. The Spanish government has not yet commented on the results. Analysts say the success of separatist parties means that the ball is now back in the Spanish government's court. Antonio Barroso, of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence, says the problem for Madrid remains ""and the secession movement is not going to go away"". Correspondents say it is not yet clear whether Mr Puigdemont will be renamed president, and if so, if he will return from Belgium.  As things stand, he faces arrest, should he enter Spain. Independence supporters celebrated in Barcelona Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years. Before the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under General Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75. When Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again under the 1978 constitution, and the region prospered along with the rest of the new, democratic Spain. A 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a ""nation"", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010. Recession and cuts in public spending fuelled local resentment, which coalesced in a powerful secessionist movement. Following a trial referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election and went on to win a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also banned and boycotted by unionists.

"Charles Dutoit amassed 10 Grammy Award nominations between 1982-2008 The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has cancelled conductor Charles Dutoit's appearances ""for the immediate future"" following sexual assault allegations. Three opera singers and a musician say Dutoit forced himself on them, the Associated Press news agency reported. The conductor has not responded to requests for comment from the agency. Dutoit is principal conductor and artistic director at the London-based orchestra. Other orchestras have also distanced themselves from him. In a statement, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) said it and Dutoit had ""jointly agreed"" to release him from his forthcoming concert obligations for the immediate future. ""These accusations are taken very seriously by the orchestra and the RPO believes that the truth of the matter should be determined by the legal process,"" it said. ""The immediate action taken by the RPO and Charles Dutoit allows time for a clear picture to be established. Charles Dutoit needs to be given a fair opportunity to seek legal advice and contest these accusations."" Dutoit has led the orchestra since 2009. Meanwhile, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony have severed ties with the Swiss-born conductor. The New York Philharmonic said he had been withdrawn from conducting five concerts scheduled for January, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Cleveland Orchestra said he had withdrawn from concerts scheduled in the first half of next year. Charles Dutoit conducts Japan's NHK Orchestra in 2001 They took that action after Dutoit was accused of sexual assault by four women. Retired opera singer Paula Rasmussen described an incident she said occurred in Dutoit's dressing room at the LA Opera in September 1991. ""He threw me against the wall, shoved my hand down his pants and shoved his tongue down my throat,"" she told the Associated Press. Ms Rasmussen, 52, now an attorney in the San Francisco area, said she had been summoned by Dutoit to his dressing room. She refused to ever be alone with him again, she added. Another singer, Sylvia McNair, said Dutoit ""tried to have his way"" with her at a hotel after a rehearsal with the Minnesota Orchestra in 1985. ""As soon as it was just the two of us in the elevator, Charles Dutoit pushed me back against the elevator wall and pressed his knee way up between my legs and pressed himself all over me,"" she said. The other two accusers asked to remain anonymous, saying that they feared Dutoit could have them blacklisted from performing. One told the Associated Press the conductor assaulted her three times in 2006 and once in 2010, grabbing her breasts and pinning her wrists against his dressing room wall. Dutoit has conducted in the world's major opera houses and has been nominated for 10 Grammy Awards, winning twice. He was artistic director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra for 25 years, music director of the Orchestre National de France for a decade, and is currently music director emeritus of the NHK Symphony Orchestra in Tokyo.

"Prime Minister Theresa May's deputy, Damian Green, has said allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist are ""completely false"". Mr Green has instructed libel lawyers over the claims, the BBC understands. Tory activist Kate Maltby wrote in the Times that he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015, and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message. The cabinet secretary is to investigate whether Mr Green broke the ministerial code. Ms Maltby, 31, a writer and academic, said Mr Green, 61, said he had sent her the text message after she posed in a corset for the Times. Laura Kuenssberg: Calls for change in Westminster culture MPs speak out about Westminster harassment claims PM vows to tackle Westminster abuse According to her article in the paper, it read: ""Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid I felt impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?"" The encounters left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"", she wrote. Mr Green, now first secretary of state, and Theresa May's effective deputy, said he had known Ms Maltby since 2014 and the pair ""had a drink as friends twice-yearly"". ""The text I sent after she appeared in a newspaper article was sent in that spirit - as two friends agreeing to meet for a regular catch up - and nothing more,"" he said. ""This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend."" He also denied the claim he put his hand on Ms Maltby's knee. Asked about the claims in the Times as he left his home on Wednesday morning, Mr Green told reporters: ""All these allegations are completely false."" Theministerial code,externalrequires ministers to ""behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Small Business Minister Margot James said there was no need for Mr Green to resign during the cabinet secretary's investigation. ""I've read the article in the Times today, and I certainly don't think that it warrants anyone's resignation, temporary or otherwise, in my opinion,"" she said. This video can not be played William Hague tells Today he hopes Westminster is entering an era of greater accountability It comes as allegations and rumours relating to sexual harassment and abuse by MPs swirl around Westminster. On Tuesday, Labour confirmed it had launched an independent inquiry into claims that activist Bex Bailey, 25, was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a Labour event in 2011. She told the BBC she had waived her anonymity to urge changes to the way such cases are handled. In a separate case, an anonymous woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by an MP on a foreign work trip last year told the Guardianher allegations were not taken seriously,external. Earlier this week, a spokesman for Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon confirmed he was once rebuked by a journalist for putting his hand on her knee during dinner. Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a list, thought to have been compiled by staff and researchers at Westminster, detailing a range of mostly unproven allegations about 40 Conservative MPs and ministers. Among the claims are a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour with junior members of staff, the use of prostitutes and affairs between MPs. The government has promised urgent action to improve the handling of complaints about the way MPs' staff are treated.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today Damian Green clearly breached ministerial code but calls sacking a ""sad moment"" Theresa May had to sack Damian Green after he ""lied"" over what he knew about police claims to have found porn on his office computer, Jeremy Hunt has said. The health secretary said the PM had acted with a ""heavy heart"" in firing the minister, her second-in-command. Mr Hunt said questions remained about the conduct of the ex-police officer who leaked details of the pornography. Mr Green continues to deny ""hurtful"" allegations that he downloaded and viewed the material. He also apologised for making writer Kate Maltby, who says he made inappropriate advances towards her in 2015, feel uncomfortable. During her visit to Poland, Mrs May said that she expected leaks by former police officers in relation to Mr Green to be ""properly investigated"" and ""taken seriously"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he hoped Mr Green would ""one day come back"" to serve in cabinet. Mr Green has tweeted that he has been ""overwhelmed"" by supportive messages.

Downing Street has confirmed Mr Green is entitled to ministerial severance pay of almost Â£17,000, which equates to a quarter of the annual pay he received as a cabinet minister. The spokesman said it was ""a matter for the former secretary of state"" as to whether he accepts the payment or not. Did a police vendetta topple Damian Green? Profile: Who is Damian Green? It was the minister's denials - rather than anything he is alleged to have done - that ultimately led to his downfall. By admitting he had made ""misleading and inaccurate"" statements to the media, he had breached the ministerial code, a Cabinet Office inquiry found. The inquiry also found that although there were ""competing and contradictory accounts of what were private meetings"" between himself and Ms Maltby, the investigation found her account ""to be plausible"". The investigation was prompted by Ms Maltby's allegations - denied by Mr Green - but it was later widened to include claims legal pornography had been found on his computer after a police raid on his Commons office in 2008. Mr Green reacted to Mr Quick's claims, in a Sunday Times article, by saying he had not been told that ""improper material"" had been found on his Parliamentary computer. He also accused Mr Quick of being the source of the story and said he was ""tainted, untrustworthy and discredited"". May: I asked you to resign Damian Green: Timeline of his downfall But in his resignation letter, he said his statements could have been ""clearer"" and conceded that his lawyers had been informed by Met Police lawyers about their initial discovery in 2008 and the police had also raised the matter with him in a phone call in 2013. ""I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point,"" he said. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was clear Mr Green had ""lied"" and said it was right that cabinet ministers were held to the ""very highest standards of conduct"" - but it was still a ""sad moment"". Mr Quick told the BBC he will continue to ""seek a retraction"" of the comments Mr Green made about him, saying the matter was ""in the hands of my lawyers"". This video can not be played ""I was shocked"": Former detective constable Neil Lewis speaks to the BBC Bob Quick and another retired detective, Neil Lewis, who told the BBC he had been ""shocked"" by the contents of Mr Green's office computer, are being investigated for possible breaches of the Data Protection Act. The Metropolitan Police, who referred the case to the data regulator, said the pair were under investigation over the ""apparent disclosure to the media of confidential material gathered during a police investigation in 2008"". Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: ""These are serious allegations and we are investigating to determine whether the law has been broken and what further action is necessary including potential criminal prosecution."" Conservative MPs are angry about the alleged actions of the two retired detectives, with Jeremy Hunt claiming they ""did not sit comfortably in a democracy"", something, he added, Theresa May ""had made clear"" in her letter to Mr Green. Mr Johnson said the actions of the police ""had the slight feeling of a vendetta"", and needed to be investigated further. Damian Green was a confidant of the prime minister for many years Mr Green, 61, who as first secretary of state was effectively the PM's deputy, is the third cabinet minister to resign in the space of two months - Sir Michael Fallon and Priti Patel both quit in November. It is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil,writes the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, in her blog, but it does leave her a ""lonelier figure"". Mr Green, who campaigned for Remain in last year's EU referendum and had been a leading voice in Cabinet for a ""softer"" Brexit, has been a friend of the prime minister's since their Oxford University days. A Downing Street source said his resignation was a matter of sadness and regret for Mrs May, who is in Poland to announce a new defence treaty. But as prime minister she had to make sure members of her government abided by the ministerial code, the source added. The PM may decide not to appoint a new First Secretary of State, Downing Street said, but a replacement for Mr Green's other role, as Cabinet Office minster, would be announced in the New Year. Asked if his departure left Theresa May more isolated, Mr Hunt said ""leadership is lonely"" but she had shown ""extraordinary resilience in very challenging circumstances"". Kate Maltby's account was found to be plausible, the report says Kate Maltby's parents, Colin and Victoria, said in a statement they were not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been ""untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness"". They praised their 31-year-old daughter for her courage in speaking out about the ""abuse of authority"". Ms Maltby is not commenting on Mr Green's resignation until she receives more details from the Cabinet Office. On the wider issue of dealing with instances of sexual harassment or bulling in Parliament, Mrs May said the leader of the House of Commons and leader of the House of Lords were working to ensure there was a proper grievance procedure.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says poor UK relations with Russia a tragedy Boris Johnson says the UK's relations with Russia are ""not on a good footing"" but he wants them to improve, after talks in Moscow. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov accused the UK of making ""insulting"" statements ahead of the meeting. But he said he trusted Mr Johnson and they had agreed on the need to work together on the UN Security Council. Mr Johnson is the first UK foreign secretary to visit Russia in five years. MI5 warnings on Brexit, terror and Russia Facebook: Just three Russian Brexit ads Mr Lavrov said it was no secret that Britain's relations with Russia were at a ""low point"". And he accused Britain of making a series of ""aggressive and insulting"" public statements ahead of their meeting, saying Russia had done nothing to justify being seen as an aggressor in relation to its actions in Ukraine and Syria. ""I cannot recall any of Russia's actions that would be aggressive in relation to the United Kingdom. We did not blame London for anything,"" said Mr Lavrov. ""On the contrary, we have heard accusations, even insultingly formulated - that we support the criminal regime in Syria, that we are aggressors, that we are occupiers, we annex other territories. ""And all this despite the fact that on all the regional issues in question, and on many others, all information about what our position is, what it is based on, is regularly provided."" The pair also clashed over Russia's alleged attempts to interfere in elections in the West, following UK Prime Minister Theresa May's warnings about the risks ofRussia's ""sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption"". By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Despite the differences between London and Moscow, both sides have an interest in improving what is a poor relationship. There are several issues where both Britain and Russia sometimes disagree but want more dialogue. On Syria, the UK wants to help shape any future political settlement while Russia needs western money to help rebuild the country. On North Korea, both Russia and the UK want to find ways of de-escalating the crisis prompted by Pyongyang's ballistic missile programme. And on Iran, both sides want to do what they can to protect the deal they helped negotiate to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions. So Friday's meeting may have allowed both sides to rehearse their differences - and the veteran Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, gave as good as he got from the comparative novice foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. But it also allowed them to crack a few jokes and build a relationship that they could need in the years to come. This was not a reset or a return to business as usual but the opening of a channel of communication that in recent years has been as frozen as the Moscow winter. Ahead of the meeting in Moscow, the UK government said Mr Johnson would warn Russia to stop cyber-attacks which threaten Britain's national security or face retaliation of a similar kind from the UK. But Mr Lavrov accused Mr Johnson of being a ""hostage"" of untrue Western narratives on the issue, insisting Russia had not meddled in elections in other countries. Mr Johnson said there was ""abundant evidence"" of Russian interference in polls in the US, Germany, Denmark and France. Boris Johnson stands in front of Saint Basil's cathedral in Red square in Moscow And takes part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Mr Lavrov hit back by telling Mr Johnson he himself had said Russia had not interfered in Britain's general election and Brexit referendum. Mr Johnson interrupted his Russian counterpart to add: ""Not successfully."" Mr Lavrov said the evidence produced so far of Russian attempts at interference amounted to no more than the spending of ""a few kopecks"" on social media adverts. ""I think you have made all this up in your Western community and unfortunately right now you are hostage to this subject, it is very difficult for you to climb down from the fence you have climbed."" He also criticised Britain for cutting off ties with Russia's FSB security agency over the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London, saying the UK authorities had refused to hand over information in the case. He said government criticism of British politicians who speak to Russian media outlets, such as the RT television channel, damaged the reputation of the UK as ""the cradle of democracy"". Mr Johnson acknowledged the ""difficulties"" in relations with Russia, adding: ""It is a regrettable state of affairs but it should not preclude co-operation."" The UK foreign secretary said they had identified common ground on issues such as North Korea, Syria and trade - and said the UK and Russian security services should co-ordinate ahead of next year's World Cup. As the mood at the press conference relaxed, Mr Lavrov said: ""I trust Boris and I trust him to an extent that I am ready to call him BorIs [Russian-style pronunciation] rather than BOris."" Mr Johnson said he adopted the approach Ronald Reagan had taken with Mikhail Gorbachev: ""Trust, but verify."" And he joked that his trust was so great that he had handed his coat with ""everything in my pockets, secret or otherwise"" to Mr Lavrov when he arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. Mr Lavrov joked back: ""I can say that there was nothing in the pockets of Boris's coat"", to which Mr Johnson responded in surprise: ""So you have searched it already?"" Mr Johnson's trip follows Prime Minister Theresa May's accusation last month that Russia was trying to ""undermine free societies"".

"People should pay a deposit for using plastic bottles in an attempt to protect the seas from the ""devastating effects"" of plastic pollution, MPs say. The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) also wants free public drinking water fountains. And it says firms using plastic packaging should pay more for the waste they create. The government says it is consulting with industry on a deposit scheme, and charges for single-use plastics. But the MPs say ministers need to review society's relationship with plastics as a whole. They are proposing,externala sliding scale of taxes on plastic packaging. They want suppliers of hard-to-recycle complex plastics to be charged most and firms using simple easy-to-recycle packages to pay least. The MPs are trying to tackle the rising tide of plastic waste in the ocean, which has been described by UN Oceans Chief Lisa Svensson as a ""planetary crisis"". EAC Chair Mary Creagh MP said: ""Urgent action is needed to protect our environment from the devastating effects of marine plastic pollution which, if it continues to rise at current rates, will outweigh fish by 2050."" She added that the current levy on plastics producers only raised a fraction of the cost of dealing with plastic waste. ""Packaging producers don't currently have to bear the full financial burden of recycling their packaging,"" she said. ""By reforming charges, the government can ensure that producers and retailers will have financial incentives to design packaging that is easily recyclable - or face higher compliance costs."" The committee also proposes a minimum 50% recycled plastic content in plastic bottles to stimulate the recycled plastics market. Michael Gove said he'd been moved by images of plastic pollution on the Blue Planet series The Recycling Association strongly supports rules prompting packaging firms to simplify packaging and use fewer different types of plastics. The Green Party's Amelia Womack said: ""We need to design out waste from the very start of the consumer chain. That means ending production of single-use plastics while providing the infrastructure to enable corporations and individuals to recycle close to 100% of the items they use. ""Second, we need to invest in alternatives to plastic. There is a slowly rising network of zero-waste shops across the UK and companies like Splosh and Lush create products designed to have a limited or no impact on the environment. Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said ""tokenistic measures"" - such as introducing plastic-free aisles in stores - were not the answer to reducing plastic use. ""It needs a holistic solution,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""Whether that's recycling to make sure there are common recycling standards across the UK, whether it's the plastics we use."" He said Sainsbury's had reduced its plastic use by 30% since 2006 - but insisted plastic ""does perform a purpose"" for certain products. ""One of the things that is commonly cited is 'why do we put plastic on cucumbers' - it extends the life of those products,"" he said. The government says it's taking the plastics waste problem very seriously - the Environment Secretary Michael Gove told me he's considering a four-point plan. Mr Gove said he'd been moved by images of plastic pollution on the Blue Planet series. Ministers are consulting with firms on a deposit scheme for bottles, and on charges for single-use plastics. Some firms are highly sensitive to consumer pressure on the issue: Lucozade announced it would change the complex packaging on its bottles after being exposed as a recycling ""villain"" by BBC News. The British Plastics Federation was unavailable for comment. Local authorities are wary about any plans that would raise costs for them. ""It's crucial that local authorities are consulted on the introduction of any new plastic bottle deposit return scheme,"" said Councillor Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's Environment spokesman. ""If councils are to be given the responsibilities to facilitate such a service, it must be matched in funding and resources so that councils are able to successfully implement it.""

"""Now is the time for dialogue,"" said Carles Puigdemont Catalonia's ousted leader, Carles Puigdemont, has called for new talks with Spain after separatist parties won a slim majority in a regional election. He said he wanted the negotiations in Brussels, where he is living in self-imposed exile, or another EU country. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy later appeared to reject the idea. He said he would hold talks with the head of the new Catalan government but that leader would have to take up their post in Catalonia itself. He avoided naming Mr Puigdemont, adding that the winner of Thursday's election was InÃ©s Arrimadas,  the leader of the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain. The Citizens party is now the region's biggest party. although pro-independence parties are best placed to form a government. ""Catalonia wants to be an independent state,"" said Mr Puigdemont, speaking in Belgium on Friday. ""This is the wish of the Catalan people. I think the plan of [Spanish Prime Minister] Mariano Rajoy is not working, so we have to find new ways to tackle this crisis."" Mr Rajoy's conservative Popular Party (PP) recorded its worst ever result in Thursday's vote. He had hoped that the poll would restore stability and said the Spanish government was ""willing to talk in a realistic way and inside the law"" with a future Catalan government. ""I offer Catalonia this because we care about the people"" he said. Analysis: Catalan political landscape as divided as ever Catalonia crisis in 300 words Will Catalan independence happen? The Spanish government imposed direct rule on Catalonia and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal. Mr Puigdemont has also called on the prime minister to repatriate all the police sent to Catalonia before the referendum. With nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Together for Catalonia (JxCat), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were on course to win a total of 70 seats in total, giving them a majority in the new parliament. Citizens (Cs) had 25.3% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber. Its leader told the BBC her party had been ""victorious"". Ms InÃ©s Arrimadas said forming a coalition would be ""difficult - but we will try"". The PP, meanwhile, won only three seats, down from 11 in the previous assembly. Turnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. By BBC Monitoring Leading Spanish newspapers say that the result has strengthened the government's position. ""Nationalism can no longer claim that it exclusively represents Catalonia,"" says Madrid-based La RazÃ³n. ABC newspaper thinks Madrid should now settle the Catalan crisis. ""If Spain wants to win this fight in the long term and prevent Catalonia from leaving one day, it should draft a serious plan for strengthening the state."" The result seems to have split Catalan papers between those who want the independence project to continue, and those who accept the realpolitik of the election result. ""The independence movement has humiliated the Spanish prime minister,"" El Nacional says. ""The decisions that affect Catalonia are not made in Madrid."" But Barcelona's El PeriÃ³dico says the result means a ""divided Catalonia"". ""The election that Mariano Rajoy called has shown that Catalonia is firmly divided in two blocs and there is hardly any space for intermediaries."" La Vanguardia writes: ""Major forces supporting independence should look back, confess to mistakes and avoid making them again,"" Separatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October after a referendum that was declared illegal by Spain. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots. The move led to violent clashes with hundreds of people reported injured. The man who wants to break up Spain Could Catalonia make a success of independence? According to referendum organisers, 90% of voters were in favour of independence, but fewer than half the region's electorate took part. InÃ©s Arrimadas said she would try to form a coalition However, Mr Puigdemont decided it was enough to declare independence from Spain. Mr Rajoy then sacked the Catalan government, imposed direct rule and called the 21 December election. Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. The European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result. The executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain. ""Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,"" commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency. Muslim woman seeks seat in Catalonia Catalonia region profile ""In relation to a regional election, we have no comment to make,"" he added. The Spanish government has not yet commented on the results. Analysts say the success of separatist parties means that the ball is now back in the Spanish government's court. Antonio Barroso, of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence, says the problem for Madrid remains ""and the secession movement is not going to go away"". Correspondents say it is not yet clear whether Mr Puigdemont will be renamed president, and if so, if he will return from Belgium.  As things stand, he faces arrest, should he enter Spain. Independence supporters celebrated in Barcelona Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years. Before the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under General Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75. When Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again under the 1978 constitution, and the region prospered along with the rest of the new, democratic Spain. A 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a ""nation"", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010. Recession and cuts in public spending fuelled local resentment, which coalesced in a powerful secessionist movement. Following a trial referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election and went on to win a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also banned and boycotted by unionists.

"The woman has been named in tributes as 30-year-old Jodie Willsher Tributes have been paid to a woman stabbed to death in an Aldi supermarket. Mum-of-one Jodie Willsher, 30, was attacked as she worked in the store in Skipton, North Yorkshire, at 15:30 GMT on Thursday. Customers and colleagues pinned down the attacker before police arrived. A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Friends said she was a ""bubbly, lovely"" girl who would be missed. More on this and other Yorkshire stories A former school friend of Mrs Willsher, Kelly Blagden, 30, said they were both pregnant at the same time when her friend was expecting her daughter, Megan, now four, with husband Mal. She said Mrs Willsher had worked at the shop since it opened two years ago. Mrs Blagden added: ""She's a lovely girl, she was so in love, they were just the perfect relationship, they were so in love with each other and I just can't believe it really. ""We don't even know who did it. Nobody has said who it is."" Flowers have been left outside the Aldi store in Keighley Road Mrs Willsher studied theatrical and media make-up at Craven College in Skipton in 2004/5. A statement from the college said: ""Our thoughts are with Jodie's family and friends at this tragic time."" Forensic investigations are being carried out at the supermarket An Aldi customer said she had seen Mrs Willsher earlier that day wearing a Christmas jumper at work. Flowers have been left in the supermarket car park and two friends of the woman, pushing small children in buggies, described their friend as ""a truly lovely woman and very popular"". People left tributes on a community Facebook page, saying ""she was such a happy, friendly person"". One wrote: ""Horrendous, so tragic for her family and for those who witnessed this barbaric act."" Tributes have been left at the scene by friends The store and its car park remain cordoned off by police. Two officers are guarding the entrance but there isn't much police activity to be seen through the brightly-lit supermarket windows. Trolleys full of shopping can be seen in the aisles and food at the checkouts. Christmas shoppers unaware of what happened here yesterday are still arriving. No-one is saying when the shop will reopen. Among the tributes left in the car park, one says: ""In our thoughts, from all of us at Tesco in Skipton."" Another says: ""To our dear beautiful sweet friend, we are all broken. Sorry we never got our girls' night, here's a glass to you."" Shoppers had described how they were left terrified when the attack happenedat the store in Keighley Road, with witness saying everyone ""screamed and ran up and down"". A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: ""The suspect was initially detained by brave members of staff and public, before he was arrested by officers who were quickly on scene. ""He was taken into custody on suspicion of attempted murder, but it has now turned into a murder investigation despite the efforts of medics to save the victim."" The force said the attack was not terror-related or believed to be a hate crime. The supermarket remains closed and cordoned off Shopping was seen abandoned in the supermarket In a statement released on Friday, Aldi said the store would be closed until further notice to allow police to carry out investigations. A spokesman said: ""We are working with the police following an incident at our Skipton store."" Mayor Andy Rankine said the town was in shock over the death. Mr Rankine said: ""Skipton is a small but close-knit community where most people know each other.

"Shoppers at the store spoke of ""hearing screams"" A woman who was stabbed in an Aldi supermarket, in Skipton, North Yorkshire, has died. The 30-year-old was attacked at the store in Keighley Road at about 15:30 GMT on Thursday. Shoppers were left terrified, with one witness saying everyone ""screamed and ran up and down"". The witness also said she had ""never been so scared"". A 44-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, North Yorkshire Police said. A force spokesman said: ""The suspect was initially detained by brave members of staff and public, before he was arrested by officers who were quickly on scene. ""He was taken into custody on suspicion of attempted murder, but it has now turned into a murder investigation despite the efforts of medics to save the victim."" He added that they were not in a position to identify the victim at this stage, but her family was being supported by specialist officers. The store was busy with shoppers at the time, and one said:  ""I just saw the aftermath, I was so scared I ran off. ""All the staff were racing about,"" she said, adding police vans arrived on the scene within minutes. In a statement released on Friday, Aldi said the store would be closed until further notice to allow police to carry out investigations. A spokesperson said: ""We are working with the police following an incident at our Skipton store.""

"The executive chairman of Google owner Alphabet is to step down in January, the company has announced. Eric Schmidt, who has been with the tech giant since 2001, will remain on the board as a technical adviser on science and technology issues. Mr Schmidt has played a key role in the development of Google from a small California start-up to the global business it is today. Alphabet said it expected to appoint a non-executive chairman. Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? Google creates Alphabet company In a statement Mr Schmidt said ""the time is right in Alphabet's evolution for this transition"". He added that in recent years he had spent a lot of his time on science and technology issues and philanthropy and he would expand that work. Google was founded as an internet search company in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Mr Schmidt joined the company as chief executive in 2001, becoming chairman in 2011. In 2015 Google restructured and the new parent company was called Alphabet with Mr Schmidt becoming chairman. Alphabet has more than 70,000 employees worldwide, and owns Google Search, Maps, Ads, Gmail, Android, Chrome, and YouTube. Joe Beda, chief technology officer of technology firm Heptio and a former Google employee, said: ""He helped them mature into the powerhouse business it is today without throwing away the uniqueness that was Google during those early days."" Alphabet board member John Hennessy said Mr Schmidt had been ""tremendously effective and tireless in guiding our board, particularly as we restructured from Google to Alphabet"". Google still makes up the most of Alphabet's revenue and income. However, the group also includes the so-called Other Bets unit, which includes the Waymo driverless car business and the Project Loon WiFi-enabled weather balloon venture. Mr Schmidt said the Alphabet structure was ""working well"", and ""Google and the Other Bets are thriving"". Amazon and Alphabet report sales surge Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big?

"The Friday before Christmas is one of the busiest days of the year for traffic, withdrivers being warned to expect long delays. On a normal day, the average person in this country spends an hour a day travelling, with most of their journeys made by car. These charts tell the story of Britain's roads. Back in 1952, less than 30% of distance travelled in Britain was by car, van or taxi. 42% was by bus or coach, and 17% by train. As people got richer and cars got cheaper, the picture changed rapidly. By 1970, three-quarters of all passenger kilometres were by private vehicle. The proportion reached 85% in the late 1980s and has stayed roughly constant since then - as has the total distance driven each year. Public policy encouraged driving in the post-war period, according to Richard Blyth of the Royal Town Planning Institute. New suburbs were more spread out. The first motorway, Lancashire's eight-mile Preston bypass, opened in 1958 and now forms part of the M6. Meanwhile less money was invested in public transport, especially buses, says Blyth. Travel by bus and coach has been in long-term decline, accounting for just 4% of total distance travelled in 2016, a tenth of the figure of the early 1950s. Away from the roads, rail fell to a low of 5% in the mid-1990s but has steadily increased - it's 10% now. The average amount of time each person spends travelling each day is about one hour, and surprisingly this has been fairly constant since the 1960s. But average speeds have increased, especially for rail, so people can go further in the same amount of time. This means people are commuting greater distances, especially in the crowded south-east of England. Despite people driving far more than in the post-war period, deaths on the road have declined since the mid-1960s. Fatalities rose sharply as more people got cars in the 1950s and 60s, then fell dramatically. The post-war peak was 1966, when 7,985 people died on the roads in England, Scotland and Wales. From that year all new cars had to be fitted with seatbelts - though they only became compulsory in the front seat in 1983 and the back in 1991. These legal changes were accompanied by hard hitting advertising campaigns. By 2010 the annual figure had fallen to about 1,800 and has stayed roughly there since, although there has been a small rise in some recent years. The amount of traffic has grown hugely since the war, so road safety has improved even more dramatically than the total fatalities figure suggests. This trend is replicated across the world. Prof Benjamin Heydecker of University College London says the improvements were not inevitable and have been brought about by the ""three Es"" of road safety policy: engineering, enforcement and education. Between 2006 and 2010 there was a particularly sharp drop in deaths - 40%. That's partly because traffic fell a bit during the financial crisis, as well as road engineering improvements and car safety. There's also been a rapid fall in the number of people killed in drink-driving incidents - from 490 in 2006 to 220 in 2010. There are lots of other possible factors, says Heydecker, one being that young people - who are more likely to crash - increasingly interact by the internet and smart phones, making driving less essential. Speed cameras first started being used in 1992 but became widespread across the country in the early 2000s. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents they are a ""very effective way of persuading drivers not to speed, and thereby reducing the number of people killed and seriously injured"". In 2016, about a quarter of all fatal accidents on the roads were related to speed. It was the third most common reason for fatal accidents, after drivers failing to look properly or losing control of their vehicles. Other common factors contributing to accidents include: Careless, reckless or aggressive driving Driver impaired by alcohol or drugs Fatigue Driver failing to judge other person's path or speed Research suggests an average ofmore than 400 deaths or serious injuries are prevented each year in Britain by the use of cameras,external. That's after you allow for the general decline in road accidents, and for natural variation. On average the number of crashes resulting in death and serious injury was cut by more than a third in sites where speed cameras were installed. Their effectiveness does vary though. The reduction in average speed at sites where speed cameras were installed ranges between 1% and 15%, while the reduction in the proportion of vehicles speeding ranges from 14% to 65%, again adjusting for the fact that not all decreases in injury or speed can be attributed to speed cameras. That's according toan international review published in 2010,external. Most people spend far more on driving than they do on public transport. But the amount we spend on public transport has been increasing far more quickly in recent years. While spending on motoring has increased by 9% over the past decade, spending on public transport has increased by 74%. That's partly because we're travelling far further by rail than a decade ago. It's also because fares are rising rapidly. If you look at what's happened to motoring costs over the past two decades compared with the cost of public transport, driving costs have increased at a slower rate. That's using a Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation to look at how the costs of driving and of public transport have increased relative to their 1997 levels. The average household still spends far more on driving than public transport though - Â£56.50 per week last year. Just under half this money went towards purchasing vehicles, while a slightly smaller chunk went on fuel. Most of the remaining cash went on spares, accessories, repairs and servicing. The average household spent Â£17.20 a week on public transport last year - that's rail, underground, bus, coach and air travel combined. Most of this - Â£11 per week - went on air travel, which is infrequent but expensive. The average household spends less than Â£5 a week on rail fares and season tickets. This might surprise people living in London and the South East where this method of commuting is the norm - in much of the country it is a rarity. Public money for transport is not distributed equally across the country. Whether you look at the overall amount, or how much is spent per person, investment in London far outstrips other parts of the country. This is slightly complicated by the fact that figures on spending per head are calculated based on how many people live in an area, not by how many people use the transport services. In London, it may look like more is spent per person than the reality because the large commuter population who travel in by rail from outside the capital doesn't get included in the calculation. The figures provide a snapshot of a single year so they can also be thrown off by a small number of large projects such as Crossrail or HS2. But nevertheless, public spending on transport in London and the South East is much higher than in other places. Scotland is comfortably in next place, which makes sense because it is far larger than Wales, Northern Ireland or any English region, and more sparsely populated. Most other Department for Transport statistics only cover England, Wales and Scotland. Although the vast majority of distance travelled in the UK is by road, more money is spent on rail than on national and local roads put together. If you look at how much is spent for each kilometre travelled, public spending on rail is five to six times higher than spending on national roads, according to Paul Withrington, director of campaign group Transport Watch. Maintaining the railways is by nature more expensive - there is a lot more infrastructure associated with rail and although they take up less land, they have to be much straighter and flatter than roads and so often involve expensive earthworks, bridges and tunnels. And governments over the past decade or so have ""have sought to curb private motoring in favour of rail"" in order to cut carbon emissions, according to Prof Anthony Fowkes at the University of Leeds' Institute for Transport Studies. However, these spending figures are a gross amount, meaning they don't include any money coming back to the government through ticket prices or tolls. The majority of households in England own at least one car these days, though about one in five households don't. As you'd probably expect, it's the poorest in society who are least likely to own a car. If you look at the lowest income bracket, the proportion of households which don't own a car rises to 44%. The proportion of households without a car fell dramatically from the middle of the 20th Century, but has been fairly stable for the last couple of decades. Although the overall proportion of people owning cars has remained fairly constant in recent years, this hides a significant change that has taken place among those who own cars, says Prof Heydecker. Older women are far more likely to drive these days - there was a ""societal shift"" in the 1970s after which young women were far more likely to take up driving. However, the proportion of young people overall who drive is falling - and a growing proportion of young people live in big cities, especially London, where cars are less essential. Meanwhile, the proportion of households owning two or more cars has risen considerably. In 1981, 15% of households did. By 2016, a third had at least two vehicles at home. A couple of decades ago, the vast majority of vehicles on Britain's roads ran on petrol. This began to change from the millennium. Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax for diesel cars in 2001 as they were thought to be more economical and less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. Now the total number of diesel vehicles on the roads is not far off the number running on petrol. Those powered by alternative fuels - like electric cars and hybrids - make up a tiny proportion. That's because of cost, range and ""consumer perception"", says Prof David Bailey of Aston University. However, things are changing rapidly. There has been increasing concern that diesel cars emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to contribute to thousands of premature deaths in the UK. Diesel sales have fallen considerably over the past year. Vehicles running on alternative fuels form a small proportion of new sales but the figure is rising rapidly. Why officials in Labour government pushed 'dash for diesel' UK diesel car sales fall by nearly a third in October Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? That trend is set to continue, says Prof Bailey. ""There is likely to be a tipping point in the early to mid-2020s when the electric car outperforms the internal combustion engine car and we see mass take-up."" He also thinks hybrid vehicles will become mainstream in the coming years. One big technological development could dramatically change the vehicle market in ways that are hard to predict - last month Chancellor Philip Hammond said driverless cars could be on UK roads as early as 2021. It might come as a surprise to British motorists, but petrol prices in the UK are among the cheapest in Western Europe. Diesel prices, on the other hand, are relatively higher - only Swedes and Italians pay more. Roughly the same amount is spent on the fuel itself in different European countries, says Simon Williams, the RAC's fuel spokesman. But countries that pay a lot more than the UK at the pump like the Netherlands, Italy and Greece pay significantly more in taxes, while the ""retailer margin"" also varies a lot across the continent, he says. Petrol and diesel cost roughly the same in the UK - in November theaverage was 120.2p a litre for petrol and 122.6p a litre for diesel,external, according to the AA motoring organisation. Overall, fuel prices increased sharply between 2009 and 2012, the year they reached record highs. They have fallen quite a bit since then. The price at the pump is determined by three things: global energy prices, tax, and the retailer's margin. Global energy prices are volatile and unpredictable, and account for the big fluctuations over the past decade. Taxes are set by governments. In the UK, fuel duty rose sharply in the 1990s, but at a slower rate since then. It was cut for several years from the early 2000s and has been frozen in cash terms since 2011. British roads are the most congested in Europe, a 2016 study of more than 100 cities suggests. Data company Inrix found more than 20,000 so-called ""traffic hotspots"" in UK cities, well over double the number in Germany and eleven times the number in France. Some other congested UK cities and their worst hotspots include: Glasgow: Eastbound junction of the A8 Glasgow and Edinburgh Road with the M8 Birmingham: Northbound junction of the A38 (M) with the M6 Manchester: M60 northbound at junction 1 for the A6 Stockport Bristol: M5 southbound at junction 20 for Clevedon Leeds: Westbound M62 junction 26 with M606 junction 1 Bradford: From the A650 in the city centre to the A6038 Otley Road The government says it is investing Â£23bn between 2015 and 2020 to improve the roads and reduce congestion, describing this as ""the biggest investment in a generation"", as well as giving councils extra capital funding to upgrade roads and cut congestion.

"Thousands of travellers have hit the UK's roads and railways at the start of the Christmas getaway on what was billed as ""frantic Friday"". An estimated 1.3 million Christmas drivers were expected to add to the usual end-of-week traffic. Bristol Airport cancelled flights after a plane came off the runway and several train lines reported disruption. However, road delays were less severe than predicted, with the RAC suggesting many may travel on Saturday instead. Christmas getaway: What you need to know Driving home? 10 things to know about roads Virgin rail strikes called off Many of Britain's mainline routes will be partially shut in the coming days as Network Rail carries out its biggest ever Christmas engineering programme. With Paddington station completely closed between Christmas Eve and 27 December, Great Western Railway is urging passengers to get to their Christmas destination by the end of Saturday ""at the latest"". Meanwhile, the Association of British Travel Agents said 4.5 million people were expected to travel abroad in coming days. It said airports, ports and international train stations would be exceptionally busy and advised people to begin their journeys earlier than usual. About 260 rail engineering projects will cause disruption to trains during the Christmas period. Southeastern will not run trains to London Bridge, Charing Cross and Cannon Streetbetween 23 December and 1 January,external The West Coast main line will be halted between Preston and Lancaster from Christmas Eve to 27 December with buses replacing trains Other improvements on the same line will mean a reduced service, with longer travel times, to and from London Eustonbetween 24 December to 2 January,external Thameslink services will not run through Central Londonbetween 23-29 December,external There will be no Greater Anglia trains between London Liverpool Street and Ingatestone or Billericayfrom 23 December to 1 January,external Earlier South Western Railway blamed sickness among train crew for the cancellation of some services on Friday.

ScotRail has been suffering delays and cancellations between Stranraer/Ardrossan Harbour and Kilmarnock/Glasgow Central after a train derailment in a depot. But Virgin trains as running a full timetable on the West Coast mainline after a planned strike was called off. Flights in and out of Bristol Airport were suspendedafter a plane carrying 25 people came off the runway. The runway is now not expected to reopen until 23:00 GMT at the earliest. A post on the airport's Twitter feed apologised for the disruption andthanked customers for their ""continued patience."",external"" This video can not be played Long queues at Bristol Airport after plane error shuts runway. The RAC said: ""Friday has turned out to be slightly less frantic than it first looked although things are hotting up this evening as holiday traffic is competing with commuters and commercial traffic."" It said it had attended 9,000 breakdowns - 15% higher than the seasonal norm. It warned that drivers might have altered their plans, increasing the risk of serious delays on Saturday. Earlier, the M1 was hit by three serious incidents with a vehicle fire closing three northbound lanes. The M40 southbound was closed earlier between junction 10 (Brackley) and junction nine (Bicester), after a lorry caught fire. Witnesses said the vehiclewas carrying bottles of beerwhich exploded due to the heat. However,according to Highways England,external, the disruption has now cleared. Some stretches of the M40 remain slow due to road works. Beer bottles were reported to be exploding on the M40 after the lorry carrying them caught fire A ""roadworks embargo"" is in place on English motorways and major A roads until 00:01 on 2 January in a bid to ease festive congestion. Many lanes are open and temporary speed restrictions are lifted. However, 27 sets of roadworks, covering a total of 122 miles, are staying in place because it would be too dangerous to lift them. In Wales, no roadworks are taking place over Christmas and the New Year, other than essential or emergency work. Coach operator National Express is running extra services over the festive period.

"Police on the Italian island of Sicily have arrested an ambulance worker suspected of killing people to earn money from a funeral parlour linked to the mafia. The man is alleged to have injected air into the veins of at least three terminally ill patients as they were transported back to their homes. He is said to have been paid â¬300 (Â£265) for each corpse. Italian media have dubbed it the ""ambulances of death"" scandal. Police arrested the man after a contact, said to be a reformed mafia member, gave details to authorities in the city of Catania and to an investigative TV programme. The ambulance worker is charged with voluntary homicide. It is alleged that the suspect injected air into the veins of patients - causing them to die of an embolism - as they were being transported back to the small inland town of Biancavilla. The 42-year-old man is said to have then taken advantage of grieving families by recommending a funeral agency linked to the Sicilian mafia, from which he gained a commission. Reports suggest the scheme could have been operating since 2012 and there could have been many other victims. Investigators say they have looked into dozens of deaths in Biancavilla but only 12 have so far been deemed ""meaningful"" and only three have been presented to an investigating magistrate.

"Gambling giant Ladbrokes Coral has agreed to be bought by online rival GVC in a deal worth up to Â£4bn. Under the deal, shareholders in GVC - which owns the Bwin, Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo brands - will hold 53.5% of the combined group. Ladbrokes Coral became the UK's biggest High Street bookmaker following last year's merger of Ladbrokes and Coral. The company has about 3,500 High Street outlets and employs more than 25,000 staff. GVC - which has 2,800 employees - has grown rapidly in recent years through a number of takeovers,  most notably that of Bwin.party in February last year. The final worth of the deal is dependent on the government's review of gaming machines known as fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has said it will cap the size of stakes gamblers can make on FOBTs, amid concerns they may harm vulnerable people. Bookies brace for possible sales hit Ministers have proposed that bets on the machines should be cut from a maximum of Â£100 a spin to somewhere between Â£2 and Â£50. GVC and Ladbrokes Coral have said that the review could hit the profitability of Ladbrokes Coral's UK business. Ladbrokes, Coral, Gala Casino, Gala Bingo, Eurobet, Betdaq, Sportium Bwin, Sportingbet, Betboo, Gamebookers, Partypoker, Partycasino, CasinoClub, Gioco Digitale, Foxy Bingo, Foxy Casino Under the terms of the deal, for each share that Ladbrokes Coral shareholders own, they will get 32.7p in cash and 0.141 ordinary GVC shares, plus a ""contingent value right"" worth up to 42.8p. The size of this contingent entitlement will be decided by the outcome of the DCMS review. GVC chief executive Kenneth Alexander described the takeover deal as ""a truly exciting prospect"". Ladbrokes Coral chairman John Kelly said the tie-up with GVC would ""improve the customer experience, drive faster online growth and build a more diverse and extensive international portfolio of businesses"".

Under the deal, shareholders in GVC - which owns the Bwin, Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo brands - will hold 53.5% of the combined group. Ladbrokes Coral became the UK's biggest High Street bookmaker following last year's merger of Ladbrokes and Coral. The company has about 3,500 High Street outlets and employs more than 25,000 staff. GVC - which has 2,800 employees - has grown rapidly in recent years through a number of takeovers,  most notably that of Bwin.party in February last year. The final worth of the deal is dependent on the government's review of gaming machines known as fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has said it will cap the size of stakes gamblers can make on FOBTs, amid concerns they may harm vulnerable people. Bookies brace for possible sales hit Ministers have proposed that bets on the machines should be cut from a maximum of Â£100 a spin to somewhere between Â£2 and Â£50. GVC and Ladbrokes Coral have said that the review could hit the profitability of Ladbrokes Coral's UK business. Ladbrokes, Coral, Gala Casino, Gala Bingo, Eurobet, Betdaq, Sportium Bwin, Sportingbet, Betboo, Gamebookers, Partypoker, Partycasino, CasinoClub, Gioco Digitale, Foxy Bingo, Foxy Casino Under the terms of the deal, for each share that Ladbrokes Coral shareholders own, they will get 32.7p in cash and 0.141 ordinary GVC shares, plus a ""contingent value right"" worth up to 42.8p. The size of this contingent entitlement will be decided by the outcome of the DCMS review. GVC chief executive Kenneth Alexander described the takeover deal as ""a truly exciting prospect"". Ladbrokes Coral chairman John Kelly said the tie-up with GVC would ""improve the customer experience, drive faster online growth and build a more diverse and extensive international portfolio of businesses"".

"People should pay a deposit for using plastic bottles in an attempt to protect the seas from the ""devastating effects"" of plastic pollution, MPs say. The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) also wants free public drinking water fountains. And it says firms using plastic packaging should pay more for the waste they create. The government says it is consulting with industry on a deposit scheme, and charges for single-use plastics. But the MPs say ministers need to review society's relationship with plastics as a whole. They are proposing,externala sliding scale of taxes on plastic packaging. They want suppliers of hard-to-recycle complex plastics to be charged most and firms using simple easy-to-recycle packages to pay least. The MPs are trying to tackle the rising tide of plastic waste in the ocean, which has been described by UN Oceans Chief Lisa Svensson as a ""planetary crisis"". EAC Chair Mary Creagh MP said: ""Urgent action is needed to protect our environment from the devastating effects of marine plastic pollution which, if it continues to rise at current rates, will outweigh fish by 2050."" She added that the current levy on plastics producers only raised a fraction of the cost of dealing with plastic waste. ""Packaging producers don't currently have to bear the full financial burden of recycling their packaging,"" she said. ""By reforming charges, the government can ensure that producers and retailers will have financial incentives to design packaging that is easily recyclable - or face higher compliance costs."" The committee also proposes a minimum 50% recycled plastic content in plastic bottles to stimulate the recycled plastics market. Michael Gove said he'd been moved by images of plastic pollution on the Blue Planet series The Recycling Association strongly supports rules prompting packaging firms to simplify packaging and use fewer different types of plastics. The Green Party's Amelia Womack said: ""We need to design out waste from the very start of the consumer chain.

"Melbourne city centre reopened Friday but high police presence remains Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said an attack involving a car in Melbourne was a ""shocking crime"" but an ""isolated incident"". On Thursday, a 32-year old man drove his car into pedestrians on Flinders Street, injuring 19 people. Police have said the driver had a history of mental illness and drug abuse but no known extremist links. He had ""attributed his actions to perceived mistreatment of Muslims"", said a senior officer. The man, who was arrested at the scene by an off-duty officer, is an Australian citizen of Afghan descent who arrived in Australia under a refugee programme. Investigations were continuing, said Mr Turnbull. This video can not be played The crash happened on Flinders Street at a busy crossing in the centre of the city At this stage there were ""no known links to any political issues, or any links to extremist groups"" but he added that ""nothing should be ruled out"". Acting Chief Commissioner Shane Patton earlier said the man was known to have a mental illness. He was on a treatment plan but had missed an appointment on Thursday. When interviewed by police he ""spoke about dreams, he spoke about voices"", said the chief inspector, ""but he also did attribute some of his actions to the poor treatment of Muslims"". Mr Turnbull confirmed that nine foreign nationals were among the injured. According to media reports, these include three South Korean tourists, as well as tourists from China and Italy, India, Venezuela, Ireland, and New Zealand. Several of the injured remain in critical condition, one pre-school aged child is reportedly stable. On Friday morning, streets in the city centre reopened and trams were operating as usual. Police said a second man arrested at the scene was released and expected to be charged with possession of cannabis and a controlled weapon. The charges are not linked to the car attack.

"Johanna Young's parents Robert and Carol want closure 25 years on Police investigating the murder of a teenager 25 years ago remain convinced someone in the area where she died holds the key to the case. Johanna Young was 14 when she went missing from her family home in Watton, Norfolk, on 23 December 1992. Her partially-clothed body was found covered in scratches and face down in water on Boxing Day. Investigating officer Marie James said: ""I am convinced the answer lies within the community of Watton."" ""I'm quite sure that there is someone out there, whether they used to live in Watton or have since moved on, that has information that may unlock this case,"" said Det Insp James, of Norfolk Police. A post-mortem examination revealed Johanna - whose body was found close to Griston Road in Watton - died from drowning and a fractured skull. A fresh appeal in 2014 sawtwo people arrested and bailedbut police said there was ""insufficient information to prove those individuals' involvement"". Her partially-clothed body was found covered in scratches and face down in water on Boxing Day, on 1992 Johanna had left home, where she lived with her parents Carol and Robert and siblings Daniel and Emma, at 19:30 GMT on 23 December. When she did not return home that night, her parents assumed she was with friends or her boyfriend Ryan Firman. But, she failed to turn up for her paper round on Christmas Eve and the police were called. After her body was recovered, investigations targeted local men and although three people were arrested and questioned, no charges were brought. Mr Young, 64, said they would ""finally get closure"" if the case was solved. ""You live in hope that someday something will happen,"" added Mrs Young, 61. A cryptic letter was sent to the Eastern Daily Press soon after Johanna was found dead Johanna's body was found after a dog walker came across one of her trainers in undergrowth near the body. There was no evidence of a sexual motive, police said. Soon after Johanna was found dead, a cryptic letter was sent to the Eastern Daily Press, featuring a drawing of a girl, a youth, a motorcycle, the date and naming Griston Road. It is believed a ""young man"" with a motorcycle was seen in the area on the night she went missing, police said.

"Six men were arrested at a dock near Geraldton, in Western Australia Australian police have arrested eight men over the nation's largest ever seizure of the drug methamphetamine. The haul, estimated to have a street value of A$1bn (Â£600m; $800m), was uncovered when police raided a dock in Western Australia, authorities said. Police have charged the men, each of whom faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. Crystal methamphetamine, also known as ice, has been described as the most damaging illicit drug in Australia. The 1.2-tonne (2,650lb) bust was larger thanthe previous record seizure, made in Melbourne in April. ""We are very pleased that 12 million hits of methamphetamine will be off the streets over the Christmas [and] new year period,"" said Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. Six men were arrested at a dock near the city of Geraldton, while two were arrested in Perth. All are Australians aged between 33 and 52. The drugs were intercepted about 400km (250 miles) north of Perth The arrests happened after 59 bags containing the drugs were loaded from a boat, Valkoista, into a white van on Thursday, Australian Federal Police said. In 2015,Australia's government established a national taskforceto tackle the growing use of ice. The move followed a report by the Australian Crime Commission that found ice posed the highest risk to communities of any illegal substance.

"Morgan Geyser (L) and Anissa Weier (R) were 12 at the time of the crime One of two US girls convicted of a 2014 stabbing to honour the horror character Slender Man has been sentenced to 25 years in a mental hospital. Anissa Weier, 16, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was mentally ill at the time. She and Morgan Geyser lured a classmate into a Wisconsin wooded park where Geyser stabbed her 19 times as Weier stood by. The victim survived. All three girls were 12 at the time. The victim was found crawling from woods by a cyclist near the city of Waukesha, a western suburb of Milwaukee. She had stab wounds to her arms, legs and torso. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren on Thursday sentenced Weier to the maximum punishment of 25 years in a psychiatric institution. The sentencing is retroactive to the date of the crime in May 2014, which means she will be committed until the age of 37. Weier and Geyser told investigators that they believed they had to kill their victim in ""dedication"" to Slender Man, a fictional horror website character. Before her sentencing, Weier told the judge: ""I do hold myself accountable for this and that I will do whatever I have to do to make sure I don't get any sort of delusion or whatever again. ""I want everybody involved to know I deeply regret everything that happened that day. I know that nothing I say is going to make this right and nothing I say is going to fix what I broke."" He is a skinny, shadowy figure, who has appeared in photos, drawings and articles across the internet. Some claim he has tentacles emerging from his back and most say he wears dark clothes and has a pale face. The schoolgirls involved in the attack in Waukesha say there were inspired after reading about him in acreepypasta,external, a short online story designed to shock or scare the reader. Slender Man first appeared on the internet in 2009. Eric Knudsen from Florida created the character in response to a call for submissions from the online forum SomethingAwful and posted the picture of the figure behind a crowd of people. Slender Man: Born in cyber land The origins of Slender Man Earlier this year Geyser pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in a deal with prosecutors to avoid a prison term. She is scheduled to be sentenced in February. Prosecutors have asked that she be sent to a mental hospital for at least 40 years.

"Shingles causes a nasty, painful rash and can lead to complications in older people Cases of shingles have reduced by 35% in England since a vaccine was offered to 70-year-olds, Public Health England says. But it is urging more people in their 70s to get their free injection against the painful condition. They are most at risk of shingles and more likely to develop complications, such as severe nerve pain. Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the chicken pox virus and results in a nasty skin rash and fever. The vaccine programme started in England in 2013 and 5.5m people were eligible for the free single injection over the first three years. A report in the Lancet Journal of Public Health on how much difference the jab has made between 2013 and 2016 found that roughly 17,000 GP visits for shingles had been avoided. And another 3,300 consultations were avoided for one of the main complications of shingles - post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) or long-term pain. From the data collected, PHE estimate that the vaccine is 62% effective against shingles and between 70-88% effective against PHN. Despite the reduction in shingles cases, however, the numbers taking up the offer of the vaccine have gone down slightly since 2013. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, encouraged all those eligible to make an appointment at their GP practice to get the shingles vaccine. ""It's the best way to avoid this very nasty disease and the long-term complications that can develop from having it,"" she said. ""Our population is aging and the risk from getting shingles and complications is higher as you get older. ""Immunisation is the best way to protect yourself from this painful, sometimes debilitating condition."" More than 50,000 cases of shingles occur in people aged 70 years and over each year in England and Wales - and around 50 cases are fatal. All those aged 70, or at 78 as part of a catch-up option Also, anyone who missed out up until their 80th birthday The shingles vaccine is not available on the NHS if you are aged 80 or over See if you are eligible for the shingles vaccine here,external It is a form of the chicken pox virus which has been hiding in the body and been reactivated Symptoms are a skin rash on one side of the body, sharp stabbing pain and burning of the skin, headache and fever It can last for two to four weeks and be very debilitating Shingles can sometimes lead to complications, including severe nerve pain lasting for several months or more It is not contagious, but it is possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had chickenpox before More on shingles from the NHS here,external Q&A: Shingles Shingles vaccine campaign to start 'Shingles left me with years of pain' Shingles - NHS UK Shingles vaccination - Vaccinations - NHS Choices At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Poundland has removed the image of a box of Twinings tea from a controversial social media advert after the company complained on Twitter. The campaign displayed a toy elf in a suggestive pose with a plastic doll in front of a box of Twinings Classics tea. Twinings tweeted that the picture ""misuses our product"". The picture has reappeared, but without the box of Classics Selection tea and a caption: ""Spot the difference?"" Poundland refused to comment on the change, but all the previous offending pictures had disappeared from Twitter by 17:30 GMT on Thursday. Twinings tweeted about the Poundland campaign: ""We had no involvement in this and... it is obviously not reflective of our brand values."" Poundland has been running its ""Naughty Elf"" adverts since the beginning of December. They have included tableaux of a toy elf in a hot tub with naked dolls and another of the toy elf playing strip poker. The campaign has divided opinion on Twitter, with some praising it as ""brilliant"", others damning it as ""outdated misogyny"". Many tweets speculated that Poundland's Twitter Feed had been hacked. However, Poundland confirmed the adverts were genuine. Marketing Director Mark Pym said: ""The love on Facebook has been overwhelming, and that's because it connects with our shoppers. ""We're proud of a campaign that's only cost Â£25.53 and is being touted as the winning marketing campaign this Christmas!"" A spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Authority confirmed they had had eight complaints about the advertising campaign, all on Thursday, claiming that it was offensive and unsuitable to be seen by children. He said: ""Because the complaints have only just come in we will assess them and then decide whether there is a problem, and whether the advertisements need to be investigated.""

"Pro-independence parties have retained their majority Catalan separatist parties are on track to win most seats in the new regional parliament, setting the stage for more confrontation with Spain's government. However the Citizens party, which wants Catalonia to remain a semi-autonomous part of Spain, is the biggest party. As a result, it is unclear who will be given the right to form a government. The Madrid government stripped Catalonia of its autonomy and called the election after declaring an October independence referendum illegal. With nearly all votes counted, the pro-independence parties Together for Catalonia (JxCat), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Popular Unity (CUP) were together on course to win a total of 70 seats, giving them a majority. Within the separatist party block, ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont's JxCat was slightly ahead of the ERC, led by his former deputy, Oriol Junqueras. Speaking in Brussels, where he is in self-imposed exile, Mr Puigdemont said the ""Catalan republic"" had won and ""the Spanish state has been defeated"". Mr Puigdemont's party was the biggest separatist party The situation called for ""rectification, reparation and restitution,"" he said. He is accused by Spanish prosecutors of rebellion and sedition. Mr Junqueras faces the same charges and is currently in prison. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Catalonia snap election: What you need to know Citizens (Cs) had 25% of the vote, winning 37 seats in the 135-seat chamber. Its leader InÃ©s Arrimadas told the BBC her party had been ""victorious"". She said forming a coalition would be ""difficult - but we will try"". Ms Arrimadas said she would try to form a coalition The Popular Party (PP) of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who took the decision to remove Catalonia's autonomy, was projected to win just three seats in the new Catalan parliament, down from 11 in the 2015 election. Election turnout was more than 80%, a record for a Catalan regional election. Separatists who dominated the previous Catalan parliament declared independence on 27 October, after the referendum which was declared illegal by Spain. In an attempt to stop that referendum, Spanish police stormed some polling stations. However many voters defied the Spanish courts and riot police to cast their ballots.

Prosecutors accused 13 Catalan separatist politicians of rebellion and sedition, including Mr Puigdemont and four others who fled to Belgium. Among the accused, two pro-independence politicians are in Spanish prisons, and six are being monitored while on bail. The European Commission said that its stance towards Catalonia remained the same, despite Thursday's election result. The executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain. ""Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,"" commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency. ""In relation to a regional election, we have no comment to make,"" he added. The Spanish government has not yet commented on the results. Analysts say the success of separatist parties means that the ball is now back in the Spanish government's court. Antonio Barroso, of the London-based research firm Teneo Intelligence, said the problem for Madrid remains ""and the secession movement is not going to go away"". This video can not be played A DJ explains why the Cs party is holding a music event Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions and has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years. Before the Spanish Civil War it enjoyed broad autonomy but that was suppressed under Gen Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75. When Franco died, the region was granted autonomy again under the 1978 constitution, and the region prospered along with the rest of the new, democratic Spain. A 2006 statute granted even greater powers, boosting Catalonia's financial clout and describing it as a ""nation"", but Spain's Constitutional Court reversed much of this in 2010. Recession and cuts in public spending fuelled local resentment, which coalesced in a powerful secessionist movement. Following a trial referendum in November 2014, outlawed by Spain, separatists won the 2015 regional election and went on to win a full referendum on 1 October 2017, which was also banned and boycotted by unionists.

"The executive chairman of Google owner Alphabet is to step down in January, the company has announced. Eric Schmidt, who has been with the tech giant since 2001, will remain on the board as a technical adviser on science and technology issues. Mr Schmidt has played a key role in the development of Google from a small California start-up to the global business it is today. Alphabet said it expected to appoint a non-executive chairman. Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? Google creates Alphabet company In a statement Mr Schmidt said ""the time is right in Alphabet's evolution for this transition"". He added that in recent years he had spent a lot of his time on science and technology issues and philanthropy and he would expand that work. Google was founded as an internet search company in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Mr Schmidt joined the company as chief executive in 2001, becoming chairman in 2011. In 2015 Google restructured and the new parent company was called Alphabet with Mr Schmidt becoming chairman. Alphabet has more than 70,000 employees worldwide, and owns Google Search, Maps, Ads, Gmail, Android, Chrome, and YouTube. Joe Beda, chief technology officer of technology firm Heptio and a former Google employee, said: ""He helped them mature into the powerhouse business it is today without throwing away the uniqueness that was Google during those early days."" Alphabet board member John Hennessy said Mr Schmidt had been ""tremendously effective and tireless in guiding our board, particularly as we restructured from Google to Alphabet"". Google still makes up the most of Alphabet's revenue and income. However, the group also includes the so-called Other Bets unit, which includes the Waymo driverless car business and the Project Loon WiFi-enabled weather balloon venture.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says poor UK relations with Russia a tragedy Boris Johnson says the UK's relations with Russia are ""not on a good footing"" but he wants them to improve, after talks in Moscow. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov accused the UK of making ""insulting"" statements ahead of the meeting. But he said he trusted Mr Johnson and they had agreed on the need to work together on the UN Security Council. Mr Johnson is the first UK foreign secretary to visit Russia in five years. MI5 warnings on Brexit, terror and Russia Facebook: Just three Russian Brexit ads Mr Lavrov said it was no secret that Britain's relations with Russia were at a ""low point"". And he accused Britain of making a series of ""aggressive and insulting"" public statements ahead of their meeting, saying Russia had done nothing to justify being seen as an aggressor in relation to its actions in Ukraine and Syria. ""I cannot recall any of Russia's actions that would be aggressive in relation to the United Kingdom. We did not blame London for anything,"" said Mr Lavrov. ""On the contrary, we have heard accusations, even insultingly formulated - that we support the criminal regime in Syria, that we are aggressors, that we are occupiers, we annex other territories. ""And all this despite the fact that on all the regional issues in question, and on many others, all information about what our position is, what it is based on, is regularly provided."" The pair also clashed over Russia's alleged attempts to interfere in elections in the West, following UK Prime Minister Theresa May's warnings about the risks ofRussia's ""sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption"". By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Despite the differences between London and Moscow, both sides have an interest in improving what is a poor relationship. There are several issues where both Britain and Russia sometimes disagree but want more dialogue. On Syria, the UK wants to help shape any future political settlement while Russia needs western money to help rebuild the country. On North Korea, both Russia and the UK want to find ways of de-escalating the crisis prompted by Pyongyang's ballistic missile programme. And on Iran, both sides want to do what they can to protect the deal they helped negotiate to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions. So Friday's meeting may have allowed both sides to rehearse their differences - and the veteran Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, gave as good as he got from the comparative novice foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. But it also allowed them to crack a few jokes and build a relationship that they could need in the years to come. This was not a reset or a return to business as usual but the opening of a channel of communication that in recent years has been as frozen as the Moscow winter. Ahead of the meeting in Moscow, the UK government said Mr Johnson would warn Russia to stop cyber-attacks which threaten Britain's national security or face retaliation of a similar kind from the UK. But Mr Lavrov accused Mr Johnson of being a ""hostage"" of untrue Western narratives on the issue, insisting Russia had not meddled in elections in other countries. Mr Johnson said there was ""abundant evidence"" of Russian interference in polls in the US, Germany, Denmark and France. Boris Johnson stands in front of Saint Basil's cathedral in Red square in Moscow And takes part in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Mr Lavrov hit back by telling Mr Johnson he himself had said Russia had not interfered in Britain's general election and Brexit referendum. Mr Johnson interrupted his Russian counterpart to add: ""Not successfully."" Mr Lavrov said the evidence produced so far of Russian attempts at interference amounted to no more than the spending of ""a few kopecks"" on social media adverts. ""I think you have made all this up in your Western community and unfortunately right now you are hostage to this subject, it is very difficult for you to climb down from the fence you have climbed."" He also criticised Britain for cutting off ties with Russia's FSB security agency over the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London, saying the UK authorities had refused to hand over information in the case. He said government criticism of British politicians who speak to Russian media outlets, such as the RT television channel, damaged the reputation of the UK as ""the cradle of democracy"". Mr Johnson acknowledged the ""difficulties"" in relations with Russia, adding: ""It is a regrettable state of affairs but it should not preclude co-operation."" The UK foreign secretary said they had identified common ground on issues such as North Korea, Syria and trade - and said the UK and Russian security services should co-ordinate ahead of next year's World Cup. As the mood at the press conference relaxed, Mr Lavrov said: ""I trust Boris and I trust him to an extent that I am ready to call him BorIs [Russian-style pronunciation] rather than BOris."" Mr Johnson said he adopted the approach Ronald Reagan had taken with Mikhail Gorbachev: ""Trust, but verify."" And he joked that his trust was so great that he had handed his coat with ""everything in my pockets, secret or otherwise"" to Mr Lavrov when he arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. Mr Lavrov joked back: ""I can say that there was nothing in the pockets of Boris's coat"", to which Mr Johnson responded in surprise: ""So you have searched it already?"" Mr Johnson's trip follows Prime Minister Theresa May's accusation last month that Russia was trying to ""undermine free societies"".

"Three UK supermarket chains have published figures on the amount of antibiotics used by their farm suppliers, in an effort to cut use of the medicines. Marks and Spencer,external,Waitrose,externalandAsda,externalhave all revealed the quantities of antibiotics in meat and dairy produce. Campaigners have called on all supermarkets to follow their lead. Overuse of antibiotics can cause drugs resistance leading to the prevalence of superbugs such as MRSA. England's Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies warned in October that if antibiotics lost their effectiveness it would ""spell the end to modern medicine"". The campaign group, the Alliance To Save Our Antibiotics, which was founded by charities Sustain, Compassion in World Farming and the Soil Association welcomed the move by the supermarkets, saying it was a good start. Coilin Nunan, scientific advisor to the Alliance said: ""The publication of this data should help drive average use across the farming industry down, as it illustrates the extent to which many other producers are still overusing antibiotics, despite recent cuts. ""We are also calling for all supermarkets to publish antibiotic-use data by farming system, so that consumers can compare free-range and organic farming with indoor farming and intensive systems."" Figures from all three supermarket chains show they are ahead of industry-wide targets on chicken farms. Mr Nunan said Marks and Spencer figures showed their pig and chicken farmers were using less than one quarter of the UK averages. He said antibiotic use in Waitrose's pig and chicken suppliers was about one third or less than industry averages and use in turkeys was about one sixth of the average. Asda's figures showed its suppliers' usage was less than half the industry average for chickens, and for turkey it was less than a quarter but their pig survey was still in progress, he added. Information on the different sectors is not comprehensive and varies in detail so it is not always possible to make direct comparisons. The supermarkets follow industry standards set by the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance which represents organisations involved in the food chain. The UK Veterinary Antibiotics Resistance and Sales Surveillance Report 2016, released in October, showed sales of antibiotics for use in food-producing animals dropped by 27%, achieving a government-set target two years early. Tesco,external,Sainsbury's,external,Morrisons,external,Lidl,externalandAldi,externaldo not at present publish data on antibiotic use. Lidl said: ""We are committed to meeting sector targets and fully support the disclosure of antibiotic usage, however we believe that it is important to support suppliers through the development of a centralised, industry-wide approach."" Morrisons said it was ""open-minded"" about publishing data. Tesco said it had a comprehensive plan to reduce antibiotic use, ""including measuring and publishing progress against our commitments"". The British Retail Consortium, which represents the big supermarkets, said all its members advocated the responsible use of antibiotics and were working to reduce usage without any detrimental effect on animal welfare. It's director of food policy, Andrew Opie, said: ""All our members are collaborating with their suppliers to determine what data is available and the best way to communicate progress.""

"Separatists on course to win snap election called by Spain Madrid called vote after Catalonia declared independence Some saw election as proxy referendum on secession Record turnout of above 80% Final results expected around 2300 GMT Ellis Palmer, Vanessa Barford and Patrick Jackson We are now pausing our live coverage following Thursday's election in Catalonia. A pro-Spanish unity party has won the most seats but separatist parties will together be able to form a majority in parliament. The results are a setback for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy who had imposed direct rule over the region after its illegal independence declaration. For the latest updatessee our main news story.  This video can not be played Catalan election: Party atmosphere amid political stand-off In an opinion piece, the Spanish daily El Pais says the regional elections have failed to create clarity in Catalonia's ""exhausted and fractured"" society. It says, however, that in the popular vote the separatists have failed to achieve a clear majority - the three main independence parties have about 48% of the total vote. It calls on politicians to avoid the path of social conflict, adding: ""Instead, the winners should do something as simple as that for which every politician is elected - to govern, from the institutions and within the law."" The European Commission says that its stance towards Catalonia remains the same. The executive arm of the EU has previously stated that events in Catalonia are an internal issue for Spain. ""Our position on the question of Catalonia is well known and has been regularly restated, at all levels. It will not change,"" commission spokesman 
Alexander Winterstein told AFP news agency. ""In relation to a regional election, we have no comment to make,"" he added. In an interview with the Catalan broadcaster TV3, the leader of the liberal unionist Citizens party, InÃ©s Arrimadas has said that, despite the fact that the separatist parties appear to have won a absolute majority, her party ""would wait and see who wants to form a coalition in the coming weeks"". Carles Puigdemont, the sacked president of the Spanish region of Catalonia has said that tonight's result ""shows that the Catalan people have won the right to be listened to"". Carles Puigdemont told a news conference in Brussels that the Catalan regional election was a victory for separatist parties ""which no-one can dispute"". InÃ©s Arrimadas, leader of the Citizens party in Catalonia, has made a triumphant speech in the Placa d'Espanya in Barcelona despite the unionists' overall failure to win a majority in parliament. ""For the first time, a unionist party has won an election to the Catalan parliament,"" she said after Citizens won the largest share of seats. Carles Puigdemont is continuing his speech in Brussels. He says that ""(Prime Minister) Rajoy's method has failed to stop the independence movement"". ""Despite the difficulties we have faced, the absolute majority of independence continues, he said."" Ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, speaking in Belgium, says that the ""Catalan republic has won"" Thursday's election. Alfred Bosch, an ERC leader in Barcelona, said his party wanted nothing less than independence. ""Our goal is a Catalan republic,"" he told BBC World Service's Newshour programme. ""We want to do it democratically with all the people voting and being able to participate in that and the response of the Spanish government is violence, police violence, putting people in jail for political motives, so we're not very happy at that.  Despite all this, we accepted these elections, not because we accept who called them and how they called them, but because we accept the citizens and we accept their verdict.""

Asda's figures showed its suppliers' usage was less than half the industry average for chickens, and for turkey it was less than a quarter but their pig survey was still in progress, he added. Information on the different sectors is not comprehensive and varies in detail so it is not always possible to make direct comparisons. The supermarkets follow industry standards set by the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance which represents organisations involved in the food chain. The UK Veterinary Antibiotics Resistance and Sales Surveillance Report 2016, released in October, showed sales of antibiotics for use in food-producing animals dropped by 27%, achieving a government-set target two years early. Tesco,external,Sainsbury's,external,Morrisons,external,Lidl,externalandAldi,externaldo not at present publish data on antibiotic use. Lidl said: ""We are committed to meeting sector targets and fully support the disclosure of antibiotic usage, however we believe that it is important to support suppliers through the development of a centralised, industry-wide approach."" Morrisons said it was ""open-minded"" about publishing data. Tesco said it had a comprehensive plan to reduce antibiotic use, ""including measuring and publishing progress against our commitments"". The British Retail Consortium, which represents the big supermarkets, said all its members advocated the responsible use of antibiotics and were working to reduce usage without any detrimental effect on animal welfare. It's director of food policy, Andrew Opie, said: ""All our members are collaborating with their suppliers to determine what data is available and the best way to communicate progress.""

"This video can not be played Samuel Armstrong said his life had been ""turned upside down"" by allegations A Conservative MP's chief of staff has been cleared of raping a woman after they had sex in the MP's Westminster office. Samuel Armstrong, aide to South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay, said he and the woman had consensual sex after drinking in the Houses of Parliament. He was found not guilty of two counts of rape and two of sexual assault at Southwark Crown Court. The jury returned its verdicts after five-and-a-half hours of deliberation. CCTV captured the aide, from Danbury, Essex, and the woman - a parliamentary worker - dancing in an empty Westminster Hall before they headed off with her holding his arm on the evening of 13 October 2016. Mr Armstrong said he felt like he had been ""punched in the stomach"" when he was arrested early the next morning. His barrister, Sarah Forshaw described him as ""earnest, a little geeky, awkward"" while Mr Mackinlay, who was not in Westminster that evening, told the court he and his aide were like ""father and son"". Speaking at the end of the two-week trial, Mr Armstrong said: ""My whole life has been turned upside down. ""For a year now I've not slept or eaten and I was innocent. ""Were it not for the fact that crucial evidence was disclosed to my defence team just eight working days before trial there could well have been yet another miscarriage of justice in this case."" A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""The disclosure of evidence in this case was undertaken properly and in line with our legal obligations. ""We disclosed additional material to the defence on 30 November - only a day after the police officer in charge and the CPS had first examined it."" The court was told the pair kissed as they danced to jazz music in the office, before they had consensual sex - a claim the woman denied. Mr Armstrong's barrister suggested the woman had panicked after becoming distressed as she tried to leave the Palace of Westminster at about 02:00 GMT. ""When it was over you were not upset with him at all, were you?"" Ms Forshaw asked her. She replied: ""Yes, I was completely confused and devastated in the truest sense of that word."" She admitted sending a request to Mr Armstrong to follow him on Twitter in September 2017 but said it was an accident. Mr Armstrong's defence lawyer suggested the woman became distressed as she left The woman said she had given the story to journalists 15 hours after she and Mr Armstrong had sex. She sent a message to her boyfriend: ""Keeping you in the loop. I've given it to Harry Cole who works for the Sun. It will either be in the Mail on Sunday or the Sun front page on Monday."" A later message said: ""The media already knew so this is my way of controlling it to ensure I get a sympathetic writer."" Mr Armstrong said he had lost his ""dream job"" and would ""never, ever, ever"" get his career back. He said: ""It was foolish. It was an act of enormous foolishness and as a consequence I have had the worst year of my life. ""While what I did is foolish, the point is I'm innocent of this and for whatever reason somebody is trying to make a horrible, horrible, horrible allegation."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Mackinlay told the court he was not sure whether the Mr Armstrong ""hero-worshipped"" him, but said they had a close relationship. ""Given the age difference, I became like - it was almost like father and son, I suppose."" He told jurors they would go for a beer, or out for drinks and dinner with his wife, Kati, when they were working in the MP's Kent constituency office.

"Shingles causes a nasty, painful rash and can lead to complications in older people Cases of shingles have reduced by 35% in England since a vaccine was offered to 70-year-olds, Public Health England says. But it is urging more people in their 70s to get their free injection against the painful condition. They are most at risk of shingles and more likely to develop complications, such as severe nerve pain. Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the chicken pox virus and results in a nasty skin rash and fever. The vaccine programme started in England in 2013 and 5.5m people were eligible for the free single injection over the first three years. A report in the Lancet Journal of Public Health on how much difference the jab has made between 2013 and 2016 found that roughly 17,000 GP visits for shingles had been avoided. And another 3,300 consultations were avoided for one of the main complications of shingles - post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) or long-term pain. From the data collected, PHE estimate that the vaccine is 62% effective against shingles and between 70-88% effective against PHN. Despite the reduction in shingles cases, however, the numbers taking up the offer of the vaccine have gone down slightly since 2013. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, encouraged all those eligible to make an appointment at their GP practice to get the shingles vaccine. ""It's the best way to avoid this very nasty disease and the long-term complications that can develop from having it,"" she said. ""Our population is aging and the risk from getting shingles and complications is higher as you get older. ""Immunisation is the best way to protect yourself from this painful, sometimes debilitating condition."" More than 50,000 cases of shingles occur in people aged 70 years and over each year in England and Wales - and around 50 cases are fatal. All those aged 70, or at 78 as part of a catch-up option Also, anyone who missed out up until their 80th birthday The shingles vaccine is not available on the NHS if you are aged 80 or over See if you are eligible for the shingles vaccine here,external It is a form of the chicken pox virus which has been hiding in the body and been reactivated Symptoms are a skin rash on one side of the body, sharp stabbing pain and burning of the skin, headache and fever It can last for two to four weeks and be very debilitating Shingles can sometimes lead to complications, including severe nerve pain lasting for several months or more It is not contagious, but it is possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had chickenpox before More on shingles from the NHS here,external Q&A: Shingles Shingles vaccine campaign to start 'Shingles left me with years of pain' Shingles - NHS UK Shingles vaccination - Vaccinations - NHS Choices At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Some of the accusations date back to 2010 - before Mark Garnier was a minister MP Mark Garnier has been cleared of breaking the ministerial code after a Cabinet Office investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. International trade minister Mark Garnier was also said to have used derogatory language to his secretary and asked her to buy sex toys in 2010. The investigation concluded there was ""no evidence"" to suggest he had broken the rules. Theresa May said ""a line should be drawn under the issue"". The Conservative MP said he did not intend to comment on the outcome of the inquiry. Minister investigated over sex toy errand PM vows to tackle Westminster abuse The allegations regarding his secretary, Caroline Edmondson, from before he was appointed a minister in 2016, came to light in October. Ms Edmondson, who now works for another MP,told The Mail on Sundayhe had given her money to buy two vibrators at a Soho sex shop and called her ""sugar tits."" Mr Garnier told the paper: ""I'm not going to deny it, because I'm not going to be dishonest. I'm going to have to take it on the chin."" The Cabinet Office investigation said there was ""no dispute about the facts of the incident"", but there was ""a significant difference of interpretation between the parties"", leaving a member of staff ""distressed"". A No 10 spokesman said: ""It was not his intention to cause distress, and Mr Garnier has apologised unreservedly to the individual. ""On that basis, the prime minister considers that a line should be drawn under the issue."" The announcement comes a day after Mrs Maysacked her First Secretary of State, Damian Green, for breaching the ministerial code. He was asked by the PM to quit after making ""inaccurate and misleading"" statements over what he knew about claims pornography was found on his office computer in 2008. Mr Green also apologised for making writer Kate Maltby feel uncomfortable in 2015. It made him the third cabinet minister to leave the table in recent weeks, following the resignations of Sir Michael Fallon and Priti Patel.

"Big Ben is to temporarily chime again over the festive season. The Great Bell, housed in the Palace of Westminster's Elizabeth Tower, will resume service from 9am on December 23 until 1pm on New Year's Day. Its hourly bongs werecontroversially halted in August until 2021to ensure the safety of workers carrying out repairs on the tower. Keeper of the Great Clock, Steve Jaggs, said Big Ben's return would allow it to remain a ""focal point"" of celebrations. He said that the chimes, most recently reactivated for Armistice Day in November, would continue to be rung for special occasions during its four-year restoration period. This video can not be played Watch London's New Year fireworks display in full Big Ben last fell silent in 2007 and before that, for major refurbishments between 1983 and 1985. In operation for 157 years, the clock face and surrounding tower is currently clad in scaffolding. ""This essential programme of works will safeguard it for future generations, as well as protecting and conserving the Elizabeth Tower,"" Mr Jagg added. The decision to silence the Great Bellsparked ""concern"" and criticism from MPs and Prime Minister Theresa May.
